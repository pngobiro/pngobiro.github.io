\caption{FIGURE 66-2 Hinge joint of the knee.}
\end{figure}

The ends of the articulating bones of a typical movable joint are covered with smooth hyaline cartilage. A tough, fibrous sheath called the joint capsule surrounds the articulating bones. The capsule is lined with a membrane, the synovium, which secretes the lubricating and shock-absorbing synovial fluid into the joint capsule. Therefore, the bone surfaces are not in direct contact. In some synovial joints (eg, the knee), fibrocartilage disks (eg, medial meniscus) are located between the articular cartilage surfaces. These disks provide shock absorption.

Ligaments (fibrous connective tissue bands) bind the articulating bones together. Ligaments and muscle tendons, which pass over the joint, provide joint stability. In some joints, interosseous ligaments (eg, the cruciate ligaments of the knee) are found within the capsule and add stability to the joint.

A bursa is a sac filled with synovial fluid that cushions the movement of tendons, ligaments, and bones at a point of friction. Bursae are found at the elbow, shoulder, knee, and some other joints.

\section*{STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE SKELETAL MUSCLE SYSTEM}

Muscles are attached by tendons (cords of fibrous connective tissue) or aponeuroses (broad, flat sheets of connective tissue) to bones, connective tissue, other muscles, soft tissue, or skin. The muscles of the body are composed of parallel groups of muscle cells (fasciculi) encased in fibrous tissue called fascia or epimysium. The more fasciculi contained in a muscle, the more precise the movements. Muscles vary in shape and size according to the activities for which they are responsible. Skeletal (striated) muscles are involved in body movement, posture, and heat-production functions. Muscles contract to bring the two points of attachment closer together, resulting in movement.

\section*{Skeletal Muscle Contraction}

Each muscle cell (also referred to as a muscle fiber) contains myofibrils, which in turn are composed of a series of sarcomeres, the actual contractile units of skeletal muscle. Sarcomeres contain thick myosin and thin actin filaments.

Muscle fibers contract in response to electrical stimulation delivered by an effector nerve cell at the motor end plate. When stimulated, the muscle cell depolarizes and generates an action potential in a manner similar to that described for nerve cells. These action potentials propagate along the muscle cell membrane and lead to the release of calcium ions that are stored in specialized organelles called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When there is a local increase in calcium ion concentration, the myosin and actin filaments slide across one another. Shortly after the muscle cell membrane is depolarized, it recovers its resting membrane voltage. Calcium is rapidly removed from the sarcomeres by active reaccumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When calcium concentration in the sarcomere decreases, the myosin and actin filaments cease to interact, and the sarcomere returns to its original resting length (relaxation). Actin and myosin do not interact in the absence of calcium.

Energy is consumed during muscle contraction and relaxation. The primary source of energy for the muscle cells is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is generated through cellular oxidative metabolism. At low levels of activity (ie, sedentary activity), the skeletal muscle synthesizes ATP from the oxidation of glucose to water and carbon dioxide. During periods of strenuous activity, when sufficient oxygen may not be available, glucose is metabolized primarily to lactic acid, an inefficient process compared with that of oxidative pathways. Stored muscle glycogen is used to supply glucose during periods of activity. Muscle fatigue is thought to be caused by depletion of glycogen and accumulation of lactic acid. As a result, the cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation cannot continue.

During muscle contraction, the energy released from ATP is not completely used. The excess energy is dissipated in the form of heat. During isometric contraction, almost all of the energy is released in the form of heat; during isotonic contraction, some of the energy is expended in mechanical work. In some situations, such as shivering because of cold, the need to generate heat is the primary stimulus for muscle contraction.

\section*{Types of Muscle Contractions}

The contraction of muscle fibers can result in either isotonic or isometric contraction of the muscle. In isometric contraction, the length of the muscles remains constant but the force generated by the muscles is increased; an example of this is when one pushes against an immovable wall. Isotonic contraction, on the other hand, is characterized by shortening of the muscle with no increase in tension within the muscle; an example of this is flexion of the forearm. In normal activities, many muscle movements are a combination of isometric and isotonic contraction. For example, during walking, isotonic contraction results in shortening of the leg, and isometric contraction causes the stiff leg to push against the floor.

The speed of the muscle contraction is variable. Myoglobulin is a hemoglobin-like protein pigment present in striated muscle cells that transports oxygen. Muscles containing large quantities of myoglobulin (red muscles) have been observed to contract slowly and powerfully (eg, respiratory and postural muscles). Muscles containing little myoglobulin (white muscles) contract quickly (eg, extraocular eye muscles). Most muscles contain both red and white muscle fibers.

\section*{Muscle Tone}

Relaxed muscles demonstrate a state of readiness to respond to contraction stimuli. This state of readiness, known as muscle tone (tonus), is produced by the maintenance of some of the
muscle fibers in a contracted state. Muscle spindles, which are sense organs in the muscles, monitor muscle tone. Muscle tone is minimal during sleep and is increased when the person is anxious. A muscle that is limp and without tone is described as flaccid; a muscle with greater-than-normal tone is described as spastic. In conditions characterized by lower motor neuron destruction (eg, polio), denervated muscle becomes atonic (soft and flabby) and atrophies.

\section*{Muscle Actions}

Muscles accomplish movement by contraction. Through the coordination of muscle groups, the body is able to perform a wide variety of movements (Chart 66-1). The prime mover is the muscle that causes a particular motion. The muscles assisting the prime mover are known as synergists. The muscles causing movement opposite to that of the prime mover are known as antagonists. An antagonist must relax to allow the prime mover to contract, producing motion. For example, when contraction of the biceps causes flexion of the elbow joint, the biceps is the prime mover, and the triceps is the antagonist. A person with muscle paralysis, which is a loss of movement possibly from nerve damage, may be able to retrain functioning muscles within the synergistic group to produce the needed movement. Muscles of the synergistic group then become the prime mover.

\section*{Exercise, Disuse, and Repair}

Muscles need to be exercised to maintain function and strength. When a muscle repeatedly develops maximum or close to maximum tension over a long time, as in regular exercise with weights, the cross-sectional area of the muscle increases. This enlargement, known as hypertrophy, results from an increase in the size of individual muscle fibers without an increase in the number of muscle fibers. Hypertrophy persists only if the exercise is continued. The opposite phenomenon occurs with disuse of muscle over a long period of time. Age and disuse cause loss of muscular function as fibrotic tissue replaces the contractile muscle tissue. The decrease in the size of a muscle is called atrophy. Bed rest and immobility cause loss of muscle mass and strength. When immobility is the result of a treatment mode (eg, casting, traction), the patient can decrease the effects of immobility by isometric exercise of the muscles of the immobilized part. Quadriceps setting exercises (tightening the muscles of the thigh) and gluteal setting exercises (tightening of the muscles of the buttocks) help maintain the larger muscle groups that are important in ambulation. Active and weight-resistance exercises of uninjured parts of the body maintain muscle strength. When muscles are injured, they need rest and immobilization until tissue repair occurs. The healed muscle then needs progressive exercise to resume its preinjury strength and functional ability.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Multiple changes in the musculoskeletal system occur with aging (Table 66-1). Bone mass peaks at about 35 years of age, after which there is a universal gradual loss of bone. There is a loss of height due to osteoporosis (abnormal excessive bone loss), kyphosis, thinned intervertebral disks, and flexion of the knees and hips. Numerous metabolic changes, including menopausal withdrawal of estrogen and decreased activity, contribute to osteoporosis. Women lose more bone mass than men do. Additionally, bones change in shape and have reduced strength. Fractures are com-
mon. In the elderly, collagen structures are less able to absorb energy. Ligaments become weak. The articular cartilage degenerates in weight-bearing areas and heals less readily. This contributes to the development of osteoarthritis. Joints enlarge and range of motion decreases. Muscle mass and strength are also diminished. There is an actual loss in the size and number of muscle fibers due to myofibril atrophy with fibrous tissue replacement. Increased inactivity, diminished neuron stimulation, and nutritional deficiencies contribute to loss of muscle strength. In addition, remote musculoskeletal problems for which the patient has compensated may become new problems with age-related changes. For example, people who have had polio and who have been able to function normally by using synergistic muscle groups may discover increasing incapacity because of a reduced compensatory ability. Many of the effects of aging, however, can be slowed if the body is kept healthy and active through positive lifestyle behaviors.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

The nursing assessment of the patient with musculoskeletal dysfunction includes an evaluation of the effects of the musculoskeletal problem on the patient. The nurse is concerned with assisting patients who have musculoskeletal problems to maintain their general health, accomplish their activities of daily living, and manage their treatment programs. The nurse ensures systemic homeostasis, encourages optimal nutrition, and prevents problems related to immobility. Through an individualized plan of nursing care, the nurse helps the patient achieve maximum health.

\section*{Initial Interview}

In the initial interview, the nurse obtains a general impression of the patient's health status, gathering subjective data from the patient concerning the onset of the problem and how it has been managed, as well as the patient's perceptions and expectations related to health. Concurrent health conditions (eg, diabetes, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infection, preexisting disability) and related problems, such as familial or genetic abnormalities, also need to be considered when developing the plan of care. A history of medication use and response to pain medication aids in designing medication management regimens.

The nurse notes allergies and describes them in terms of the reactions they produce in the patient. The nurse also assesses the patient's use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs to evaluate how these agents may affect patient care. Information concerning the patient's learning ability, economic status, and current occupation is needed for rehabilitation and discharge planning. Additions to the initial interview data are made as the nurse interacts with the patient. Such data assist the nurse to adjust the individualized plan of care as needed.

\section*{Assessment Data}

During the interview and physical assessment, the patient may report pain, tenderness, tightness, and abnormal sensations. The nurse assesses and documents this information.

\section*{PAIN}

Most patients with diseases and traumatic conditions or disorders of muscles, bones, and joints experience pain. Bone pain is characteristically described as a dull, deep ache that is "boring" in nature,

Flexion—bending at a joint (eg, elbow)
Extension-straightening at a joint Abduction-moving away from midline Adduction-moving toward midline
Rotation-turning around a specific axis (eg, shoulder joint) Circumduction-cone-like movement
Supination-turning upward Pronation-turning downward Inversion-turning inward Eversion-turning outward Protraction-pushing forward Retraction—pulling backward

whereas muscular pain is described as soreness or aching and is referred to as "muscle cramps." Fracture pain is sharp and piercing and is relieved by immobilization. Sharp pain may also result from bone infection with muscle spasm or pressure on a sensory nerve.

Rest relieves most musculoskeletal pain. Pain that increases with activity may indicate joint sprain or muscle strain, whereas steadily increasing pain points to the progression of an infectious process (osteomyelitis), a malignant tumor, or neurovascular complications. Radiating pain occurs in conditions in which pressure is exerted on a nerve root. Pain is variable, and its assessment and nursing management must be individualized.

Questions that the nurse can ask regarding pain include the following:

How does the patient describe the pain?
Is the pain localized?
Does the pain radiate? If so, in which direction and to which body parts?
Is there pain in any other part of the body?
How intense is the pain on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 being the worst possible pain)?
What is the character of the pain (sharp, dull, boring, shooting, throbbing, cramping)?
Is it constant? Is it increasing or decreasing in intensity?
What relieves it?
What makes it worse?
What was the patient doing before the pain occurred?
What was the manner of onset?
Is the body in proper alignment?
Is there pressure from traction, bed linens, a cast, or other appliances?
Is there tension on the skin at a pin site?

Does the patient experience increased discomfort when overly tired from lack of sleep, exciting stimuli, or too much activity?

It is important that the patient's pain and discomfort be managed successfully. Not only is pain exhausting, but, if prolonged, it can force the patient to become increasingly preoccupied and dependent (see Chapter 13).

\section*{ALTERED SENSATIONS}

Sensory disturbances are frequently associated with musculoskeletal problems. The patient may describe paresthesias, which are burning, tingling sensations or numbness. These sensations may be caused by pressure on nerves or by circulatory impairment. Soft tissue swelling or direct trauma to these structures can impair their function. The nurse assesses the neurovascular status of the involved musculoskeletal area.

Questions that the nurse can ask regarding altered sensations include the following:

Is the patient experiencing any abnormal sensations or numbness?
When did this begin? Is it getting worse?
Does the patient also have pain?
Can the patient move the affected part?
What is the color of the part distal to the affected area? Is it pale? Dusky? Cyanotic?
Does rapid capillary refill occur? (The nurse can gently squeeze a nail until it blanches, then release the pressure. The amount of time for the color under the nail to return to normal is noted. Color normally returns within 3 seconds. The return of color is evidence of capillary refill.)
Is a pulse palpable distal to the affected area?

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Musculoskeletal Disorders}

When assessing a patient with musculoskeletal complaints, nurses should not overlook the possibility of a genetic component to the patient's problems

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

An examination of the musculoskeletal system ranges from a basic assessment of functional capabilities to sophisticated physical examination maneuvers that facilitate diagnosis of specific bone, muscle, and joint disorders (Chart 66-2). The extent of assessment depends on the patient's physical complaints, health history, and physical clues that warrant further exploration. The nursing assessment is primarily a functional evaluation, focusing on the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living.

Techniques of inspection and palpation are used to evaluate the patient's posture, gait, bone integrity, joint function, and muscle strength and size. In addition, assessing the skin and neurovascular status is an important part of a complete musculoskeletal assessment. The nurse also should understand and be able to perform correct assessment techniques on patients with musculoskeletal trauma. When specific symptoms or physical findings of musculoskeletal dysfunction are apparent, the nurse carefully
documents the examination findings and shares the information with the physician, who may decide that more extensive examination and diagnostic workup are necessary.

\section*{Posture}

The normal curvature of the spine is convex through the thoracic portion and concave through the cervical and lumbar portions. Common deformities of the spine include kyphosis, an increased forward curvature of the thoracic spine; lordosis, or swayback, an exaggerated curvature of the lumbar spine; and scoliosis, a lateral curving deviation of the spine (Fig. 66-3). Kyphosis is frequently seen in elderly patients with osteoporosis and in some patients with neuromuscular diseases. Scoliosis may be congenital, idiopathic (without an identifiable cause), or the result of damage to the paraspinal muscles, as in poliomyelitis. Lordosis is frequently seen during pregnancy as the woman adjusts her posture in response to changes in her center of gravity.

During inspection of the spine, the entire back, buttocks, and legs are exposed. The examiner inspects the spinal curves and trunk symmetry from posterior and lateral views. Standing behind the patient, the examiner notes any differences in the height of the shoulders or iliac crests. The gluteal folds are normally symmetric. Shoulder and hip symmetry, as well as the line of the

\section*{Chart 66-2 • ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Peripheral Nerve Function}

Assessment of peripheral nerve function has two key elements: evaluation of sensation and evaluation of motion. The nurse may perform one or all of the following during a musculoskeletal assessment.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-006.jpg?height=2135&width=823&top_left_y=443&top_left_x=219)
vertebral column, are inspected with the patient erect and with the patient bending forward (flexion). (Scoliosis is evidenced by an abnormal lateral curve in the spine, shoulders that are not level, an asymmetric waistline, and a prominent scapula, accentuated by bending forward.) Older adults experience a loss in height due to loss of vertebral cartilage and osteoporosis-related vertebral fractures. Therefore, an adult's height should be measured periodically.

\section*{Gait}

Gait is assessed by having the patient walk away from the examiner for a short distance. The examiner observes the patient's gait for smoothness and rhythm. Any unsteadiness or irregular movements (frequently noted in elderly patients) are considered abnormal. When a limping motion is noted, it is most frequently caused by painful weight bearing. In such instances, the patient can usually pinpoint the area of discomfort, thus guiding further examination. If one extremity is shorter than another, a limp may also be observed as the patient's pelvis drops downward on the affected side with each step. Limited joint motion may affect gait. In addition, a variety of neurologic conditions are associated with abnormal gaits such as a spastic hemiparesis gait (stroke), steppage gait (lower motor neuron disease), and shuffling gait (Parkinson's disease).

\section*{Bone Integrity}

The bony skeleton is assessed for deformities and alignment. Symmetric parts of the body are compared. Abnormal bony growths due to bone tumors may be observed. Shortened extremities, amputations, and body parts that are not in anatomic alignment are noted. Fracture findings may include abnormal angulation of long bones, motion at points other than joints, and crepitus (a grating sound) at the point of abnormal motion. Movement of fracture fragments must be minimized to avoid additional injury.

\section*{Joint Function}

The articular system is evaluated by noting range of motion, deformity, stability, and nodular formation. Range of motion is evaluated both actively (the joint is moved by the muscles surrounding the joint) and passively (the joint is moved by the examiner). The examiner is familiar with the normal range of motion of major joints (see Chapter 11). Precise measurement of range of motion can be made by a goniometer (a protractor designed for evaluating joint motion). Limited range of motion may be the result of skeletal deformity, joint pathology, or contracture of the surrounding muscles, tendons, and joint capsule. In elderly patients, limitations of range of motion associated with osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) may reduce their ability to perform activities of daily living.

If joint motion is compromised or the joint is painful, the joint is examined for effusion (excessive fluid within the capsule), swelling, and increased temperature that may reflect active inflammation. An effusion is suspected if the joint is swollen and the normal bony landmarks are obscured. The most common site for joint effusion is the knee. If a small amount of fluid is present in the joint spaces beneath the patella, it may be identified by the following maneuver. The medial and lateral aspects of the extended knee are milked firmly in a downward motion. This displaces any fluid downward. As pressure is exerted against the

\begin{figure}

\caption{FIGURE 66-3 A normal spine and three abnormalities. (A) Kyphosis: an increased convexity or roundness of the spine's thoracic curve. (B) Lordosis: swayback; exaggeration of the lumbar spine curve. (C) Scoliosis: a lateral curvature of the spine.}
\end{figure}
medial or lateral side, the examiner observes the opposite side for a bulge below the patella. When larger amounts of fluid are present, the patella becomes elevated from the femur during knee extension and the ballottement test is positive (Fig. 66-4). If inflammation or fluid is suspected in a joint, physician consultation is indicated.

Joint deformity may be caused by contracture (shortening of surrounding joint structures), dislocation (complete separation of joint surfaces), subluxation (partial separation of articular surfaces), or disruption of structures surrounding the joint. Weakness or disruption of joint-supporting structures may result in a weak joint that requires an external supporting appliance (eg, brace).

Palpation of the joint while it is passively moved provides information about the integrity of the joint. Normally, the joint moves smoothly. A snap or crack may indicate that a ligament is slipping over a bony prominence. Slightly roughened surfaces, as in arthritic conditions, result in crepitus (grating, crackling sound or sensation) as the irregular joint surfaces move across one another.

The tissues surrounding joints are examined for nodule formation. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and osteoarthritis produce characteristic nodules. The subcutaneous nodules of rheumatoid arthritis are soft and occur within and along tendons that provide extensor function to the joints. The nodules of gout are hard and lie within and immediately adjacent to the joint capsule itself.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

They may rupture, exuding white uric acid crystals onto the skin surface. Osteoarthritic nodules are hard and painless and represent bony overgrowth that has resulted from destruction of the cartilaginous surface of bone within the joint capsule. They are frequently seen in older adults.

Often, the size of the joint is exaggerated by atrophy of the muscles proximal and distal to that joint. This is seen in rheumatoid arthritis of the knees, in which the quadriceps muscle may atrophy dramatically. In rheumatoid arthritis, joint involvement assumes a symmetric pattern (Fig. 66-5). (See Chapter 54 for further information about rheumatoid arthritis.)

\section*{Muscle Strength and Size}

The muscular system is assessed by noting the patient's ability to change position, muscular strength and coordination, and the size of individual muscles. Weakness of a group of muscles might indicate a variety of conditions, such as polyneuropathy, electrolyte disturbances (particularly potassium and calcium), myasthenia gravis, poliomyelitis, and muscular dystrophy. By palpating the muscle while passively moving the relaxed extremity, the nurse can determine the muscle tone. The nurse assesses muscle strength by having the patient perform certain maneuvers with and without added resistance. For example, when the biceps are tested, the patient is asked to extend the arm fully and then to flex it against resistance applied by the nurse. A simple handshake may provide an indication of grasp strength.

The nurse may elicit muscle clonus (rhythmic contractions of a muscle) in the ankle or wrist by sudden, forceful, sustained dorsiflexion of the foot or extension of the wrist. Fasciculations (involuntary twitching of muscle fiber groups) may be observed.

The nurse measures the girth of an extremity to monitor increased size due to exercise, edema, or bleeding into the muscle. Girth may decrease due to muscle atrophy. The unaffected extremity is measured and used as the reference standard. Measurements are taken at the maximum circumference of the extremity. It is important that the measurements be taken at the same location on the extremity, and with the extremity in the same position, with the muscle at rest. Distance from a specific anatomic landmark (eg, 10 cm below the medial aspect of the knee for measurement of the calf muscle) should be indicated in the patient's record so that subsequent measurements can be made at the same

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
point. For ease of serial assessment, the nurse may indicate the point of measurement by marking the skin. Variations in size greater than 1 cm are considered significant.

\section*{Skin}

In addition to assessing the musculoskeletal system, the nurse inspects the skin for edema, temperature, and color. Palpation of the skin can reveal whether any areas are warmer, suggesting increased perfusion or infection, or cooler, suggesting decreased perfusion, and whether edema is present. Cuts, bruises, skin color, and evidence of decreased circulation or infection can influence nursing management of musculoskeletal conditions.

\section*{Neurovascular Status}

It is important for the nurse to perform frequent neurovascular assessments of patients with musculoskeletal disorders (especially of those with fractures) because of the risk of tissue and nerve damage. One complication that the nurse needs to be alert for when assessing the patient is compartment syndrome, which is described in detail later in this unit. This major neurovascular problem is caused by pressure within a muscle compartment that increases to such an extent that microcirculation diminishes, leading to nerve and muscle anoxia and necrosis. Function can be permanently lost if the anoxic situation continues for longer than 6 hours. Assessment of neurovascular status (Chart 66-3) is frequently referred to as assessment of CMS (circulation, motion, and sensation).

\section*{The Patient With Musculoskeletal Injury}

Special precautions must be taken when assessing a trauma patient. If there is injury to an extremity, it is important to assess for soft tissue trauma, deformity, and neurovascular status. If the patient has a possible cervical spine injury and is wearing a cervical collar, the collar must not be removed until the absence of spinal cord injury is confirmed on x-ray. When the collar is removed, the cervical spine area is gently assessed for swelling, tenderness, and deformity. With pelvic trauma, abdominal organ injuries may occur. The patient is assessed for abdominal pain, tenderness, hematomas, and the presence or absence of femoral pulses. If blood is present at the urinary meatus, the nurse should suspect bladder and urethral injury, and the patient should not

be catheterized. Instead, such findings should be reported immediately to the primary health care provider.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

\section*{IMAGING PROCEDURES}

\section*{X-ray Studies}

X-ray studies are important in evaluating patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Bone x-rays determine bone density, texture, erosion, and changes in bone relationships. Multiple x-rays are needed for full assessment of the structure being examined. X-ray study of the cortex of the bone reveals any widening, narrowing, or signs of irregularity. Joint x-rays reveal fluid, irregularity, spur formation, narrowing, and changes in the joint structure. After being positioned for the study, the patient must remain still while the x-rays are taken.

\section*{Computed Tomography}

A computed tomography (CT) scan shows in detail a specific plane of involved bone and can reveal tumors of the soft tissue or injuries to the ligaments or tendons. It is used to identify the location and extent of fractures in areas that are difficult to evaluate (eg, acetabulum). CT studies, which may be performed with or without the use of contrast agents, last about 1 hour. The patient must remain still during the procedure.

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that uses magnetic fields, radio waves, and computers to demonstrate abnormalities (ie, tumors or narrowing of tissue pathways through bone) of soft tissues such as muscle, tendon, cartilage, nerve, and fat. Because an electromagnet is used, patients with any metal implants, clips, or pacemakers are not candidates for MRI.

1NURSING ALERT Jewelry, hair clips, hearing aids, credit cards with magnetic strips, and other metal-containing objects must be removed before the MRI is done; otherwise they can become dangerous projectile objects.

To enhance visualization of anatomic structures, contrast media may be injected intravenously. During the procedure, the patient needs to lie still for 1 to 2 hours and will hear a rhythmic knocking sound. Patients who experience claustrophobia may be unable to tolerate the confinement of closed MRI equipment without sedation. Open MRI systems are available, but they use lower-intensity magnetic fields, which reduces the quality of the imaging; repeated imaging may be required. Advantages of open MRI include increased patient comfort, reduced problems with claustrophobic patients, and reduced noise.

\section*{Arthrography}

Arthrography is useful in identifying acute or chronic tears of the joint capsule or supporting ligaments of the knee, shoulder, ankle, hip, or wrist. A radiopaque substance or air is injected into the joint cavity to outline soft tissue structures and the contour of the joint. The joint is put through its range of motion to distribute the contrast agent while a series of x-rays is obtained. If a tear is present, the contrast agent leaks out of the joint and is evident on the x-ray image.

After an arthrogram, the joint is usually rested for 12 hours, and a compression elastic bandage is applied as prescribed. In addition, the nurse provides comfort measures (mild analgesia, ice) as appropriate. The nurse should explain to the patient that it is normal to experience clicking or crackling in the joint for a day or two after the procedure, until the contrast agent or air is absorbed.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Before the patient undergoes an imaging study, the nurse should assess for conditions that may require special consideration during the study or that may be contraindications to the study (eg, pregnancy; claustrophobia; inability to tolerate required positioning due to age, debility, or disability; metal implants). It is essential that the patient remove all jewelry, hair clips, hearing aids, and other metal before having an MRI. If contrast agents will be used for CT scan, MRI, or arthrography, the nurse should carefully assess the patient for possible allergy.

\section*{Bone Densitometry}

Bone densitometry is used to estimate bone mineral density (BMD). This can be done through the use of x -rays or ultrasound. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) determines bone mineral density at the wrist, hip, or spine to estimate the extent of osteoporosis and to monitor a patient's response to treatment for osteoporosis. Bone sonometry (ultrasound) measures heel bone quantity and quality and is used to estimate BMD and the risk of fracture for people with osteoporosis. Bone density sonography is a cost-effective, readily available screening tool for diagnosing osteoporosis and predicting a person's risk for fracture.

\section*{NUCLEAR STUDIES}

\section*{Bone Scan}

A bone scan is performed to detect metastatic and primary bone tumors, osteomyelitis, certain fractures, and aseptic necrosis. A bone-seeking radioisotope is injected intravenously. The scan is performed 2 to 3 hours after the injection. At this point, distribution and concentration of the isotope in the bone are determined. The degree of nuclide uptake is related to the metabolism of the bone. An increased uptake of isotope is seen in primary skeletal disease (osteosarcoma), metastatic bone disease, inflammatory skeletal disease (osteomyelitis), and certain types of fractures.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Before the patient undergoes a bone scan, the nurse should inquire about possible allergy to the radioisotope and should assess for any condition that would contraindicate performing the procedure (eg, pregnancy). In addition, it is important to encourage the patient to drink plenty of fluids to help distribute and eliminate the isotope. Before the scan, the nurse asks the patient to empty the bladder, because a full bladder interferes with scanning of the pelvic bones.

\section*{ENDOSCOPIC STUDIES}

\section*{Arthroscopy}

Arthroscopy is a procedure that allows direct visualization of a joint to diagnose joint disorders. Treatment of tears, defects, and disease processes may be performed through the arthroscope. The procedure is carried out in the operating room under sterile conditions; injection of a local anesthetic into the joint or general
anesthesia is used. A large-bore needle is inserted, and the joint is distended with saline. The arthroscope is introduced, and joint structures, synovium, and articular surfaces are visualized. After the procedure, the puncture wound is closed with adhesive strips or sutures and covered with a sterile dressing. Complications are rare but may include infection, hemarthrosis, neurovascular compromise, thrombophlebitis, stiffness, effusion, adhesions, and delayed wound healing.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The joint is wrapped with a compression dressing to control swelling. In addition, ice may be applied to control edema and discomfort. Frequently, the joint is kept extended and elevated to reduce swelling. It is important to monitor neurovascular function. The nurse administers prescribed analgesics to control discomfort. The nurse should explain when the patient can resume activity and what weight-bearing limits to follow, as prescribed by the orthopedic surgeon. The nurse also explains to the patient and family the symptoms (eg, swelling, numbness, cool skin) to watch for in order to determine whether complications are occurring and the importance of notifying the physician of these observations. The physician's prescription for analgesic medication is also explained.

\section*{OTHER STUDIES}

\section*{Arthrocentesis}

Arthrocentesis (joint aspiration) is carried out to obtain synovial fluid for purposes of examination or to relieve pain due to effusion. Examination of synovial fluid is helpful in the diagnosis of septic arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies and reveals the presence of hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint cavity), which suggests trauma or a bleeding disorder. Normally, synovial fluid is clear, pale, straw-colored, and scanty in volume. Using aseptic technique, the physician inserts a needle into the joint and aspirates fluid. Anti-inflammatory medications may be injected into the joint. A sterile dressing is applied after aspiration. There is a risk for infection after this procedure.

\section*{Electromyography}

Electromyography (EMG) provides information about the electrical potential of the muscles and the nerves leading to them. The test is done to evaluate muscle weakness, pain, and disability. The purpose of the procedure is to determine any abnormality of function and to differentiate muscle and nerve problems. Needle electrodes are inserted into selected muscles, and responses to electrical stimuli are recorded on an oscilloscope. Warm compresses may relieve residual discomfort after the study.

\section*{Biopsy}

Biopsy may be performed to determine the structure and composition of bone marrow, bone, muscle, or synovium to help diagnose specific diseases. The nurse monitors the biopsy site for edema, bleeding, pain, and infection. Ice is applied as prescribed to control bleeding and edema. In addition, analgesics are administered as prescribed for comfort.

\section*{LABORATORY STUDIES}

Examination of the patient's blood and urine can provide information about a primary musculoskeletal problem (eg, Paget's disease), a developing complication (eg, infection), the baseline
for instituting therapy (eg, anticoagulant therapy), or the response to therapy. The complete blood count includes the hemoglobin level (which is frequently lower after bleeding associated with trauma and surgery) and the white blood cell count (which is elevated in acute infections, trauma, acute hemorrhage, and tissue necrosis). Before surgery, coagulation studies are performed to detect bleeding tendencies (because bone is very vascular tissue).

Blood chemistry studies provide data about a wide variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Serum calcium levels are altered in patients with osteomalacia, parathyroid function, Paget's disease, metastatic bone tumors, or prolonged immobilization. Serum phosphorus levels are inversely related to calcium levels and are diminished in osteomalacia associated with malabsorption syndrome. Acid phosphatase is elevated in Paget's disease and metastatic cancer. Alkaline phosphatase is elevated during early fracture healing and in diseases with increased osteoblastic activity (eg, metastatic bone tumors). Bone metabolism may be evaluated through thyroid studies and determination of calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D levels. Serum enzyme levels of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase become elevated with muscle damage. Aldolase is elevated in muscle diseases (eg, muscular dystrophy, skeletal muscle necrosis). Serum osteocalcin (bone GLA protein) indicates the rate of bone turnover. Urine calcium levels increase with bone destruction (eg, parathyroid dysfunction, metastatic bone tumors, multiple myeloma).

Specific serum biochemical markers can be used to provide information about bone formation; these include bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin from osteoblasts, and procollagen 1 carboxyterminal propeptide and procollagen 1 aminoterminal propeptide from the bone matrix. Specific serum biochemical markers that provide information about bone resorption include tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and bone sialoprotein from osteoclasts, and aminoterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and carboxyterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen from bone matrix. Biochemical markers of bone resorption in the urine include pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline crosslinks, aminoterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen, and hydroxyproline from collagen degradation from bone matrix (Koopman, 2001; Woitge \& Seibel, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Determining the patient's functional status and health care needs is an integral part of the nursing assessment. Nursing diagnoses and the care plan are developed and modified according to the patient's needs.

During the period of assessment, the patient requires support and nursing care, including physical and psychological preparation for examinations and tests. Patient education before the tests (what is to be done; why it is being done; what the patient can expect to experience, including tactile, visual, and auditory sensations; and what patient participation is expected) reduces anxiety and enables the patient to be an active participant in care.

The resulting medical diagnosis and prescribed treatment regimen affect the nursing management of the patient. The nursing plan of care includes nursing measures to facilitate the resolution of the patient's health problems and promotion of health. The nursing assessment enables the nurse to identify the health problems that can be improved by nursing interventions. In collaboration with the patient, health goals and nursing strategies are formulated to resolve the identified nursing diagnoses.

1. A young adult patient who experienced multiple fractures of the left tibia is to be confined to non-weight-bearing activity for about 3 months. During a clinic visit 3 weeks after the fracture occurred, he tells the nurse that his left leg is "withering away" and he is afraid that he will have no strength in this leg when he is finally permitted to walk on it. Discuss the nursing interventions to help this patient. What additional assessments and explanations could the nurse make to help this patient deal with the effects of immobility?
2. You are teaching a class on age-associated body changes at a senior center. Your focus is on the musculoskeletal system. The participants have experienced many of the changes you identify and ask you what they can do about them. What strategies to minimize these changes and maximize musculoskeletal health would you discuss with the participants?
3. An older patient with low back pain is scheduled for a bone scan. She tells the nurse that she just had a bone density study for osteoporosis a month ago and does not understand why the doctor wants her to have another one so soon. What additional assessment should the nurse perform? Discuss the differences in the two procedures.

\section*{Musculoskeletal Care Modalities}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the preventive and health teaching needs of the patient with a cast.
2. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with a cast.
3. Describe the various types of traction and the principles of effective traction.
4. Identify the preventive nursing care needs of the patient in traction.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient in traction.
6. Compare the nursing needs of the patient undergoing total hip replacement with those of the patient undergoing total knee replacement.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient undergoing orthopedic surgery.
$T_{h c}$ agement of musculoskeletal problems frequently includes the use of casts, traction, artificial joint replacement, and/or surgery. Patient education is essential for optimal outcomes. The nurse prepares the patient for immobilization with casts or traction, for surgery, and for joint replacement when indicated. Nursing care is planned to maximize the effectiveness of these treatment modalities and to prevent potential complications associated with each of the interventions. The patient is taught to manage his or her care at home and how to safely resume activities.

\section*{Managing Care of the Patient in a Cast}

A cast is a rigid external immobilizing device that is molded to the contours of the body. The purposes of a cast are to immobilize a body part in a specific position and to apply uniform pressure on encased soft tissue.

A cast is used specifically to immobilize a reduced fracture, to correct a deformity, to apply uniform pressure to underlying soft tissue, or to support and stabilize weakened joints. Generally, casts permit mobilization of the patient while restricting movement of a body part.

The condition being treated influences the type and thickness of the cast applied. Generally speaking, the joints proximal and distal to the area to be immobilized are included in the cast. With some fractures, however, cast construction and molding may allow movement of a joint while immobilizing a fracture (eg, three-point fixation in a patellar tendon weight-bearing cast). Various types of casts include the following:

Short arm cast: Extends from below the elbow to the palmar crease, secured around the base of the thumb. If the thumb is included, it is known as a thumb spica or gauntlet cast.
Long arm cast: Extends from the upper level of the axillary fold to the proximal palmar crease. The elbow usually is immobilized at a right angle.
Short leg cast: Extends from below the knee to the base of the toes. The foot is flexed at a right angle in a neutral position.
Long leg cast: Extends from the junction of the upper and middle third of the thigh to the base of the toes. The knee may be slightly flexed.
Walking cast: A short or long leg cast reinforced for strength. Body cast: Encircles the trunk.

Shoulder spica cast: A body jacket that encloses the trunk and the shoulder and elbow.
Hip spica cast: Encloses the trunk and a lower extremity. A double hip spica cast includes both legs.

Figure 67-1 illustrates the long-arm and long-leg cast and areas in which pressure problems commonly occur with these casts.

\section*{CASTING MATERIALS}

\section*{Nonplaster}

Generally referred to as fiberglass casts, these water-activated polyurethane materials have the versatility of plaster (see later discussion) but are lighter in weight, stronger, water resistant, and durable. They consist of an open-weave, nonabsorbent fabric impregnated with cool water-activated hardeners that bond and reach full rigid strength in minutes.

Nonplaster casts are porous and therefore diminish skin problems. They do not soften when wet, which allows for hydrotherapy (use of water for treatment) when appropriate. When wet, they are dried with a hair drier on a cool setting; thorough drying is important to prevent skin breakdown. They are used for nondisplaced fractures with minimal swelling and for long-term wear.

\section*{Plaster}

The traditional cast is made of plaster. Rolls of plaster bandage are wet in cool water and applied smoothly to the body. A crystallizing reaction occurs, and heat is given off (an exothermic reaction). The heat given off during this reaction can be uncomfortable, and the nurse should inform the patient about the sensation of increasing warmth so that the patient does not become alarmed. Additionally, the nurse should explain that the cast needs to be exposed to allow maximum dissipation of the heat and that most casts cool after about 15 minutes.

The crystallization process produces a rigid dressing. The speed of the reaction varies from a few minutes to 15 to 20 minutes. The orthopedist determines the plaster setting speed appropriate for the cast being applied. After the plaster sets, the cast remains wet and somewhat soft. It does not have its full strength

until it is dry. While damp, the cast can be dented. Therefore, it must be handled with the palms of the hand and not allowed to rest on hard surfaces or sharp edges. Cast dents may press on the skin causing irritation and skin breakdown. The plaster cast requires 24 to 72 hours to dry completely, depending on its thickness and the environmental drying conditions. A freshly applied cast should be exposed to circulating air to dry and should not be covered with clothing or bed linens. A wet plaster cast appears dull and gray, sounds dull on percussion, feels damp, and smells musty. A dry plaster cast is white and shiny, resonant, odorless, and firm.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT IN A CAST}

\section*{Assessment}

Before the cast is applied, the nurse completes an assessment of the patient's general health, presenting signs and symptoms, emotional status, understanding of the need for the cast, and condition of the body part to be immobilized in the cast. Physical assessment of the part to be immobilized must include assessment of the neurovascular status (neurologic and circulatory functioning) of the body part, degree and location of swelling, bruising, and skin abrasions.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient with a cast may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge related to the treatment regimen
- Acute pain related to the musculoskeletal disorder
- Impaired physical mobility related to the cast
- Self-care deficit: bathing/hygiene, feeding, dressing/grooming, or toileting due to restricted mobility
- Impaired skin integrity related to lacerations and abrasions
- Risk for peripheral neurovascular dysfunction related to physiologic responses to injury and compression effect of cast

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Compartment syndrome
- Pressure ulcer
- Disuse syndrome

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient with a cast include knowledge of the treatment regimen, relief of pain, improved physical mobility, achievement of maximum level of self-care, healing of lacerations and abrasions, maintenance of adequate neurovascular function, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{EXPLAINING THE TREATMENT REGIMEN}

Before the cast is applied, the patient needs information concerning the pathologic problem and the purpose and expectations of the prescribed treatment regimen. This knowledge promotes the patient's active participation in and adherence to the treatment program. It is important to prepare the patient for the application of the cast by describing the anticipated sights, sounds, and sensations (eg, heat from the hardening reaction of the plaster). The patient needs to know what to expect during application and that the body part will be immobilized after casting (Chart 67-1).

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The nurse must carefully evaluate pain associated with musculoskeletal problems, asking the patient to indicate the exact site and to describe the character and intensity of the pain to help determine its cause. Most pain can be relieved by elevating the involved part, applying cold as prescribed, and administering usual dosages of analgesics.

When applying a cast, the physician or nurse practitioner proceeds as follows:

\section*{PROCEDURE}
1. Support extremity or body part to be casted.
2. Position and maintain part to be casted in position indicated by physician during casting procedure.
3. Drape patient.
4. Wash and dry part to be casted.
5. Place knitted material* (eg, stockinette) over part to be casted.
- Apply in smooth and nonconstrictive manner.
- Allow additional material.
6. Wrap soft, nonwoven roll padding* smoothly and evenly around part.
- Use additional padding around bony prominences to protect superficial nerves (eg, head of fibula, olecranon process).
7. Apply plaster or nonplaster casting material evenly on body part.
- Choose appropriate width bandage.
- Overlap preceding turn by half the width of the bandage.
- Use continuous motion, maintaining constant contact with body part.
- Use additional casting material (splints) at joints and at points of anticipated cast stress.
8. "Finish" cast:
- Smooth edges.
- Trim and reshape with cast knife or cutter.
9. Remove particles of casting materials from skin.
10. Support cast during hardening.
- Handle hardening casts with palms of hands.
- Support cast on firm smooth surface.
- Do not rest cast on hard surfaces or on sharp edges.
- Avoid pressure on cast.
11. Promote drying of cast.
- Leave cast uncovered and exposed to air.
- Turn patient every 2 hours supporting major joints.
- Fans may be used to increase air flow and speed drying.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. Minimizes movement; maintains reduction and alignment; increases comfort.
2. Facilitates casting; reduces incidence of complications (eg, malunion, nonunion, contracture).
3. Avoids undue exposure; protects other body parts from contact with casting materials.
4. Reduces incidence of skin breakdown.
5. Protects skin from casting materials. Protects skin from pressure.
Folds over edges of cast when finishing application; creates smooth, padded edge; protects skin from abrasion.
6. Protects skin from pressure of cast.

Protects skin at bony prominences.
Protects superficial nerves.
7. Creates smooth, solid, well-contoured cast.

Facilitates smooth application.
Creates smooth, solid, immobilizing cast.
Shapes cast properly for adequate support.
Strengthens cast.
8. Protects skin from abrasion.

Assures full range of motion of adjacent joints.
9. Prevents particles from loosening and sliding underneath cast.
10. Casting materials harden in minutes. Maximum hardness of nonplaster cast occurs in minutes. Maximum hardness of plaster cast occurs with drying ( 24 to 72 hours, depending on environment and thickness of cast).
Avoids denting of cast and development of pressure areas.
11. Facilitates drying.
*Nonabsorbent materials are used with nonplaster casts.

NURSING ALERT A patient's unrelieved pain must be immediately reported to the physician to avoid possible paralysis and necrosis.

Pain associated with the disease process (eg, fracture) is frequently controlled by immobilization. Pain due to edema that is associated with trauma, surgery, or bleeding into the tissues can frequently be controlled by elevation and, if prescribed, intermittent application of cold. Ice bags (one-third to one-half full) or cold application devices are placed on each side of the cast, if prescribed, making sure not to indent the cast.

Pain may be indicative of complications. Pain associated with compartment syndrome is relentless and is not controlled by modalities such as elevation, application of cold if prescribed, and usual dosages of analgesics. Severe pain over a bony prominence warns of an impending pressure ulcer. Pain decreases when ulceration occurs. Discomfort due to pressure on the skin may be relieved by elevation that controls edema or by positioning that alters pressure. It may be necessary, however, to modify the cast or to apply a new cast.

NURSING ALERT The nurse must never ignore complaints of pain from the patient in a cast because of the possibility of potential problems, such as impaired tissue perfusion or pressure ulcer formation.

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

Every joint that is not immobilized should be exercised and moved through its range of motion to maintain function. If the patient has a leg cast, the nurse encourages toe exercises. If the patient has an arm cast, the nurse encourages finger exercises.

\section*{PROMOTING HEALING OF SKIN ABRASIONS}

Before the cast is applied, it is important to treat skin lacerations and abrasions to promote healing. The nurse thoroughly cleans the skin and treats it as prescribed. Sterile dressings are used to cover the injured skin. If the skin wounds are extensive, an alternative method (eg, external fixator) may be chosen to immobilize the body part. While the cast is on, the nurse observes the patient for systemic signs of infection, odors from the cast, and purulent drainage staining the cast. It is important to notify the physician if any of these occurs.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NEUROVASCULAR FUNCTION}

Swelling and edema are natural responses of the tissue to trauma and surgery. The patient may complain that the cast is too tight. Vascular insufficiency and nerve compression due to unrelieved swelling can result in compartment syndrome (see Chap. 69, Management of Patients With Musculoskeletal Trauma). The nurse monitors circulation, motion, and sensation of the affected extremity, assessing the fingers or toes of the casted extremity and comparing them with those of the opposite extremity. Normal findings include minimal swelling, minimal discomfort, pink color, warm to touch, rapid capillary refill response, normal sensations, and ability to exercise fingers or toes. The nurse encourages the patient to move fingers or toes hourly when awake to stimulate circulation.

It is important to perform frequent, regular assessments of neurovascular status. Early recognition of diminished circulation and nerve function is essential to prevent loss of function. Assessment data including progressive unrelieved pain, pain on passive stretch, paresthesia, motor loss, sensory loss, coolness, paleness, slow capillary refill, and sensation of tightness indicate potential compartment syndrome. The nurse adjusts the extremity so that it is no higher than heart level to enhance arterial perfusion and control edema and notifies the physician at once.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Compartment Syndrome}

Compartment syndrome occurs when there is increased tissue pressure within a limited space (eg, cast, muscle compartment) that compromises the circulation and the function of the tissue within the confined area. To relieve the pressure, the cast must be bivalved (cut in half longitudinally) while maintaining alignment, and the extremity must be elevated no higher than heart level (Chart 67-2). If pressure is not relieved and circulation is not restored, a fasciotomy may be necessary to relieve the pressure within the muscle compartment. The nurse closely monitors the patient's response to conservative and surgical management of compartment syndrome. The nurse records neurovascular responses and promptly reports changes to the physician.

\section*{Pressure Ulcers}

Pressure of the cast on soft tissues may cause tissue anoxia and pressure ulcers. Lower extremity sites most susceptible to pressure
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-016.jpg?height=161&width=680&top_left_y=1915&top_left_x=202)

When cutting a cast in half (bivalving), the physician or nurse practitioner proceeds as follows:
1. With a cast cutter, a longitudinal cut is made to divide the cast in half.
2. The underpadding is cut with scissors.
3. The cast is spread apart with cast spreaders to relieve pressure and to inspect and treat the skin without interrupting the reduction and alignment of the bone.
4. After the pressure is relieved, the anterior and posterior parts of the cast are secured together with an elastic compression bandage to maintain immobilization.
5. To control swelling and promote circulation, the extremity is elevated (but no higher than heart level, to minimize the effect of gravity on perfusion of the tissues).
are the heel, malleoli, dorsum of the foot, head of the fibula, and anterior surface of the patella. The main pressure sites on the upper extremity are located at the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the ulnar styloid (see Fig. 67-1).

Usually, the patient with a pressure ulcer reports pain and tightness in the area. A warm area on the cast suggests underlying tissue erythema. The area may break down. The drainage may stain the cast and emit an odor. Even if discomfort does not occur with tissue breakdown and necrosis, there may still be extensive loss of tissue. The nurse must monitor the patient with a cast for pressure ulcer development and report findings to the physician.

To inspect the pressure area, the physician may bivalve the cast or cut an opening (window) in the cast. If the physician elects to create a window to inspect the pressure site, a portion of the cast is cut out. The affected area is inspected and possibly treated. The portion of the cast is replaced and held in place by an elastic compression dressing or tape. This prevents the underlying tissue from swelling through the window and creating pressure areas around its margins.

\section*{Disuse Syndrome}

While in a cast, the patient needs to learn to tense or contract muscles (eg, isometric muscle contraction) without moving the part. This helps to reduce muscle atrophy and maintain muscle strength. The nurse teaches the patient with a leg cast to "push down" the knee and teaches the patient in an arm cast to "make a fist." Muscle-setting exercises (eg, quadriceps-setting and glutealsetting exercises) are important in maintaining muscles essential for walking (Chart 67-3). Isometric exercises should be performed hourly while the patient is awake.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching the Patient Self-Care}

Self-care deficits occur when a portion of the body is immobilized. The nurse encourages the patient to participate actively in personal care and to use assistive devices safely. The nurse must assist the patient in identifying areas of self-care deficit and in developing strategies to achieve independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) (Chart 67-4). The patient's participation in

\section*{Chelpt 6/-3}

\section*{Muscle-Setting Exercises}

Isometric contractions of the muscle maintain muscle mass and strength and prevent atrophy.

\section*{Quadriceps-Setting Exercise}
- Position patient supine with leg extended.
- Instruct patient to push knee back onto the mattress by contracting the anterior thigh muscles.
- Encourage patient to hold the position for 5 to 10 seconds.
- Let patient relax.
- Have the patient repeat the exercise 10 times each hour when awake.

\section*{Gluteal-Setting Exercise}
- Position the patient supine with legs extended, if possible.
- Instruct the patient to contract the muscles of the buttocks.
- Encourage the patient to hold the contraction for 5 to 10 seconds.
- Let the patient relax.
- Have the patient repeat the exercise 10 times each hour when awake.

planning and accomplishing ADLs is an important aspect of selfcare, independence, maintaining control, and avoiding untoward psychological reactions, such as depression.

When the cast is dry, the nurse instructs the patient as follows:
- Move about as normally as possible, but avoid excessive use of the injured extremity and avoid walking on wet, slippery floors or sidewalks.
- Perform prescribed exercises regularly, as scheduled.
- Elevate the casted extremity to heart level frequently to prevent swelling.
- Do not attempt to scratch the skin under the cast. This may cause a break in the skin and result in the formation of a skin ulcer. Cool air from a hair dryer may alleviate an itch.
- Cushion rough edges of the cast with tape.
- Keep the cast dry but do not cover it with plastic or rubber, because this causes condensation, which dampens the cast and skin. Moisture softens a plaster cast. (A wet fiberglass cast must be dried thoroughly with a hair dryer on a cool setting to avoid skin problems.)
- Report any of the following to the physician: persistent pain, swelling that does not respond to elevation, changes in sensation, decreased ability to move exposed fingers or toes, and changes in skin color and temperature.
- Note odors around the cast, stained areas, warm spots, and pressure areas. Report them to the physician.
- Report a broken cast to the physician; do not attempt to fix it yourself.
The nurse prepares the patient for cast removal or cast changes by explaining what to expect (Chart 67-5). The cast is cut with a cast cutter, which vibrates. The patient can feel the vibration and pressure during its use. The cutter does not penetrate deeply enough to hurt the patient's skin. The cast padding is cut with scissors.

The casted body part is weak from disuse, is stiff, and may appear atrophied. There may be extreme stiffness even after only a few weeks of immobilization. Therefore, support is needed when the cast is removed. The skin, which is usually dry and scaly from accumulated dead skin, is vulnerable to injury from scratching.

The skin needs to be washed gently and lubricated with an emollient lotion.

The nurse and physical therapist teach the patient to resume activities gradually within the prescribed therapeutic regimen. Exercises that are prescribed to help the patient regain joint motion are explained and demonstrated. Because the muscles are weak from disuse, the body part that has been casted cannot withstand normal stresses immediately. In addition, the nurse teaches the patient who has noticeable swelling of the affected extremity after the cast is removed to continue to elevate the extremity to control swelling until normal muscle tone and use are reestablished.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Removing a Cast}

When removing a cast, the physician or nurse practitioner proceeds as follows:

\section*{PROCEDURE}
1. Inform the patient about the procedure.
2. Reassure patient that the electric saw or cast cutter will not cut skin.
3. Wear eye protection (patient and operator of the cast cutter).
4. Bivalve cast using a series of alternating pressures and linear movements of blade along the line to be cut.
5. Cut padding with scissors.
6. Support body part as it is removed from the cast.
7. Gently wash and dry area that has been immobilized.* Apply emollient lotion.
8. Teach patient to avoid rubbing and scratching skin.
9. Collaborates with physical therapist to teach patient to resume active use of body part gradually within the guidelines of prescribed therapeutic regimen.
10. Teach patient to control swelling by elevating the extremity or using elastic bandage if prescribed.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. Facilitates cooperation and reduces fear about the procedure.
2. Reduces anxiety. (Explains that blade oscillates to cut cast and vibrations will be felt.)
3. Protects eyes from flying cast particles.
4. Cuts cast in halves. Avoids burning sensation from prolonged contact of oscillating blade with padding.

c. Adheres to prescribed exercise regimen.

\section*{Specific Cast Management Considerations}

\section*{ARM CASTS}

The patient whose arm is immobilized in a cast must readjust to many routine tasks. The unaffected arm must assume all the upper extremity activities. The nurse, in consultation with an occupational therapist, suggests devices designed to aid onehanded activities. The patient may experience fatigue due to modified activities and the weight of the cast. Frequent rest periods are necessary.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

To control swelling, the nurse elevates the immobilized arm. When the patient is lying down, the arm is elevated so that each joint is positioned higher than the preceding proximal joint (eg, elbow higher than the shoulder, hand higher than the elbow).

A sling may be used when the patient ambulates. To prevent pressure on the cervical spinal nerves, the sling should distribute the supported weight over a large area and not on the back of the neck. The nurse encourages the patient to remove the arm from the sling and elevate it frequently.

Circulatory disturbances in the hand may become apparent with signs of cyanosis, swelling, and an inability to move the fingers. One serious effect of impaired circulation in the arm is Volkmann's contracture, a form of compartment syndrome. Contracture of the fingers and wrist occurs as the result of obstructed arterial blood flow to the forearm and hand. The patient is unable to extend the fingers, describes abnormal sensation (eg, unrelenting pain, pain on passive stretch), and exhibits signs of diminished circulation to the hand. Permanent damage develops within a few hours if action is not taken.

This serious complication can be prevented with nursing surveillance and proper care. The nurse makes frequent neurovascular checks (see Chap. 66). Compartment syndrome is managed in part by bivalving (cutting) the cast to release constricting cast and dressings. A fasciotomy may be necessary to improve vascular status.

\section*{LEG CASTS}

The application of a leg cast imposes a degree of immobility on the patient. The cast may be a short leg cast, extending to the knee, or a long leg cast, extending to the groin. The fresh cast must be handled in a manner that will not cause denting or disruption of the cast.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The nurse supports the patient's leg on pillows to heart level to control swelling and applies ice packs as prescribed over the fracture site for 1 or 2 days. The patient is taught to elevate the casted leg when seated. The patient should also assume a recumbent position several times a day with the casted leg elevated to promote venous return and control swelling.

The nurse assesses circulation by observing the color, temperature, and capillary refill of the exposed toes. Nerve function is
assessed by observing the patient's ability to move the toes and by asking about the sensations in the foot. Numbness, tingling, and burning may be caused by peroneal nerve injury from pressure at the head of the fibula.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-019.jpg?height=189&width=875&top_left_y=387&top_left_x=100)

When the cast is hard and dry, the nurse teaches the patient how to transfer and ambulate safely with assistive devices (eg, crutches, walker). The gait to be used depends on whether the patient is permitted to bear weight. If weight bearing is allowed, the cast is reinforced to withstand the body weight. A cast boot, worn over the casted foot, provides a broad, nonskid walking surface.

\section*{BODY OR SPICA CASTS}

Casts that encase the trunk (body cast) and portions of one or two extremities (spica cast) require special nursing strategies. Body casts are used to immobilize the spine. Hip spicas are used for some femoral fractures and after some hip joint surgeries, and shoulder spica casts are used for some humeral neck fractures.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Nursing responsibilities include preparing and positioning the patient, assisting with skin care and hygiene, and monitoring for cast syndrome. Explaining the procedure helps reduce the patient's apprehension about being encased in a large cast. The nurse reassures the patient that several people will provide care during the application, that support for the injured area will be adequate, and that care providers will be as gentle as possible. Medications for pain relief and relaxation administered before the procedure enable the patient to cooperate during application of the cast.

Cracking or denting of the cast is prevented by supporting the patient on a firm mattress and with flexible, waterproof pillows until the cast dries. The nurse positions the pillows next to each other, because spaces between pillows allow the damp cast to sag, become weak, and possibly break. A pillow is not placed under the head and shoulders of a patient in a body cast while the cast is drying, because doing so causes pressure on the chest.

The nurse turns the patient as a unit toward the uninjured side every 2 hours to relieve pressure and to allow the cast to dry. It is important to avoid twisting the patient's body within the cast. Sufficient personnel (at least three people) are needed when the patient is turned so that the fresh cast can be adequately supported with the palms of the hands at vulnerable points (ie, body joints) to prevent cracking. The nurse encourages the patient to assist in the repositioning, if not contraindicated, by use of the trapeze or bed rail. A stabilizing abduction bar incorporated into a spica cast should not be used as a turning device. The nurse adjusts the pillows to provide support without creating areas of pressure.

The nurse turns the patient to a prone position, twice daily if tolerated, to provide postural drainage of the bronchial tree and to relieve pressure on the back. A small pillow under the abdomen enhances comfort. The nurse can either place a pillow lengthwise under the dorsa of the feet or allow the toes to hang over the edge of the bed to prevent the toes from being forced into the mattress.

The nurse inspects the skin around the edges of the cast frequently for signs of irritation. The nurse can inspect some of the skin under the cast by pulling the skin taut and using a flashlight.

The skin can be bathed and massaged by reaching under the cast edges with the fingers.

The perineal opening must be large enough for hygienic care. To protect the cast from soiling, the nurse can insert clean dry plastic sheeting under the cast and over the cast edge before elimination by the patient. Usually, fracture bedpans are easier for patients with a hip spica cast to use than regular bedpans.

Patients immobilized in large casts may develop cast syndrome -psychological and physiologic responses to the confinement. The psychological component is similar to a claustrophobic reaction. The patient exhibits an acute anxiety reaction characterized by behavioral changes and autonomic responses (eg, increased respiratory rate, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure). The nurse needs to recognize the anxiety reaction and provide an environment in which the patient feels secure.

The physiologic cast syndrome responses (superior mesenteric artery syndrome) are associated with immobility in a body cast. With decreased physical activity, gastrointestinal motility decreases, intestinal gases accumulate, intestinal pressure increases, and ileus may occur. The patient exhibits abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. As with other instances of adynamic ileus, the patient is treated conservatively with decompression (nasogastric intubation connected to suction) and intravenous fluid therapy until gastrointestinal motility is restored. If the cast restricts the abdomen, the abdominal window must be enlarged. After the ileus resolves and bowel sounds resume, the patient gradually resumes an oral diet. Rarely, the distention places traction on the superior mesenteric artery, reducing the blood supply to the bowel. The bowel may become gangrenous, which requires surgical intervention. The nurse monitors the patient in a large body cast for potential cast syndrome, noting bowel sounds every 4 to 8 hours, and reports distention, nausea, and vomiting to the physician.

The patient with a body or spica cast is often cared for in the home. The nurse teaches family members how to care for the patient, which includes providing hygienic and skin care, ensuring proper positioning, preventing complications, and recognizing symptoms that should be reported to the health care provider.

\section*{Managing the PatientWith Splints and Braces}

Contoured splints of plaster or pliable thermoplastic materials may be used for conditions that do not require rigid immobilization, for those in which swelling may be anticipated, and for those that require special skin care. The splint needs to immobilize and support the body part in a functional position. The splint must be well padded to prevent pressure, skin abrasion, and skin breakdown. The splint is overwrapped with an elastic bandage applied in a spiral fashion and with pressure uniformly distributed so that the circulation is not restricted. The nurse frequently assesses the neurovascular status and skin integrity of the splinted extremity.

Soft immobilizers may be used to support an injured body part. Usually, the extremity is wrapped with an elastic bandage and then secured in a padded, contoured, canvas immobilizer. Rigid immobilization is not achieved. The nurse provides skin care and makes adjustments for swelling.

For long-term use, braces (orthoses) are used to provide support, control movement, and prevent additional injury. They are custom fitted to various parts of the body. Braces may be constructed of plastic materials, canvas, leather, or metal. The orthotist adjusts the brace for fit, positioning, and motion.

The nurse helps the patient learn to apply the brace and to protect the skin from irritation and breakdown. The nurse also assesses neurovascular integrity and comfort when the patient is
wearing the brace, encourages the patient to wear the brace as prescribed, and reassures the patient that minor adjustments of the brace by the orthotist will increase comfort and minimize problems associated with its long-term use.

\section*{Managing the PatientWith an External Fixator}

External fixators are used to manage open fractures with soft tissue damage. They provide stable support for severe comminuted (crushed or splintered) fractures while permitting active treatment of damaged soft tissues (Fig. 67-2). Complicated fractures of the humerus, forearm, femur, tibia, and pelvis are managed with external skeletal fixators. The fracture is reduced, aligned, and immobilized by a series of pins inserted in the bone. Pin position is maintained through attachment to a portable frame. The fixator facilitates patient comfort, early mobility, and active exercise of adjacent uninvolved joints. Complications related to disuse and immobility are minimized.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

It is important to prepare the patient psychologically for application of the external fixator. The apparatus looks clumsy and foreign. Reassurance that the discomfort associated with the device

EIGURE 67-2 External fixation device. Pins are inserted into bone. The fracture is reduced and aligned and then stabilized by attaching the pins to a rigid portable frame. The device facilitates treatment of soft tissue damaged in complex fractures.
is minimal and that early mobility is anticipated promotes acceptance of the device.

After the external fixator is applied, the extremity is elevated to reduce swelling. If there are sharp points on the fixator or pins, they are covered to prevent device-induced injuries. The nurse monitors the neurovascular status of the extremity every 2 to 4 hours and assesses each pin site for redness, drainage, tenderness, pain, and loosening of the pin. Some serous drainage from the pin sites is to be expected. The nurse must be alert for potential problems caused by pressure from the device on the skin, nerves, or blood vessels and for the development of compartment syndrome (see Chap. 69). The nurse carries out pin care as prescribed to prevent pin tract infection. This typically includes cleaning each pin site separately three times a day with cotton-tipped applicators soaked in sterile saline solution. Crusts should not form at the pin site. If signs of infection are present or if the pins or clamps seem loose, the nurse notifies the physician.

NURSING ALERT The nurse never adjusts the clamps on the external fixator frame. It is the physician's responsibility to do so.

The nurse encourages isometric and active exercises within the limits of tissue damage. When the swelling subsides, the nurse helps the patient to become mobile within the prescribed weightbearing limits (non-weight bearing to full weight bearing). Adherence to weight-bearing instructions minimizes the chance of loosening of the pins when stress is applied to the bone-pin interface. The fixator is removed after the soft tissue heals. The fracture may require additional stabilization by a cast or molded orthosis while healing.

The Ilizarov external fixator is a special device used to correct angulation and rotational defects, to treat nonunion (failure of bone fragments to heal), and to lengthen limbs. Tension wires are attached to fixator rings, which are joined by telescoping rods. Bone formation is stimulated by prescribed daily adjustment of the telescoping rods. It is important to teach the patient how to adjust the telescoping rods and how to perform skin care. Generally, the nurse can encourage weight bearing. After the desired correction has been achieved, no additional adjustments are made, and the fixator is left in place until the bone heals.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching the Patient Self-Care. The nurse teaches the patient to perform pin site care according to the prescribed protocol (clean technique can be used at home [McKenzie, 1999]) and to report promptly any signs of pin site infection: redness, tenderness, increased or purulent pin site drainage, or fever. The nurse also instructs the patient and family to monitor neurovascular status and report any changes promptly. The nurse teaches the patient or family member to check the integrity of the fixator frame daily and to report loose pins or clamps. A physical therapy referral is helpful in teaching the patient how to transfer, use ambulatory aids safely, and adjust to weight-bearing limits and altered gait patterns (Chart 67-6).

\section*{Managing the Patient inTraction}

Traction is the application of a pulling force to a part of the body. Traction is used to minimize muscle spasms; to reduce, align, and immobilize fractures; to reduce deformity; and to increase space between opposing surfaces. Traction must be applied in the cor-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-021.jpg?height=752&width=1780&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=109)
rect direction and magnitude to obtain its therapeutic effects. As muscle and soft tissues relax, the amount of weight used may be changed to obtain the desired effect.

At times, traction needs to be applied in more than one direction to achieve the desired line of pull. When this is done, one of the lines of pull counteracts the other. These lines of pull are known as the vectors of force. The actual resultant pulling force is somewhere between the two lines of pull (Fig. 67-3). The effects of traction are evaluated with x-ray studies, and adjustments are made if necessary.

Traction is used primarily as a short-term intervention until other modalities, such as external or internal fixation, are possible. This reduces the risk of disuse syndrome and minimizes the length of hospitalization, often allowing the patient to be cared for in the home setting.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TRACTION}

Whenever traction is applied, countertraction must be used to achieve effective traction. Countertraction is the force acting in

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-021.jpg?height=572&width=743&top_left_y=1915&top_left_x=184}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 67-3 Traction may be applied in different directions to achieve the desired therapeutic line of pull. Adjustments in applied forces may be prescribed over the course of treatment.}
\end{figure}
the opposite direction. Usually, the patient's body weight and bed position adjustments supply the needed countertraction. NURSING ALERT Countertraction must be maintained for effective traction.

The following are additional principles to follow when caring for the patient in traction:
- Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.
- Skeletal traction is never interrupted.
- Weights are not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.
- Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated:
- The patient must be in good body alignment in the center of the bed when traction is applied.
- Ropes must be unobstructed.
- Weights must hang free and not rest on the bed or floor.
- Knots in the rope or the footplate must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed.
There are several types of traction. Straight or running traction applies the pulling force in a straight line with the body part resting on the bed. Buck's extension traction (Fig. 67-4) is an example of straight traction. Balanced suspension traction (Fig. 67-5) supports the affected extremity off the bed and allows for some patient movement without disruption of the line of pull.

Traction may be applied to the skin (skin traction) or directly to the bony skeleton (skeletal traction). The mode of application is determined by the purpose of the traction. Traction can be applied with the hands (manual traction). This is temporary traction that may be used when applying a cast, giving skin care under a Buck's extension foam boot, or adjusting the traction apparatus.

\section*{SKIN TRACTION}

Skin traction is used to control muscle spasms and to immobilize an area before surgery. Skin traction is accomplished by using a weight to pull on traction tape or on a foam boot attached to the skin. The amount of weight applied must not exceed the toler-

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-022.jpg?height=615&width=732&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=267}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 67-4 Buck's extension traction. Lower extremity in unilateral Buck's extension traction is aligned in a foam boot and traction applied by the free-hanging weight.}
\end{figure}
ance of the skin. No more than 2 to 3.5 kg ( 4.5 to 8 lb ) of traction can be used on an extremity. Pelvic traction is usually 4.5 to 9 kg ( 10 to 20 lb ), depending on the weight of the patient.

Types of skin traction used for adults include Buck's extension traction (applied to the lower leg), the cervical head halter (occasionally used to treat neck pain), and the pelvic belt (sometimes used to treat back pain).

\section*{Buck's Extension Traction}

Buck's extension traction (unilateral or bilateral) is skin traction to the lower leg. The pull is exerted in one plane when partial or temporary immobilization is desired (see Fig. 67-4). It is used to provide immobility after fractures of the proximal femur before surgical fixation.

Before the traction is applied, the nurse inspects the skin for abrasions and circulatory disturbances. The skin and circulation must be in healthy condition to tolerate the traction. The extremity should be clean and dry before the foam boot or traction tape is applied.

To apply Buck's traction, one nurse elevates and supports the extremity under the patient's heel and knee while another nurse
places the foam boot under the leg, with the patient's heel in the heel of the boot. Next, the nurse secures Velcro straps around the leg. Traction tape overwrapped with elastic bandage in a spiral fashion may be used instead of the boot. Excessive pressure is avoided over the malleolus and proximal fibula during application to prevent pressure ulcers and nerve damage. The nurse then passes the rope affixed to the spreader or footplate over a pulley fastened to the end of the bed and attaches the weight-usually 5 to 8 pounds-to the rope.

\section*{Potential Complications}

Skin breakdown, nerve pressure, and circulatory impairment are complications that may develop as a result of skin traction. Skin breakdown results from irritation caused by contact of the skin with the tape or foam and shearing forces. Older adults are at greater risk for this complication because of their sensitive, fragile skin.

Nerve pressure results from pressure on the peripheral nerves. Footdrop may occur if pressure is applied to the peroneal nerve at the point at which it passes around the neck of the fibula just below the knee.

Circulatory impairment is manifested by cold skin temperature, decreased peripheral pulses, slow capillary refill time, and bluish skin. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a serious circulatory impairment, is manifested by calf tenderness, swelling, and a positive Homans' sign (see Chap. 31).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{ENSURING EFFECTIVE TRACTION}

To ensure effective skin traction, it is important to avoid wrinkling and slipping of the traction bandage and to maintain countertraction. Proper positioning must be maintained to keep the leg in a neutral position. To prevent bony fragments from moving against one another, the patient should not turn from side to side; however, the patient may shift position slightly with assistance.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Skin Breakdown. During the initial assessment, the nurse identifies sensitive, fragile skin (common in older adults). The nurse also closely monitors the reaction of the skin in contact with tape or foam to ensure that shearing forces are avoided. The nurse per-

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 67-5 Balanced suspension skeletal traction with Thomas leg splint. The patient can move vertically as long as the resultant line of pull is maintained.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-022.jpg?height=677&width=1163&top_left_y=1936&top_left_x=822}
\end{figure}
forms the following procedures to monitor and prevent skin breakdown:
- Removes the foam boots to inspect the skin, the ankle, and the Achilles tendon three times a day. A second nurse is needed to support the extremity during the inspection and skin care.
- Palpates the area of the traction tapes daily to detect underlying tenderness.
- Provides back care at least every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers. The patient who must remain in a supine position is at increased risk for development of a pressure ulcer.
- Uses special mattress overlays (eg, air-filled, high-density foam) to minimize the development of skin ulcers.

Nerve Pressure. Skin traction can place pressure on peripheral nerves. When traction is applied to the lower extremity, care must be taken to avoid pressure on the peroneal nerve at the point at which it passes around the neck of the fibula just below the knee. Pressure at this point can cause footdrop. The nurse questions the patient about sensation and asks the patient to move the toes and foot. Dorsiflexion of the foot demonstrates function of the peroneal nerve. Weakness of dorsiflexion or foot movement and inversion of the foot might indicate pressure on the common peroneal nerve. Plantar flexion demonstrates function of the tibial nerve.

The following are important points to keep in mind when caring for the patient in traction:
- Regularly assess sensation and motion.
- Immediately investigate any complaint of burning sensation under the traction bandage or boot.
- Promptly report altered sensation or motor function.

Circulatory Impairment. After skin traction is applied, the nurse assesses circulation of the foot or hand within 15 to 30 minutes and then every 1 to 2 hours. Circulatory assessment consists of the following:
- Peripheral pulses, color, capillary refill, and temperature of the fingers or toes
- Indicators of DVT, including calf tenderness, swelling, and a positive Homans' sign

The nurse also encourages the patient to perform active foot exercises every hour when awake.

\section*{SKELETAL TRACTION}

Skeletal traction is applied directly to the bone. This method of traction is used occasionally to treat fractures of the femur, the tibia, and the cervical spine. The traction is applied directly to the bone by use of a metal pin or wire (eg, Steinmann pin, Kirschner wire) that is inserted through the bone distal to the fracture, avoiding nerves, blood vessels, muscles, tendons, and joints. Tongs applied to the head (eg, Gardner-Wells or Vinke tongs) are fixed in the skull to apply traction that immobilizes cervical fractures.

The orthopedic surgeon applies skeletal traction, using surgical asepsis. The insertion site is prepared with a surgical scrub agent such as povidone-iodine solution. A local anesthetic is administered at the insertion site and periosteum. The surgeon makes a small skin incision and drills the sterile pin or wire through the bone. The patient feels pressure during this procedure and possibly some pain when the periosteum is penetrated.

After insertion, the pin or wire is attached to the traction bow or caliper. The ends of the wire are covered with corks or tape to prevent injury to the patient or caregivers. The weights are attached to the pin or wire bow by a rope-and-pulley system that exerts the appropriate amount and direction of pull for effective traction. Skeletal traction frequently uses 7 to 12 kg ( 15 to 25 lb ) to achieve the therapeutic effect. The weights applied initially must overcome the shortening spasms of the affected muscles. As the muscles relax, the traction weight is reduced to prevent fracture dislocation and to promote healing.

Often, skeletal traction is balanced traction, which supports the affected extremity, allows for some patient movement, and facilitates patient independence and nursing care while maintaining effective traction. The Thomas splint with a Pearson attachment is frequently used with skeletal traction for fractures of the femur (see Fig. 67-5). Because upward traction is required, an overbed frame is used.

When skeletal traction is discontinued, the extremity is gently supported while the weights are removed. The pin is cut close to the skin and removed by the physician. Internal fixation, casts, or splints are then used to immobilize and support the healing bone.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE TRACTION}

When skeletal traction is used, the nurse checks the apparatus to see that the ropes are in the wheel grooves of the pulleys, that the ropes are not frayed, that the weights hang free, and that the knots in the rope are tied securely. The nurse also evaluates the patient's position, because slipping down in bed results in ineffective traction.

NURSING ALERT The nurse must never remove weights from skeletal traction unless a life-threatening situation occurs. Removal of the weights completely defeats their purpose and may result in injury to the patient.

\section*{MAINTAINING POSITIONING}

The nurse must maintain alignment of the patient's body in traction as prescribed to promote an effective line of pull. The nurse positions the patient's foot to avoid footdrop (plantar flexion), inward rotation (inversion), and outward rotation (eversion). The patient's foot may be supported in a neutral position by orthopedic devices (eg, foot supports).

\section*{PREVENTING SKIN BREAKDOWN}

The patient's elbows frequently become sore, and nerve injury may occur if the patient repositions by pushing on the elbows. In addition, patients frequently push on the heel of the unaffected leg when they raise themselves. This digging of the heel into the mattress may injure the tissues. Therefore, the nurse should protect the elbows and heels and inspect them for pressure areas. To encourage movement without using the elbows or heel, the nurse can suspend a trapeze overhead within easy reach of the patient. This apparatus helps the patient to move about in bed and to move on and off the bedpan.

Specific pressure points are assessed for redness and skin breakdown. Areas that are particularly vulnerable to pressure caused by traction apparatus applied to the lower extremity include the ischial tuberosity, popliteal space, Achilles tendon, and heel. If the patient is not permitted to turn on one side or the other, the nurse must make a special effort to provide back care and to keep
the bed dry and free of crumbs and wrinkles. The patient can assist by holding the overhead trapeze and raising the hips off the bed. If the patient cannot do this, the nurse can push down on the mattress with one hand to relieve pressure on the back and bony prominences and to provide for some shifting of weight. A pressurerelieving air-filled or high-density foam mattress overlay may reduce the risk of pressure ulcer.

For change of bed linens, the patient raises the torso while nurses on both sides of the bed roll down and replace the upper mattress sheet. Then, as the patient raises the buttocks off the mattress, the nurses slide the sheets under the buttocks. Finally, the nurses replace the lower section of the bed linens while the patient rests on the back. Sheets and blankets are placed over the patient in such a way that the traction is not disrupted.

\section*{MONITORING NEUROVASCULAR STATUS}

The nurse assesses the neurovascular status of the immobilized extremity at least every hour initially and then every 4 hours. The nurse instructs the patient to report any changes in sensation or movement immediately so that they can be promptly evaluated. DVT is a significant risk for the immobilized patient. The nurse encourages the patient to do active flexion-extension ankle exercises and isometric contraction of the calf muscles (calf-pumping exercises) 10 times an hour while awake to decrease venous stasis. In addition, elastic stockings, compression devices, and anticoagulant therapy may be prescribed to help prevent thrombus formation.

Prompt recognition of a developing neurovascular problem is essential so that corrective measures can be instituted promptly.

\section*{PROVIDING PIN SITE CARE}

The wound at the pin insertion site requires attention. The goal is to avoid infection and development of osteomyelitis. Initially, the site is covered with a sterile dressing. Subsequent care of the pin site is individually prescribed and performed three times a day. The nurse must keep the area clean. Slight serous oozing at the pin site is expected, but crusting should be prevented. The nurse assesses the pin site and drainage for signs of infection, such as redness, tenderness, and purulent drainage. The patient may experience discomfort at the pin site due to traction on the skin caused by an unsupported muscle.

\section*{PROMOTING EXERCISE}

Patient exercises, within the therapeutic limits of the traction, assist in maintaining muscle strength and tone and in promoting circulation. Active exercises include pulling up on the trapeze, flexing and extending the feet, and range-of-motion and weight-resistance exercises for noninvolved joints. Isometric exercises of the immobilized extremity (quadriceps-setting and gluteal-setting exercises) are important for maintaining strength in major ambulatory muscles (see Chart 67-3). Without exercise, the patient will lose muscle mass and strength, and rehabilitation will be greatly prolonged.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT IN TRACTION}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse must consider the psychological and physiologic impact of the musculoskeletal problem, traction device, and immo-
bility. Traction restricts one's mobility and independence. The equipment often looks threatening, and its application can be frightening. Confusion, disorientation, and behavioral problems may develop in patients who are confined in a limited space for an extended time. Therefore, the nurse must assess and monitor the patient's anxiety level and psychological responses to traction.

It is important to evaluate the body part to be placed in traction and its neurovascular status (ie, color, temperature, capillary refill, edema, pulses, ability to move, and sensations) and compare it to the unaffected extremity. The nurse also assesses skin integrity along with body system functioning for baseline data. Ongoing assessment is indicated for the patient in traction. Immobility-related problems may include pressure ulcers, stasis pneumonia, constipation, loss of appetite, urinary stasis, urinary tract infections, and venous stasis. Early identification of preexisting or developing problems facilitates prompt interventions to resolve them.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the nursing assessment, the patient's major nursing diagnoses related to traction may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge related to the treatment regimen
- Anxiety related to health status and the traction device
- Acute pain related to musculoskeletal disorder
- Self-care deficit: feeding, bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, and/or toileting related to traction
- Impaired physical mobility related to musculoskeletal disorder and traction

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Pressure ulcer
- Pneumonia
- Constipation
- Anorexia
- Urinary stasis and infection
- Venous stasis with DVT

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient in traction may include understanding of the treatment regimen, reduced anxiety, maximum comfort, maximum level of self-care, maximum mobility within the therapeutic limits of traction, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING \\ OF THE TREATMENT REGIMEN}

The patient must understand the problem being treated and the rationale for the traction therapy. The nurse may need to repeat and reinforce the information. With increased understanding of the therapy, the patient becomes an active participant in health care.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Before any traction is applied, the patient needs to be informed about the procedure, its purpose, and its implications. The nurse encourages the patient to participate in decisions that affect care.

Increasing the patient's sense of control reduces feelings of helplessness, allays apprehension, and fosters coping.

After being in traction for a while, the patient may react to being confined to a limited space. Frequent visits by the nurse can reduce feelings of isolation and confinement. The nurse should encourage family and friends to visit frequently for the same reason. The nurse encourages diversional activities that can be performed within the limits of the traction.

\section*{ACHIEVING A MAXIMUM LEVEL OF COMFORT}

Because the patient is immobilized in bed, the mattress needs to be firm. Special mattresses or mattress overlays designed to minimize the development of pressure ulcers may be placed on the bed before the traction is applied. The nurse can relieve pressure on dependent body parts by turning and positioning the patient for comfort within the limits of the traction and by making sure the bed linens remain wrinkle-free and dry.

NURSING ALERT The nurse must promptly investigate every complaint of discomfort expressed by the patient in traction.

\section*{ACHIEVING MAXIMUM SELF-CARE}

Initially, the patient may require assistance with self-care activities. The nurse helps the patient eat, bathe, dress, and toilet. Convenient arrangement of items such as telephone, tissues, water, and assistive devices (eg, reachers, overbed trapeze) may facilitate self-care. With resumption of self-care activities, the patient feels less dependent and less frustrated and experiences improved self-esteem.

Because some assistance is required throughout the period of immobility, the nurse and the patient can creatively develop routines that maximize the patient's independence.

\section*{ATTAINING MAXIMUM MOBILITY WITH TRACTION}

During traction therapy, the nurse encourages the patient to exercise muscles and joints that are not in traction to guard against their deterioration. The physical therapist can design bed exercises that minimize loss of muscle strength. During the patient's exercise, the nurse ensures that traction forces are maintained and that the patient is properly positioned to prevent complications resulting from poor alignment.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Pressure Ulcers}

The nurse examines the patient's skin frequently for evidence of pressure or friction, paying special attention to bony prominences. It is helpful to reposition the patient frequently and to use protective devices (eg, elbow protectors) to relieve pressure. If the risk of skin breakdown is high, as in a patient with multiple trauma or a debilitated elderly patient, use of a specialized bed is considered to prevent skin breakdown. If a pressure ulcer develops, the nurse consults with the physician and the wound care nurse specialist.

\section*{Pneumonia}

The nurse auscultates the patient's lungs every 4 to 8 hours to determine respiratory status and teaches the patient deep-breathing and coughing exercises to aid in fully expanding the lungs and moving pulmonary secretions. If the patient history and baseline assessment indicate that the patient is at high risk for development of respiratory complications, specific therapies (eg, in-
centive spirometer) may be indicated. If a respiratory problem develops, prompt institution of prescribed therapy is needed.

\section*{Constipation and Anorexia}

Reduced gastrointestinal motility results in constipation and anorexia. A diet high in fiber and fluids may help to stimulate gastric motility. If constipation develops, therapeutic measures might include stool softeners, laxatives, suppositories, and enemas. To improve the patient's appetite, the nurse identifies and includes the patient's food preferences, as appropriate, within the prescribed therapeutic diet.

\section*{Urinary Stasis and Infection}

Incomplete emptying of the bladder related to positioning in bed can result in urinary stasis and infection. In addition, the patient may find use of the bedpan uncomfortable and may limit fluids to minimize the frequency of urination. The nurse monitors the fluid intake and the character of the urine. The nurse teaches the patient to consume adequate amounts of fluid and to void every 3 to 4 hours. If the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection, the nurse notifies the physician.

\section*{Venous Stasis and Deep Vein Thrombosis}

Venous stasis occurs with immobility. The nurse teaches the patient to perform ankle and foot exercises within the limits of the traction therapy every 1 to 2 hours when awake to prevent DVT, which may result from venous stasis. The patient is encouraged to drink fluids to prevent dehydration and associated hemoconcentration, which contribute to stasis. The nurse monitors the patient for signs of DVT, including calf tenderness, warmth, redness, swelling (increased calf circumference), and a positive Homans' sign (discomfort in the calf when the foot is forcibly dorsiflexed). The nurse promptly reports findings to the physician for definitive evaluation and therapy.

\section*{Managing the Patient Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery}

Many patients with musculoskeletal dysfunction undergo surgery to correct the problem. Problems that may be corrected by surgery include unstabilized fracture, deformity, joint disease, necrotic or infected tissue, and tumors. Frequent surgical procedures include open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) and closed reduction with internal fixation (fracture fragments are not surgically exposed) for fractures; arthroplasty, meniscectomy, and joint replacement for joint problems; amputation for severe extremity problems (eg, gangrene, massive trauma); bone graft for joint stabilization, defect-filling, or stimulation of bone healing; and tendon transfer for improving motion. The goals include improving function by restoring motion and stability and relieving pain and disability. See Chart 67-7 for descriptions of orthopedic surgeries.

Joint surgery is one the most frequently performed orthopedic surgeries. Joint disease or deformity may necessitate surgical intervention to relieve pain, improve stability, and improve function. Surgical procedures include excision of damaged and diseased tissue, repair of damaged structures (eg, ruptured tendon), removal of loose bodies (débridement), arthroplasty (replacement of all or part of the joint surfaces), and arthrodesis (immobilizing fusion of a joint).

The procedure is based on the patient's underlying orthopedic condition, general physical health, impact of joint disability on daily activities, and age. Timing of these procedures is important to ensure maximum function. Surgery should be performed before surrounding muscles become contracted and atrophied
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-026.jpg?height=1059&width=864&top_left_y=1551&top_left_x=208)
and serious structural abnormalities occur. The physician carefully evaluates the patient so that the most appropriate procedure is performed.

Because these are elective procedures, many patients donate their own blood during the weeks preceding their surgery. This blood is used to replace blood lost during surgery. Autologous blood transfusions eliminate many of the risks of transfusion therapy.

Also, during surgery blood is conserved to minimize loss. A pneumatic tourniquet may be applied after exsanguination of the limb with bandages to produce a "bloodless field." Intraoperative blood salvage with reinfusion is used when a large volume of blood loss is anticipated. Postoperative blood salvage with intermittent autotransfusion also reduces the need for blood transfusion.

\section*{JOINT REPLACEMENT}

Patients with severe joint pain and disability may undergo joint replacement. Conditions contributing to joint degeneration include osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, and congenital deformity. Some fractures (eg, femoral neck fracture) may cause disruption of the blood supply and subsequent avascular necrosis; management with joint replacement may be elected over ORIF. Joints frequently replaced include the hip, knee (Fig. 67-6), and finger joints. Less fre-

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 67-6 Examples of hip and knee replacement.}
\end{figure}
quently, more complex joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle) are replaced. The procedure is usually an elective one.

Most joint replacements consist of metal and high-density polyethylene components. Finger prostheses are usually Silastic. The joint implants may be cemented in the prepared bone with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), a bone-bonding agent that has properties similar to bone. Loosening of the prosthesis due to cement-bone interface failure is a common reason for prosthesis failure. Press-fit, ingrowth prostheses (porous-coated, cementless artificial joint components) that allow the patient's bone to grow into and securely fix the prosthesis in the bone are alternatives to cemented prostheses. Accurate fitting and the presence of healthy bone with adequate blood supply are important in the use of cementless components. Much progress has been made in reducing prosthesis failure rate through improved techniques, improved materials, and use of bone grafts.

With joint replacement, excellent pain relief is obtained in most patients. Return of motion and function depends on preoperative soft tissue condition, soft tissue reactions, and general muscle strength. Early failure of joint replacement is associated with excessive activity and preoperative joint and bone pathology.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Assessment of the patient and preoperative management are aimed at having the patient in optimal health at the time of surgery. Preoperatively, it is important to evaluate cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and hepatic functions. Age, obesity, preoperative leg edema, history of DVT, and varicose veins increase the risk of postoperative DVT and pulmonary embolism. These are the most common causes of postoperative mortality for patients older than 60 years of age undergoing total hip replacement. Every effort is made to prevent these complications.

Preoperatively, it is important to assess the neurovascular status of the extremity undergoing joint replacement. Postoperative assessment data are compared with preoperative assessment data to identify changes and deficits. For example, an absent pulse postoperatively is of concern unless the pulse was also absent preoperatively. Nerve palsy could occur as a result of surgery.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Preoperative assessment of the patient for infections, including urinary tract infection, is necessary because of the risk of postoperative infection. Any infection 2 to 4 weeks before planned surgery may result in postponement of surgery. Preoperative skin preparation frequently begins 1 or 2 days before the surgery. Airborne bacteria that contaminate the wound at the time of surgery cause most deep infections. Therefore, as with any surgery, there is strict adherence to aseptic principles and the operating area is controlled and made as bacteria free as possible.

Prophylactic antibiotics are administered perioperatively as a single preoperative or short perioperative course (Rosen et al., 1999). Culture of the joint during surgery, before intraoperative antibiotic therapy is begun, may be important in identifying and treating subsequent infections.

If osteomyelitis develops, it is difficult to treat. Persistent infection at the site of the prosthesis usually requires removal of the implant and joint revision, which is a complex procedure. Also, it is not always possible to achieve a functional joint when the reconstruction procedure has to be repeated.

\section*{PROMOTING AMBULATION}

Patients with total hip or total knee replacement begin ambulation with a walker or crutches within a day after surgery. The
nurse and the physical therapist assist the patient in achieving the goal of independent ambulation. At first, the patient may only be able to stand for a brief period because of orthostatic hypotension. Specific weight-bearing limits on the prosthesis are determined by the physician and are based on the patient's condition, the procedure, and the fixation method. Usually, patients with cemented prostheses can proceed to weight bearing as tolerated. If the patient has a press-fit, cementless, ingrowth prosthesis, weight bearing immediately after surgery may be limited to minimize micromotion of the prosthesis in the bone. As the patient is able tolerate more activity, the nurse encourages transferring to a chair several times a day for short periods and walking for progressively greater distances.

\section*{TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT}

Total hip replacement is the replacement of a severely damaged hip with an artificial joint. Indications for this surgery include arthritis (degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis), femoral neck fractures, failure of previous reconstructive surgeries (failed prosthesis, osteotomy), and problems resulting from congenital hip disease. A variety of total hip prostheses are available. Most consist of a metal femoral component topped by a spherical ball fitted into a plastic acetabular socket (see Fig. 67-6). The surgeon selects the prosthesis that is most suited to the individual patient, considering various factors, including skeletal structure and activity level.

The patient is usually 60 years of age or older and has unremitting pain or irreversibly damaged hip joints. With the advent of improved prosthetic materials and operative techniques, the life of the prosthesis has been extended, and today younger patients with severely damaged and painful hip joints are undergoing total hip replacement.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The nurse must be aware of and monitor for specific potential complications associated with total hip replacement. Complications that may occur include dislocation of the hip prosthesis, excessive wound drainage, thromboembolism, infection, and heel pressure ulcer. Other complications for which the nurse must monitor include those associated with immobility, heterotophic ossification (formation of bone in the periprosthetic space), avascular necrosis (bone death caused by loss of blood supply), and loosening of the prosthesis.

\section*{PREVENTING DISLOCATION OF THE HIP PROSTHESIS}

Maintenance of the femoral head component in the acetabular cup is essential. The nurse teaches the patient about positioning the leg in abduction, which helps to prevent dislocation of the prosthesis. The use of an abduction splint, a wedge pillow (Fig. 67-7), or two or three pillows between the legs keeps the hip in abduction. When the nurse turns the patient in bed, it is important to keep the operative hip in abduction. Depending on the surgeon's preference, some patients are not permitted to be turned onto the affected side, whereas others may be turned to either side.

The patient's hip is never flexed more than 90 degrees. To prevent hip flexion, the nurse does not elevate the head of the bed more than 60 degrees. For use of the fracture bedpan, the nurse instructs the patient to flex the unaffected hip and to use the trapeze to lift the pelvis onto the pan. The patient is also reminded not to flex the affected hip.

Limited flexion is maintained during transfers and when sitting. When the patient is initially assisted out of bed, an abduction splint or pillows are kept between the legs. The nurse

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-028.jpg?height=372&width=843&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=213}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 67-7 An abduction pillow may be used after a total hip replacement to prevent dislocation of the prosthesis.}
\end{figure}
encourages the patient to keep the affected hip in extension, instructing the patient to pivot on the unaffected leg with assistance by the nurse, who protects the affected hip from adduction, flexion, internal or external rotation, and excessive weight bearing.

High-seat (orthopedic) chairs, semireclining wheelchairs, and raised toilet seats may be used to minimize hip joint flexion. When sitting, the patient's hips should be higher than the knees. The patient's affected leg should not be elevated when sitting. The patient may flex the knee.

The nurse teaches the patient protective positioning, which includes maintaining abduction and avoiding internal and external rotation, hyperextension, and acute flexion. A cradle boot may be used to prevent leg rotation and to support the heel off the bed, preventing development of a pressure ulcer. The patient should use pillows between the legs when in a supine or side-lying position and when turning. Generally, the nurse instructs the patient
not to sleep on the side on which the surgery was performed without consulting the surgeon. At no time should the patient cross his or her legs. The patient must avoid acute flexion of the hip. The patient should not bend at the waist to put on shoes and socks. Occupational therapists can provide the patient with devices to assist with dressing below the waist. Hip precautions are needed for about 4 months after surgery (Chart 67-8).

Dislocation may occur with positioning that exceeds the limits of the prosthesis. The nurse must recognize dislocation of the prosthesis. Indicators are as follows:
- Increased pain at the surgical site, swelling, and immobilization
- Acute groin pain in affected hip or increased discomfort
- Shortening of the leg
- Abnormal external or internal rotation
- Restricted ability or inability to move leg
- Reported "popping" sensation in hip

If a prosthesis becomes dislocated, the nurse (or the patient, if at home) immediately notifies the surgeon, because the hip must be reduced and stabilized promptly so that the leg does not sustain circulatory and nerve damage. After closed reduction, the hip may be stabilized with Buck's traction or a brace to prevent recurrent dislocation. As the muscles and joint capsule heal, the chance of dislocation diminishes. Stresses to the new hip joint should be avoided for the first 3 to 6 months.

\section*{MONITORING WOUND DRAINAGE}

Fluid and blood accumulating at the surgical site are usually drained with a portable suction device. This prevents accumula-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-028.jpg?height=1179&width=1772&top_left_y=1426&top_left_x=213)
tion of fluid, which could contribute to discomfort and provide a site for infection. Drainage of 200 to 500 mL in the first 24 hours is expected; by 48 hours postoperatively, the total drainage in 8 hours usually decreases to 30 mL or less, and the suction device is then removed. The nurse promptly notifies the physician of any drainage volumes greater than anticipated.

If extensive blood loss is anticipated after total joint replacement surgery, an autotransfusion drainage system (in which the drained blood is filtered and reinfused into the patient during the immediate postoperative period) may be used to decrease the need for homologous blood transfusions.

\section*{PREVENTING DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS}

The risk for thromboembolism is particularly great after reconstructive hip surgery. The incidence of DVT is $45 \%$ to $70 \%$. The peak occurrence is 5 to 7 days after surgery. About $20 \%$ of patients with DVT develop pulmonary emboli, of which about $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ of cases are fatal. Therefore, the nurse must institute preventive measures and monitor the patient closely for the development of DVT and pulmonary emboli. Signs of DVT include calf pain, swelling, and tenderness. Measures to promote circulation and decrease venous stasis are priorities for the patient undergoing hip reconstruction. The nurse encourages the patient to consume adequate amount of fluids, to perform ankle and foot exercises hourly while awake, to use elastic stockings and sequen-
tial compression devices as prescribed, and to transfer out of bed and ambulate with assistance beginning on the first postoperative day. Low-dose heparin or enoxaparin (Lovenox) is frequently prescribed as prophylaxis for DVT after hip replacement surgery.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Infection, a serious complication of total hip replacement, may necessitate removal of the implant. Patients who are elderly, obese, or poorly nourished and patients who have diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, concurrent infections (eg, urinary tract infection, dental abscess), or large hematomas are at high risk for infection.

Because total joint infections are so disastrous, all efforts are undertaken to minimize their occurrence. Potential sources of infection are avoided. Prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed. If indwelling urinary catheters or portable wound suction devices are used, they are removed as soon as possible to avoid infection. Prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed if the patient needs any future surgical instrumentation, such as tooth extraction or cystoscopic examination.

Acute infections may occur within 3 months after surgery and are associated with progressive superficial infections or hematomas. Delayed surgical infections may appear 4 to 24 months after surgery and may cause return of discomfort in the hip. Infections occurring more than 2 years after surgery are attributed to the spread of infection through the bloodstream from another site in the body. If

Hahn, G., et al. (1999). Wound complications after surgery using a tapeless compressive support. Orthopaedic Nursing, 18(3), 43-49.

\section*{Purpose}

Skin blisters (tape blisters) frequently occur after hip surgery and cause skin breakdown and patient discomfort. This study compared the incidence of blisters and wound drainage with traditional wound taping and with a tapeless compressive (stretch spica) wrap dressing (i.e., cotton stockinette or a commercial single-piece stretch spica wrap).

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A total of 499 hip surgeries performed by one surgeon over a 10-year period on 457 patients, whose average age was 65 years, were reviewed. Eighty-seven consecutive hip surgeries with taped dressings (control group) were compared with 368 consecutive hip surgeries with hip wrap dressings (experimental group). The patient characteristics in the two groups were similar. The surgeries were performed for osteoarthritis $(60 \%)$, fracture $(22 \%)$, rheumatoid arthritis $(8 \%)$, and other problems ( $10 \%$ ) including osteonecrosis, congenitally dislocated hips, Reiter's syndrome, and Legg-Perthes disease. Surgical procedures performed included hip replacement ( $67 \%$ ), revision of hip replacement ( $25 \%$ ), and open reduction internal fixation of hip fracture (8\%).

A retrospective, descriptive study design was used to compare the incidence of wound drainage, tape blisters, infections, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism in the two groups.

\section*{Findings}
- Wound drainage was difficult to quantify because of the descriptive nature of charting. Twenty-eight ( $7 \%$ ) of the spica wrap group and $13(15 \%)$ of the tape group exhibited wound drainage. All drainage was described as slight to moderate with no drainage at the time of discharge from the hospital. The difference in incidence of drainage between groups was statistically significant ( $p<.001$ ).
- Four tape blisters ( $1 \%$ ), two from surgical incision adhesive strips and two from taping of the dressing after the spica wrap was discontinued, occurred in the tapeless compressive wrap dressing group, compared with 13 tape blisters ( $15 \%$ ) in the tape group. The difference in incidence of blisters between groups was statistically significant ( $p<.001$ ).
- No infections occurred in the spica wrap group, and there was one documented Staphylococcus aureus infection in the tape group.
- Thrombotic disease prophylaxis was used for both groups. The incidence of thrombotic disease in the spica wrap group was 12 patients ( $3 \%$ ). Because the data recorded for the traditional tape group were insufficient to determine the incidence of thrombotic disease, no comparison with controls could be made. However, the low incidence in the experimental group suggests that the spica wrap does not contribute to an increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis.
- Patients reported that the spica wrap was comfortable and supported the incision well, so that they could move with greater confidence.
- Nurses found the spica wrap easy to apply and easy to unfasten for inspection of the wound. Also, nursing time was not required to care for tape blisters.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

In this study, the use of a compressive spica wrap dressing, compared with taped dressings, reduced the incidence of wound complications (eg, tape blisters, drainage). Advantages included ease of application and removal for wound inspection. In addition, the hip spica dressing was comfortable for the patient.

Additional studies in other settings and with other patients comparing the use of the hip spica dressing and traditional taped dressings are recommended; randomization of patients to the spica wrap dressing group and to the tape group is also recommended.
an infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed. Severe infections may require surgical débridement or removal of the prosthesis (Nursing Research Profile 67-1).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching the Patient Self-Care. Before the patient prepares to leave the acute care setting, the nurse provides a thorough teaching program to promote continuity of the therapeutic regimen and active participation in the rehabilitation process (Chart 67-9). The nurse advises the patient of the importance of the daily exercise program in maintaining the functional motion of the hip joint and strengthening the abductor muscles of the hip, and reminds the patient that it will take time to strengthen and retrain the muscles.

Assistive devices (crutches, walker, or cane) are used for a time. After sufficient muscle tone has developed to permit a normal gait without discomfort, these devices are not necessary. In general, by 3 months, the patient can resume routine ADLs. Stair climbing is permitted as prescribed and is kept to a minimum for 3 to 6 months. Frequent walks, swimming, and use of a high rocking chair are excellent for hip exercises. Sexual activities should be carried out with the patient in the dependent position (flat on the back) for 3 to 6 months to avoid excessive adduction and flexion of the new hip.

At no time during the first 4 months should the patient cross the legs or flex the hip more than 90 degrees. Assistance in putting on shoes and socks may be needed. The patient should avoid low chairs and sitting for longer than 45 minutes at a time. These precautions minimize hip flexion and the risks for prosthetic dislocation, hip stiffness, and flexion contracture. Traveling long distances should be avoided unless frequent position changes are possible. Other activities to avoid include tub baths, overexertion, jogging, lifting heavy loads, and excessive bending and twisting (eg, lifting, shoveling snow, forceful turning).

Continuing Care in the Home and Community. The nurse may make a home visit to assess for potential problems and to monitor wound healing (see Chart 67-9). The nurse, physical therapist, or occupational therapist assesses the home environment for physical barriers that may impede the patient's rehabilitation. In addition, the nurse or therapist may need to assist the patient in acquiring devices, such as reachers to help with dressing or toilet seat extenders.

After successful surgery and rehabilitation, the patient can expect a hip joint that is free or almost free of pain, has good motion, is stable, and permits normal or near-normal ambulation (see Plan of Nursing Care).

\section*{TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT}

Total knee replacement surgery is considered for patients who have severe pain and functional disabilities related to joint surfaces destroyed by arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, posttraumatic arthritis) or bleeding into the joint, such as may result from hemophilia. Metal and acrylic prostheses designed to provide the patient with a functional, painless, stable joint may be used. If the patient's ligaments have weakened, a fully constrained (hinged) or semiconstrained prosthesis may be used to provide joint stability. A nonconstrained prosthesis depends on the patient's ligaments for joint stability.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Postoperatively, the knee is dressed with a compression bandage. Ice may be applied to control edema and bleeding. The nurse assesses the neurovascular status of the leg. It is important to encourage active flexion of the foot every hour when the patient is awake. Efforts are directed at preventing complications

\section*{Plan of Nursing Care \\ The Patient With a Total Hip Replacement}
Nursing Interventions Rationale Expected Outcomes
Nursing Diagnosis: Pain related to total hip replacement
Goal: Relief of pain
1. Assess patient for pain using a standard pain intensity scale.
2. Ask patient to describe discomfort.
3. Acknowledge existence of pain; inform patient of available analgesics or muscle relaxants.

a. Use analgesics.
b. Change position within prescribed limits.
c. Modify environment.
d. Notify surgeon about persistent pain.
5. Evaluate and record discomfort and effec- tiveness of pain-modifying techniques.
1. Pain is expected after a surgical procedure because of the surgical trauma and tissue response. Muscle spasms occur after total hip replacements. Immobility causes discomfort at pressure points.
2. Pain characteristics may help to determine the cause of discomfort. Pain may be due to complications (hematoma, infection, dislocation). Pain is an individual experience-it means different things to different people.
3. The nurse can reduce the stress experienced by patient by communicating concern and availability of assistance to help the patient deal with the pain
4.
a. Patient will require parenteral opioids during the first 24-48 hours, and then will progress to oral analgesics.
b. Use of pillows to provide adequate support and relief of pressure on bony prominences assists in minimizing pain.
c. Interactions with others, distractions, and sensory overload or deprivation may affect pain experience.
d. Surgical intervention may be necessary if pain is due to hematoma or excessive edema.
5. Effectiveness of action is based on experience; data provide a baseline about pain experiences, management, and pain relief.
- Patient describes discomfort
- Expresses confidence in efforts to control pain
- States pain is reduced; pain intensity scores are decreasing

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

Collaborative Problems: Hemorrhage; neurovascular compromise; dislocation of prosthesis; deep vein thrombosis; infection related to surgery
Goal: Absence of complications

\section*{Hemorrhage}
1. Monitor vital signs, observing for shock.
2. Note character and amount of drainage.
3. Notify surgeon if patient develops shock or excessive bleeding and prepare for administration of fluids, blood component therapy, and medications.
4. Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit values.

\section*{Neurovascular Dysfunction}
1. Assess affected extremity for color and temperature.
2. Assess toes for capillary refill response.
3. Assess extremity for edema and swelling. Report patient complaints of leg tightness.
4. Elevate extremity (keep leg lower than hip when in chair).
5. Assess for deep, throbbing, unrelenting pain.
6. Assess for pain on passive flexion of foot.
7. Assess for change in sensations and numbness.
8. Assess ability to move foot and toes.
9. Assess pedal pulses in both feet.
10. Notify surgeon if altered neurovascular status is noted.
1. Changes in pulse, blood pressure, and respirations may indicate development of shock. Blood loss and stress of surgery may contribute to development of shock.
2. Within 48 hours, bloody drainage collected in portable suction device should decrease to $25-30 \mathrm{~mL}$ per 8 hours. Excessive drainage (more than 250 mL in first 8 hours after surgery) and bright red drainage may indicate active bleeding.
3. Corrective measures need to be instituted.
4. Anemia due to blood loss may develop. Blood replacement or iron supplementation may be needed.
1. The skin becomes pale and feels cool with decreased tissue perfusion. Venous congestion may produce cyanosis.
2. After compression of the nail, rapid return of pink color indicates good capillary perfusion.
3. The trauma of surgery will cause edema. Excessive swelling and hematoma formation can compromise circulation and function.
4. Minimizes dependent edema.
5. Surgical pain can be controlled; pain due to neurovascular compromise is not relieved by treatment.
6. With nerve ischemia, there will be pain on passive stretch. Additionally, pain may indicate deep vein thrombosispositive Homans' sign.
7. Diminished pain and sensory function may indicate nerve damage. Sensation in web between great and second toeperoneal nerve; sensation on sole of foot-tibial nerve.
8. Dorsiflexion of ankle and extension of toes indicate function of peroneal nerve. Plantar flexion of ankle and flexion of toes indicate function of tibial nerve.
9. Indicator of extremity circulation.
10. Function of extremity needs to be preserved.

4. Avoid acute flexion of hip (head of bed at 60 degrees or less).
5. Avoid crossing legs.
6. Assess for dislocation of prosthesis (extremity shortens, internally or externally rotated, severe hip pain, patient unable to move extremity)
7. Notify surgeon of possible dislocation.

\section*{Deep Vein Thrombosis}
1. Use elastic compression stocking or sequential compression device as prescribed.

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}
1. Hip component positioning (femoral
- Prosthesis not dislocated component in acetabular component) needs to be maintained.
2. Keep hip in abduction and in a neutral rotation to prevent dislocation.
3-5. Prevent dislocation.
6. Findings may indicate dislocation of prosthesis.
7. Joint dislocations compromise neurovascular status and future function of extremity.
1. Aid in venous blood return and prevent stasis.
2. Skin care is necessary to avoid breakdown. Extended removal of stockings defeats purpose of stockings.
3. Pulses indicate arterial perfusion of extremity.
4. Local inflammation will increase local skin temperature.
5. Pain on dorsiflexion of ankle may indicate deep vein thrombosis.
6. Compression of blood vessels diminishes blood flow.
7. Activity promotes circulation and diminishes venous stasis.
8. Muscle exercise promotes circulation.
9. Body temperature increases with inflammation.
10. Dehydration increases blood viscosity
1. Temperature, pulse, and respirations increase in response to infection. (Magnitude of response may be minimal in an elderly patient.)

\section*{Plan of Nursing Care \\ The Patient With a Total Hip Replacement (Continued)}
Nursing Interventions Rationale Expected Outcomes
Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for ineffective health maintenance related to total hip replacement
Goal: Cares for self at home
1. Assess home environment for discharge planning.
2. Encourage patient to express concerns about care at home; explore togetherpossible solutions to the problem.
3. Assess availability of physical assistancefor health care activities.
4. Teach caregiver home health careregimen.

1. Physical barriers (especially stairs, bathrooms) may limit patient's ability to ambulate and care for self at home.
2. Patient may have special problems that need to be identified and resolved.
3. Because of limitation of mobility and limited hip range of motion, patient may require some assistance in routine health care.
4. Understanding of rehabilitative regimen is necessary for compliance.
5. Lack of knowledge and poor preparation for care at home contribute to patient anxiety, insecurity, and nonadherence to therapeutic regimen.
- Home is accessible for patient at time of discharge.
- Patient appears relaxed and develops strategies to deal with identified problems.
- Personal assistance is available.
- Patient demonstrates ability to provide necessary assistance within therapeutic prescription.
- Patient complies with home care program.
- Patient keeps follow-up health care appointments.
(thromboembolism, peroneal nerve palsy, infection, limited range of motion).

A wound suction drain removes fluid accumulating in the joint. Drainage ranges from 200 to 400 mL during the first 24 hours after surgery and diminishes to less than 25 mL by 48 hours. Then the surgeon removes the drains. If extensive bleeding is anticipated, an autotransfusion drainage system may be used during the immediate postoperative period. The color, type, and amount of drainage are documented, and any excessive drainage or change in characteristics of the drainage are promptly reported to the physician.

Frequently, a continuous passive motion (CPM) device is used. The patient's leg is placed in this device, which increases circulation and range of motion of the knee joint. The rate and amount of extension and flexion are prescribed. Usually, 10 degrees of extension and 50 degrees of flexion are prescribed initially, increasing to 90 degrees of flexion with full extension ( 0 degrees) by discharge.

The nurse encourages the patient to use the device most of the time. The physical therapist supervises exercises for strength and range of motion. If satisfactory flexion is not achieved, gentle manipulation of the knee joint under general anesthesia may be necessary about 2 weeks after surgery.

The nurse assists the patient to get out of bed on the evening or the day after surgery. The knee is usually protected with a knee immobilizer (splint, cast, or brace) and is elevated when the patient sits in a chair. The physician prescribes weight-bearing limits. Progressive ambulation, using assistive devices and within the prescribed weight-bearing limits, begins on the day after the surgery.

After discharge from the hospital, the patient may continue to use the CPM device at home and may undergo physical therapy on an outpatient basis. Late complications that may occur include infection and loosening and wear of prosthetic components. Patients usually can achieve a pain-free, functional joint and participate more fully in life activities than before the surgery (Nursing Research Profile 67-2).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: PREOPERATIVE CARE OF THE PATIENT UNDERGOING ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY}

\section*{Assessment}

Assessment of the patient is focused on hydration status, current medication history, and possible infection. Adequate hydration is an important goal for orthopedic patients. Immobilization and bed rest contribute to DVT, to urinary stasis and associated bladder infections, and to kidney stone formation. Adequate hydration decreases blood viscosity and venous stasis and ensures adequate urine flow. To determine preoperative hydration status, the nurse assesses the skin and mucous membranes, vital signs, urinary output, and laboratory values.

The medication history provides information for perioperative management. The patient with chronic illness (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, allergies) frequently has received corticosteroid medications to control symptoms. The corticosteroid should be administered preopera-

Showalter, A., et al. (2000). Patients' and their spouses' needs after total joint arthroplasty: A pilot study. Orthopaedic Nursing, 19(1), 49-57, 62.

\section*{Purpose}

Each year almost 250,000 Americans who have arthritis-related disability choose to have total joint arthroplasty in an attempt to reduce pain and improve functional status and mobility. Health care providers need to understand the perceived needs of patients and their families during hospitalization and recovery from total joint arthroplasty so that programs can be developed or modified to meet those needs.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The purposive sample consisted of 5 patients who had recently undergone total joint arthroplasty and their spouses. The mean age of patients was 68.6 years, and the mean age of spouses was 69 years. Three patients had undergone total knee replacement, and two patients had undergone total hip replacement within 4 months of data collection.

Focus group interviews were conducted and videotaped for subsequent analysis. The interviewer used an open-ended interview format to explore the perceptions of patients and spouses regarding what information that was useful before surgery, what information they wished they had received, and what else would have helped them during recovery.

\section*{Results}

The primary need expressed by this focus group was the need for help in making transitions. The participants expressed problems in mak-
ing situational and role transitions and experienced distress over not being able to resume activities that they had previously enjoyed within an expected time frame. Spouses stated that they felt unprepared for the reality of being a care provider and often felt overwhelmed and insecure about what was expected of them.

In addition, the focus group addressed health and illness transitions and the need to know that each patient progresses toward recovery at his or her own rate. Patients commented that the patient education they received did not prepare them for problems encountered during recovery at home. Pain management was of particular concern. A home visit soon after hospital discharge was suggested as a way to help patients and spouses manage the transitions.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Hospital health care professionals need to be sensitive to the needs of patients and their families as they transition to care in their home. The nurse needs to include both the patient and family members in discharge teaching regarding activities and pain management. Knowledge and skills are needed by the patients and families to confidently manage problems that they encounter during recovery at home.

Further research is necessary to explore the needs of patients and families in care after hospitalization.
tively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively as prescribed to prevent the occurrence of adrenal insufficiency from suppressed adrenal function. The patient's use of other medications, such as anticoagulants, cardiovascular agents, or insulin, needs to be documented and discussed with the surgeon and anesthesiologist to ensure adequate management.

The nurse asks the patient specifically about the occurrence of colds, dental problems, urinary tract infections, and other infections within the 2 weeks before surgery. Osteomyelitis could develop through hematologous spread. Permanent disability can result if infection occurs within a bone or joint. Preexisting infections must be resolved before elective orthopedic surgery is performed.

Other areas of preoperative assessment are similar to those for any patient undergoing surgery. Intramuscular medications are injected into an uninvolved area, because tissue absorption is better in nontraumatized tissues.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on the nursing assessment data, the patient's major preoperative nursing diagnoses related to orthopedic status may include the following:
- Acute pain related to fracture, orthopedic problem, swelling, or inflammation
- Risk for peripheral neurovascular dysfunction related to swelling, constricting devices, or impaired venous return
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management related to insufficient knowledge or lack of available support and resources
- Impaired physical mobility related to pain, swelling, and possible presence of an immobilization device
- Risk for situational low self-esteem: disturbed body image and/or functional impairment related to impact of musculoskeletal disorder

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient before orthopedic surgery may include relief of pain, adequate neurovascular function, health promotion, improved mobility, and positive self-esteem.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Physical, pharmacologic, and psychological strategies to control pain are useful in the preoperative period. Specific strategies are tailored to the individual patient. Discomfort is decreased with immobilization of a fractured bone or an injured, inflamed joint. Elevation of an edematous extremity promotes venous return and reduces associated discomfort. Ice, if prescribed, relieves swelling and directly reduces discomfort by diminishing nerve stimulation. Analgesics are frequently prescribed to control the acute pain of musculoskeletal injury and associated muscle spasm. During the immediate preoperative period, the nurse needs to discuss and coordinate the administration of analgesic medications with the anesthesiologist and surgeon. Alternative methods of pain control (eg, distraction, focusing, guided imagery, quiet environment, backrubs) may be used to decrease pain perception.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NEUROVASCULAR FUNCTION}

Trauma, edema, or immobilization devices may interrupt tissue perfusion. The nurse must frequently assess neurovascular status (ie, color, temperature, capillary refill, pulses, edema, pain, sen-
sation, motion) of the extremity and document the findings. If circulation is compromised, the nurse institutes measures to restore adequate circulation. These include promptly notifying the physician, elevating the extremity, and releasing constricting wraps or casts as prescribed.

\section*{PROMOTING HEALTH}

The nurse assists the patient in activities that promote health during the perioperative period. The nurse assesses nutritional status and hydration. The preoperative fasting regimen is usually tolerated well. If the patient has diabetes, is elderly and frail, or is the victim of multiple trauma, special fluid and nutritional provisions may be necessary.

The nurse monitors fluid intake, urinary output, urinalysis findings, and complaints of burning on urination. At times, patients may limit their fluid intake to minimize the use of a bedpan. A small fracture pan may be more comfortable for the patient to use. An indwelling catheter should be used only when absolutely necessary to minimize the risk of urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infection must be addressed before surgery.

Coughing, deep breathing, and use of the incentive spirometer are practiced preoperatively for improved respiratory function during the postoperative period. Preoperative teaching facilitates postoperative compliance. Smoking should be stopped during the preoperative period to facilitate optimal respiratory function.

The nurse provides skin care, paying special attention to pressure points. It is important to institute the use of pressure-reducing surfaces (i.e., special mattresses) before surgery for patients at high risk for skin breakdown.

To minimize the risk for infection, the nurse meticulously and gently cleans the skin with soap and water on the day before surgery. If the surgery is elective, the orthopedic surgeon may instruct the patient to use a germicidal soap for several days before hospitalization.

The nurse discusses with the patient and the family the need for assistance with ADLs and the therapeutic regimen during convalescence so that adequate support is available when the patient is discharged. Modification of the home environment may be necessary to accommodate the altered mobility of the patient after surgery. Referral to the social worker and the case manager may be needed to ensure a smooth transition to home care.

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

Preoperatively, the patient's mobility may be impaired by pain, swelling, and immobilizing devices (eg, splints, casts, traction). The nurse should elevate and adequately support edematous extremities with pillows. It is important to control pain before an injured part is moved by administering medication in time for it to take effect and by supporting the injured part when it is moved. The nurse encourages movement within the limits of therapeutic immobility. The patient should perform active range-of-motion exercises of uninvolved joints, and, unless contraindicated, the nurse teaches gluteal-setting and quadriceps-setting isometric exercises to maintain the muscles needed for ambulation (see Chart 67-3). The patient who will be using assistive devices postoperatively may exercise to strengthen the upper extremities and shoulders. If the use of assistive devices (eg, crutches, walker, wheelchair) is anticipated, the nurse encourages the patient to practice with them preoperatively to facilitate their safe use and to promote earlier independent mobility.

\section*{HELPING THE PATIENT MAINTAIN SELF-ESTEEM}

Preoperatively, orthopedic patients may need assistance in accepting changes in body image, diminished self-esteem, or inability to
perform their roles and responsibilities. The degree of assistance required in this area varies greatly, depending on the events preceding hospitalization, the surgery and rehabilitation planned, and the temporary or permanent nature of the problems. The nurse promotes a trusting relationship for patients to express concerns and anxieties and helps them examine their feelings about changes in self-concept. The nurse clarifies any misconceptions patients may have and helps them work through modifications needed to adapt to alterations in physical capacity and to reestablish positive self-esteem.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: POSTOPERATIVE CARE OF THE PATIENT UNDERGOING ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY}

\section*{Assessment}

After orthopedic surgery, the nurse continues the preoperative care plan, modifying it to match the patient's current postoperative status. The nurse reassesses the patient's needs in relation to pain, neurovascular status, health promotion, mobility, and self-esteem. Skeletal trauma and surgery performed on bones, muscles, or joints can produce significant pain, especially during the first 1 or 2 postoperative days. Tissue perfusion must be monitored closely, because edema and bleeding into the tissues can compromise circulation and result in compartment syndrome. Inactivity contributes to venous stasis and the development of DVT. General anesthesia, analgesia, and immobility can result in altered functioning of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary systems.

The nurse notes the prescribed limits on mobility and assesses the patient's understanding of the mobility restrictions. The
nurse discusses the plan of care with the patient and encourages active participation in the plan.

In addition, the nurse assesses and monitors the patient for potential problems related to the surgery. Frequent assessment of vital signs, level of consciousness, neurovascular status, wound drainage, breath sounds, bowel sounds, fluid balance, and pain provides the nurse with data that may suggest the possible development of complications. The nurse reports abnormal findings to the physician promptly.

With major orthopedic surgery, there is a risk of hypovolemic shock because of blood loss. Muscle dissection frequently produces wounds in which hemostasis is poor. Wounds that are closed under tourniquet control may bleed during the postoperative period. The nurse must be alert for signs of hypovolemic shock.

Changes in the patient's pulse rate, respiratory rate, or color may indicate pulmonary or cardiovascular complications. Atelectasis and pneumonia are common and may be related to preexisting pulmonary disease, deep anesthesia, decreased activity, analgesics, and reduced respiratory reserve due to advanced age or an underlying musculoskeletal disorder (eg, restrictive lung expansion secondary to kyphosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoporosis).

Voiding in unnatural positions may contribute to urinary retention. In addition, elderly men usually have some degree of prostate enlargement and may already have difficulty voiding. Therefore, it is important to monitor urinary output.

Temperature elevations within the first 48 hours are frequently related to atelectasis or other respiratory problems. Temperature elevations during the next few days are frequently associated with urinary tract infections. Superficial wound infections take 4 to 6 days to develop. Fever from phlebitis usually occurs during the end of the first week through the second week.

Thromboembolic disease (see discussions of deep vein thrombosis in Chap. 31 and pulmonary embolism in Chap. 23) is one of the most common and most dangerous of all complications occurring in the postoperative orthopedic patient. Advanced age, venous stasis, lower extremity orthopedic surgery, and immobilization are significant risk factors. The nurse assesses the patient daily for calf swelling, tenderness, warmth, redness, and a positive Homans' sign. The nurse promptly reports abnormal findings to the physician.

In addition, fat embolus (see Chap. 69) may occur with orthopedic surgery. The nurse must be alert to changes in respiration, behavior, and level of consciousness that suggest the development of fat embolus.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on all assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses after orthopedic surgery may include the following:
- Acute pain related to the surgical procedure, swelling, and immobilization
- Risk for peripheral neurovascular dysfunction related to swelling, constricting devices, or impaired circulation
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management related to insufficient knowledge or available support and resources
- Impaired physical mobility related to pain, edema, or the presence of an immobilizing device (eg, splint, cast, or brace)
- Risk for situational low self-esteem: disturbed body image or role performance related to impact of musculoskeletal problem

COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Hypovolemic shock
- Atelectasis; pneumonia
- Urinary retention
- Infection
- Venous stasis and DVT

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient after orthopedic surgery may include relief of pain, adequate neurovascular function, health promotion, improved mobility, positive self-esteem, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

After orthopedic surgery, pain can be intense. Edema, hematomas, and muscle spasms contribute to the pain experienced. Some patients report that the pain is less than that experienced preoperatively, and only moderate amounts of analgesics are needed. The nurse closely monitors the patient's pain level and response to therapeutic measures and makes every effort to relieve the pain and discomfort.

Multiple pharmacologic approaches to pain management exist. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and epidural analgesia may be prescribed to control the pain. If intramuscular and oral analgesics are prescribed on an as-needed basis (PRN), the nurse instructs the patient to request the analgesic before the pain becomes severe. Alternatively, the nurse can offer the medication at set intervals. The nurse rotates intramuscular injection sites, avoiding the operative hip and thigh. The nurse may administer medications on a preventive basis within the prescribed intervals if the onset of pain can be predicted (eg, 30 minutes before planned activity such as transfer or exercise).

In addition to pharmacologic approaches to controlling pain, elevation of the operative extremity and application of cold, if prescribed, help to control edema and pain. Portable suction of the wound decreases fluid accumulation and hematoma formation. The nurse may find that repositioning, relaxation, distraction, and guided imagery help in reducing the patient's pain.

The nurse should report increasing and uncontrollable pain to the orthopedic surgeon for evaluation. Pain should diminish rapidly after the initial postoperative period. After 2 to 3 days, most patients require only occasional oral analgesia for residual muscle soreness and spasm.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NEUROVASCULAR FUNCTION}

The nurse continues the preoperative plan of care. The nurse monitors the neurovascular status of the involved body part and notifies the physician promptly of any indications of diminished tissue perfusion. The patient is reminded to perform musclesetting, ankle, and calf-pumping exercises hourly while awake to enhance circulation.

\section*{MAINTAINING HEALTH}

The nurse continues the preoperative plan of care. It is important to encourage the patient to participate in the postoperative treatment regimen.

A well-balanced diet with adequate protein and vitamins is needed for wound healing. The patient progresses to a regular diet as soon as possible. Large amounts of milk should not be given to orthopedic patients who are on bed rest, however, because this adds to the calcium pool in the body and requires that the kidneys excrete more calcium, which increases the risk for urinary calculi.

The nurse monitors the patient for pressure ulcers, which are a threat to any patient who must spend an extended time in bed or who is elderly, malnourished, or unable to move without assistance. Turning, washing, and drying the skin and minimizing pressure over bony prominences are necessary to avoid skin breakdown.

\section*{IMPROVING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Patients are frequently reluctant to move after orthopedic surgery. Preoperative education about the planned postoperative treatment regimen promotes patient participation in physical activities. Patients often increase their mobility once they have been reassured that movement within therapeutic limits is beneficial, that the nurse will provide assistance, and that discomfort can be controlled.

Metal pins, screws, rods, and plates used for internal fixation are designed to maintain the position of the bone until ossification occurs. They are not designed to support the body's weight, and they can bend, loosen, or break if stressed. The estimated strength of the bone, the stability of the fracture, reduction and fixation, and the amount of bone healing are important considerations in determining weight-bearing limits. Although the incision may appear healed, the underlying bone requires more time to repair and regain normal strength. Some orthopedic procedures require weight-bearing restrictions. The orthopedic surgeon will prescribe the weight-bearing limits and the use of protective devices (orthoses), if necessary, after surgery.

The physical therapist tailors the exercise program to the individual patient's needs. The goal is the patient's return to the highest level of function in the shortest time possible. Rehabilitation involves progressive increases in the patient's activities and exercises. Assistive devices (crutches, walker) may be used for postoperative mobility. Preoperative practice with assistive devices helps the patient use them postoperatively. The nurse makes sure that the patient uses these devices safely (see discussions of crutch walking and use of a walker in Chap. 11).

\section*{MAINTAINING SELF-ESTEEM}

The nurse continues the preoperative plan of care. The nurse and the patient set realistic goals. Increased self-care activities within the limits of the therapeutic regimen and resumption of roles facilitate recognition of abilities and promote self-esteem, personal identity, and role performance. Acceptance of altered body image is facilitated by support provided by the nurse, family, and others.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Hypovolemic Shock}

Excessive loss of blood during or after surgery can result in shock. The nurse monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock: increased pulse rate, decreased blood pressure, urine output less than 30 mL per hour, restlessness, change in mentation, thirst, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. The nurse reports these findings to the orthopedic surgeon and assists
in appropriate management. (See Chap. 15 for a discussion of managing shock.)

\section*{Atelectasis and Pneumonia}

The nurse monitors the patient's breath sounds and encourages deep breathing and coughing exercises. Full expansion of the lungs prevents the accumulation of pulmonary secretions and the development of atelectasis and pneumonia. Incentive spirometry, if prescribed, is encouraged. If signs of respiratory problems develop (eg, increased respiratory rate, productive cough, diminished or adventitious breath sounds, fever), the nurse reports the findings to the surgeon.

\section*{Urinary Retention}

The nurse closely monitors the patient's urinary output after surgery. The nurse encourages the patient to void every 3 to 4 hours to prevent urinary retention and bladder distention. It is important to provide privacy during toileting. Because the patient may need to void in an unusual position, the nurse assists the patient with positioning. Fracture bedpans may be more comfortable than other bedpans. Voiding in the side-lying position may be helpful to the male patient. Some male patients can void only if standing, and clarification with the surgeon of the activity prescription may be needed before the patient is assisted to a standing position. If the patient is unable to void, intermittent catheterizations may be prescribed until the patient is able to void independently. Indwelling urinary catheters are to be used only when absolutely necessary and should be removed as soon as possible.

\section*{Infection}

Infection is a risk after any surgery, but it is of particular concern for the postoperative orthopedic patient because of the high risk of osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis often requires prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics. At times, the infected bone and prosthesis or internal fixation device must be surgically removed. Therefore, prophylactic systemic antibiotics are usually prescribed during the perioperative and immediate postoperative period. The nurse assesses the patient's response to these antibiotics. When changing dressings and emptying wound drainage devices, aseptic technique is essential. The nurse monitors the patient's vital signs, incision, and drainage. The nurse monitors the patient for signs of urinary tract infection. Prompt assessment for and treatment of infection are essential.

\section*{Venous Stasis and Deep Vein Thrombosis}

Prevention of DVT requires use of ankle and calf-pumping exercises, elastic compression stockings, and sequential compression devices. Adequate hydration and early mobilization are equally important. Prophylactic warfarin, adjusted-dose heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin sodium) may be prescribed. Aspirin has no apparent effect in preventing DVT in the orthopedic patient. The nurse monitors the patient for signs of DVT and promptly reports findings to the physician for management.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching the Patient Self-Care}

The length of stay in the hospital after orthopedic surgery is usually less than 1 week. Convalescence and rehabilitation take place at home or in a nonacute care setting. The nurse teaches the patient and the family to recognize complications that must be reported promptly to the orthopedic surgeon. The patient must

understand the prescribed medication regimen. The nurse should demonstrate proper wound care. The patient gradually resumes physical activities and adheres to weight-bearing limits. The patient must be able to perform transfers and to use mobility aids safely. If the patient has a cast or other immobilizing device, family members should be instructed about how to assist the patient in a way that is safe for the patient and for the family member (eg, using proper body mechanics when lifting the patient). Specific exercises need to be taught and practiced before discharge. The nurse discusses recovery and health promotion, emphasizing a healthy lifestyle and diet.

\section*{Continuing Care}

If special equipment or home modifications are needed for safe care at home, they must be obtained before the patient is discharged home. The nurse, physical therapist, and social worker can assist the patient and family in identifying their needs and in getting ready to care for the patient at home.

Frequently, home health nursing and home physical therapy are part of the discharge plan of care. These referrals provide resources and help the patient and the family cope with the demands of care during convalescence and rehabilitation. The nurse can explore problems that the patient and family identify during the home care visit. The nurse assesses the patient's progress and monitors for possible complications. Regular medical follow-up care after discharge needs to be arranged (Chart 67-10).

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are working in the emergency department of a community hospital. Early this afternoon, an elderly patient who had fallen and broken her right forearm was treated with closed reduction and casting. She was sent home and was told she could call the emergency department if she had any questions or concerns. She has been home for about 7 hours and is calling because she is experiencing extreme pain in her hand and does not know what to do. What information do you need to assess this situation? What potential problems might she be experiencing? What advice would you give? What is the rationale for this advice?
2. You are providing postoperative care to two patients who had elective hip replacements. The 67-year-old patient had a cemented prosthesis. The 52-year-old patient had a press-fit ingrowth prosthesis. Compare and contrast the plans of care for these two patients. How would they be similar? How would they be different?
3. A 48-year-old patient with multiple trauma is placed in balanced skeletal traction to treat his midshaft femoral fracture until his condition is stable for surgical management of the fracture. Discuss the principles of managing a patient in skeletal traction and how these principles can be incorporated into this patient's plan of care. What actions can you take to minimize the effects of immobilization?
4. An 84-year-old woman had an internal fixation for her fractured hip. She complains that her elastic stockings feel tight and hot and asks you to remove them. How would you respond to this request? What is the rationale for your action? Role play your explanation of the purpose of the stockings.

$\bigwedge_{\text {usculoskeletal disorders, such as impairment of the back }}$ and spine, are leading health problems and causes of disability, particularly in people during their employment years. The limitations imposed on the patient are severe, and the economic cost, in terms of loss of productivity, medical expenses, and other costs that are not compensated, is in the billions of dollars.

\section*{Common Musculoskeletal Problems}
\section*{ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN}

The number of medical visits resulting from low back pain is second only to the number of visits for upper respiratory illnesses. Most low back pain is caused by one of many musculoskeletal problems, including acute lumbosacral strain, unstable lumbosacral ligaments and weak muscles, osteoarthritis of the spine, spinal stenosis, intervertebral disk problems, and unequal leg length.

Older patients may experience back pain associated with osteoporotic vertebral fractures or bone metastasis. Other causes include kidney disorders, pelvic problems, retroperitoneal tumors, abdominal aneurysms, and psychosomatic problems.

In addition, obesity, stress, and occasionally depression may contribute to low back pain. Back pain due to musculoskeletal disorders usually is aggravated by activity, whereas pain due to other conditions is not. Patients with chronic low back pain may develop a dependence on alcohol or analgesics in an attempt to cope with and self-treat the pain.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The spinal column can be considered as an elastic rod constructed of rigid units (vertebrae) and flexible units (intervertebral disks) held together by complex facet joints, multiple ligaments, and paravertebral muscles. Its unique construction allows for flexibility while providing maximum protection for the spinal cord. The spinal curves absorb vertical shocks from running and jumping. The trunk muscles help to stabilize the spine. The abdominal and thoracic muscles are important in lifting activities. Disuse weakens these supporting structures. Obesity, postural problems, structural problems, and overstretching of the spinal supports may result in back pain.

The intervertebral disks change in character as a person ages. A young person's disks are mainly fibrocartilage with a gelatinous matrix. As a person ages, the disks become dense, irregular fibrocartilage. Disk degeneration is a common cause of back pain. The lower lumbar disks, L4-L5 and L5-S1, are subject to the greatest mechanical stress and the greatest degenerative changes. Disk protrusion (herniated nucleus pulposus) or facet joint changes can cause pressure on nerve roots as they leave the spinal canal, which results in pain that radiates along the nerve. Management of intervertebral disk disease is discussed in Chapter 65.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient complains of either acute back pain or chronic back pain (lasting more than 3 months without improvement) and fatigue. The patient may report pain radiating down the leg, which is known as radiculopathy or sciatica and which suggests nerve root involvement. The patient's gait, spinal mobility, reflexes, leg length, leg motor strength, and sensory perception may be altered. Physical examination may disclose paravertebral muscle spasm (greatly increased muscle tone of the back postural muscles) with a loss of the normal lumbar curve and possible spinal deformity.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The Agency for Heath Care Policy and Research developed guidelines for assessment and management of acute low back pain (Bigos et al., 1994). These safe, conservative, and cost-effective guidelines have reduced the use of noneffective therapeutic interventions, including prolonged bed rest.

The initial evaluation of acute low back pain includes a focused history and physical examination, including general observation of the patient, back examination, and neurologic testing (reflexes, sensory impairment, straight-leg raising, muscle strength, and muscle atrophy). The findings suggest either nonspecific back symptoms or potentially serious problems, such as sciatica, spine fracture, cancer, infection, or rapidly progressing neurologic deficit. If the initial examination does not suggest a serious condition, no additional testing is performed during the first 4 weeks of symptoms.

The diagnostic procedures described in Chart 68-1 may be indicated for the patient with potentially serious or prolonged low back pain. The nurse prepares the patient for these studies, provides the necessary support during the testing period, and monitors the patient for any adverse responses to the procedures.

\section*{Medical Management}

Most back pain is self-limited and resolves within 4 weeks with analgesics, rest, stress reduction, and relaxation. Based on initial assessment findings, the patient is reassured that the assessment indicates that the back pain is not due to a serious condition. Management focuses on relief of pain and discomfort, activity modification, and patient education.

Nonprescription analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) are usually effective in achieving pain relief. At times, a patient may require the addition of muscle relaxants or opioids. Heat or cold therapy frequently provides temporary relief of symptoms. In the absence of symptoms of disease (radiculopathy of the roots of spinal nerves), manipulation may be helpful.

Other physical modalities have no proven efficacy in treating acute low back pain. They include traction, massage, diathermy, ultrasound, cutaneous laser treatment, biofeedback, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Likewise, acupuncture and injection procedures have no proven efficacy (Bigos et al., 1994).

Most patients need to alter their activity patterns to avoid aggravating the pain. Twisting, bending, lifting, and reaching, all of which stress the back, are avoided. The patient is taught to change position frequently. Sitting should be limited to 20 to 50 minutes based on level of comfort. Bed rest is recommended for 1 to 2 days, with a maximum of 4 days only if pain is severe. A gradual return to activities and low-stress aerobic exercise is recommended. Conditioning exercises for the trunk muscles are begun after about 2 weeks.

If there is no improvement within 1 month, additional assessments for physiologic abnormalities are performed. Management is based on findings.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse encourages the patient with low back pain to describe the discomfort (eg, location, severity, duration, characteristics, radiation, associated weakness in the legs). Descriptions of how the pain occurred-with a specific action (eg, opening a garage door) or with an activity in which weak muscles were overused (eg, weekend gardening)-and how the patient has dealt with the pain often suggest areas for intervention and patient teaching.

If back pain is a recurrent problem, information about previous successful pain control methods helps in planning current management. The nurse also asks how the back pain affects the patient's lifestyle. Information about work and recreational activities helps to identify areas for back health education. Because stress and anxiety can evoke muscle spasms and pain, the nurse needs insight into environmental variables, work situations, and family relationships. In addition, the nurse assesses the effect of chronic pain on the emotional well-being of the patient. Referral to a psychiatric nurse clinician for assessment and management of stressors contributing to the low back pain and related depression may be appropriate.

During the interview, the nurse observes the patient's posture, position changes, and gait. Often, the patient's movements are guarded, with the back kept as still as possible. The patient often selects a chair of standard seat height with arms for support. The patient may sit and stand in an unusual position, leaning away from the most painful side, and may ask for assistance when undressing for the physical examination.

On physical examination, the nurse assesses the spinal curve, any leg length discrepancy, and pelvic crest and shoulder symme-
try. The nurse palpates the paraspinal muscles and notes spasm and tenderness. When the patient is in a prone position, the paraspinal muscles relax, and any deformity caused by spasm subsides. The nurse asks the patient to bend forward and then laterally and notes any discomfort or limitations in movement. It is important to determine the effect of these limitations in movement on activities of daily living (ADLs). The nurse evaluates nerve involvement by assessing deep tendon reflexes, sensations (eg, paresthesia), and muscle strength. Back and leg pain on straight-leg raising (with the patient supine, the patient's leg is lifted upward with the knee extended) suggests nerve root involvement. Obesity can contribute to low back pain. If the patient is obese, the nurse completes a nutritional assessment.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to musculoskeletal problems
- Impaired physical mobility related to pain, muscle spasms, and decreased flexibility
- Deficient knowledge related to back-conserving techniques of body mechanics
- Risk for situational low self-esteem related to impaired mobility, chronic pain, and altered role performance
- Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements related to obesity

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of pain, improved physical mobility, use of back-conserving techniques of body mechanics, improved self-esteem, and weight reduction (Chart 68-2).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

To relieve pain, the nurse encourages the patient to reduce stress on the back muscles and to change position frequently. Patients are taught to control and modify the perceived pain through behavioral therapies that reduce muscular and psychological tension. Diaphragmatic breathing and relaxation help reduce muscle tension contributing to low back pain. Diverting the patient's attention from the pain to another activity (eg, reading, conversation, watching television) may be helpful in some instances. Guided imagery, in which the relaxed patient learns to focus on a pleasant event, may be used along with other pain-relief strategies (see Chart 68-2).

If medication is prescribed, the nurse assesses the patient's response to each medication. As the acute pain subsides, medications are reduced as prescribed. Self-applied intermittent heat or cold may reduce the pain. The nurse evaluates and notes the patient's response to various pain management modalities.

\section*{IMPROVING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Physical mobility is monitored through continuing assessments. The nurse assesses how the patient moves and stands. As the back pain subsides, self-care activities are resumed with minimal strain on the injured structures. Position changes should be made slowly and carried out with assistance as required. Twisting and jarring motions are avoided. The nurse encourages the patient to alter-

\section*{Strategies for the Patient With Low Back Pain}

Discuss the following strategies with the patient:
Pain Management
- Limit bed rest; keep knees flexed to decrease strain on back
- Nonpharmacologic approaches: distraction, relaxation, imagery, thermal interventions (eg, ice or heat), stress reduction
- Pharmacologic approaches: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, muscle relaxants
Exercise
- Stretch to enhance flexibility, do strengthening exercises
- Perform prescribed back exercises to increase function, emphasizing gradual increases in time and repetitions
Body Mechanics
- Practice good posture
- Avoid twisting body
- Push objects rather than pull them
- Keep load close to body when lifting
- Bend knees and tighten abdominal muscles when lifting
- Avoid overreaching
- Use wide base of support
- Use back brace to protect back

\section*{Work Modifications}
- Adjust work area to avoid stress on back
- Adjust height of chair or work table
- Use lumbar support in chair
- Avoid prolonged standing and repetitive tasks
- Avoid bending, twisting, and lifting heavy objects
- Avoid work involving continuous vibrations

\section*{Stress Reduction}
- Discuss with patient the interdependence of stress and anxiety on muscle tension and pain
- Explore effective coping mechanisms
- Teach stress reduction techniques
- Refer patient to back clinic
nate lying, sitting, and walking activities frequently and advises the patient to avoid sitting, standing, or walking for long periods. The patient may find that sitting in a chair with arm rests to support some of the body weight and a soft support at the small of the back provides comfort.

With severe pain, the patient limits activity for 1 to 2 days. Extended periods of inactivity are not effective and result in deconditioning. The patient rests in bed on a firm, nonsagging mattress (a bed board may be used). Lumbar flexion is increased by elevating the head and thorax 30 degrees using pillows or a foam wedge and slightly flexing the knees supported on a pillow. Alternatively, the patient assumes a lateral position with knees and hips flexed (curled position) with a pillow between the knees and legs and a pillow supporting the head (Fig. 68-1). A prone position is avoided because it accentuates lordosis. The nurse instructs the patient to get out of bed by rolling to one side and placing the legs down while pushing the torso up, keeping the back straight.

As the patient achieves comfort, activities are gradually resumed, and an exercise program is initiated. Initially, low-stress aerobic exercises, such as short walks or swimming, are suggested. After 2 weeks, conditioning exercises for the abdominal and trunk

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}
muscles are started. The physical therapist designs an exercise program for the individual patient to reduce lordosis, increase flexibility, and reduce strain on the back. It may include hyperextension exercises to strengthen the paravertebral muscles, flexion exercises to increase back movement and strength, and isometric flexion exercises to strengthen trunk muscles. Each exercise period begins with relaxation. Exercise begins gradually and increases as the patient recovers.

The nurse encourages the patient to adhere to the prescribed exercise program. Erratic exercising is ineffective. For most exercise programs, it is suggested that the person exercise twice a day, increasing the number of exercises gradually. Some patients may find it difficult to adhere to a program of prescribed exercises for a long period. These patients are encouraged to improve their posture, use good body mechanics on a regular basis, and engage in regular exercise activities (eg, walking, swimming) to maintain a healthy back. Activities should not cause excessive lumbar strain, twisting, or discomfort; for example, activities such as horseback riding and weight-lifting are avoided.

\section*{USING PROPER BODY MECHANICS}

Good body mechanics and posture are essential to avoid recurrence of back pain. The patient must be taught how to stand, sit, lie, and lift properly (Figs. 68-2 and 68-3). Providing the patient with a list of suggestions helps in making these long-term changes (Chart 68-3). The patient who wears high heels is encouraged to change to low heels. The patient who is required to stand for long periods should shift weight frequently and should rest one foot on a low stool, which decreases lumbar lordosis. The proper posture can be verified by looking in a mirror to see whether the chest is up and the abdomen is tucked in. Locking the knees when standing is avoided, as is bending forward for long periods.

When the patient is sitting, the knees and hips should be flexed, and the knees should be level with the hips or higher to minimize lordosis. The feet should be flat on the floor. The back needs to be supported. The patient should sleep on the side with knees and hips flexed, or supine with knees supported in a flexed position. Sleeping prone should be avoided.

\section*{Purpose}

Low back pain is a common job-related injury. Nurse practitioners managing industrial injuries in primary health care clinics need to design treatment protocols that are effective for the employee and contain costs for the employer.

This study compared the average number of days absent from work for patients treated with various protocols. The conservative treatment consisted of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, and rest. The active physical rehabilitation treatment consisted of NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and referral to an exercise physiologist for muscle strength and range of motion exercise, including ice, electrical stimulation, and/or exercise therapy.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Two primary health care clinics located in different regions of the United States were used. One clinic used a conservative treatment protocol; the other used the active physical rehabilitation protocol. Charts of patients with the appropriate diagnostic code (ie, low-back strain) were reviewed for inclusion criteria (eg, adult age, first-time work-related injury of the back).

The convenience sample consisted of two groups of patients ( 18 patients in each group). The ages and gender distributions in the two groups were similar. The mean number of days off from work was cal-
culated for each of the two treatment groups and compared using the $t$ test for independent groups to answer the research question: Do patients with a clinical diagnosis of low back pain differ in their responses to two sets of treatment protocols as measured by number of days absent from work?

\section*{Findings}

The mean number of days absent from work was 13.3 days for the conservative treatment group and 4.5 days for the active physical rehabilitation group. This was a statistically significant difference ( $p<.01$ ), suggesting active physical rehabilitation is the superior protocol. However, employer costs, including monetary outlay for exercise therapy and loss of productivity due to number of days off from work, were not considered in this study.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings suggest that active physical rehabilitation may be more effective than conservative treatment; however, additional studies are needed to replicate the findings and should include a cost-benefit analysis and random assignment of subjects.

Prevention of back injury is a primary concern of employee health nurses. Additional studies are warranted to determine effectiveness of health promotion programs before back injury occurs.

\end{figure}

The nurse instructs the patient in the safe and correct way to lift objects-using the strong quadriceps muscles of the thighs, with minimal use of weak back muscles. With feet placed to provide a wide base of support, the patient should bend the knees, tighten the abdominal muscles, and lift the object close to the body with a smooth motion, avoiding twisting and jerking. To prevent recurrence of acute low back pain, the nurse may instruct the patient to wear a back support when repeated lifting is required and to avoid lifting more than one third of his or her weight without help.

It takes about 6 months for a person to readjust postural habits. Practicing these protective and defensive postures, positions, and body mechanics results in natural strengthening of the back and diminishes the chance that back pain will recur.

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-ESTEEM}

Because of the immobility associated with low back pain, the patient may depend on others to do various tasks. Dependency may continue beyond physiologic needs and become a way to fulfill psychosocial needs. Assisting both the patient and support people to recognize continued dependency helps the patient identify and cope with the underlying reason for the dependency.

Role-related responsibilities may have been modified with the onset of low back pain. As recovery from acute low back pain and immobility progresses, the patient may resume former rolerelated responsibilities.

If these activities contributed to the development of low back pain, however, it may be difficult to resume them without chronic low back pain syndrome, with associated disability and depression resulting. If the patient experiences secondary gains associ-

ated with low back disability (eg, worker's compensation, easier lifestyle or workload, increased emotional support), a "low back neurosis" may develop. The patient may need help in coping with specific stressors and in learning how to control stressful situations. When people successfully deal with stress, they develop confidence in their abilities to manage other stressful situations. Psychotherapy or counseling may be needed to assist the person in resuming a full, productive life. Back clinics use multidisciplinary approaches to help the patient with pain and with resumption of role-related responsibilities.

\section*{MODIFYING NUTRITION FOR WEIGHT REDUCTION}

Obesity contributes to back strain by stressing the relatively weak back muscles. Exercises are less effective and more difficult to perform when the patient is overweight. Weight reduction through diet modification may prevent recurrence of back pain. Weight reduction is based on a sound nutritional plan that includes a change in eating habits to maintain desirable weight. Monitoring weight reduction, noting achievement, and providing encouragement and positive reinforcement facilitate adherence. Frequently, back problems resolve as normal weight is achieved.

\section*{Chart 68-3 \\ Health Promotion - Activities to Promote a Healthy Back}

\section*{Standing}
- Avoid prolonged standing and walking.
- When standing for any length of time, rest one foot on a small stool or box to relieve lumbar lordosis.
- Avoid forward flexion work positions.
- Avoid high heels.

Sitting
- Avoid sitting for prolonged periods.
- Sit in a straight-back chair with back well supported and arm rests to support some of the body weight; use a footstool to position knees higher than hips if necessary.
- Eradicate the hollow of the back by sitting with the buttocks "tucked under."
- Maintain back support; use a soft support at the small of the back.
- Avoid knee and hip extension. When driving a car, have the seat pushed forward as far as possible for comfort.
- Guard against extension strains-reaching, pushing, sitting with legs straight out.
- Alternate periods of sitting with walking.

Lying
- Rest at intervals; fatigue contributes to spasm of the back muscles.
- Place a firm bed board under the mattress.
- Avoid sleeping in a prone position.
- When lying on the side, place a pillow under the head and one between the legs, with the legs flexed at the hips and knees.
- When supine, use a pillow under the knees to decrease lordosis.

Lifting
- When lifting, keep the back straight and hold the load as close to the body as possible.
- Lift with the large leg muscles, not the back muscles.
- Use trunk muscles to stabilize the spine.
- Squat while keeping the back straight when it is necessary to pick something off the floor.
- Avoid twisting the trunk of the body, lifting above waist level, and reaching up for any length of time.

\section*{Exercising}
- Daily exercise is important in the prevention of back problems.
- Walking and gradually increasing the distance and pace of walking is recommended.
- Perform prescribed back exercises twice daily, increasing exercise gradually.
- Avoid jumping and jarring activities.

\section*{Common Problems of the Upper Extremity}

The structures in the upper extremity are frequently the sites of painful syndromes. The structures most frequently affected are the shoulder, wrist, and hand.

\section*{BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS}

Bursitis and tendinitis are inflammatory conditions that commonly occur in the shoulder. Bursae are fluid-filled sacs that prevent friction between joint structures during joint activity. When inflamed, they are painful. Similarly, muscle tendon sheaths become inflamed with repetitive stretching. The inflammation causes proliferation of synovial membrane and pannus formation, which restricts joint movement. Conservative treatment includes rest of the extremity, intermittent ice and heat to the joint, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control the inflammation and pain. Arthroscopic synovectomy may be considered if shoulder pain and weakness persist.

\section*{LOOSE BODIES}

Loose bodies may occur in a joint as a result of articular cartilage wear and bone erosion. These fragments interfere with joint movement, locking the joint, and cause painful movement. Loose bodies are removed by arthroscopic surgery.

\section*{IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME}

Overuse (microtrauma) may produce an impingement syndrome in the shoulder. The supraspinatus and biceps tendons become irritated and edematous and press against the acromion process,
limiting shoulder motion. The patient experiences pain, shoulder tenderness, limited movement, muscle spasm, and atrophy. The process may progress to a rotator cuff tear. Conservative treatment includes rest, NSAIDs, joint injections, and physical therapy (Chart 68-4). Arthroscopic débridement is used for persistent pain. Gentle joint motion is begun after surgery. (See Chapter 69 for a discussion of rotator cuff injury.)

\section*{CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME}

Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy that occurs when the median nerve at the wrist is compressed by a thickened flexor tendon sheath, skeletal encroachment, edema, or a soft tissue mass. The syndrome is commonly caused by repetitive hand activities but may be associated with arthritis, hypothyroidism, or pregnancy. The patient experiences pain, numbness, paresthesia, and possibly weakness along the median nerve (thumb and first two fingers). Tinel's sign may be used to help identify carpal tunnel syndrome (Fig. 68-4). Night pain is common. Treatment is based on cause. Rest splints to prevent hyperextension and prolonged flexion of the wrist, avoidance of repetitive flexion of the wrist (eg, use of ergonomic changes at work to reduce wrist strain), NSAIDs, and carpal canal cortisone injections may relieve the symptoms. Specific yoga postures, relaxation, and acupuncture may provide nontraditional alternatives to relieve carpal tunnel symptoms. Traditional or endoscopic laser surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament may be necessary. The patient wears a hand splint after surgery and limits hand use during healing. The patient may need assistance with personal care and ADLs. Full recovery of motor and sensory function after nerve release surgery may take several weeks or months.

\section*{GANGLION}

A ganglion, a collection of gelatinous material near the tendon sheaths and joints, appears as a round, firm, cystic swelling, usually on the dorsum of the wrist. It most frequently occurs in women younger than 50 years of age. The ganglion is locally tender and may cause an aching pain. When a tendon sheath is in-

\section*{Chart 68-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION Measures to Promote Shoulder Healing}

The nurse provides guidelines for general care and instructs the patient in carrying out measures that will promote shoulder healing. Patient education includes the following points:
- During the acute phase, rest the joint in a position that minimizes stress on the joint structures, to prevent further damage and the development of adhesions.
- Support the affected arm on pillows while sleeping, to keep from turning onto the shoulder.
- For the first 24 to 48 hours of the acute phase, apply cold to reduce swelling and discomfort; then, according to the treatment plan, apply heat intermittently to promote circulation and healing.
- Gradually resume motion and use of the joint. Assistance with dressing and other activities of daily living may be needed.
- Avoid working and lifting above shoulder level or pushing an object against a "locked" shoulder.
- Perform the prescribed daily range-of-motion and strengthening exercises.

volved, weakness of the finger occurs. Treatment may include aspiration, corticosteroid injection, or surgical excision. After treatment, a compression dressing and immobilization splint are used.

\section*{DUPUYTREN'S CONTRACTURE}

Dupuytren's deformity is a slowly progressive contracture of the palmar fascia, which causes flexion of the fourth and fifth fingers, and frequently the middle finger. This renders the fingers more or less useless (Fig. 68-5). It is caused by an inherited autosomal dominant trait and occurs most frequently in men who are older than 50 years of age and who are of Scandinavian or Celtic origin. It is also associated with arthritis, diabetes, gout, and alcoholism. It starts as a nodule of the palmar fascia. The nodule may not change, or it may progress so that the fibrous thickening extends to involve the skin in the distal palm and produces a contracture of the fingers. The patient may experience dull aching discomfort, morning numbness, cramping, and stiffness in the affected fingers. This condition starts in one hand, but eventually both hands are affected symmetrically. Initially, fingerstretching exercises may prevent contractures. With contracture development, palmar and digital fasciectomies are performed to improve function. Finger exercises are begun on postoperative day 1 or 2 .

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING SURGERY OF THE HAND OR WRIST}

\section*{Assessment}

Surgery of the hand or wrist, unless related to major trauma, is generally an ambulatory surgery procedure. Before surgery, the nurse assesses the patient's level and type of discomfort and limitations in function caused by the ganglion, carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's contracture, or other condition of the hand.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses for the patient undergoing surgery of the hand or wrist may include the following:
- Risk for peripheral neurovascular dysfunction related to surgical procedure
- Acute pain related to inflammation and swelling
- Self-care deficit: bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, feeding, and/or toileting related to bandaged hands
- Risk for infection related to surgical procedure

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals of the patient may include relief of pain, improved selfcare, and absence of infection.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING NEUROVASCULAR FUNCTION}

Neurovascular assessment of the exposed fingers every hour for the first 24 hours is essential for monitoring function of the nerves and perfusion of the hand. The nurse compares the affected hand with the unaffected hand and the postoperative status with the documented preoperative status. The nurse asks the patient to describe the sensations in the hands and to demonstrate finger mobility. With tendon repairs and nerve, vascular, or skin grafts, motor function is tested only if prescribed. The nurse assesses the temperature of the affected hand. Dressings are to be supportive but nonconstrictive. Pain uncontrolled by analgesics suggests compromised neurovascular functioning.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Pain may be related to surgery, edema, hematoma formation, or restrictive bandages. To control swelling that may increase the patient's pain and discomfort, the nurse elevates the hand to heart level with pillows. When higher elevation is prescribed, an elevating sling may be attached to a pole used in intravenous (IV) therapies or to an overhead frame. If the patient is ambulatory, the arm is elevated in a conventional sling with the hand at heart level.

Intermittent ice packs to the surgical area during the first 24 to 48 hours may be prescribed to control swelling. Unless contraindicated, active extension and flexion of the fingers to promote circulation are encouraged, even though movement is limited by the bulky dressing.

Generally, the pain and discomfort can be controlled by oral analgesics. The nurse evaluates the patient's response to analgesics and to other pain-control measures. Patient education concerning analgesics is important.

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-CARE}

During the first few days after surgery, the patient needs assistance with ADLs because one hand is bandaged and independent self-care is impaired. The patient may need to arrange for assistance with feeding, bathing and hygiene, dressing, grooming, and toileting. Within a few days, the patient develops skills in onehanded ADLs and is usually able to function with minimal assistance and use of assistive devices. The nurse encourages use of the involved hand, unless contraindicated, within the limits of discomfort. As rehabilitation progresses, the patient resumes use of the injured hand. Physical or occupational therapy-directed exercises may be prescribed. The nurse emphasizes adherence to the therapeutic regimen.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

As with all surgery, there is a risk for infection. The nurse teaches the patient to monitor temperature and signs and symptoms that suggest an infection. It also is important to instruct the patient to keep the dressing clean and dry and to report any drainage, foul odor, or increased pain and swelling. Patient education includes aseptic wound care as well as education related to prescribed prophylactic antibiotics.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

After the patient has undergone hand surgery, the nurse teaches the patient how to monitor neurovascular status and the signs of complications that need to be reported to the surgeon (eg, paresthesia, paralysis, uncontrolled pain, coolness of fingers, extreme swelling, excessive bleeding, purulent drainage, fever). The nurse discusses prescribed medications with the patient. In addition, the nurse teaches the patient to elevate the hand above the elbow and to apply ice (if prescribed) to control swelling. Unless contraindicated, the nurse encourages extension and flexion exercises of the fingers to promote circulation. The use of assistive devices is encouraged if they would be helpful in promoting accomplishment of ADLs. For bathing, the nurse instructs the patient to keep the dressing dry by covering it with a secured plastic bag. Generally, the wound is not redressed until the patient's followup visit with the surgeon (Chart 68-5).

\section*{Common Foot Problems}

Disabilities of the foot are commonly caused by poorly fitting shoes. Fashion, vanity, and eye appeal, rather than function and physiology of the foot, are the determining factors in the design of footwear. Ill-fitting shoes distort normal anatomy while inducing deformity and pain.

Several systemic diseases affect the feet. Patients with diabetes are prone to develop corns and peripheral neuropathies with diminishing sensation, leading to ulcers at pressure points of the foot. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and arteriosclerosis complain of burning and itching feet resulting in scratching and skin breakdown. Foot deformities may occur with rheumatoid arthritis. Dermatology problems commonly affect the feet in the form of fungal infections and plantar warts.

The discomforts of foot strain are treated with rest, elevation, physiotherapy, supportive strappings, and orthotic devices. The patient must inspect the foot and skin under pads and orthotic devices for pressure and skin breakdown daily. If a "window" is cut into shoes to relieve pressure over a bony deformity, the skin must be monitored daily for breakdown from pressure exerted at the "window" area. Active foot exercises promote the circulation and help strengthen the feet. Walking in properly fitting shoes is considered the ideal exercise.

\section*{PLANTAR FASCIITIS}

Plantar fasciitis, an inflammation of the foot-supporting fascia, presents as an acute onset of heel pain experienced with the first steps in the morning. The pain is localized to the anterior medial aspect of the heel and diminishes with gentle stretching of the foot and Achilles tendon. Management includes stretching exercises, wearing shoes with support and cushioning to relieve pain, orthotic devices (eg, heel cups, arch supports), and NSAIDs. Unresolved plantar fasciitis may progress to fascial tears at the heel and eventual development of heel spurs.

\section*{CORN}

A corn is an area of hyperkeratosis (overgrowth of a horny layer of epidermis) produced by internal pressure (the underlying bone is prominent because of congenital or acquired abnormality, commonly arthritis) or external pressure (ill-fitting shoes). The fifth toe is most frequently involved, but any toe may be involved.

Corns are treated by soaking and scraping off the horny layer by a podiatrist, by application of a protective shield or pad, or by surgical modification of the underlying offending osseous structure. Soft corns are located between the toes and are kept soft by moisture. Treatment consists of drying the affected spaces and separating the affected toes with lamb's wool or gauze. A wider shoe may be helpful. Usually, a podiatrist is needed to treat the underlying cause.

\section*{CALLUS}

A callus is a discretely thickened area of the skin that has been exposed to persistent pressure or friction. Faulty foot mechanics usually precede the formation of a callus. Treatment consists of eliminating the underlying causes and having the callus treated by a podiatrist if it is painful. A keratolytic ointment may be applied and a thin plastic cup worn over the heel if the callus is on this area. Felt padding with adhesive backing is also used to prevent and relieve pressure. Orthotic devices can be made to remove the pressure from bony protuberances, or the protuberance may be excised.

\section*{INGROWN TOENAIL}

An ingrown toenail (onychocryptosis) is a condition in which the free edge of a nail plate penetrates the surrounding skin, either laterally or anteriorly. A secondary infection or granulation tissue may develop. This painful condition is caused by improper selftreatment, external pressure (tight shoes or stockings), internal pressure (deformed toes, growth under the nail), trauma, or infection. Trimming the nails properly (clipping them straight across and filing the corners consistent with the contour of the toe) can prevent this problem. Active treatment consists of washing the foot twice a day, followed by the application of a local antibiotic ointment, and relieving the pain by decreasing the pressure of the nail plate on the surrounding soft tissue. Warm, wet soaks help to drain an infection. A toenail may need to be excised by the podiatrist if there is severe infection.

\section*{HAMMER TOE}

Hammer toe is a flexion deformity of the interphalangeal joint, which may involve several toes (Fig. 68-6). The condition is usually an acquired deformity. Tight socks or shoes may push an

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-050.jpg?height=1376&width=864&top_left_y=200&top_left_x=1113}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 68-6 Common foot deformities (A) Hammer toe, (B) Pes cavus (clawfoot), (C) Bunion (hallux valgus), (D) Site for Morton's neuroma.}
\end{figure}
overlying toe back into the line of the other toes. The toes usually are pulled upward, forcing the metatarsal joints (ball of the foot) downward. Corns develop on top of the toes, and tender calluses develop under the metatarsal area. The treatment consists of conservative measures: wearing open-toed sandals or shoes that conform to the shape of the foot, carrying out manipulative exercises, and protecting the protruding joints with pads. Surgical correction (osteotomy) is necessary for an established deformity.

\section*{HALLUX VALGUS}

Hallux valgus (commonly called a bunion) is a deformity in which the great toe deviates laterally (see Fig. 68-6). Associated with this is a marked prominence of the medial aspect of the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint. There is also osseous enlargement (exostosis) of the medial side of the first metatarsal head, over which a bursa may form (secondary to pressure and inflammation). Acute bursitis symptoms include a reddened area, edema, and tenderness.

Factors contributing to bunion formation include heredity, ill-fitting shoes, and gradual lengthening and widening of the foot associated with aging. Osteoarthritis is frequently associated
with hallux valgus. Treatment depends on the patient's age, the degree of deformity, and the severity of symptoms. If a bunion deformity is uncomplicated, wearing a shoe that conforms to the shape of the foot or that is molded to the foot to prevent pressure on the protruding portions may be all the treatment that is needed. Corticosteroid injections control acute inflammation. Surgical removal of the bunion (exostosis) and osteotomies to realign the toe may be required to improve function and appearance. Complications related to bunionectomy include limited range of motion, paresthesias, tendon injury, and recurrence of deformity.

Postoperatively, the patient may have intense throbbing pain at the operative site, requiring liberal doses of analgesic medication. The foot is elevated to the level of the heart to decrease edema and pain. The neurovascular status of the toes is assessed. The duration of immobility and initiation of ambulation depend on the procedure used. Toe flexion and extension exercises are initiated to facilitate walking. Shoes that fit the shape and size of the foot are recommended.

\section*{PES CAVUS}

Pes cavus (clawfoot) refers to a foot with an abnormally high arch and a fixed equinus deformity of the forefoot (see Fig. 68-6). The shortening of the foot and increased pressure produce calluses on the metatarsal area and on the dorsum (bottom) of the foot. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (a peripheral neuromuscular disease associated with a familial degenerative disorder), diabetes mellitus, and tertiary syphilis are common causes of pes cavus. Exercises are prescribed to manipulate the forefoot into dorsiflexion and relax the toes. Bracing to protect the foot may be used. In severe cases, arthrodesis (fusion) is performed to reshape and stabilize the foot.

\section*{MORTON'S NEUROMA}

Morton's neuroma (plantar digital neuroma, neurofibroma) is a swelling of the third (lateral) branch of the median plantar nerve (see Fig. 68-6). The third digital nerve, which is located in the third intermetatarsal (web) space, is most commonly involved. Microscopically, digital artery changes cause an ischemia of the nerve.

The result is a throbbing, burning pain in the foot that is usually relieved when the patient rests. Conservative treatment consists of inserting innersoles and metatarsal pads designed to spread the metatarsal heads and balance the foot posture. Local injections of hydrocortisone and a local anesthetic may provide relief. If these fail, surgical excision of the neuroma is necessary. Pain relief and loss of sensation are immediate and permanent.

\section*{FLATF00T}

Flatfoot (pes planus) is a common disorder in which the longitudinal arch of the foot is diminished. It may be caused by congenital abnormalities or associated with bone or ligament injury, muscle and posture imbalances, excessive weight, muscle fatigue, poorly fitting shoes, or arthritis. Symptoms include a burning sensation, fatigue, clumsy gait, edema, and pain.

Exercises to strengthen the muscles and to improve posture and walking habits are helpful. A number of foot orthoses are available to give the foot additional support. Orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists treat severe flatfoot problems.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING FOOT SURGERY}

\section*{Assessment}

Surgery of the foot may be necessary because of various conditions, including neuromas and foot deformities (bunion, hammer toe, clawfoot). Generally, foot surgery is performed on an outpatient basis. Before surgery, the nurse assesses the patient's ambulatory ability and balance and the neurovascular status of the foot. Additionally, the nurse considers the availability of assistance at home and the structural characteristics of the home in planning for care during the first few days after surgery. The nurse uses these data, in addition to knowledge of the usual medical management of the condition, to formulate appropriate nursing diagnoses.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses for the patient undergoing foot surgery may include the following:
- Risk for ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion: related to swelling
- Acute pain related to surgery, inflammation, and swelling
- Impaired physical mobility related to the foot-immobilizing device
- Risk for infection related to the surgical procedure/surgical incision

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include adequate tissue perfusion, relief of pain, improved mobility, and absence of infection.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING TISSUE PERFUSION}

Neurovascular assessment of the exposed toes every 1 to 2 hours for the first 24 hours is essential to monitor the function of the nerves and the perfusion of the tissues. If the patient is discharged within several hours after the surgery, the nurse teaches the patient and family how to assess for swelling and neurovascular status (circulation, motion, sensation). Compromised neurovascular function can increase the patient's pain. See Chart 66-3 in Chapter 66.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Pain experienced by patients who undergo foot surgery is related to inflammation and edema. Formation of a hematoma may contribute to the discomfort. To control the swelling, the foot should be elevated on several pillows when the patient is sitting or lying. Intermittent ice packs applied to the surgical area during the first 24 to 48 hours may be prescribed to control swelling and provide some pain relief. As activity increases, the patient may find that dependent positioning of the foot is uncomfortable. Simply elevating the foot often relieves the discomfort. Oral analgesics may be used to control the pain. The nurse instructs the patient and family about appropriate use of these medications.

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

After surgery, the patient will have a bulky dressing on the foot, protected by a light cast or a special protective boot. Limits for
weight bearing on the foot will be prescribed by the surgeon. Some patients are allowed to walk on the heel and progress to weight-bearing as tolerated; other patients are restricted to non-weight-bearing activities. Assistive devices (eg, crutches, walker) may be needed. The choice of the devices depends on the patient's general condition and balance and on the weight-bearing prescription. Safe use of the assistive devices must be ensured through adequate patient education and practice before discharge. Strategies to move around the house safely while using assistive devices are discussed with the patient. As healing progresses, the patient gradually resumes ambulation within prescribed limits. The nurse emphasizes adherence to the therapeutic regimen.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Any surgery carries a risk for infection. In addition, percutaneous pins may be used to hold bones in position, and these pins serve as potential sites for infection. Because the foot is on or near the floor, care must be taken to protect it from dirt and moisture. When bathing, the patient can secure a plastic bag over the dressing to prevent it from getting wet. Patient instruction concerning aseptic wound care and pin care may be necessary.

The nurse teaches the patient to monitor for temperature and infection. Drainage on the dressing, foul odor, or increased pain and swelling could indicate infection. The nurse instructs the patient to promptly report any of these findings to the physician. If prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed, the nurse provides instruction about their correct use.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse plans patient teaching for home care, focusing on neurovascular status, pain management, mobility, and wound care (Chart 68-6).

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}

Osteoporosis is a disease that threatens more than 28 million Americans (National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2000). Characteristics of osteoporosis include a reduction of bone density and a change in bone structure, both of which increase susceptibility to fracture. The normal homeostatic bone turnover is altered: the rate of bone resorption is greater than the rate of bone formation, resulting in a reduced total bone mass. Suboptimal bone mass development in children and teens contributes to the development of osteoporosis. With osteoporosis, the bones become progressively porous, brittle, and fragile; they fracture easily under stresses that would not break normal bone. Osteoporosis frequently results in compression fractures (Fig. 68-7) of the thoracic and lumbar spine, fractures of the neck and intertrochanteric region of the femur, and Colles' fractures of the wrist. The probability that a 50-year-old Caucasian woman will experience a hip fracture during her lifetime is $14 \%$; for a Caucasian man, it is $5 \%$ to $6 \%$. The risk for African Americans is lower-6\% for women and 3\% for men (NIH Consensus Statement, 2000). Multiple compression fractures of the vertebrae result in skeletal deformity. Osteoporosis is a costly disorder not only in terms of health care dollars but also in terms of human suffering, pain, disability, and death.

The gradual collapse of a vertebra may be asymptomatic; it is observed as progressive kyphosis. With the development of kyphosis ("dowager's hump"), there is an associated loss of height (Fig. 68-8). Frequently, postmenopausal women lose height from vertebral collapse. The postural changes result in relaxation of the abdominal muscles and a protruding abdomen. The deformity may also produce pulmonary insufficiency. Many patients complain of fatigue.

\section*{Prevention}

Primary osteoporosis occurs in women after menopause and later in life in men, but it is not merely a consequence of aging. Failure to develop optimal peak bone mass during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood contributes to the development of osteoporosis without resultant bone loss. Early identification of at-risk teenagers and young adults, increased calcium intake, participation in regular weight-bearing exercise, and modification of lifestyle (eg, reduced use of caffeine, cigarettes, and alcohol) are interventions that decrease the risk for development of osteoporosis, fractures, and associated disability later in life. Secondary osteoporosis is the result of medications or other conditions and diseases that affect bone metabolism. Specific disease states (eg, celiac disease, hypogonadism) and medications (eg, corticosteroids, antiseizure medications) that place patients at risk need to be identified and therapies instituted to reverse the development of osteoporosis.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The prevalence of osteoporosis in women older than 80 years of age is $84 \%$ (Genant et al., 1997). The average 75 -year-old woman has lost $25 \%$ of her cortical bone and $40 \%$ of her trabecular bone. With the aging of the population, the incidence of fractures (more than 1.5 million fractures per year), pain, and disability associated with osteoporosis is rising. The mortality rate 1 year after hip fracture is $20 \%$. Two-thirds of patients with hip fracture never regain their prefracture level of functioning (NIH Consensus Statement, 2000).

Elderly people absorb dietary calcium less efficiently and excrete it more readily through their kidneys; therefore, postmenopausal women and the elderly actually need to consume liberal amounts of calcium. As much as 1500 mg daily for postmenopausal women may be prescribed. Most residents of longterm care facilities have a low bone mineral density (BMD) and are at risk for fracture. Hip protectors have been found to reduce

\end{figure}
the incidence of hip fracture in the elderly; however, compliance in wearing these hip protectors is low (Kannus et al., 2000).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Normal bone remodeling in the adult results in gradually increased bone mass until the early 30s. Gender, race, genetics, aging, low body weight and body mass index, nutrition, lifestyle choices (eg, smoking, caffeine and alcohol consumption), and physical activity influence peak bone mass and the development of osteoporosis (Fig. 68-9). Although the consequences of osteoporosis (eg, fractures) occur with aging, osteoporosis is not a disease of the elderly. Rather, its onset occurs earlier in life, when bone mass peaks and then begins to decline.

Loss of bone mass is a universal phenomenon associated with aging. Age-related loss begins soon after the peak bone mass is achieved (ie, in the fourth decade). Calcitonin, which inhibits bone resorption and promotes bone formation, is decreased. Estrogen, which inhibits bone breakdown, decreases with aging. On the other hand, parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases with aging, increasing bone turnover and resorption. The consequence of these changes is net loss of bone mass over time.

The withdrawal of estrogens at menopause or with oophorectomy causes an accelerated bone resorption that continues during the postmenopausal years. Women develop osteoporosis more frequently and more extensively than men because of lower peak bone mass and the effect of estrogen loss during menopause. More than half of all women older than 45 years of age show evidence of osteopenia. World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic categories for osteoporosis are based on BMD scan findings (Walker-Bone et al., 2001).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 68-9 Pathophysiology of osteoporosis.}
\end{figure}

Secondary osteoporosis is associated with many disease states, nutritional deficiencies, and medications. Coexisting medical conditions (eg, malabsorption syndromes, lactose intolerance, alcohol abuse, renal failure, liver failure, Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, and hyperparathyroidism) contribute to bone loss and the development of osteoporosis. Medications (eg, corticosteroids, antiseizure medications, heparin, tetracycline, aluminumcontaining antacids, and thyroid supplements) affect the body's use and metabolism of calcium. The degree of osteoporosis is related to the duration of medication therapy. When the therapy is discontinued or the metabolic problem is corrected, the progression of osteoporosis is halted, but restoration of lost bone mass usually does not occur.

\section*{Risk Factors}

Small-framed, nonobese Caucasian women are at greatest risk for osteoporosis. Also, Asian women of slight build are at risk for low peak BMD. African American women, who have a greater bone mass than Caucasian women, are less susceptible to osteoporosis. Men have a greater peak bone mass and do not experience sud-
den estrogen reduction. As a result, osteoporosis occurs in men at a lower rate and at an older age (about one decade later). However, it has been determined that testosterone and estrogen are important in achieving and maintaining bone mass in men.

Nutritional factors contribute to the development of osteoporosis. A balanced diet-including adequate calories and nutrients needed to maintain bone, calcium, and vitamin D-must be consumed. Vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption and for normal bone mineralization. Dietary calcium and vitamin D must be adequate to maintain bone remodeling and body functions. The best source of calcium and vitamin D is fortified milk. A cup of milk or calcium-fortified orange juice contains about 300 mg of calcium.

The recommended adequate intake (AI) level of calcium for the age range of puberty through young adulthood ( 9 to 19 years of age) is 1300 mg per day. The goal of this daily level of calcium is to maximize peak bone mass. The AI level for adults 19 to 50 years of age is 1000 mg per day, and the AI level for adults 51 years and older is 1200 mg per day. The actual estimated average daily intake is 300 to 500 mg . The recommended adult vita$\min \mathrm{D}$ intake is 400 to 600 IU per day. Inadequate intake of calcium or vitamin D over a period of years results in decreased bone mass and the development of osteoporosis.

Bone formation is enhanced by the stress of weight and muscle activity. Resistance and impact exercises are most beneficial in developing and maintaining bone mass. Immobility contributes to the development of osteoporosis. When immobilized by casts, general inactivity, paralysis or other disability, the bone is resorbed faster than it is formed, and osteoporosis results. Risk factors for osteoporosis are summarized in Chart 68-7.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Osteoporosis may be identified on routine x-rays when there has been $25 \%$ to $40 \%$ demineralization. There is radiolucency to the bones. When the vertebrae collapse, the thoracic vertebrae become

wedge-shaped and the lumbar vertebrae become biconcave. Osteoporosis is diagnosed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which provides information about BMD at the spine and hip. The DEXA scan data are analyzed and reported as T-scores (the number of standard deviations [SD] above or below the average BMD value for a young, healthy Caucasian woman). A normal BMD is less than 1 SD below the young adult mean value. The WHO defines osteoporosis as being present when the T -score is at least 2.5 SD below the young adult mean value. Osteopenia is diagnosed when the BMD T-score is between 1 and 2.5 SD below the young adult mean value (Walker-Bone et al., 2001). Fracture risk increases progressively as the SD of the T -score falls below the mean value.

Quantitative ultrasound studies (QUS) of the heel also are used to diagnose osteoporosis and to predict the risk of hip and nonvertebral fracture. When standardization of sites and comparability of findings of BMD and QUS are determined, these measurements will become more clinically useful (NIH Consensus Statement, 2000).

These BMD studies are useful in identifying osteopenic and osteoporotic bone and in assessing response to therapy. Through early screening (using both assessment of risk factors and BMD scans), promotion of adequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, encouragement of lifestyle changes, and early institution of preventive medications, bone loss and osteoporosis can be reduced, resulting in a reduced incidence of fracture.

Laboratory studies (eg, serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum alkaline phosphatase, urine calcium excretion, urinary hydroxyproline excretion, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and x-ray studies are used to exclude other possible medical diagnoses (eg, multiple myeloma, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, malignancy) that contribute to bone loss.

\section*{Medical Management}

An adequate, balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D throughout life, with an increased calcium intake during adolescence, young adulthood, and the middle years, protects against skeletal demineralization. Such a diet would include three glasses of skim or whole vitamin D-enriched milk or other foods high in calcium (eg, cheese and other dairy products, steamed broccoli, canned salmon with bones), daily. To ensure adequate calcium intake, a calcium supplement (eg, Caltrate, Citrocal) may be prescribed and taken with meals or with a beverage high in vitamin C to promote absorption. The recommended daily dose should be split and not taken as a single dose. Common side effects of calcium supplements are abdominal distention and constipation.

Regular weight-bearing exercise promotes bone formation. From 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (eg, walking), 3 days or more a week, is recommended. Weight training stimulates an increase in BMD. In addition, exercise improves balance, reducing the incidence of falls and fractures (Chart 68-8).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

At natural or surgical menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone has been the mainstay of therapy to retard bone loss and prevent occurrence of fractures. Estrogen replacement decreases bone resorption and increases bone mass, reducing the incidence of osteoporotic fractures. However, recent studies have demonstrated greater risks than previously recognized (Chen, Weiss, Newcomb, Barlow \& White, 2002).

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as raloxifene (Evista), reduce the risk for osteoporosis by preserving bone
mineral density without estrogenic effects on the uterus. They are indicated for both prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

Other medications that may be prescribed to treat osteoporosis include bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate [Fosamax]; risedronate [Actonel]) and calcitonin. Alendronate offers an alternative to HRT and produces increased bone mass (by inhibiting osteoclast function) and decreased bone loss. Bisphosphonates reduce spine and hip fractures associated with osteoporosis. A weekly dosage strength of alendronate is available and has been shown to be as effective as previously used daily dosing. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is needed for maximum effect, but these supplements should not be taken at the same time of day as bisphosphonates. Side effects of alendronate include gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation). Alendronate and risedronate are approved for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women.

Calcitonin (Miacalcin) primarily suppresses bone loss through direct action on osteoclasts and reduced bone turnover. It is effective in increasing BMD. Calcitonin is administered by nasal spray or by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Side effects include nasal irritation, flushing, gastrointestinal disturbances, and urinary frequency.

Recently, in clinical trials, small daily subcutaneous injections of PTH or PTH bioactive fragments (1-34; 1-38), or both, have been found to stimulate bone formation (Neer et al., 2001). U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of prescription of intermittent PTH is anticipated as a new anabolic approach to treatment of osteoporosis.

Natural estrogens (plant-derived phytoestrogens) have not been shown to be effective in reducing osteoporosis-related fractures (NIH Consensus Statement, 2000).

In addition, antilipid medications, such as statins (HMGCoA reductase inhibitors), reduce the incidence of fractures in patients who take these medications to control their hyperlipidemia. The statins promote bone growth, thereby preventing the development of osteoporosis.

\section*{FRACTURE MANAGEMENT}

Fractures of the hip are managed surgically by joint replacement or by closed or open reduction with internal fixation (eg, hip pinning). Surgery, early ambulation, intensive physical therapy, and adequate nutrition result in decreased morbidity and improved outcomes. In addition, patients need to be evaluated for osteoporosis and treated, if indicated.

Osteoporotic compression fractures of the vertebra are managed conservatively. Additional vertebral fractures and progressive kyphosis are common. Pharmacologic and dietary treatment are aimed at increasing vertebral bone density. A new procedure, percutaneous vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty (injection of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement into the fractured vertebra), is reported to provide rapid acute pain relief and improved quality of life. The long-term effect of this procedure is unknown (NIH Consensus Statement, 2000).

tions concerning the occurrence of osteopenia and osteoporosis and focuses on family history, previous fractures, dietary consumption of calcium, exercise patterns, onset of menopause, and use of corticosteroids as well as alcohol, smoking, and caffeine intake. Any symptoms the patient is experiencing, such as back pain, constipation, or altered body image, are explored.

Physical examination may disclose a fracture, kyphosis of the thoracic spine, or shortened stature. Problems in mobility and breathing may exist as a result of changes in posture and weakened muscles.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses for the patient who experiences a spontaneous vertebral fracture related to osteoporosis may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge about the osteoporotic process and treatment regimen
- Acute pain related to fracture and muscle spasm
- Risk for constipation related to immobility or development of ileus (intestinal obstruction)
- Risk for injury: additional fractures related to osteoporosis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include knowledge about osteoporosis and the treatment regimen, relief of pain, improved bowel elimination, and absence of additional fractures.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING OF OSTEOPOROSIS AND THE TREATMENT REGIMEN}

Patient teaching focuses on factors influencing the development of osteoporosis, interventions to arrest or slow the process, and measures to relieve symptoms. Adequate dietary or supplemental calcium and vitamin D, regular weight-bearing exercise, and modification of lifestyle, if necessary (eg, cessation of smoking, reduced use of caffeine and alcohol), help to maintain bone mass. Diet, exercise, and physical activity are the primary keys to developing high-density bones that are resistant to osteoporosis. It is emphasized that all people continue to need sufficient calcium, vitamin D, sunshine, and weight-bearing exercise to slow the progression of osteoporosis.

Patient teaching related to medication therapy is important. Because gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal distention are
frequent side effects of calcium supplements, the nurse instructs the patient to take the calcium supplements with meals. Also, it is important to teach the patient to drink adequate fluids to reduce the risk of renal calculi. If HRT is prescribed, the nurse teaches the patient about the importance of compliance and periodic screening for breast and endometrial cancer. Alendronate requires compliance: it must be taken on an empty stomach with water, and then the patient must not consume foods or liquids or assume a reclining position for 30 to 60 minutes. Nasal calcitonin is administered daily, alternating the nares. An adequate daily intake of dietary calcium and vitamin D is needed along with these prescribed medications.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Relief of back pain resulting from compression fracture may be accomplished by resting in bed in a supine or side-lying position several times a day. The mattress should be firm and nonsagging. Knee flexion increases comfort by relaxing back muscles. Intermittent local heat and back rubs promote muscle relaxation. The nurse instructs the patient to move the trunk as a unit and to avoid twisting. The nurse encourages good posture and teaches body mechanics. When the patient is assisted out of bed, a lumbosacral corset may be worn for temporary support and immobilization, although such a device is frequently uncomfortable and is poorly tolerated by many elderly patients. The patient gradually resumes activities as pain diminishes. Vertebroplasty may be considered for some patients.

\section*{IMPROVING BOWEL ELIMINATION}

Constipation is a problem related to immobility and medications. Early institution of a high-fiber diet, increased fluids, and the use of prescribed stool softeners help to prevent or minimize constipation. If the vertebral collapse involves the T10-L2 vertebrae, the patient may develop an ileus. The nurse therefore monitors the patient's intake, bowel sounds, and bowel activity.

\section*{PREVENTING INJURY}

Physical activity is essential to strengthen muscles, improve balance, prevent disuse atrophy, and retard progressive bone demineralization. Isometric exercises can strengthen trunk muscles. The nurse encourages walking, good body mechanics, and good posture. Daily weight-bearing activity, preferably outdoors in the sunshine to enhance the body's ability to produce vitamin D , is encouraged. Sudden bending, jarring, and strenuous lifting are avoided.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly people fall frequently as a result of environmental hazards, neuromuscular disorders, diminished senses and cardiovascular responses, and responses to medications. The patient and family need to be included in planning for care and preventive management regimens. For example, the home environment should be assessed for safety and elimination of potential hazards (eg, scatter rugs, cluttered rooms and stairwells, toys on the floor, pets underfoot). A safe environment can then be created (eg, well-lighted staircases with secure hand rails, grab bars in the bathroom, properly fitting footwear). Other safety devices, such as hip protectors (Fig. 68-10), have been used to diminish the impact of a fall and have reduced the hip fracture rate (Kannus et al., 2000).

\section*{OSTEOMALACIA}

Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone. As a result of faulty mineralization, there is softening and weakening of the skeleton, causing pain, tenderness to touch, bowing of the bones, and pathologic fractures. On physical examination, skeletal deformities (spinal kyphosis and bowed legs) give patients an unusual appearance and a waddling or limping gait. These patients may be uncomfortable with their appearance. As a result of calcium deficiency, muscle weakness, and unsteadiness, there is an increased risk for falls and fractures.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The primary defect in osteomalacia is a deficiency of activated vitamin D (calcitriol), which promotes calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and facilitates mineralization of bone. The supply of calcium and phosphate in the extracellular fluid is low. Without adequate vitamin D, calcium and phosphate are not moved to calcification sites in bones.

Osteomalacia may result from failed calcium absorption (eg, malabsorption syndrome) or from excessive loss of calcium from the body. Gastrointestinal disorders (eg, celiac disease, chronic biliary tract obstruction, chronic pancreatitis, small bowel resection) in which fats are inadequately absorbed are likely to produce osteomalacia through loss of vitamin D (along with other fatsoluble vitamins) and calcium, the latter being excreted in the feces with fatty acids. In addition, liver and kidney diseases can produce a lack of vitamin $D$ because these are the organs that convert vitamin D to its active form.

Severe renal insufficiency results in acidosis. The body uses available calcium to combat the acidosis, and PTH stimulates the release of skeletal calcium in an attempt to reestablish a physiologic pH. During this continual drain of skeletal calcium, bony fibrosis occurs and bony cysts form. Chronic glomerulonephritis, obstructive uropathies, and heavy-metal poisoning result in a reduced serum phosphate level and demineralization of bone.

Hyperparathyroidism leads to skeletal decalcification and thus to osteomalacia by increasing phosphate excretion in the urine. Prolonged use of antiseizure medication (eg, phenytoin, phenobarbital) poses a risk for osteomalacia, as does insufficient vitamin D (dietary, sunlight).

The malnutrition type of osteomalacia (deficiency in vitamin D often associated with poor intake of calcium) is a result of poverty, food faddism, and lack of knowledge about nutrition. It occurs most frequently in parts of the world where vitamin D is not added to food, where dietary deficiencies exist, and where sunlight is rare.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

A nutritious diet is particularly important in elderly people. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is promoted. Because sunlight is necessary for synthesizing vitamin D, people should be encouraged to spend some time in the sun. Prevention, identification, and management of osteomalacia in the elderly are essential to reduce the incidence of fractures. When osteomalacia is combined with osteoporosis, the incidence of fracture increases.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

On x-ray, generalized demineralization of bone is evident. Studies of the vertebrae may show a compression fracture with indistinct vertebral end-plates. Laboratory studies show low serum calcium
and phosphorus levels and a moderately elevated alkaline phosphatase concentration. Urine excretion of calcium and creatinine is low. Bone biopsy demonstrates an increased amount of osteoid.

\section*{Medical Management}

The underlying cause of osteomalacia is corrected if possible. If osteomalacia is caused by malabsorption, increased doses of vitamin D, along with supplemental calcium, are usually prescribed. Exposure to sunlight for ultraviolet radiation to transform a cholesterol substance (7-dehydrocholesterol) present in the skin into vitamin D may be recommended.

If osteomalacia is dietary in origin, a diet with adequate protein and increased calcium and vitamin D is provided. The patient is instructed about dietary sources of calcium and vitamin D (eg, fortified milk and cereals, eggs, chicken livers). The safe use of supplements is reviewed. Because high doses of vitamin D are toxic and enhance the risk of hypercalcemia, the importance of monitoring serum calcium levels is stressed. Vitamin D raises the concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in the extracellular fluid and thus makes these ions available for mineralization of bone.

Physical, psychological, and pharmaceutical measures are used to reduce the patient's discomfort and pain. When assisting the patient to change positions, the nurse handles the patient gently, and pillows are used to support the body. As the patient responds to therapy, the skeletal discomforts diminish.

Frequently, skeletal problems associated with osteomalacia resolve themselves when the underlying nutritional deficiency or pathologic process is adequately treated. Long-term monitoring of the patient is appropriate to ensure stabilization or reversal of osteomalacia. Some persistent orthopedic deformities may need to be treated with braces or surgery (eg, osteotomy may be performed to correct long bone deformity).

\section*{PAGET'S DISEASE}

Paget's disease (osteitis deformans) is a disorder of localized rapid bone turnover, most commonly affecting the skull, femur, tibia, pelvic bones, and vertebrae. There is a primary proliferation of osteoclasts, which produces bone resorption. This is followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic activity that replaces the bone. As bone turnover continues, a classic mosaic (disorganized) pattern of bone develops. Because the diseased bone in Paget's disease is highly vascularized and structurally weak, pathologic fractures occur. Structural bowing of the legs causes malalignment of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, which contributes to the development of arthritis and back and joint pain.

Paget's disease occurs in about $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ of the population older than 50 years of age. The incidence is slightly greater in men than in women and increases with aging. A family history has been noted, with siblings developing the disease. The cause of Paget's disease is not known.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Paget's disease is insidious; most patients never know they have it. Some patients do not experience symptoms but have skeletal deformity. A few patients have symptomatic deformity and pain. The condition is most frequently identified on x-ray during a routine physical examination or in the course of a workup for another problem. Sclerotic changes, skeletal deformities (eg, bowing of femur and tibia, enlargement of the skull, deformity of pelvic bones), and cortical thickening of the long bones occur.

In most patients, skeletal deformity involves the skull or long bones. The skull may thicken, and the patient may report that a hat no longer fits. In some cases of Paget's disease, the cranium, but not the face, is enlarged. This gives the face a small, triangular appearance. Most patients with skull involvement have impaired hearing from cranial nerve compression and dysfunction. Other cranial nerves may also be compressed.

The femurs and tibiae tend to bow, producing a waddling gait. The spine is bent forward and is rigid; the chin rests on the chest. The thorax is compressed and immobile on respiration. The trunk is flexed on the legs to maintain balance; the arms are bent outward and forward and appear long in relation to the shortened trunk, giving the patient an apelike posture.

Pain, tenderness, and warmth over the bones may be noted. The pain is mild to moderate, deep, and aching; it increases with weight bearing if the lower extremities are involved. Pain and discomfort may precede skeletal deformities of Paget's disease by years and are often wrongly attributed by the patient to old age or arthritis.

The temperature of the skin overlying the affected bone increases because of increased bone vascularity. Patients with large, highly vascular lesions may develop high-output cardiac failure because of the increased vascular bed and metabolic demands.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentration and urinary hydroxyproline excretion reflect increased osteoblastic activity. Higher values suggest more active disease. Patients with Paget's disease have normal blood calcium levels. X-rays confirm the diagnosis of Paget's disease. Local areas of demineralization and bone overgrowth produce characteristic mosaic patterns and irregularities. Bone scans demonstrate the extent of the disease. Bone biopsy may aid in the differential diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Pain usually responds to administration of NSAIDs. Gait problems from bowing of the legs are managed with walking aids, shoe lifts, and physical therapy. Weight is controlled to reduce stress on weakened bones and malaligned joints. Asymptomatic patients may be managed with diets adequate in calcium and vita$\min \mathrm{D}$ and periodic monitoring.

Fractures, arthritis, and hearing loss are complications of Paget's disease. Fractures are managed according to location. Healing occurs if fracture reduction, immobilization, and stability are adequate. Severe degenerative arthritis may require total joint replacement. Loss of hearing is managed with hearing aids and communication techniques used with the hearing-impaired person (eg, lip reading, body language).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Patients with moderate to severe disease may benefit from specific antiosteoclastic therapy. Several medications reduce bone turnover, reverse the course of the disease, relieve pain, and improve mobility.

Calcitonin, a polypeptide hormone, retards bone resorption by decreasing the number and availability of osteoclasts. Calcitonin therapy facilitates remodeling of abnormal bone into normal lamellar bone, relieves bone pain, and helps alleviate neurologic and biochemical signs and symptoms. Calcitonin is administered subcutaneously or by nasal inhalation. Side effects include flushing of the face and nausea. The effect of calcitonin therapy is evident in 3 to 6 months.

Bisphosphonates, such as etidronate disodium (Didronel) and alendronate sodium (Fosamax), produce rapid reduction in bone turnover and relief of pain. They also reduce serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels. Food inhibits absorption of these medications. Adequate daily calcium ( 1500 mg ) and vitamin D ( 400 to 600 IU ) are required during therapy.

Plicamycin (Mithracin), a cytotoxic antibiotic, may be used to control the disease. This medication is reserved for severely affected patients with neurologic compromise and for those whose disease is resistant to other therapy. This medication has dramatic effects on pain reduction and on serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and urinary hydroxyproline levels. It is administered by IV infusion and requires that hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function be monitored during therapy. Clinical remissions may continue for months after the medication is discontinued.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Careful assessment of the patient's pain and discomfort is necessary. Patient teaching helps the patient understand the treatment regimen, the need for a diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D, and how to compensate for altered musculoskeletal functioning. The home environment is assessed for safety to prevent falls and to reduce the risk for fracture. Strategies for coping with a chronic health problem and its effect on quality of life need to be developed.

\section*{Musculoskeletal Infections}

\section*{OSTEOMYELITIS}

Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone. The bone becomes infected by one of three modes:
- Extension of soft tissue infection (eg, infected pressure or vascular ulcer, incisional infection)
- Direct bone contamination from bone surgery, open fracture, or traumatic injury (eg, gunshot wound)
- Hematogenous (bloodborne) spread from other sites of infection (eg, infected tonsils, boils, infected teeth, upper respiratory infections). Osteomyelitis resulting from hematogenous spread typically occurs in a bone area of trauma or lowered resistance, possibly from subclinical (nonapparent) trauma.

Patients who are at high risk for osteomyelitis include those who are poorly nourished, elderly, or obese. Also at risk are patients with impaired immune systems, those with chronic illness (eg, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis), and those receiving longterm corticosteroid therapy.

Postoperative surgical wound infections occur within 30 days after surgery. They are classified as incisional (superficial, located above the deep fascia layer) or deep (involving tissue beneath the deep fascia). If an implant has been used, deep postoperative infections may occur within a year. Deep sepsis after arthroplasty may be classified as follows:

Stage 1, acute fulminating: occurring during the first 3 months after orthopedic surgery; frequently associated with hematoma, drainage, or superficial infection
Stage 2, delayed onset: occurring between 4 and 24 months after surgery
Stage 3, late onset: occurring 2 or more years after surgery, usually as a result of hematogenous spread

Bone infections are more difficult to eradicate than soft tissue infections because the infected bone becomes walled off. Natural body immune responses are blocked, and there is less penetration by antibiotics. Osteomyelitis may become chronic and may affect the patient's quality of life.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Staphylococcus aureus causes $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of bone infections. Other pathogenic organisms frequently found in osteomyelitis include Proteus and Pseudomonas species and Escherichia coli. The incidence of penicillin-resistant, nosocomial, gram-negative, and anaerobic infections is increasing.

The initial response to infection is inflammation, increased vascularity, and edema. After 2 or 3 days, thrombosis of the blood vessels occurs in the area, resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis. The infection extends into the medullary cavity and under the periosteum and may spread into adjacent soft tissues and joints. Unless the infective process is treated promptly, a bone abscess forms. The resulting abscess cavity contains dead bone tissue (the sequestrum), which does not easily liquefy and drain. Therefore, the cavity cannot collapse and heal, as occurs in soft tissue abscesses. New bone growth (the involucrum) forms and surrounds the sequestrum. Although healing appears to take place, a chronically infected sequestrum remains and produces recurring abscesses throughout the patient's life. This is referred to as chronic osteomyelitis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

When the infection is bloodborne, the onset is usually sudden, occurring often with the clinical manifestations of septicemia (eg, chills, high fever, rapid pulse, general malaise). The systemic symptoms at first may overshadow the local signs. As the infection extends through the cortex of the bone, it involves the periosteum and the soft tissues. The infected area becomes painful, swollen, and extremely tender. The patient may describe a constant, pulsating pain that intensifies with movement as a result of the pressure of the collecting pus. When osteomyelitis occurs from spread of adjacent infection or from direct contamination, there are no symptoms of septicemia. The area is swollen, warm, painful, and tender to touch.

The patient with chronic osteomyelitis presents with a continuously draining sinus or experiences recurrent periods of pain, inflammation, swelling, and drainage. The low-grade infection thrives in scar tissue, because it has a reduced blood supply.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In acute osteomyelitis, early x-ray findings demonstrate soft tissue swelling. In about 2 weeks, areas of irregular decalcification, bone necrosis, periosteal elevation, and new bone formation are evident. Radioisotope bone scans, particularly the isotopelabeled white blood cell (WBC) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help with early definitive diagnosis. Blood studies reveal elevated leukocyte levels and an elevated sedimentation rate. Wound and blood culture studies are performed to identify appropriate antibiotic therapy.

With chronic osteomyelitis, large, irregular cavities, raised periosteum, sequestra, or dense bone formations are seen on x-ray. Bone scans may be performed to identify areas of infection. The sedimentation rate and the WBC count are usually normal. Anemia, associated with chronic infection, may be evident. The
abscess is cultured to determine the infective organism and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

\section*{Prevention}

Prevention of osteomyelitis is the goal. Elective orthopedic surgery should be postponed if the patient has a current infection (eg, urinary tract infection, sore throat) or a recent history of infection. During orthopedic surgery, careful attention is paid to the surgical environment and to techniques to decrease direct bone contamination. Prophylactic antibiotics, administered to achieve adequate tissue levels at the time of surgery and for 24 hours after surgery, are helpful. Urinary catheters and drains are removed as soon as possible to decrease the incidence of hematogenous spread of infection.

Treatment of focal infections diminishes hematogenous spread. Aseptic postoperative wound care reduces the incidence of superficial infections and osteomyelitis. Prompt management of soft tissue infections reduces extension of infection to the bone. When patients who have had joint replacement surgery undergo dental procedures or other invasive procedures (eg, cystoscopy), prophylactic antibiotics are frequently recommended.

\section*{Medical Management}

The initial goal of therapy is to control and halt the infective process. Antibiotic therapy depends on the results of blood and wound cultures. Frequently, the infection is caused by more than one pathogen. General supportive measures (eg, hydration, diet high in vitamins and protein, correction of anemia) should be instituted. The area affected with osteomyelitis is immobilized to decrease discomfort and to prevent pathologic fracture of the weakened bone. Warm wet soaks for 20 minutes several times a day may be prescribed to increase circulation.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

As soon as the culture specimens are obtained, IV antibiotic therapy begins, based on the assumption that infection results from a staphylococcal organism that is sensitive to a semisynthetic penicillin or cephalosporin. The aim is to control the infection before the blood supply to the area diminishes as a result of thrombosis. Around-the-clock dosing is necessary to achieve a sustained high therapeutic blood level of the antibiotic. An antibiotic to which the causative organism is sensitive is prescribed after results of the culture and sensitivity studies are known. IV antibiotic therapy continues for 3 to 6 weeks. After the infection appears to be controlled, the antibiotic may be administered orally for up to 3 months. To enhance absorption of the orally administered medication, antibiotics should not be administered with food.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

If the patient does not respond to antibiotic therapy, the infected bone is surgically exposed, the purulent and necrotic material is removed, and the area is irrigated with sterile saline solution. Antibiotic-impregnated beads may be placed in the wound for direct application of antibiotics for 2 to 4 weeks. IV antibiotic therapy is continued.

In chronic osteomyelitis, antibiotics are adjunctive therapy to surgical débridement. A sequestrectomy (removal of enough involucrum to enable the surgeon to remove the sequestrum) is performed. In many cases, sufficient bone is removed to convert a deep cavity into a shallow saucer (saucerization). All dead, infected
bone and cartilage must be removed before permanent healing can occur. A closed suction irrigation system may be used to remove debris. Wound irrigation using sterile physiologic saline solution may be performed for 7 to 8 days.

The wound is either closed tightly to obliterate the dead space or packed and closed later by granulation or possibly by grafting. The débrided cavity may be packed with cancellous bone graft to stimulate healing. With a large defect, the cavity may be filled with a vascularized bone transfer or muscle flap (in which a muscle is moved from an adjacent area with blood supply intact). These microsurgery techniques enhance the blood supply. The improved blood supply facilitates bone healing and eradication of the infection. These surgical procedures may be staged over time to ensure healing. Because surgical débridement weakens the bone, internal fixation or external supportive devices may be needed to stabilize or support the bone to prevent pathologic fracture.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH OSTEOMYELITIS}

\section*{Assessment}

The patient reports an acute onset of signs and symptoms (eg, localized pain, swelling, erythema, fever) or recurrent drainage of an infected sinus with associated pain, swelling, and low-grade fever. The nurse assesses the patient for risk factors (eg, older age, diabetes, long-term corticosteroid therapy) and for a history of previous injury, infection, or orthopedic surgery. The patient avoids pressure on the area and guards movement. In acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, the patient exhibits generalized weakness due to the systemic reaction to the infection.

Physical examination reveals an inflamed, markedly swollen, warm area that is tender. Purulent drainage may be noted. The patient has an elevated temperature. With chronic osteomyelitis, the temperature elevation may be minimal, occurring in the afternoon or evening.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the nursing assessment data, nursing diagnoses for the patient with osteomyelitis may include the following:
- Acute pain related to inflammation and swelling
- Impaired physical mobility related to pain, use of immobilization devices, and weight-bearing limitations
- Risk for extension of infection: bone abscess formation
- Deficient knowledge related to the treatment regimen

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The patient's goals may include relief of pain, improved physical mobility within therapeutic limitations, control and eradication of infection, and knowledge of treatment regimen.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The affected part may be immobilized with a splint to decrease pain and muscle spasm. The nurse monitors the neurovascular status of the affected extremity. The wounds are frequently very painful, and the extremity must be handled with great care and gentleness. Elevation reduces swelling and associated discomfort.

Pain is controlled with prescribed analgesics and other painreducing techniques.

\section*{IMPROVING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Treatment regimens restrict activity. The bone is weakened by the infective process and must be protected by immobilization devices and by avoidance of stress on the bone. The patient must understand the rationale for the activity restrictions. The joints above and below the affected part should be gently placed through their range of motion. The nurse encourages full participation in ADLs within the physical limitations to promote general well-being.

\section*{CONTROLLING THE INFECTIOUS PROCESS}

The nurse monitors the patient's response to antibiotic therapy and observes the IV access site for evidence of phlebitis, infection, or infiltration. With long-term, intensive antibiotic therapy, the nurse monitors the patient for signs of superinfection (eg, oral or vaginal candidiasis, loose or foul-smelling stools).

If surgery was necessary, the nurse takes measures to ensure adequate circulation (wound suction to prevent fluid accumulation, elevation of the area to promote venous drainage, avoidance of pressure on grafted area), to maintain needed immobility, and to comply with weight-bearing restrictions. The nurse changes dressings using aseptic technique to promote healing and to prevent cross-contamination.

The nurse continues to monitor the general health and nutrition of the patient. A diet high in protein and vitamin C ensures a positive nitrogen balance and promotes healing. The nurse encourages adequate hydration as well.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient and family must learn and recognize the importance of strictly adhering to the therapeutic regimen of antibiotics and preventing falls or other injuries that could result in bone fracture. The patient needs to know how to maintain and manage the IV access and IV administration equipment in the home. Medication education includes medication name, dosage, frequency, administration rate, safe storage and handling, adverse reactions, and necessary laboratory monitoring. In addition, aseptic dressing and warm compress techniques are taught.

The nurse carefully monitors the patient for the development of additional painful areas or sudden increases in body temperature. The nurse instructs the patient and family to observe and report elevated temperature, drainage, odor, increased inflammation, adverse reactions, and signs of superinfection.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Management of osteomyelitis, including wound care and IV antibiotic therapy, is usually performed at home. The patient must be medically stable, physically able, and motivated to adhere strictly to the therapeutic regimen of antibiotic therapy. The home care environment needs to be conducive to promotion of health and to the requirements of the therapeutic regimen.

If warranted, the nurse completes a home assessment to determine the patient's and family's abilities regarding continuation of the therapeutic regimen. If the patient's support system is questionable or if the patient lives alone, a home care nurse may be needed to assist with intravenous administration of the antibiotics. The nurse monitors the patient for response to the treatment, signs and symptoms of superinfections, and adverse drug

\section*{SEPTIC (INFECTIOUS) ARTHRITIS}

Joints can become infected through spread of infection from other parts of the body (hematogenous spread) or directly through trauma or surgical instrumentation. Previous trauma to joints, joint replacement, coexisting arthritis, and diminished host resistance contribute to the development of an infected joint. S. aureus causes most adult joint infections, followed by streptococci and
gram-negative organisms. Prompt recognition and treatment of an infected joint are important because accumulating pus results in chondrolysis (destruction of hyaline cartilage).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient with acute septic arthritis usually presents with a warm, painful, swollen joint with decreased range of motion. Systemic chills, fever, and leukocytosis are present. Risk factors include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and preexisting joint disease or joint replacement.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly patients and patients taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications may not exhibit typical clinical manifestations of infection. Therefore, they require ongoing assessment to detect infection as early as possible in the infectious process.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

An assessment for the source and cause of infection is performed. Diagnostic studies include aspiration, examination, and culture of the synovial fluid. Computed tomography and MRI may disclose damage to the joint lining. Radioisotope scanning may be useful in localizing the infectious process.

\section*{Management}

Prompt treatment is essential and may save a joint prosthesis for patients who have one. Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics are started promptly and then changed to organism-specific antibiotics after culture results are available. The IV antibiotics are continued until symptoms disappear. The synovial fluid is monitored for sterility and decrease in WBCs.

In addition to prescribing antibiotics, the physician may aspirate the joint with a needle to remove excessive joint fluid, exudate, and debris. This promotes comfort and decreases joint destruction caused by the action of proteolytic enzymes in the purulent fluid. Occasionally, arthrotomy or arthroscopy is used to drain the joint and remove dead tissue.

The inflamed joint is supported and immobilized in a functional position by a splint that increases the patient's comfort. Analgesics, such as codeine, may be prescribed to control pain. After the infection has responded to antibiotic therapy, NSAIDs may be prescribed to limit joint damage. The patient's nutrition
and fluid status is monitored. Progressive range-of-motion exercises are prescribed after the infection subsides.

If septic joints are treated promptly, recovery of normal function is expected. The patient is assessed periodically for recurrence. If the articular cartilage was damaged during the inflammatory reaction, joint fibrosis and diminished function may result.

The nurse describes the septic arthritis process to the patient and teaches the patient how to relieve pain using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. The nurse also explains the importance of supporting the affected joint, adhering to the prescribed antibiotic regimen, and observing weight-bearing and activity restrictions. Additionally, the nurse demonstrates and encourages the patient to practice safe use of ambulatory aids and assistive devices.

The nurse teaches the patient strategies to promote healing through aseptic dressing changes and proper wound care. The patient is then encouraged to perform range-of-motion exercises after the infection subsides.

\section*{BoneTumors}

Neoplasms of the musculoskeletal system are of various types, including osteogenic, chondrogenic, fibrogenic, muscle (rhabdomyogenic), and marrow (reticulum) cell tumors as well as nerve, vascular, and fatty cell tumors. They may be primary tumors or metastatic tumors from primary cancers elsewhere in the body (eg, breast, lung, prostate, kidney). Metastatic bone tumors are more common than primary bone tumors.

\section*{BENIGN BONE TUMORS}

Benign tumors of the bone and soft tissue are more common than malignant primary bone tumors. Benign bone tumors generally are slow growing and well circumscribed, present few symptoms, and are not a cause of death.

Benign primary neoplasms of the musculoskeletal system include osteochondroma, enchondroma, bone cyst (eg, aneurysmal bone cyst), osteoid osteoma, rhabdomyoma, and fibroma. Some benign tumors, such as giant cell tumors, have the potential to become malignant.

Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. It usually occurs as a large projection of bone at the end of long bones (at the knee or shoulder). It develops during growth and then becomes a static bony mass. In fewer than $1 \%$ of patients, the cartilage cap of the osteochondroma may undergo malignant transformation after trauma, and a chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma may develop.

Enchondroma is a common tumor of the hyaline cartilage that develops in the hand, femur, tibia, or humerus. Usually, the only symptom is a mild ache. Pathologic fractures may occur.

Bone cysts are expanding lesions within the bone. Aneurysmal (widening) bone cysts are seen in young adults, who present with a painful, palpable mass of the long bones, vertebrae, or flat bone. Unicameral (single cavity) bone cysts occur in children and cause mild discomfort and possible pathologic fractures of the upper humerus and femur, which may heal spontaneously.

A painful tumor that occurs in children and young adults is the osteoid osteoma. The neoplastic tissue is surrounded by reactive bone formation that assists in its identification by x-ray.

Giant cell tumors (osteoclastomas) are benign for long periods but may invade local tissue and cause destruction. They occur in
young adults and are soft and hemorrhagic. Eventually, giant cell tumors may undergo malignant transformation and metastasize.

\section*{MALIGNANT BONE TUMORS}

Primary malignant musculoskeletal tumors are relatively rare and arise from connective and supportive tissue cells (sarcomas) or bone marrow elements (multiple myeloma; see Chap. 33). Malignant primary musculoskeletal tumors include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas include liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma of soft tissue, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Bone tumor metastasis to the lungs is common.

Osteogenic sarcoma (osteosarcoma) is the most common and most often fatal primary malignant bone tumor. Prognosis depends on whether the tumor has metastasized to the lungs at the time the patient seeks health care. Osteogenic sarcoma appears most frequently in males between the ages of 10 and 25 years (in bones that grow rapidly), in older people with Paget's disease, and as a result of radiation exposure. Clinical manifestations include pain, swelling, limited motion, and weight loss (which is considered an ominous finding). The bony mass may be palpable, tender, and fixed, with an increase in skin temperature over the mass and venous distention. The primary lesion may involve any bone, but the most common sites are the distal femur, the proximal tibia, and the proximal humerus.

Malignant tumors of the hyaline cartilage are called chondrosarcomas. These tumors are the second most common primary malignant bone tumor. They are large, bulky, slow-growing tumors that affect adults. The usual tumor sites include the pelvis, femur, humerus, spine, scapula, and tibia. Metastasis to the lungs occurs in fewer than half of patients. When these tumors are well differentiated, large bloc excision or amputation of the affected extremity results in increased survival rates. These tumors may recur.

\section*{METASTATIC BONE DISEASE}

Metastatic bone disease (secondary bone tumor) is more common than any primary bone tumor. Tumors arising from tissues elsewhere in the body may invade the bone and produce localized bone destruction (lytic lesions) or bone overgrowth (blastic lesions). The most common primary sites of tumors that metastasize to bone are the kidney, prostate, lung, breast, ovary, and thyroid. Metastatic tumors most frequently attack the skull, spine, pelvis, femur, and humerus and involve more than one bone (polyostotic).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A tumor in the bone causes the normal bone tissue to react by osteolytic response (bone destruction) or osteoblastic response (bone formation). Primary tumors cause bone destruction, which weakens the bone, resulting in bone fractures. Adjacent normal bone responds to the tumor by altering its normal pattern of remodeling. The bone's surface changes, and the contours enlarge in the tumor area.

Malignant bone tumors invade and destroy adjacent bone tissue. Benign bone tumors, in contrast, have a symmetric, controlled growth pattern and place pressure on adjacent bone tissue. Malignant invading bone tumors weaken the structure of the bone until it can no longer withstand the stress of ordinary use; pathologic fracture commonly results.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients with metastatic bone tumor may have a wide range of associated clinical manifestations. They may be symptom free or have pain (mild and occasional to constant and severe), varying degrees of disability and, at times, obvious bone growth. Weight loss, malaise, and fever may be present. The tumor may be diagnosed only after pathologic fracture has occurred.

With spinal metastasis, spinal cord compression may occur. It can progress rapidly or slowly. Neurologic deficits (eg, progressive pain, weakness, gait abnormality, paresthesia, paraplegia, urinary retention, loss of bowel or bladder control) must be identified early and treated with decompressive laminectomy to prevent permanent spinal cord injury.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The differential diagnosis is based on the history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies, including computed tomography, bone scans, myelography, arteriography, MRI, biopsy, and biochemical assays of the blood and urine. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels are frequently elevated with osteogenic sarcoma. With metastatic carcinoma of the prostate, serum acid phosphatase levels are elevated. Hypercalcemia is present with breast, lung, or kidney cancer bone metastases. Symptoms of hypercalcemia include muscle weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, cardiac dysrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Hypercalcemia must be identified and treated promptly. Surgical biopsy is performed for histologic identification. Extreme care is taken during biopsy to prevent seeding and resultant recurrence after excision of the tumor.

Chest x-rays are performed to determine the presence of lung metastasis. Surgical staging of musculoskeletal tumors is based on tumor grade and site (intracompartmental or extracompartmental), as well as on metastasis. Staging is used for planning treatment.

During the diagnostic period, the nurse explains the diagnostic tests and provides psychological and emotional support to the patient and family. The nurse assesses coping behaviors and encourages use of support systems.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{PRIMARY BONE TUMORS}

The goal of primary bone tumor treatment is to destroy or remove the tumor. This may be accomplished by surgical excision (ranging from local excision to amputation and disarticulation), radiation therapy if the tumor is radiosensitive, and chemotherapy (preoperative, intraoperative [neoadjuvant], postoperative, and adjunctive for possible micrometastases). Major gains are being made in the use of wide bloc excision with restorative grafting technique. Survival and quality of life are important considerations in procedures that attempt to save the involved extremity.

Limb-sparing (salvage) procedures are used to remove the tumor and adjacent tissue. A customized prosthesis, total joint arthroplasty, or bone tissue from the patient (autograft) or from a cadaver donor (allograft) replaces the resected tissue. Soft tissue and blood vessels may need grafting because of the extent of the excision. Complications may include infection, loosening or dislocation of the prosthesis, allograft nonunion, fracture, devitalization of the skin and soft tissues, joint fibrosis, and recurrence of the tumor. Function and rehabilitation after limb
salvage depend on positive encouragement and reducing the risk for complications.

Surgical removal of the tumor may require amputation of the affected extremity, with the amputation extending well above the tumor to achieve local control of the primary lesion (see Nursing Process: The Patient Undergoing an Amputation in Chapter 69.)

Because of the danger of metastasis with malignant bone tumors, combined chemotherapy is started before and continued after surgery in an effort to eradicate micrometastatic lesions. The goal of combined chemotherapy is greater therapeutic effect at a lower toxicity rate with reduced resistance to the medications. There is an improved long-term survival rate when a localized osteosarcoma is removed and chemotherapy is initiated. Soft tissue sarcomas are treated with radiation, limb-sparing excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy (see Chap. 33).

\section*{METASTATIC BONE DISEASE}

The treatment of metastatic bone cancer is palliative. The therapeutic goal is to relieve the patient's pain and discomfort while promoting quality of life.

If metastatic disease weakens the bone, structural support and stabilization are needed to prevent pathologic fracture. At times, large bones with metastatic lesions are strengthened by prophylactic internal fixation. Internal fixation of pathologic fractures, arthroplasty, or methylmethacrylate (bone cement) reconstruction minimizes associated disability and pain. Patients with metastatic disease are at higher risk for pulmonary congestion, hypoxemia, deep vein thrombosis, and hemorrhage than are other patients after orthopedic surgery.

Hypercalcemia results from breakdown of bone. It needs to be recognized promptly. Treatment includes hydration with IV administration of normal saline solution, diuresis, mobilization, and medications such as bisphosphonates, pamidronate, and calcitonin. Because inactivity leads to loss of bone mass and increased calcium in the blood, the nurse assists the patient to increase activity and ambulation.

Hematopoiesis is frequently disrupted by tumor invasion of the bone marrow or by treatment (chemotherapy or radiation). Blood product transfusions restore hematologic factors. Pain can result from multiple factors, including the osseous metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy or radiation side effects, and arthritis. Pain must be assessed accurately and managed with adequate and appropriate opioid, nonopioid, and nonpharmaceutical interventions. External beam radiation to involved metastasis sites may be used. Patients with multiple bony metastases may achieve pain control with systemically administered "bone-seeking" isotopes (eg, strontium 89). See Chapter 13 for more information about pain management.

Additional therapies are used to treat the original cancer. Radiation and hormonal therapy may be effective in promoting healing of osteolytic lesions. Chemotherapy is used to control the primary disease (see Chap. 33).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A BONE TUMOR}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse asks the patient about the onset and course of symptoms. During the interview, the nurse notes the patient's understanding of the disease process, how the patient and the family

Coward, D., and Wilkie, D. (2000). Metastatic bone pain: Meanings associated with self-report and self-management decision making. Cancer Nursing, 23, 101-108.

\section*{Purpose}

Patients with cancer and bone metastases experience severe pain, especially when moving. Cancer pain is conceptualized as multidimensional: physiologic, sensory, affective, behavioral, and cognitive. This descriptive study examined the meanings of pain experiences as well as self-disclosure and self-management of pain in both men and women. The study goals were (1) to identify thoughts, feelings, and perceptions reported by patients experiencing metastatic bone pain, (2) to identify methods patients used to tell others about the pain, (3) to describe the process patients used to decide whether to take analgesics, and (4) to describe possible gender-related differences in pain experiences.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A convenience sample consisted of 10 women and 10 men who had pain and objective evidence of bone metastasis. Most of the patients had metastases to the spine and had undergone surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation as cancer treatments before participating in the study.

Data were collected during audiotaped interviews. Interview questions were used to identify the patient's pain-related beliefs, feelings, and actions. The study participants also completed a McGill Pain Questionnaire, a visual analog scale of pain intensity, and a demographic form.

Transcribed tapes were analyzed for themes, and the narrative data were organized into descriptions of the participants' thoughts and feelings about their pain, the impact of pain on their lives, how they disclosed their pain to others, and how they decided to take analgesics.

\section*{Results}

Participants' reported thoughts and feelings about pain included possible injury, recurrence of cancer, progression of cancer, ineffectiveness of cancer treatments, fright and uncertainty about whether the cancer could be controlled, and the need to work harder to fight the cancer.

Pain interfered with participants' activities, including activities of daily living, work/housework, and pleasure activities. Also, pain interfered with family relationships, causing the participants to be irritable with family members or to isolate themselves from the family.

Most of the participants ( 7 women and 5 men) preferred not to tell others about their pain because they did not want to disappoint or worry others. Women sought normalcy. Men did not want to complain or saw no purpose in telling others. Those who disclosed their pain ( 3 women and 5 men) wanted to be honest with their friends and thought it would help health professionals to manage their pain. Only 3 women and 6 men took analgesics on the recommended schedule. Many delayed taking analgesics because the pain reminded them to protect the hurting part and kept them from overexertion. Side effects (eg, gastrointestinal distress, feeling out of control) were a concern for some of the participants ( 4 women and 5 men). Another reason given for not taking analgesics was to see whether the cancer treatment was working. The sample was too small to draw any conclusions about gender-related differences in pain experiences.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Pain means different things to different patients. Nurses need to engage patients with cancer in discussion of their pain and pain management. Disclosure of the characteristics of pain experiences would facilitate development of individualized, effective pain management strategies. If pain is associated with movement, pain management interventions need to be used to encourage movement and participation in activities of daily living and socialization. Alternative activities that bring the patient pleasure can be devised when pain or fear of fracture causes the patient to give up previously pleasurable activities.

For various reasons, a patient may not take analgesics on the recommended schedule; these reasons should be explored by the nurse. If side effects of analgesics are reported, they can be minimized. The nurse needs to discuss with the patient the physiologic benefits of controlling pain.
have been coping, and how the patient has managed the pain. On physical examination, the nurse gently palpates the mass and notes its size and associated soft tissue swelling, pain, and tenderness. Assessment of the neurovascular status and range of motion of the extremity provides baseline data for future comparisons. The nurse evaluates the patient's mobility and ability to perform ADLs.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the nursing assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses for the patient with a bone tumor may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge related to the disease process and the therapeutic regimen
- Acute and chronic pain related to pathologic process and surgery
- Risk for injury: pathologic fracture related to tumor and metastasis
- Ineffective coping related to fear of the unknown, perception of disease process, and inadequate support system
- Risk for situational low self-esteem related to loss of body part or alteration in role performance

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications may include the following:
- Delayed wound healing
- Nutritional deficiency
- Infection
- Hypercalcemia

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include knowledge of the disease process and treatment regimen, control of pain, absence of pathologic fractures, effective patterns of coping, improved self-esteem, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The nursing care of a patient who has undergone excision of a bone tumor is similar in many respects to that of other patients who have had skeletal surgery. Vital signs are monitored; blood loss is assessed; and observations are made to assess for the development of complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, infection, contracture, and disuse atrophy. The
affected part is elevated to control swelling, and the neurovascular status of the extremity is assessed.

\section*{PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE PROCESS AND TREATMENT REGIMEN}

Patient and family teaching about the disease process and diagnostic and management regimens is essential. Explanation of diagnostic tests, treatments (eg, wound care), and expected results (eg, decreased range of motion, numbness, change of body contours) helps the patient deal with the procedures and changes. Cooperation and adherence to the therapeutic regimen are enhanced through understanding. The nurse can most effectively reinforce and clarify information provided by the physician by being present during these discussions.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Accurate pain assessment is the foundation for pain management. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain management techniques are used to relieve pain and increase the patient's comfort level. The nurse works with the patient in designing the most effective pain management regimen, thereby increasing the patient's control over the pain. The nurse prepares the patient and gives support during painful procedures. Prescribed IV or epidural analgesics are used during the early postoperative period. Later, oral or transdermal opioid or nonopioid analgesics are usually adequate to relieve pain. In addition, external radiation or systemic radioisotopes may be used to control pain (see Chapter 13 for further discussion of pain management).

\section*{PREVENTING PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE}

Bone tumors weaken the bone to a point at which normal activities or even position changes can result in fracture. During nursing care, the affected extremities must be supported and handled gently. External supports (eg, splints) may be used for additional protection. At times, the patient may elect to have surgery (eg, open reduction with internal fixation, joint replacement) in an attempt to prevent pathologic fracture. Prescribed weight-bearing restrictions must be followed. The nurse teaches the patient how to use assistive devices safely and how to strengthen unaffected extremities.

\section*{PROMOTING COPING SKILLS}

The nurse encourages the patient and family to verbalize their fears, concerns, and feelings. They need to be supported as they deal with the impact of the malignant bone tumor. Feelings of shock, despair, and grief are expected. Referral to a psychiatric nurse liaison, psychologist, counselor, or spiritual advisor may be indicated for specific psychological help and emotional support.

\section*{PROMOTING SELF-ESTEEM}

Independence versus dependence is an issue for the patient who has a malignancy. Lifestyle is dramatically changed, at least temporarily. It is important to support the family in working through the adjustments that must be made. The nurse assists the patient in dealing with changes in body image due to surgery and possible amputation. It is helpful to provide realistic reassurance about the future and resumption of role-related activities and to encourage self-care and socialization. The patient participates in planning daily activities. The nurse encourages the patient to be as independent as possible. Involvement of the patient and family throughout treatment encourages confidence, restoration of self-concept, and a sense of being in control of one's life.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Delayed Wound Healing}

Wound healing may be delayed because of tissue trauma from surgery, previous radiation therapy, inadequate nutrition, or infection. The nurse minimizes pressure on the wound site to promote circulation to the tissues. An aseptic, nontraumatic wound dressing promotes healing. Monitoring and reporting of laboratory findings facilitate initiation of interventions to promote homeostasis and wound healing.

Repositioning the patient at frequent intervals reduces the incidence of skin breakdown due to pressure. Special therapeutic beds may be needed to prevent skin breakdown and to promote wound healing after extensive surgical reconstruction and skin grafting.

\section*{Inadequate Nutrition}

Because loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting are frequent side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, it is necessary to provide adequate nutrition for healing and health promotion. Antiemetics and relaxation techniques reduce the gastrointestinal reaction. Stomatitis is controlled with anesthetic or antifungal mouthwash (see Chap. 33). Adequate hydration is essential. Nutritional supplements or total parenteral nutrition may be prescribed to achieve adequate nutrition.

\section*{Osteomyelitis and Wound Infections}

Prophylactic antibiotics and strict aseptic dressing techniques are used to diminish the occurrence of osteomyelitis and wound infections. During healing, other infections (eg, upper respiratory infections) need to be prevented so that hematogenous spread does not result in osteomyelitis. If the patient is receiving chemotherapy, it is important to monitor the white blood cell count and to instruct the patient to avoid contact with people who have colds or other infections.

\section*{Hypercalcemia}

Hypercalcemia is a dangerous complication of bone cancer. The symptoms must be recognized and treatment initiated promptly. Symptoms include muscular weakness, incoordination, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, constipation, electrocardiographic changes (eg, shortened QT interval and ST segment, bradycardia, heart blocks), and altered mental states (eg, confusion, lethargy, psychotic behavior). See Chapter 14 for a full discussion of hypercalcemia and its management.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Preparation for and coordination of continuing health care are begun early as a multidisciplinary effort. Patient teaching addresses medication, dressing, treatment regimens, and the importance of physical and occupational therapy programs. The nurse teaches weight-bearing limitations and special handling to prevent pathologic fractures. It is important that the patient and family know the signs and symptoms of possible complications as well as resources available for continuing care (Chart 68-10).

\section*{Continuing Care}

Frequently, arrangements are made with a home health care agency for home care supervision and follow-up. The home care nurse assesses the patient's and family's abilities to meet the patient's needs and determines whether the services of other agencies are needed.

The nurse advises the patient to have readily available the telephone numbers of people to contact in case concerns arise.

The nurse emphasizes the need for long-term health supervision to ensure cure or to detect tumor recurrence or metastasis. If the patient has metastatic disease, end-of-life issues may need to be explored. Referral for hospice care is made if appropriate.

$I_{n}$njury to one part of the musculoskeletal system usually results in injury or dysfunction of adjacent structures and of structures enclosed or supported by them. If the bone is broken, the muscles cannot function, and blood vessels and nerves in the vicinity of the fracture may be injured. If the nerves do not send impulses to the muscles, as in paralysis, the bones cannot move. If the joint surfaces do not articulate normally, neither the bones nor the muscles can function properly.

Treatment of injury of the musculoskeletal system involves providing support to the injured part until healing is complete. Support may be provided by externally applied bandages, adhesive strapping, splints, or casts. Alternatively, support may be applied directly to the bone in the form of pins or plates. At times, traction must be applied to correct deformity or shortening.

After the immediate and the painful effects of the injury have passed, treatment efforts are focused on preventing fibrosis and stiffness in the injured muscles and joint structures. Proper exercise guards against this disability. In some cases, the support applied permits early activity. Various forms of physical and occupational therapy may hasten the healing process and recovery of function.

\section*{Contusions, Strains, and Sprains}

A contusion is a soft tissue injury produced by blunt force, such as a blow, kick, or fall. Many small blood vessels rupture and bleed into soft tissues (ecchymosis, or bruising). A hematoma develops when the bleeding is sufficient to cause an appreciable collection of blood. Local symptoms (pain, swelling, and discoloration) are controlled with intermittent application of cold. Most contusions resolve in 1 to 2 weeks.

A strain is a "muscle pull" caused by overuse, overstretching, or excessive stress. Strains are microscopic, incomplete muscle tears with some bleeding into the tissue. The patient experiences soreness or sudden pain, with local tenderness on muscle use and isometric contraction.

A sprain is an injury to the ligaments surrounding a joint that is caused by a wrenching or twisting motion. The function of a ligament is to maintain stability while permitting mobility. A torn ligament loses its stabilizing ability. Blood vessels rupture and edema occurs; the joint is tender, and movement of the joint becomes painful. The degree of disability and pain increases during the first 2 to 3 hours after the injury because of the associated swelling and bleeding. An x-ray should be obtained to rule out bone injury. Avulsion fracture (in which a bone fragment is
pulled away by a ligament or tendon) may be associated with a sprain.

\section*{Management}

Treatment of contusions, strains, and sprains consists of resting and elevating the affected part, applying cold, and using a compression bandage. (The acronym RICE-Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation-is helpful for remembering treatment interventions.) Rest prevents additional injury and promotes healing. Moist or dry cold applied intermittently for 20 to 30 minutes during the first 24 to 48 hours after injury produces vasoconstriction, which decreases bleeding, edema, and discomfort. Care must be taken to avoid skin and tissue damage from excessive cold. An elastic compression bandage controls bleeding, reduces edema, and provides support for the injured tissues. Elevation controls the swelling. If the sprain is severe (torn muscle fibers and disrupted ligaments), surgical repair or cast immobilization may be necessary so that the joint will not lose its stability. The neurovascular status (circulation, motion, sensation) of the injured extremity is monitored frequently.

After the acute inflammatory stage (eg, 24 to 48 hours after injury), heat may be applied intermittently (for 15 to 30 minutes, four times a day) to relieve muscle spasm and to promote vasodilation, absorption, and repair. Depending on the severity of injury, progressive passive and active exercises may begin in 2 to 5 days. Severe sprains may require 1 to 3 weeks of immobilization before protected exercises are initiated. Excessive exercise early in the course of treatment delays recovery. Strains and sprains take weeks or months to heal. Splinting may be used to prevent reinjury.

\section*{Joint Dislocations}

A dislocation of a joint is a condition in which the articular surfaces of the bones forming the joint are no longer in anatomic contact. The bones are literally "out of joint." A subluxation is a partial dislocation of the articulating surfaces. Traumatic dislocations are orthopedic emergencies because the associated joint structures, blood supply, and nerves are distorted and severely stressed. If the dislocation is not treated promptly, avascular necrosis (tissue death due to anoxia and diminished blood supply) and nerve palsy may occur.

Dislocations may be congenital, or present at birth (most often the hip); spontaneous or pathologic, caused by disease of the

Signs and symptoms of a traumatic dislocation are pain, change in contour of the joint, change in the length of the extremity, loss of normal mobility, and change in the axis of the dislocated bones. X-rays confirm the diagnosis and demonstrate any associated fracture.

\section*{Medical Management}

The affected joint needs to be immobilized while the patient is transported to the hospital. The dislocation is promptly reduced (ie, displaced parts are brought into normal position) to preserve joint function. Analgesia, muscle relaxants, and possibly anesthesia are used to facilitate closed reduction. The joint is immobilized by bandages, splints, casts, or traction and is maintained in a stable position. Neurovascular status is monitored. After reduction, if the joint is stable, gentle, progressive, active and passive movement is begun to preserve range of motion (ROM) and restore strength. The joint is supported between exercise sessions.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care is directed at providing comfort, evaluating the patient's neurovascular status, and protecting the joint during healing. The nurse teaches the patient how to manage the immobilizing devices and how to protect the joint from reinjury.

\section*{Sports-Related Injuries}

Many people participate in recreational sports. These recreational athletes may push themselves beyond the level of their physical conditioning and incur injuries. Injuries to the musculoskeletal system may be acute (eg, sprains, strains, dislocations, fractures), or they may be gradual, resulting from overuse (eg, chondromalacia patella, tendinitis, stress fractures). Professional athletes are also susceptible to injury, even though their training is supervised closely to minimize the occurrence of injury.
- Contusions result from direct falls or blows. The initial dull pain becomes greater, with edema and stiffness occurring by the next day.
- Sprains commonly occur in fingers, ankles, and knees. If the ligament damage is major, the joint becomes unstable, and surgical repair may be required. In addition, an avulsion fracture may exist.
- Strains manifest with a sharp, stabbing pain caused by bleeding and immediate protective muscle contraction. Tennis players often suffer calf muscle strains; soccer players often experience quadriceps strains; and swimmers, weight lifters, and tennis players often suffer shoulder strains.
- Tendinitis (inflammation of a tendon) is caused by overuse and is seen in tennis players (epicondylar tendinitis, or "tennis elbow"), in runners and gymnasts (Achilles tendinitis), and in basketball players (infrapatellar tendinitis).
- Meniscal injuries of the knee occur with excessive rotational stress.
- Dislocations are seen with sports that involve throwing or lifting.
- Fractures occur with falls. Skaters and bikers frequently suffer Colles' fractures of the wrist when they fall on outstretched arms; ballet dancers and track and field athletes may experience metatarsal fractures. Stress fractures occur with repeated bone trauma from activities such as jogging, gymnastics, basketball, and aerobics. The tibias, fibulas, and metatarsals are most vulnerable.

Patients who have experienced a sports-related injury are often highly motivated to return to their previous level of activity. Compliance with restriction of activities and gradual resumption of activities may be a significant problem for these patients. They need to be taught how to avoid further injury or new injury. With recurrence of symptoms, they need to diminish their level and intensity of activity to a comfortable level and to treat the symptoms with RICE. The time required to recover from a sports-related injury can be as short as a few days or longer than 6 weeks.

\section*{Prevention}

Sports-related injuries can be prevented by the use of proper equipment (eg, running shoes for joggers, wrist guards for skaters) and by effectively training and conditioning of the body. Specific training needs to be tailored to the person and the sport. Warm-up routines generally include walking or slow jogging for about 5 minutes, followed by slow, gradual stretching. The athlete holds the stretch for 10 seconds before relaxing and repeating the stretch (Fig. 69-1). Preparing the body for sport activities increases the person's flexibility and decreases the incidence of strains and sprains.

After exercise, the body needs to cool off to prevent cardiovascular problems such as hypotension, syncope, and dysrhythmias. Changes in activities and stresses should occur gradually. In addition, the athlete needs to be taught to "tune in" to body symptoms

EIGURE 69-1 Stretching exercises. Slow, gradual stretching (after walking to warm the muscles) increases flexibility and decreases the incidence of sprains and strains. Lower extremity stretches include (A) quadriceps stretch; (B) heel cord stretch; (C) hamstring stretch; and (D) hamstring and quadriceps stretch.

that indicate stress and to modify activities to minimize injury and to promote healing.

\section*{ROTATOR CUFF TEARS}

Rotator cuff tears may result from an acute injury or from chronic joint stresses. Patients complain of pain, limited ROM, and some joint dysfunction, including muscle weakness. In many cases, the patient with a rotator cuff tear experiences night pain and is unable to sleep on the involved side. The patient is unable to perform over-the-head activities. The acromioclavicular joint is tender. X-rays are helpful in evaluating the joint. Arthrography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to determine soft tissue pathology and the extent of the rotator cuff tear.

\section*{Medical Management}

Initial conservative management includes use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, rest with modification of activities, injection of a corticosteroid into the shoulder joint, and progressive stretching, ROM, and strengthening exercises. Some rotator cuff tears require arthroscopic débridement (removal of devitalized tissue) or arthroscopic or open acromioplasty with tendon repair. Postoperatively, the shoulder is immobilized for several days to 4 weeks. Physical therapy with shoulder exercises is begun as prescribed, and the patient is instructed in how to perform the exercises at home. Full recovery is expected in 6 to 12 months.

\section*{EPICONDYLITIS (TENNIS ELBOW)}

Epicondylitis is a chronic, painful condition that is caused by excessive, repetitive extension, flexion, pronation, and supination activities of the forearm. These excessive, repetitious activities result in inflammation (tendinitis) and minor tears in the tendons at the origin of the muscles on the medial or lateral epicondyles. Activities contributing to the development of epicondylitis include tennis, racket sports, pitching, gymnastics, and repetitive use of a screwdriver. The pain characteristically radiates down the extensor (dorsal) surface of the forearm. The patient may have a weakened grasp. Most often, relief is obtained by rest and avoidance of the aggravating activity.

\caption{FIGURE 69-2 Knee ligaments. (A) Anterolateral view. (B) Posterolateral view.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Medical Management}

Application of ice after the activity and administration of NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, usually relieve the pain. In some instances, the arm is immobilized in a molded splint or cast. Because of its degenerative effects on tendons, local injection of a corticosteroid is reserved for patients with severe pain who do not respond to NSAIDs and immobilization. After pain subsides, rehabilitation exercises include gentle and gradually increased stretching of the tendons. A tennis elbow counterforce strap to limit extension of the elbow may be prescribed when activity is resumed. Occasionally, surgery may be needed to release strictures or to débride the joint.

\section*{LATERAL AND MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT INJURY}

Lateral and medial collateral ligaments of the knee (Fig. 69-2) provide stability at the sides of the knee. Injury to these ligaments occurs when the foot is firmly planted and the knee is struck-either medially, causing stretching and tearing injury to the lateral collateral ligament, or laterally, causing stretching and tearing injury to the medial collateral ligament. The patient experiences pain, joint instability, and inability to walk without assistance.

\section*{Medical Management}

Emergency management includes RICE. The joint is evaluated for fracture. Hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint) may develop, contributing to the pain. The joint fluid is aspirated to relieve pressure.

The treatment depends on the severity of the sprain. Conservative management includes limited weight bearing and use of protective elastic bandaging or a brace. As pain subsides, ROM exercise is encouraged. The patient's return to full activities, including sports, depends on return of motion, functional stability of the joint, and muscle strength.

If needed, surgical reconstruction may be performed immediately or delayed. Generally, the leg is immobilized, and weight bearing is restricted for 6 to 8 weeks. A progressive rehabilitation program helps to restore the function and strength of the knee. Rehabilitation requires many months, and the patient may need to wear a derotational brace while engaging in sports.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse provides patient teaching about proper use of ambulatory devices, the healing process, and activity limitation to promote healing. The nurse teaches the surgical patient about pain management, medications (analgesics, antibiotics), brace use, wound care, possible complications (eg, altered neurovascular status, infection, skin breakdown), and self-care.

\section*{ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURY}

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) of the knee stabilize forward and backward motion of the femur and tibia (see Fig. 69-2). These ligaments cross in the center of the knee. Injury occurs when the foot is firmly planted, the knee is hyperextended, and the person twists the torso and femur. The patient reports a pop or tearing sensation with this twisting injury. Usually, the ACL is torn. The patient experiences pain, joint instability, and pain with ambulation.

\section*{Medical Management}

Emergency management includes RICE. The joint is evaluated for fracture. Joint effusion and hemarthrosis require joint aspiration and wrapping with a compression elastic dressing.

Treatment depends on the severity of the injury and the effect of the injury on daily activities. Conservative treatment involves application of a brace, physical therapy, and avoidance of jumping activities. Surgical ACL reconstruction includes tendon repair with grafting and is performed as ambulatory arthroscopic surgery. After surgery, the patient is taught to control pain with oral opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, and cryotherapy (a cooling pad incorporated in a dressing). The patient is taught about monitoring neurovascular status of the leg, wound care, and signs of complications that need to be reported promptly to the surgeon. Exercises (ankle pumps, quadriceps sets, and hamstring sets) are encouraged during the early postoperative period. The nurse reinforces instruction about weight-bearing limits, exercise restrictions, and the use of a knee brace or immobilizer. The patient must protect the graft by complying with exercise restrictions. The physical therapist supervises progressive ROM and weight bearing (as the patient is permitted). Continuous passive motion may be helpful in restoring full ROM. Rehabilitation after surgery typically takes 6 to 12 months.

\section*{MENISCAL INJURIES}

In the knee, there are two crescent-shaped (semilunar) cartilages, called menisci, attached to the edge of the shallow articulating surface of the head of the tibia (see Fig. 69-2). Each meniscus moves slightly backward and forward to accommodate the condyles of the femur when the leg is flexed or extended. Normally, little twisting movement is permitted in the knee joint. In sports or accidents, twisting of the knee or repetitive squatting and impact may result in either tearing or detachment of the cartilage from its attachment to the head of the tibia.

These injuries leave loose cartilage in the knee joint that may slip between the femur and the tibia, preventing full extension of the leg. If this happens during walking or running, patients often describe their leg as "giving way" under them. Patients may hear or feel a click in the knee when they walk, especially when they extend the leg that is bearing weight, as in going upstairs. When
the cartilage is attached to the front and back of the knee but torn loose laterally (bucket-handle tear), it may slide between the bones to lie between the condyles and prevent full flexion or extension. As a result, the knee "locks." Meniscal injuries produce pain and disability because the patient never knows when the knee will malfunction. Also, the torn cartilage is an irritant in the joint, causing inflammation, chronic synovitis, and effusion.

\section*{Medical Management}

Initial conservative treatment includes immobilization of the knee, use of crutches, antiinflammatory agents, analgesics, and modification of activities to avoid those causing the symptoms. If symptoms persist, the damaged cartilage is surgically removed (meniscectomy) through a procedure in which the surgeon uses an arthroscope to visualize and repair the damage. After surgery, a pressure dressing is applied, and a knee-immobilizing splint may be required. The most common complication is an effusion into the knee joint, which produces marked pain. The physician may need to aspirate the joint to remove fluid and relieve the pressure. These patients are taught quadriceps-setting and ROM exercises. Additional exercises help to restore full function, stability, and strength. After arthroscopic meniscectomy, most patients resume activities in a day or two, and sports can be resumed in several weeks, as prescribed by the physician.

\section*{RUPTURE OF THE ACHILLES TENDON}

Traumatic rupture of the Achilles tendon, generally within the tendon sheath, occurs during activities when there is a sudden contraction of the calf muscle with the foot fixed firmly to the floor or ground. The patient experiences sharp pain and is unable to plantar flex the foot. Immediate surgical repair of complete Achilles tendon ruptures is usually recommended to obtain satisfactory results. After surgery, a cast or brace is used to immobilize the joint. In some situations, conservative management with a plantar-flexed cast for 6 to 8 weeks may be used. After immobilization, a heel lift is worn and progressive physical therapy to promote ankle ROM and strength is begun.

\section*{Fractures}

A fracture is a break in the continuity of bone and is defined according to its type and extent. Fractures occur when the bone is subjected to stress greater than it can absorb. Fractures are caused by direct blows, crushing forces, sudden twisting motions, and even extreme muscle contractions. When the bone is broken, adjacent structures are also affected, resulting in soft tissue edema, hemorrhage into the muscles and joints, joint dislocations, ruptured tendons, severed nerves, and damaged blood vessels. Body organs may be injured by the force that caused the fracture or by the fracture fragments.

\section*{Types of Fractures}

A complete fracture involves a break across the entire cross-section of the bone and is frequently displaced (removed from normal position). In an incomplete fracture (eg, greenstick fracture), the break occurs through only part of the cross-section of the bone. A comminuted fracture is one that produces several bone fragments. A closed fracture (simple fracture) is one that does not cause a break in the skin. An open fracture (compound, or complex,
fracture) is one in which the skin or mucous membrane wound extends to the fractured bone. Open fractures are graded according to the following criteria:
- Grade I is a clean wound less than 1 cm long.
- Grade II is a larger wound without extensive soft tissue damage.
- Grade III is highly contaminated, has extensive soft tissue damage, and is the most severe.
Fractures may also be described according to the anatomic placement of fragments, particularly if they are displaced or nondisplaced. Specific types of fractures are highlighted in Chart 69-1.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical manifestations of a fracture are pain, loss of function, deformity, shortening of the extremity, crepitus, and local swelling and discoloration. Not all of these clinical manifestations are present in every fracture. For example, many are not present with linear or fissure fractures or with impacted fractures. The diagnosis of a fracture is based on the patient's symptoms, the physical signs, and the x-ray findings. Usually, the patient reports having sustained an injury to the area.

\section*{PAIN}

The pain is continuous and increases in severity until the bone fragments are immobilized. The muscle spasm that accompanies fracture is a type of natural splinting designed to minimize further movement of the fracture fragments.

\section*{LOSS OF FUNCTION}

After a fracture, the extremity cannot function properly, because normal function of the muscles depends on the integrity of the bones to which they are attached. Pain contributes to the loss of function. In addition, abnormal movement (false motion) may be present.

\section*{DEFORMITY}

Displacement, angulation, or rotation of the fragments in a fracture of the arm or leg causes a deformity (either visible or palpable) that is detectable when the limb is compared with the uninjured extremity. Deformity also results from soft tissue swelling.

\section*{SHORTENING}

In fractures of long bones, there is actual shortening of the extremity because of the contraction of the muscles that are attached above and below the site of the fracture. The fragments often overlap by as much as 2.5 to 5 cm ( 1 to 2 inches).

\section*{CREPITUS}

When the extremity is examined with the hands, a grating sensation, called crepitus, can be felt. It is caused by the rubbing of the bone fragments against each other.

NURSING ALERT Testing for crepitus can produce further tissue damage and should be avoided.

\section*{SWELLING AND DISCOLORATION}

Localized swelling and discoloration of the skin (ecchymosis) occurs after a fracture as a result of trauma and bleeding into the tissues. These signs may not develop for several hours after the injury.

\section*{Emergency Management of Fractures}

Immediately after injury, whenever a fracture is suspected, it is important to immobilize the body part before the patient is moved. If an injured patient must be removed from a vehicle before splints can be applied, the extremity is supported above and below the fracture site to prevent rotation as well as angular motion.

Adequate splinting, including joints adjacent to the fracture, is essential. Movement of fracture fragments causes additional pain, soft tissue damage, and bleeding. Temporary, well-padded splints, firmly bandaged over clothing, serve to immobilize the fracture. Immobilization of the long bones of the lower extremities may be accomplished by bandaging the legs together, with the unaffected extremity serving as a splint for the injured one. In an upper extremity injury, the arm may be bandaged to the chest, or an injured forearm may be placed in a sling. The neurovascular status distal to the injury should be assessed to determine adequacy of peripheral tissue perfusion and nerve function.

With an open fracture, the wound is covered with a clean (sterile) dressing to prevent contamination of deeper tissues. No attempt is made to reduce the fracture, even if one of the bone fragments is protruding through the wound. Splints are applied for immobilization.

In the emergency department, the patient is evaluated completely. The clothes are gently removed, first from the uninjured side of the body and then from the injured side. The patient's clothing may be cut away. The fractured extremity is moved as little as possible to avoid more damage.

\section*{Medical Management of Fractures}

The principles of fracture treatment include reduction, immobilization, and regaining of normal function and strength through rehabilitation.

\section*{REDUCTION}

Reduction of a fracture ("setting" the bone) refers to restoration of the fracture fragments to anatomic alignment and rotation. Either closed reduction or open reduction may be used to reduce a fracture. The specific method selected depends on the nature of the fracture; however, the underlying principles are the same. Usually, the physician reduces a fracture as soon as possible to prevent loss of elasticity from the tissues through infiltration by edema or hemorrhage. In most cases, fracture reduction becomes more difficult as the injury begins healing.

Before fracture reduction and immobilization, the patient is prepared for the procedure; permission for the procedure is obtained, and an analgesic is administered as prescribed. Anesthesia may be administered. The injured extremity must be handled gently to avoid additional damage.

Closed Reduction. In most instances, closed reduction is accomplished by bringing the bone fragments into apposition (ie, placing the ends in contact) through manipulation and manual traction. The extremity is held in the desired position while the physician applies a cast, splint, or other device. Reduction under anesthesia with percutaneous pinning may be used. The immobilizing device maintains the reduction and stabilizes the extremity for bone healing. X-rays are obtained to verify that the bone fragments are correctly aligned.

Traction (skin or skeletal) may be used to effect fracture reduction and immobilization. Traction may be used until the patient is physiologically stable and able to withstand surgical fixation. Use of traction and the nursing management of a patient in traction are discussed more fully in Chapter 67.

\section*{Churrt \\ 69-7}

\section*{Specific Types of Fractures}

Open Reduction. Some fractures require open reduction. Through a surgical approach, the fracture fragments are reduced. Internal fixation devices (metallic pins, wires, screws, plates, nails, or rods) may be used to hold the bone fragments in position until solid bone healing occurs. These devices may be attached to the sides of bone, or they may be inserted through the bony fragments or directly into
the medullary cavity of the bone (Fig. 63-3). Internal fixation devices ensure firm approximation and fixation of the bony fragments.

\section*{IMMOBILIZATION}

After the fracture has been reduced, the bone fragments must be immobilized, or held in correct position and alignment, until

union occurs．Immobilization may be accomplished by external or internal fixation．Methods of external fixation include bandages， casts，splints，continuous traction，and external fixators．Metal implants used for internal fixation serve as internal splints to immobilize the fracture．

\section*{MAINTAINING AND RESTORING FUNCTION}

Reduction and immobilization are maintained as prescribed to pro－ mote bone and soft tissue healing．Swelling is controlled by elevat－ ing the injured extremity and applying ice as prescribed．Neuro－ vascular status（circulation，movement，sensation）is monitored， and the orthopedic surgeon is notified immediately if signs of neurovascular compromise are identified．Restlessness，anxiety，and discomfort are controlled with a variety of approaches，such as re－ assurance，position changes，and pain relief strategies，including use of analgesics．Isometric and muscle－setting exercises are encouraged to minimize disuse atrophy and to promote circulation．Participa－ tion in activities of daily living（ADLs）is encouraged to promote independent functioning and self－esteem．Gradual resumption of activities is promoted within the therapeutic prescription．With in－ ternal fixation，the surgeon determines the amount of movement and weight－bearing stress the extremity can withstand and pre－ scribes the level of activity．（See Nursing Process sections in Chap－ ter 67 for more information about caring for patients who have a cast，are in traction，or are undergoing orthopedic surgery．）

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PATIENTS WITH CLOSED FRACTURES}

The nurse encourages patients with closed（simple）fractures to re－ turn to their usual activities as rapidly as possible．The nurse teaches patients how to control swelling and pain associated with the frac－ ture and with soft tissue trauma and encourages them to be active within the limits of the fracture immobilization（Chart 69－2）．It is important to teach exercises to maintain the health of unaffected

\section*{四川道 \\ Chart 69－2 \\ Home Care Checklist Closed Fracture}

At the completion of the home care instruction，the patient or caregiver will be able to：

muscles and to increase the strength of muscles needed for transferring and for using assistive devices (eg, crutches, walker, special utensils). The nurse and physical therapist teach patients how to use assistive devices safely. Plans are made to help patients modify their home environment as needed and to secure personal assistance if necessary. Patient teaching includes self-care, medication information, monitoring for potential complications, and the need for continuing health care supervision. Fracture healing and restoration of full strength and mobility may take months.

\section*{PATIENTS WITH OPEN FRACTURES}

In an open fracture, there is risk of osteomyelitis, tetanus, and gas gangrene. The objectives of management are to prevent infection of the wound, soft tissue, and bone and to promote healing of soft tissue and bone. The nurse administers tetanus prophylaxis if indicated. Serial irrigation and débridement are used to remove anaerobic organisms. Intravenous antibiotics are prescribed to prevent or treat infection.

Prompt, thorough wound irrigation and débridement in the operating room are necessary. The wound is cultured. Devitalized bone fragments are removed. The fracture is carefully reduced and stabilized by external fixation (see Chapter 67) or intramedullary nails. Any damage to blood vessels, soft tissue, muscles, nerves, and tendons is treated.

With open fractures, primary wound closure is usually delayed. Heavily contaminated wounds are left unsutured and dressed with sterile gauze to permit swelling and wound drainage. Wound irrigation and débridement may be repeated, removing infected and devitalized tissue and increasing vascularity in the region. After it has been determined that infection is not present, the wound is closed in 5 to 7 days, and all dead space is obliterated by grafting of autogenous skin or a flap.

The nurse elevates the extremity to minimize edema. It is important to assess neurovascular status frequently. The nurse measures the patient's temperature at regular intervals and monitors the patient for signs of infection. In 4 to 8 weeks, bone grafting may be necessary to bridge bone defects and to stimulate bone healing.

\section*{Fracture Healing and Complications (Early and Delayed)}

Weeks to months are required for most fractures to heal. Many factors influence the speed with which fractures heal (Chart 69-3). The reduction of fracture fragments must be accurate and maintained to ensure healing. The affected bone must have an adequate blood supply. The type of fracture also affects healing time. In general, fractures of flat bones (pelvis, scapula) heal rapidly. Fractures at the ends of long bones, where the bone is more vascular and cancellous, heal more quickly than do fractures in areas where the bone is dense and less vascular (midshaft). Weight bearing stimulates healing of stabilized fractures of the long bones in the lower extremities.

If fracture healing is disrupted, bone union may be delayed or stopped completely. Factors that can impair fracture healing include inadequate fracture immobilization, inadequate blood supply to the fracture site or adjacent tissue, extensive space between bone fragments, interposition of soft tissue between bone ends, infection, and metabolic problems.

Complications of fractures fall into two categories-early and delayed. Early complications include shock, fat embolism, compartment syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, thromboembolism

\section*{Factors That Affect Fracture Healing}

Factors That Enhance Fracture Healing
- Immobilization of fracture fragments
- Maximum bone fragment contact
- Sufficient blood supply
- Proper nutrition
- Exercise: weight bearing for long bones
- Hormones: growth hormone, thyroid, calcitonin, vitamin D, anabolic steroids
- Electric potential across fracture

Factors That Inhibit Fracture Healing
- Extensive local trauma
- Bone loss
- Inadequate immobilization
- Space or tissue between bone fragments
- Infection
- Local malignancy
- Metabolic bone disease (eg, Paget's disease)
- Irradiated bone (radiation necrosis)
- Avascular necrosis
- Intra-articular fracture (synovial fluid contains fibrolysins, which lyse the initial clot and retard clot formation)
- Age (elderly persons heal more slowly)
- Corticosteroids (inhibit the repair rate)
(pulmonary embolism), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and infection. Delayed complications include delayed union and nonunion, avascular necrosis of bone, reaction to internal fixation devices, complex regional pain syndrome (formerly called reflex sympathetic dystrophy), and heterotrophic ossification.

\section*{SHOCK (EARLY)}

Hypovolemic or traumatic shock resulting from hemorrhage (both visible and nonvisible blood loss) and from loss of extracellular fluid into damaged tissues may occur in fractures of the extremities, thorax, pelvis, or spine. Because the bone is very vascular, large quantities of blood may be lost as a result of trauma, especially in fractures of the femur and pelvis. Treatment of shock consists of restoring blood volume and circulation, relieving the patient's pain, providing adequate splinting, and protecting the patient from further injury and other complications. (See Chapter 15 for a discussion of shock.)

\section*{FAT EMBOLISM SYNDROME (EARLY)}

After fracture of long bones or pelvis, multiple fractures, or crush injuries, fat emboli may develop. Fat embolism syndrome occurs most frequently in young adults (typically those 20 to 30 years of age) and elderly adults who experience fractures of the proximal femur. At the time of fracture, fat globules may move into the blood because the marrow pressure is greater than the capillary pressure or because catecholamines elevated by the patient's stress reaction mobilize fatty acids and promote the development of fat globules in the bloodstream. The fat globules (emboli) occlude the small blood vessels that supply the lungs, brain, kidneys, and other organs. The onset of symptoms is rapid, usually occurring within 24 to 72 hours, but may occur up to a week after injury.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Presenting features include hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and pyrexia. The respiratory distress response includes tachypnea, dyspnea, crackles, wheezes, precordial chest pain, cough, large amounts of thick white sputum, and tachycardia. Occlusion of a large number of small vessels causes the pulmonary pressure to rise. Edema and hemorrhages in the alveoli impair oxygen transport, leading to hypoxia. Arterial blood gas values show the partial pressure of oxygen ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) to be less than 60 mm Hg , with an early respiratory alkalosis and later respiratory acidosis. The chest x-ray shows a typical "snowstorm" infiltrate. Eventually, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and heart failure develop.

Cerebral disturbances (due to hypoxia and the lodging of fat emboli in the brain) are manifested by mental status changes varying from headache, mild agitation, and confusion to delirium and coma.

NURSING ALERT Subtle personality changes, restlessness, irritability, or confusion in a patient who has sustained a fracture are indications for immediate arterial blood gas studies.

With systemic embolization, the patient appears pale. Petechiae, possibly due to a transient thrombocytopenia, are noted in the buccal membranes and conjunctival sacs, on the hard palate, and over the chest and anterior axillary folds. The patient develops a temperature of more than $39.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (about $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ). Free fat may be found in the urine if emboli reach the kidneys. Kidney failure may develop.

\section*{Prevention and Management}

Immediate immobilization of fractures (including early surgical fixation), minimal fracture manipulation, adequate support for fractured bones during turning and positioning, and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance are measures that may reduce the incidence of fat emboli. The nurse monitors high-risk patients (adults between 20 and 30 years of age with long bone, pelvic, or multiple fractures or crush injuries, and elderly patients with femur fractures) to identify this problem. Prompt initiation of respiratory support is essential.

The objectives of management are to support the respiratory system, to prevent respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and to correct homeostatic disturbances. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Respiratory support is provided with oxygen given in high concentrations. Controlled-volume ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure may be used to prevent or treat pulmonary edema. Corticosteroids may be administered to treat the inflammatory lung reaction and to control cerebral edema. Vasoactive medications to support cardiovascular function are administered to prevent hypotension, shock, and interstitial pulmonary edema. Accurate fluid intake and output records facilitate adequate fluid replacement therapy. Morphine may be prescribed for pain and anxiety for the patient who is on a ventilator. In addition, the nurse provides calm reassurance to allay apprehension. The patient's response to therapy is closely monitored.

Because fat emboli are a major cause of death for patients with fractures, the nurse must recognize early indications of fat embolism syndrome and report them promptly to the physician. Respiratory support must be instituted early.

\section*{COMPARTMENT SYNDROME (EARLY)}

Compartment syndrome is a complication that develops when tissue perfusion in the muscles is less than that required for tissue viability. The patient complains of deep, throbbing, unrelenting pain, which is not controlled by opioids. This pain can be caused by (1) a reduction in the size of the muscle compartment because the enclosing muscle fascia is too tight or a cast or dressing is constrictive, or (2) an increase in muscle compartment contents because of edema or hemorrhage associated with a variety of problems (eg, fractures, crush injuries). The forearm and leg muscle compartments are involved most frequently. The pressure within a muscle compartment may increase to such an extent as to decrease microcirculation, causing nerve and muscle anoxia and necrosis. Permanent function can be lost if the anoxic situation continues for longer than 6 hours.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Frequent assessment of neurovascular function after fracture is essential. Sensory deficits include paresthesia, unrelenting pain, and hypoesthesia. Paresthesia (burning or tingling sensation) and numbness along the involved nerve are early signs of nerve involvement. Motion is evaluated by asking the patient to move fingers or toes distal to the potential problem. Motor weakness may occur as a late sign of nerve ischemia. No movement (paralysis) suggests nerve damage.

Peripheral circulation is evaluated by assessing color, temperature, capillary refill time, swelling, and pulses. Swelling (edema) reduces tissue perfusion. Cyanotic (blue-tinged) nail beds suggest venous congestion. Pale or dusky and cold fingers or toes and prolonged capillary refill time suggest diminished arterial perfusion. Edema may obscure the presence of arterial pulsation, and Doppler ultrasonography may be used to verify a pulse. Pulselessness is a sign of arterial occlusion, not of compartment syndrome, because the tissue pressure would need to be above the systolic blood pressure for major artery occlusion to occur.

As intracompartment pressure increases, the patient complains of deep, throbbing, unrelenting pain, which is greater than expected and not controlled by opioids. Passive stretching of the muscle causes acute pain. With continued nerve ischemia and edema, the patient experiences sensations of hypoesthesia (diminished sensitivity to stimulation) and then absence of feeling. Palpation of the muscle, if possible, reveals it to be swollen and hard. The actual tissue pressure can be measured by inserting a tissue pressuremeasuring device into the muscle compartment. (Normal pressure is 8 mm Hg or less.) Nerve and muscle tissues deteriorate as compartment pressure increases. Prolonged pressure of more than 30 mm Hg can result in compromised microcirculation. Nerve tissue is more sensitive than muscle to elevated tissue pressures. Paresthesia generally occurs before paralysis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Prompt management of acute compartment syndrome is essential. The physician needs to be notified immediately if neurovascular compromise is suspected. Delay may result in permanent nerve and muscle damage or even necrosis.

Compartment syndrome is managed by elevation of the extremity to the heart level, release of restrictive devices (dressings or cast), or both. If conservative measures do not restore tissue perfusion and relieve pain within 1 hour, a fasciotomy (surgical decompression with excision of the fibrous membrane that covers and separates muscles) may be needed to relieve the constrictive mus-
cle fascia. After fasciotomy, the wound is not sutured but instead is left open to permit the muscle tissues to expand; it is covered with moist, sterile saline dressings. The limb is splinted in a functional position and elevated, and prescribed passive ROM exercises are usually performed every 4 to 6 hours. In 3 to 5 days, when the swelling has resolved and tissue perfusion has been restored, the wound is débrided and closed (possibly with skin grafts).

\section*{OTHER EARLY COMPLICATIONS}

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolus (PE) are associated with reduced skeletal muscle contractions and bed rest. Patients with fractures of the lower extremities and pelvis are at high risk for thromboembolism. Pulmonary emboli may cause death several days to weeks after injury. (See Chapter 31 for a discussion of DVT; Chapter 30 for discussion of thromboembolism, and Chapter 23 for discussion of PE).

Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) includes a group of bleeding disorders with diverse causes, including massive tissue trauma. Manifestations of DIC include ecchymoses, unexpected bleeding after surgery, and bleeding from the mucous membranes, venipuncture sites, and gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. The treatment of DIC is discussed in Chapter 33.

All open fractures are considered contaminated. Surgical internal fixation of fractures carries a risk for infection. The nurse must monitor for and teach the patient to monitor for signs of infection, including tenderness, pain, redness, swelling, local warmth, elevated temperature, and purulent drainage. Infections must be treated promptly. Antibiotic therapy must be appropriate and adequate for prevention and treatment of infection.

\section*{DELAYED UNION AND NONUNION (DELAYED)}

Delayed union occurs when healing does not occur at a normal rate for the location and type of fracture. Delayed union may be associated with distraction (pulling apart) of bone fragments, systemic or local infection, poor nutrition, or comorbidity (eg, diabetes mellitus; autoimmune disease). Eventually, the fracture heals.

Nonunion results from failure of the ends of a fractured bone to unite. The patient complains of persistent discomfort and abnormal movement at the fracture site. Factors contributing to union problems include infection at the fracture site, interposition of tissue between the bone ends, inadequate immobilization or manipulation that disrupts callus formation, excessive space between bone fragments (bone gap), limited bone contact, and impaired blood supply resulting in avascular necrosis.

In nonunion, fibrocartilage or fibrous tissue exists between the bone fragments; no bone salts have been deposited. A false joint (pseudarthrosis) often develops at the site of the fracture. Nonunion most commonly occurs with fractures of the middle third of the humerus, the lower third of the tibia, and, in elderly people, the neck of the femur.

\section*{Medical Management}

The physician treats nonunion with internal fixation, bone grafting, electrical bone stimulation, or a combination of these therapies. Internal fixation stabilizes the bone fragments and ensures bone contact.

Bone grafts provide for osteogenesis, osteoconduction, or osteoinduction. Osteogenesis (bone formation) occurs after transplantation of bone containing osteoblasts. Osteoconduction is provision by
the graft of the structural matrix for ingrowth of blood vessels and osteoblasts. Osteoinduction is the stimulation of host stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts by several growth factors, including bone morphogenic proteins. Bone transplants undergo creeping substitution, a reconstructive process in which the bone transplant is gradually replaced by new bone.

During surgery the bone fragments are trimmed, infection (if present) is removed, and a bone graft is placed in the bony defect. The bone graft may be an autograft (tissue harvested from the donor for the donor, frequently from the iliac crest) or an allograft (tissue harvested from a donor other than the person who will receive it). The bone graft fills the bone gap, provides a lattice structure for invasion by bone cells, and actively promotes bone growth. The type of bone selected for grafting depends on function: cortical bone for structural strength, cancellous bone for osteogenesis, and corticocancellous bone for strength and rapid incorporation. Bone grafts may be chips, wedges, blocks, bone segments, or demineralized bone matrix. At times, autograft bone, allograft bone, and demineralized cortical matrix are combined to optimize graft incorporation and bone healing. Free vascularized bone autografts are grafted with their own blood supply, allowing for primary fracture healing.

After grafting, immobilization and non-weight bearing are required while the bone graft becomes incorporated and the fracture or defect heals. Depending on the type of bone grafted, healing may take from 6 to 12 months or longer. Bone grafting problems include wound or graft infection, fracture of the graft, and nonunion. Specific autograft problems include a limited quantity of bone available for harvest, increased surgery and anesthesia time, increased blood loss, and donor site pain, hematoma, and infection. Infrequent specific allograft problems include partial acceptance (lack of host and donor histocompatibility, which retards graft incorporation), graft rejection (rapid and complete resorption of the graft), and transmission of disease (rare).

Osteogenesis in nonunion may be stimulated by electrical impulses; the effectiveness is similar to that of bone grafting. Use of electrical impulses is not effective with large bone gaps or synovial pseudarthrosis. The electrical stimulation modifies the tissue environment, making it electronegative, which enhances mineral deposition and bone formation.

In some situations, pins that act as cathodes are inserted percutaneously, directly into the fracture site, and electrical impulses are directed to the fracture continuously. Direct current methods cannot be used when infection is present.

Another method for stimulating osteogenesis is noninvasive inductive coupling. Pulsing electromagnetic fields are delivered to the fracture for approximately 10 hours each day by an electromagnetic coil over the nonunion site (Fig. 69-4). During the electrical stimulation treatment period, which takes 3 to 6 months or longer, rigid fracture fixation with adequate support is needed.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with a nonunion has experienced an extended time in fracture treatment and frequently becomes frustrated with prolonged therapy. The nurse provides emotional support and encouragement to the patient and encourages compliance with the treatment regimen. The orthopedic surgeon evaluates the progression of bone healing with periodic x-rays.

Nursing care for the patient with a bone graft include pain management, monitoring the patient for signs of infection at the donor and recipient sites, and patient education. The nurse needs to reinforce information concerning the objectives of the bone graft, immobilization, non-weight bearing, wound care, signs of infection, and follow-up care with the orthopedic surgeon.

Nursing care for the patient with electrical bone stimulation focus on patient education that addresses immobilization, weight bearing restrictions, and correct daily use of the stimulator as prescribed.

\section*{AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF BONE (DELAYED)}

Avascular necrosis occurs when the bone loses its blood supply and dies. It may occur after a fracture with disruption of the blood supply (especially of the femoral neck). It is also seen with dislocations, bone transplantation, prolonged high-dosage corticosteroid therapy, chronic renal disease, sickle cell anemia, and other diseases. The devitalized bone may collapse or reabsorb. The patient develops pain and experiences limited movement. X-rays reveal calcium loss and structural collapse. Treatment generally consists of attempts to revitalize the bone with bone grafts, prosthetic replacement, or arthrodesis (joint fusion).

\section*{REACTION TO INTERNAL FIXATION DEVICES (DELAYED)}

Internal fixation devices may be removed after bony union has taken place. In most patients, however, the device is not removed unless it produces symptoms. Pain and decreased function are the prime indications that a problem has developed. Problems may include mechanical failure (inadequate insertion
and stabilization); material failure (faulty or damaged device); corrosion of the device, causing local inflammation; allergic response to the metallic alloy used; and osteoporotic remodeling adjacent to the fixation device (in which stress needed for bone strength is transferred to the device, causing a disuse osteoporosis). If the device is removed, the bone needs to be protected from refracture related to osteoporosis, altered bone structure, and trauma. Bone remodeling reestablishes the bone's structural strength.

\section*{COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME (DELAYED)}

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), formerly called reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), is a painful sympathetic nervous system problem. It occurs infrequently. When it does occur, it is most often in an upper extremity after trauma and is seen more often in women. Clinical manifestations of CRPS include severe burning pain, local edema, hyperesthesia, stiffness, discoloration, vasomotor skin changes (ie, fluctuating warm, red, dry and cold, sweaty, cyanotic), and trophic changes (ie, glossy, shiny skin; increased hair and nail growth). This syndrome is frequently chronic, with extension of symptoms to adjacent areas of the body. Disuse muscle atrophy and bone deossification (osteoporosis) occur with persistence of CRPS. Patients may exhibit ineffective individual coping related to the chronic pain.

\section*{Management}

Prevention may include elevation of the extremity after injury or surgery and selection of an immobilization device (eg, external fixator) that allows for the greatest ROM and functional use of the rest of the extremity. Early effective pain relief is the focus of management. Pain may need to be controlled with analgesics, anesthetic nerve blocks, or intravenous bisphosphonate pamidronate. NSAIDs, corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, and antidepressants are also used. With pain relief, the patient can participate in ROM exercises and functional use of the affected area. The nurse needs to help the patient cope with CRPS manifestations and explore multiple ways to control pain (see Chapter 13). The nurse avoids using the involved extremity for blood pressure measurements and venipunctures.

\section*{HETEROTROPHIC OSSIFICATION (DELAYED)}

Heterotrophic ossification (myositis ossificans) is the abnormal formation of bone, near bones or in muscle, in response to soft tissue trauma after blunt trauma, fracture, or total joint replacement. The muscle is painful, and normal muscular contraction and movement are limited. Early mobilization has been recommended. Indomethacin (Indocin) may be used prophylactically if deep muscle contusion has occurred. Usually, the bone lesion resorbs over time, but the abnormal bone eventually may need to be excised if symptoms persist.

\section*{Fractures of Specific Sites}

Injuries to the skeletal structure may vary from a simple linear fracture to a severe crushing injury. The type and location of the fracture and the extent of damage to surrounding structures determine the therapeutic management. Maximum functional recovery is the goal of management.

\section*{CLAVICLE}

Fracture of the clavicle (collar bone) is a common injury that results from a direct blow to the shoulder or a fall. Head or cervical spine injuries may occur with these fractures. The clavicle helps to hold the shoulder upward, outward, and backward from the thorax. Therefore, when the clavicle is fractured, the patient assumes a protective position, slumping the shoulders and immobilizing the arm to prevent shoulder movements. The treatment goal is to align the shoulder in its normal position by means of closed reduction and immobilization.

More than $80 \%$ of these fractures occur in the middle third of the clavicle. A clavicular strap, also called a figure-of-eight bandage (Fig. 69-5), may be used to pull the shoulders back, reducing and immobilizing the fracture. When a clavicular strap is used, the axillae are well padded to prevent a compression injury to the brachial plexus and the axillary artery. The nurse monitors the circulation and nerve function of both arms. A sling may be used to support the arm and to relieve pain. The patient may be permitted to use the arm for light activities within the range of comfort.

Fracture of the distal third of the clavicle, without displacement and ligament disruption, is treated with a sling and restricted motion of the arm. When a fracture in the distal third is accompanied by a disruption of the coracoclavicular ligament, there is displacement, which may be treated by open reduction and internal fixation.

Complications of clavicular fractures include trauma to the nerves of the brachial plexus, injury to the subclavian vein or artery

\end{figure}
from a bony fragment, and malunion (poorly aligned healing of the fractured bone). Malunion may be a cosmetic problem (eg, when low-neckline clothing is worn).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse cautions the patient not to elevate the arm above shoulder level until the ends of the bone have united (about 6 weeks) but encourages the patient to exercise the elbow, wrist, and fingers as soon as possible. When prescribed, shoulder exercises (Fig. 69-6) are performed to obtain full shoulder motion. Vigorous activity is limited for 3 months.

\section*{HUMERAL NECK}

Fractures of the proximal humerus may occur through either the anatomic or the surgical neck of the humerus. The anatomic neck is located just below the humeral head. The surgical neck is the region below the tubercles. Impacted fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus are seen most frequently in older women after a fall on an outstretched arm. These are essentially nondisplaced fractures. Active middle-aged patients who are injured in a fall may suffer severely displaced humeral neck fractures with associated rotator cuff damage.

The patient presents with the affected arm hanging limp at the side and supported by the uninjured hand. Neurovascular assessment of the extremity is essential to evaluate fully the extent of injury and the possible involvement of the neurovascular bundle (nerves and blood vessels) of the arm.

\section*{Medical Management}

Many impacted fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus are not displaced and do not require reduction. The arm is supported and immobilized by a sling and swathe that secure the supported arm to the trunk (Fig. 69-7). A soft pad is placed in the axilla to absorb moisture and avoid skin breakdown. Limitation of motion and stiffness of the shoulder occur with disuse. Therefore, pendulum exercises are begun as soon as tolerated by the patient. (In pendulum or circumduction exercises, the nurse or physical therapist instructs the patient to lean forward and allow the affected arm to abduct and rotate [see Fig. 69-6].) Early motion of the joint does not displace the fragments if motion is carried out within the limits imposed by pain.

These fractures require 6 to 10 weeks to heal, and the patient should avoid vigorous activity (eg, tennis) for an additional 4 weeks. Residual stiffness, aching, and some limitation of ROM may persist for 6 months or longer.

When a humeral neck fracture is displaced, treatment consists of closed reduction, open reduction with internal fixation, or replacement of the humeral head with a prosthesis. In this type of fracture, exercises are started only after a prescribed period of immobilization.

\section*{HUMERAL SHAFT}

Fractures of the shaft of the humerus are most frequently caused by (1) direct trauma that results in a transverse, oblique, or comminuted fracture, or (2) an indirect twisting force that results in a spiral fracture. The nerves and brachial blood vessels may be injured with these fractures. Wrist drop is indicative of radial nerve injury. Initial neurovascular assessment is essential to identify nerve or blood vessel injury, which requires immediate attention.

\section*{Medical Management}

Initially, well-padded splints, overwrapped with an elastic bandage, are used to immobilize the upper arm and to support the arm in 90 degrees of flexion at the elbow. A sling or collar and cuff support the forearm. The weight of the hanging arm and splints reduce the
fracture. External fixators are used to treat open fractures of the humeral shaft (see Chapter 67). Open reduction with internal fixation of a fracture of the humerus is necessary with nerve palsy, blood vessel damage, comminuted fracture, or pathologic fracture.

Functional bracing is another form of treatment used for these fractures. A contoured thermoplastic sleeve is secured in

place with interlocking fabric (Velcro) closures around the upper arm, immobilizing the reduced fracture. As swelling decreases, the sleeve is tightened, and uniform pressure and stability are applied to the fracture. The forearm is supported with a collar and cuff sling (Fig. 69-8). Functional bracing allows active use of muscles, shoulder and elbow motion, and good approximation of fracture fragments. Pendulum shoulder exercises are performed as prescribed to provide active movement of the shoulder, thereby preventing adhesions of the shoulder joint capsule. Isometric exercises may be prescribed to prevent muscle atrophy. The callus that develops is substantial, and the sleeve can be discontinued in about 8 weeks. Complications that are seen with humeral shaft fractures include delayed union and nonunion.

\section*{ELBOW}

Fractures of the distal humerus result from motor vehicle crashes, falls on the elbow (in the extended or flexed position), or a direct blow. These fractures may result in injury to the median, radial, or ulnar nerves.

The patient is evaluated for paresthesia and signs of compromised circulation in the forearm and hand. The most serious complication of a supracondylar fracture of the humerus is Volkmann's ischemic contracture (a compartment syndrome), which results from antecubital swelling or damage to the brachial artery (Chart 69-4). The nurse needs to monitor the patient regularly for compromised neurovascular status and signs of compartment syndrome.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-084.jpg?height=570&width=864&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=1121)

Other potential complications are damage to the joint articular surfaces and hemarthrosis (blood in the joint). If hemarthrosis is present, the physician may aspirate the joint to remove the blood, thereby relieving the pressure and pain.

\section*{Management}

The goal of therapy is prompt reduction and stabilization of the distal humerus fracture, followed by controlled active motion after swelling has subsided and healing has begun. If the fracture is not displaced, the arm is immobilized in a cast or posterior splint with the elbow at 45 to 90 degrees of flexion and in a sling for 4 to 6 weeks. Then a thermoplastic splint is used to support the fracture and rehabilitation exercises are begun.

Usually, a displaced fracture is treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Excision of bone fragments may be necessary. Additional external support with a splint is then applied. Active finger exercises are encouraged. Gentle ROM exercise of the injured joint is begun about 1 week after internal fixation. Motion promotes healing of injured joints by producing movement of synovial fluid into the articular cartilage. Active exercise of the elbow is performed as prescribed to prevent residual limitation of motion.

\section*{RADIAL HEAD}

Radial head fractures are common and are usually produced by a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow extended.

\section*{Management}

If blood has collected in the elbow joint (hemarthrosis), it is aspirated to relieve pain and to allow early active elbow and forearm ROM. Immobilization for these undisplaced fractures is accomplished with a splint. The patient is instructed not to lift with the arm for approximately 4 weeks. If the fracture is displaced, surgery is required, with excision of the radial head when necessary. Postoperatively, the arm is immobilized in a posterior plaster splint and sling. The patient is encouraged to carry out a program of active motion of the elbow and forearm when prescribed.

\section*{RADIAL AND ULNAR SHAFTS}

Fractures of the shaft of the bones of the forearm occur most frequently in children. The radius or the ulna may be fractured at any level. Frequently, displacement occurs when both bones
are broken. The forearm's unique functions of pronation and supination must be preserved with good anatomic position and alignment.

\section*{Management}

If the fragments are not displaced, the fracture is treated by closed reduction with a long arm cast applied from the upper arm to the proximal palmar crease. A loop may be incorporated in the cast near the elbow and a sling pulled through it to prevent the cast from sagging against the forearm.

The circulation, motion, and sensation of the hand are assessed after the cast is applied. The arm is elevated to control edema. Frequent finger flexion and extension are encouraged to reduce edema. Active motion of the involved shoulder is essential. The reduction and alignment are monitored closely by x-rays to ensure adequate immobilization. The fracture is immobilized for about 12 weeks; during the last 6 weeks, the arm may be in a functional forearm brace that allows exercise of the wrist and elbow. Lifting and twisting are avoided.

Displaced fractures are managed by open reduction with internal fixation, using a compression plate with screws, intramedullary nails, or rods. The arm is usually immobilized in a plaster splint or cast. Open fractures may be managed with external fixation devices. The arm is elevated to control swelling. Neurovascular status is monitored. Elbow, wrist, and hand exercises are begun as permitted by the immobilization device.

\section*{WRIST}

Fractures of the distal radius (Colles' fracture) are common and are usually the result of a fall on an open, dorsiflexed hand. This fracture is frequently seen in elderly women with osteoporotic bones and weak soft tissues that do not dissipate the energy of the fall. The patient presents with a deformed wrist, radial deviation, pain, swelling, weakness, limited finger ROM, and numbness.

\section*{Management}

Treatment usually consists of closed reduction and immobilization with a short arm cast. For fractures with extensive comminution or impaction, open reduction and internal fixation, arthroscopic percutaneous pinning, or external fixation is used to achieve and maintain reduction and to allow for early functional rehabilitation. The wrist and forearm are elevated for 48 hours after reduction to control swelling.

Active motion of the fingers and shoulder should begin promptly. The patient is taught to do the following exercises to reduce swelling and prevent stiffness:
- Hold the hand at the level of the heart.
- Move the fingers from full extension to flexion. Hold and release. (Repeat at least 10 times every hour when awake.)
- Use the hand in functional activities.
- Actively exercise the shoulder and elbow, including complete ROM exercises of both joints.

Morris, N. (2000). Distal radius fracture in adults: Self-reported physical functioning, role functioning, and meaning of injury. Orthopaedic Nursing, 19(4), 37-48.

\section*{Purpose}

Distal radius fracture commonly affects women and their activities of daily living, work productivity, and overall functioning. Having a better understanding of the impact of this injury will enable the nurse to more effectively provide direct care and respond to specific needs of the patient and family.

This study explored (1) differences in physical function, role function, and meaning of injury during the first 3 months of recovery from distal radius fracture; (2) the relationships of age, gender, hand dominance, education, preinjury physical health, and treatment modality to differences in physical function, role function, and meaning of injury; and (3) differences in the patterns of change over time.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A descriptive, prospective, repeated measures design was used to study adults who had sustained fractures of the distal radius. A convenience sample of 60 adults with distal radius fracture completed the study. Seventy-two percent of the subjects were women, and $28 \%$ were men. Forty-eight percent were young adults ( 18 to 44 years of age), $27 \%$ were middle-age adults ( 45 to 64 years), and $25 \%$ were older adults ( 65 to 87 years). Forty-five percent of the subjects were college graduates. Treatment modalities were a surgical approach ( $53 \%$ ) and a nonsurgical approach ( $47 \%$ ).

Data were collected at the first office visit after fracture, at removal of the immobilizing device, and at the next office visit after device removal.

Several instruments were used to measure the dependent variables of physical function, role function, and meaning of illness/injury (MOI). The relationships of gender, age, education, hand dominance, preinjury physical health, and treatment modality to these dependent variables were analyzed.

Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.

\section*{Results}
- Over time, there was an improvement in physical function and role function for all subjects. Dependency on others for help with daily activities and injury interference with work and social activities decreased over time.
- Physical function and role function were found to be significantly better among the younger adults ( $p<.001$ ). Middle-age adults experienced greater emotional problems that interfered with work and other daily activities until the immobilizing device was removed. The lower role function observed in middle-age adults may be explained by the multiple demands placed on this age group. The younger and older adults may have had fewer demands on their time. A greater ability to work was observed among those subjects with a higher-level education; they may have had more resources, greater problem-solving abilities, and occupations in which they could work to some extent while their arm was immobilized. Overall, physical function and role function were not affected by gender, hand dominance, education, preinjury physical health, or treatment modality.
- There was a significant change in the MOI score with removal of the immobilization device. This finding suggested that patients were able to acknowledge the disruption and reframe their current situation. There was no significant change in MOI score after this time point.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The nurse needs to assess the patient's need for assistance for 6 to 8 weeks while the arm is immobilized. Older adults need greater assistance in meeting self-care needs. Younger adults need less help to perform daily activities while the wrist is immobilized. Middle-age adults may have greater problems in dealing with their usual multiple demands.

The fingers may swell due to diminished venous and lymphatic return. The nurse assesses the sensory function of the median nerve by pricking the distal aspect of the index finger. The motor function is assessed by the patient's ability to touch the thumb to the little finger. Diminished circulation and nerve function must be treated promptly by release of constricting bandages.

\section*{HAND}

Trauma to the hand often requires extensive reconstructive surgery. The objective of treatment is always to regain maximum function of the hand.

\section*{Management}

For an undisplaced fracture of the phalanx (finger bone), the finger is splinted for 3 to 4 weeks to relieve pain and to protect the finger from further trauma. Displaced fractures and open fractures may require open reduction with internal fixation, using wires or pins.

The neurovascular status of the injured hand is evaluated. Swelling is controlled by elevation of the hand. Functional use of the uninvolved portion of the hand is encouraged.

\section*{PELVIS}

The sacrum, ilium, pubis, and ischium bones form the pelvic bone, a fused, stable, bony ring in adults (Fig. 69-9). Falls, motor vehicle crashes, and crush injuries can cause pelvic fractures. Pelvic fractures are serious because at least two thirds of affected patients have significant and multiple injuries. Management of severe, life-threatening pelvic fractures is coordinated with the trauma team. Hemorrhage and thoracic, intra-abdominal, and cranial injuries have priority over treatment of fractures. There is a high mortality rate associated with pelvic fractures, related to hemorrhage, pulmonary complications, fat emboli, intravascular coagulation, thromboembolic complications, and infection.

Pelvic fracture symptoms include ecchymosis; tenderness over the symphysis pubis, anterior iliac spines, iliac crest, sacrum, or coccyx; local swelling; numbness or tingling of pubis, genitals, and proximal thighs; and inability to bear weight without discomfort. Computed tomography of the pelvis helps to determine
the extent of injury by demonstrating sacroiliac joint disruption, soft tissue trauma, pelvic hematoma, and fractures. Neurovascular assessment of the lower extremities is completed to detect injury to pelvic blood vessels and nerves.

Hemorrhage and shock are two of the most serious consequences that may occur. Bleeding arises from the cancellous surfaces of the fracture fragments, from laceration of veins and arteries by bone fragments, and possibly from a torn iliac artery. The peripheral pulses of both lower extremities are palpated; absence of pulses may indicate a torn iliac artery or one of its branches. Peritoneal lavage may be performed to detect intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The patient is handled gently to minimize further bleeding and shock.

The nurse assesses for injuries to the bladder, rectum, intestines, other abdominal organs, and pelvic vessels and nerves. To assess for urinary tract injury, the patient's urine is examined for blood. A voiding cystourethrogram and an intravenous urogram may be performed. Laceration of the urethra is suspected in males with anterior fracture of the pelvis and blood at the urethral meatus. (Females rarely experience a lacerated urethra.) A catheter should not be inserted until the status of the urethra is known. Abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis suggest injury to the intestines or abdominal bleeding. Paralytic ileus may accompany pelvic fractures.

Numerous classification systems have been used to describe pelvic fractures in relation to anatomy, stability, and mechanism of injury. Some fractures of the pelvis do not disrupt the pelvic ring; others disrupt the ring, which may be rotationally or vertically unstable. The severity of pelvic fractures varies. Long-term complications of pelvic fractures include malunion, nonunion, residual gait disturbances, and back pain from ligament injury.

\section*{Stable Pelvic Fractures}

Stable fractures of the pelvis (Fig. 69-10) include fracture of a single pubic or ischial ramus, fracture of ipsilateral pubic and ischial rami, fracture of the pelvic wing of ilium (ie, Duverney's fracture), and fracture of the sacrum or coccyx. Also, if injury results in only a slight widening of the pubic symphysis or the anterior sacroiliac joint and the pelvic ligaments are intact, the disrupted pubic symphysis is likely to heal spontaneously with conservative management. Most fractures of the pelvis heal rapidly because the pelvic bones are mostly cancellous bone, which has a rich blood supply.

\end{figure}

Stable pelvic fractures are treated with a few days of bed rest and symptom management until the pain and discomfort are controlled. The patient on bed rest is at risk for complications from immobility, including constipation, venous stasis, and pulmonary complications. Fluids, dietary fiber, ankle and leg exercises, elastic compression stockings to aid venous return, log rolling, coughing and deep breathing, and skin care reduce the risk for complications and increase the patient's comfort. The patient with a fractured sacrum is at risk for paralytic ileus, and bowel sounds should be monitored.

The patient with fracture of the coccyx experiences pain on sitting and with defecation. Sitz baths may be prescribed to relieve pain, and stool softeners may be given to prevent the need to strain on defection. As pain resolves, activity is gradually re-
sumed with the use of ambulatory aids (eg, crutches, walker) for protected weight bearing. Early mobilization reduces problems related to immobility.

\section*{Unstable Pelvic Fractures}

Unstable fractures of the pelvis (Fig. 69-11) may result in rotational instability (eg, the open book type, in which a separation occurs at the symphysis pubis with some sacral ligament disruption), vertical instability (eg, the vertical shear type, with superior-inferior displacement), or a combination of both. Lateral or anterior-posterior compression of the pelvis produces rotationally unstable pelvic fractures. Vertically unstable pelvic fractures occur when force is exerted on the pelvis vertically, as when the person falls from a height onto extended legs or is struck from above by a falling object. Vertical shear pelvic fractures involve the anterior and posterior pelvic ring with vertical displacement, usually through the sacroiliac joint. There is generally complete disruption of the posterior sacroiliac, sacrospinous, and sacrotuberous ligaments. Vertical displacement of the hemipelvis is usually evident.

Treatment of unstable pelvic fractures generally involves external fixation or open reduction and internal fixation. This promotes hemostasis, hemodynamic stability, comfort, and early mobilization.

\section*{Acetabulum}

Fractures of the acetabulum are seen after motor vehicle crashes in which the femur is jammed into the dashboard. Treatment depends on the pattern of fracture. Stable, nondisplaced fractures and fractures that involve minimal articular weight bearing may be managed with traction and protective (toe touch) weight bearing. Displaced and unstable acetabular fractures are treated with open reduction, joint débridement, and internal fixation or arthroplasty. Internal fixation permits early non-weight-bearing ambulation and ROM exercise. Complications seen with acetabular fractures include nerve palsy, heterotopic ossification, and posttraumatic arthritis.

eral frailty due to age, and conditions that produce decreased cerebral arterial perfusion (transient ischemic attacks, anemia, emboli, cardiovascular disease, effects of medications) contribute to the incidence of falls. The patient who has sustained a hip fracture frequently has a comorbidity (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, endocrine). Often, a fractured hip is a catastrophic event that will have a negative impact on the patient's lifestyle and quality of life.

There are two major types of hip fracture. Intracapsular fractures are fractures of the neck of the femur. Extracapsular fractures are fractures of the trochanteric region (between the base of the neck and the lesser trochanter of the femur) and of the subtrochanteric region (Fig. 69-12). Fractures of the neck of the femur may damage the vascular system that supplies blood to the head and the neck of the femur, and the bone may die. For this reason, nonunion or aseptic necrosis is common in patients with femoral neck fractures.

Extracapsular intertrochanteric fractures have an excellent blood supply and heal readily. However, extensive soft tissue damage

Feldt, K., \& Oh, H. (2000). Pain and hip fracture outcomes for older adults. Orthopaedic Nursing, 19(6), 35-44.

\section*{Purpose}

Many older adults experience hip fracture. Several factors (eg, age, prefracture functioning, mental status) have been identified as having an effect on functional outcome after surgery. This study focused on postoperative pain as a possible predictor of functional outcome at 2 months after surgery.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A convenience sample of 85 patients, age 65 years or older, who were hospitalized for hip fracture and treated surgically with reduction achieved by screws or pins or with a joint prosthesis, was studied. All patients were able to walk independently (with or without ambulatory aid) before fracture. Almost all of the patients were female ( $90.6 \%$ ); most were admitted from home (76.5\%) and had used no ambulatory aid (60\%).

This descriptive, comparative study included a patient interview on postoperative day 2 or 3 and a second interview at 2 months after surgery to determine functional outcomes.

Variables included demographics, mental status, pain assessment and report, use of analgesics, illness severity (ie, comorbidities, complications), and functional status/dependency as measured by the Functional Status Index.

\section*{Results}
- Almost half of the patients were identified as cognitively impaired based on the Mini Mental State Examination. These patients were older and had a higher illness severity score.
- Almost two thirds of the patients reported that they had pain. However, significantly more of the cognitively intact patients, compared with cognitively impaired patients ( $71.1 \%$ versus $48.6 \%$, respectively; $p<.05$ ) responded "Yes" to the question, "Do you have pain?" This finding may suggest that cognitively impaired patients do not remember intermittent pain experienced with movement. When patients were asked to describe their pain, many subjects noted hip pain as well as pain from other sources (eg, osteoarthritis). Comparison of pain at rest and pain with movement was statistically significant
( $p<.0001$ ) for both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired patients.
- There was no difference between cognitively intact and cognitively impaired groups regarding prescribed analgesics and administered analgesics. However, nurses administered less than $25 \%$ of the prescribed prn medications to both groups. The study also identified that the mean amount of acetaminophen prescribed was well above the recommended guidelines. Patients were prescribed prn opioid/acetaminophen combination medications as well as prn acetaminophen.
- Functional status declined for patients after hip fracture. Preoperatively, $64 \%$ of the cognitively intact patients and $54 \%$ of the cognitively impaired patients could walk without any assistive devices; postoperatively, only $29 \%$ and 5\%, respectively, were able to ambulate without assistive devices. At 2 months after surgery, functional status scores were lower for the cognitively impaired group.
- Stepwise regression analysis showed that age, mental status, illness severity, and report of pain with movement explained 51\% of the variance in functional score. Pain with movement accounted for $8 \%$ of this variance.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Postoperative pain with movement affects functional outcomes for patients with hip fracture. Better management of postoperative pain is required for better functional outcomes.

Pain reported by patients with hip fracture may be intermittent and may be caused by problems other than the hip fracture and surgery (eg, osteoarthritis). Most pain assessments are performed with the patient at rest; however, pain is more intense with movement. Managing pain associated with movement and administering pain medication before moving and before physical therapy sessions may help to improve the outcome.

In addition, the nurse should be aware of the amount of acetaminophen in combination medications and should monitor patients, especially those with liver dysfunction, for intake of acetaminophen that exceeds the recommended maximum daily dose.
may have occurred at the time of injury. It is not uncommon for the fracture to be comminuted and unstable. There is a fairly high mortality rate after intertrochanteric hip fractures, mainly because the patients are usually elderly (70 to 85 years of age) and are poor surgical candidates.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

With fractures of the femoral neck, the leg is shortened, adducted, and externally rotated. The patient complains of pain in the hip and groin or in the medial side of the knee. With most fractures of the femoral neck, the patient is unable to move the leg without a significant increase in pain. The patient is most comfortable with the leg slightly flexed in external rotation. Impacted intracapsular femoral neck fractures cause moderate discomfort (even with movement), may allow the patient to bear weight, and may not demonstrate obvious shortening or rotational changes. With extracapsular femoral fractures of the trochanteric or subtrochanteric regions, the extremity is significantly shortened, externally rotated to a greater degree than intracapsular fractures, exhibits muscle spasm that resists positioning of the extremity in a neutral position, and has an associated large hematoma or area of ecchymosis. The diagnosis of fractured hip is confirmed with x-ray.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Hip fractures are a frequent contributor to death after the age of 75 years. Stress and immobility related to the trauma predispose the older adult to pneumonia, sepsis, and reduced ability to cope with other health problems.

Many elderly people hospitalized with hip fracture are confused as a result of the stress of the trauma, unfamiliar surroundings, sleep deprivation, medications, and systemic illness. Preoperative predictors of postoperative delirium include age older than 70 years, alcohol abuse, impaired cognitive status, poor functional status, and markedly abnormal serum sodium, potassium, or glucose concentrations. In addition, confusion that develops in some elderly patients may be caused by mild cerebral ischemia. Other factors associated with confusion include responses to medications and anesthesia, malnutrition, dehydration, infectious processes, mood disturbances, and blood loss.

To prevent complications, the nurse must assess the elderly patient for chronic conditions that require close monitoring. Examination of the legs may reveal edema due to heart failure or peripheral pulselessness from arteriosclerotic vascular disease. Similarly, chronic respiratory problems may be present and may contribute to the possible development of inadequate pulmonary ventilation. Coughing and deep-breathing exercises are encouraged. Frequently, elderly people are taking cardiac, antihypertensive, or respiratory medications that need to be continued. The patient's responses to these medications should be monitored.

Dehydration and poor nutrition may be present. At times, elderly people who live alone are unable to summon help at the time of injury. A day or two may pass before assistance is provided, and as a result, dehydration occurs. Dehydration contributes to hemoconcentration and predisposes to thromboembolism. Therefore, the patient needs to be encouraged to consume adequate fluids and a healthy diet.

Muscle weakness and wasting may have contributed to the fall and fracture in the first place. Bed rest and immobility will cause an additional loss of muscle strength unless the nurse encourages
the patient to move all joints except the involved hip and knee. Patients are encouraged to use their arms and the overhead trapeze to reposition themselves. This strengthens the arms and shoulders, which facilitates walking with assistive devices.

\section*{Medical Management}

Temporary skin traction, Buck's extension, may be applied to reduce muscle spasm, to immobilize the extremity, and to relieve pain. The findings of a recent study (Jerre et al., 2000) suggested that there is no benefit to the routine use of preoperative skin traction for patients with hip fractures and that the use of skin traction should be based on evaluation of the individual patient.

The goal of surgical treatment of hip fractures is to obtain a satisfactory fixation so that the patient can be mobilized quickly and avoid secondary medical complications. Surgical treatment consists of (1) open or closed reduction of the fracture and internal fixation, (2) replacement of the femoral head with a prosthesis (hemiarthroplasty), or (3) closed reduction with percutaneous stabilization for an intracapsular fracture. Surgical intervention is carried out as soon as possible after injury. The preoperative objective is to ensure that the patient is in as favorable a condition as possible for the surgery. Displaced femoral neck fractures may be treated as emergencies, with reduction and internal fixation performed within 12 to 24 hours after fracture. This minimizes the effects of diminished blood supply and reduces the risk for avascular necrosis.

After general or spinal anesthesia, the hip fracture is reduced under x-ray visualization using an image intensifier. A stable fracture is usually fixed with nails, a nail-and-plate combination, multiple pins, or compression screw devices (Fig. 69-13). The orthopedic surgeon determines the specific fixation device based on the fracture site or sites. Adequate reduction is important for fracture healing (the better the reduction, the better the healing).

Hemiarthroplasty (replacement of the head of the femur with a prosthesis) is usually reserved for fractures that cannot be satisfactorily reduced or securely nailed or to avoid complications of nonunion and avascular necrosis of the head of the femur. Total hip replacement (see Chap. 67) may be used in selected patients with acetabular defects.

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Management}

The immediate postoperative care for a patient with a hip fracture is similar to that for other patients undergoing major surgery (see Care of the Patient Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery in Chap. 20 and Chap. 67). Attention is given to pain management, prevention of secondary medical problems, and early mobilization of the patient so that independent functioning can be restored.

During the first 24 to 48 hours, relief of pain and prevention of complications are priorities. The nurse encourages deep breathing, coughing, and foot flexion exercises every 1 to 2 hours. Thighhigh elastic compression stockings and pneumatic compression devices are used to prevent venous stasis. The nurse administers prescribed intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and monitors the patient's hydration, nutritional status, and urine output. A pillow is placed between the legs to maintain abduction and alignment and to provide needed support when turning the patient.

\section*{REPOSITIONING THE PATIENT}

The nurse may turn the patient onto the affected or unaffected extremity as prescribed by the physician. The standard method involves placing a pillow between the patient's legs to keep the affected leg in an abducted position. The patient is then turned

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
onto the side while proper alignment and supported abduction are maintained.

\section*{PROMOTING STRENGTHENING EXERCISE}

The patient is encouraged to exercise as much as possible by means of the overbed trapeze. This device helps strengthen the arms and shoulders in preparation for protected ambulation (eg, toe touch, partial weight bearing). On the first postoperative day, the patient transfers to a chair with assistance and begins assisted ambulation. The amount of weight bearing that can be permitted depends on the stability of the fracture reduction. The physician prescribes the degree of weight bearing and the rate at which the patient can progress to full weight bearing. Physical therapists work with the patient on transfers, ambulation, and the safe use of a walker and crutches.

The patient who has experienced a fractured hip can anticipate discharge to home or to an extended care facility with the use of an ambulatory aid. Some modifications in the home may be needed to permit safe use of walkers and crutches and for the patient's continuing care.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Elderly people with hip fractures are particularly prone to complications that may require more vigorous treatment than the fracture. In some instances, shock proves fatal. Achievement of homeostasis after injury and after surgery is accomplished through careful monitoring and collaborative management, including adjustment of therapeutic interventions as indicated.

Neurovascular complications may occur from direct injury to nerves and blood vessels or from increased tissue pressure. With hip fracture, bleeding into the tissues is expected. Excessive swelling may be observed. Therefore, the nurse must monitor the neurovascular status of the affected leg.

Deep vein thrombosis is the most common complication. To prevent DVT, the nurse encourages intake of fluids and ankle and
foot exercises. Elastic compression stockings, sequential compression devices, and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy may be prescribed. The nurse assesses the patient's legs at least every 4 hours for signs of DVT.

Pulmonary complications are a threat to elderly patients undergoing hip surgery. Deep-breathing exercises, a change of position at least every 2 hours, and the use of an incentive spirometer help to prevent respiratory complications. The nurse assesses breath sounds at least every 4 to 8 hours to detect adventitious or diminished sounds.

Skin breakdown is often seen in elderly patients with hip fracture. Blisters caused by tape are related to the tension of soft tissue edema under the nonelastic tape. An elastic hip spica wrap dressing (Fig. 69-14) or elastic tape applied in a vertical fashion may reduce the incidence of tape blisters. In addition, patients with hip fractures tend to remain in one position and may develop pressure ulcers. Proper skin care, especially on the heels, back, sacrum, and shoulders, helps to relieve pressure. High-density foam, static air, or another type of special mattress may provide protection by distributing pressure more evenly.

Loss of bladder control (incontinence) may occur. In general, the routine use of an indwelling catheter is avoided because of the high risk for urinary tract infection. If a catheter is inserted at the time of surgery, it usually is removed on the morning of the first postoperative day. Because urinary retention is common after surgery, the nurse must assess the patient's voiding patterns. To ensure proper urinary tract function, the nurse encourages liberal fluid intake within the cardiovascular tolerance of the patient.

Delayed complications of hip fractures include infection, nonunion, avascular necrosis of the femoral head (particularly with femoral neck fractures), and fixation device problems (eg, protrusion of the fixation device through the acetabulum, loosening of hardware). Infection is suspected if the patient complains of persistent, moderate discomfort in the hip and has a mildly elevated sedimentation rate. The nursing management of the elderly patient with a hip fracture is summarized in the Plan of Nursing Care.

\end{figure}

\section*{HEALTH PROMOTION}

Osteoporosis screening of patients who have experienced hip fracture is important for prevention of future fractures. With dualenergy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan screening, the actual risk for additional fracture can be determined. Specific patient education regarding dietary requirements, lifestyle changes, and exercise to promote bone health is needed. Specific therapeutic interventions need to be initiated to retard additional bone loss and to build bone mineral density. Studies have shown that health care providers caring for patients with hip fractures fail to diagnose or treat these patients for osteoporosis despite the high probability that hip fractures are secondary to osteoporosis (Kamel, et al., 2000). Fall prevention is also important and may be achieved through exercises to improve muscle tone and balance and through the elimination of environmental hazards. In addition, the use of hip protectors that absorb or shunt impact forces may help to prevent an additional hip fracture if the patient were to fall.

\section*{FEMORAL SHAFT}

Considerable force is required to break the shaft of the femur in adults. Most femoral fractures are seen in young adults who have been involved in a motor vehicle crash or who have fallen from a high place. Frequently, these patients have associated multiple traumas.

The patient presents with an enlarged, deformed, painful thigh and cannot move the hip or the knee. The fracture may be transverse, oblique, spiral, or comminuted. Frequently, the patient de-
velops shock, because the loss of 2 to 3 units of blood into the tissues is common with these fractures. An expanding diameter of the thigh may indicate continued bleeding. Refer to Figure 69-15A for the types of femoral fractures.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment includes checking the neurovascular status of the extremity, especially circulatory perfusion of the lower leg and foot (popliteal, posterior tibial, and pedal pulses and toe capillary refill time). A Doppler ultrasound monitoring device may be needed to assess blood flow. Dislocation of the hip and knee may accompany these fractures. Knee effusion suggests ligament damage and possible instability of the knee joint.

\section*{Medical Management}

Continued neurovascular monitoring is needed. The fracture is immobilized so that additional soft tissue damage does not occur. Generally, skeletal traction (Fig. 69-15 B and C) or splinting is used to immobilize fracture fragments until the patient is physiologically stable and ready for open reduction and internal fixation procedures.

Internal fixation usually is carried out within a few days after injury. Intramedullary locking nail devices are used for midshaft (diaphyseal) fractures. Depending on the supracondylar fracture pattern, intramedullary nailing or screw plate fixation may be used. Internal fixation permits early mobilization. A thigh cuff orthosis may be used for external support. To preserve muscle strength, the patient is instructed to exercise the lower leg, foot, toes, and hip on a regular basis. Active muscle movement enhances healing by increasing blood supply and electrical potentials at the fracture site. Prescribed weight-bearing limits are based on the fracture pattern. Physical therapy includes ROM and strengthening exercises, safe use of ambulatory aids, and gait training. Functional ambulation stimulates fracture healing. Healing time is 4 to 6 months.

Compression plates and intramedullary nails may need to be removed after 12 to 18 months due to reaction or loosening. After plates are being removed, a thigh cuff orthosis is used for several months to provide support while bone remodeling occurs.

Infrequently, because of patient risks associated with anesthesia and surgery, middle shaft and distal (supracondylar) fractures may be managed with skeletal traction. Between 2 and 4 weeks after injury, when pain and swelling have subsided, the patient is removed from skeletal traction and placed in a cast brace. The cast brace is a total contact device (ie, encircles the limb) and holds the reduced fracture. The muscle, through hydrodynamic compression, stabilizes the bone and stimulates healing. Minimal partial weight bearing is begun and is progressed to full weight bearing as tolerated. The cast brace is worn for 12 to 14 weeks.

An external fixator may be used if the patient has experienced an open fracture, has extensive soft tissue trauma, has lost bone, has an infection, or has hip and tibial fractures.

A common complication after fracture of the femoral shaft is restriction of knee motion. Active and passive knee exercises begin as soon as possible, depending on the management approach and the stability of the fracture and knee ligaments. Other complications include malunion, delayed union or nonunion, pudendal nerve palsy, and infection.

2. Elevated temperature in the early postoperative period may be due to a respiratory problem.
3. Promote optimal ventilation. Coexisting respiratory conditions diminish lung expansion.
4. Reduced ventilatory efforts may diminish $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ when patient is on room air.
5. Promotes optimal ventilation. Diminishes pooling of respiratory secretions.
6. Liquefies respiratory secretions. Facilitates expectoration.
1. The skin becomes pale and feels cool with decreased tissue perfusion. Venous congestion may cause cyanosis.
2. After compression of the nail, rapid return of pink color indicates good capillary perfusion.
3. The trauma of surgery will cause swelling; excessive swelling and hematoma formation can compromise circulation and function; edema may be due to coexisting cardiovascular disease.
4. Minimizes dependent edema.
5. Surgical pain can be controlled; pain due to neurovascular compromise is refractory to treatment with analgesics.
6. With nerve ischemia, there will be pain on passive stretch.
7. Diminished pain and paresthesia may indicate nerve damage. Sensation in web between great and second toeperoneal nerve; sensation on sole of foot-tibial nerve.
8. Dorsiflexion of ankle and extension of toes indicate function of peroneal nerve. Plantar flexion of ankle and flexion of toes indicate functioning of tibial nerve.
9. Indicates circulatory status of extremities.
10. Function of extremity needs to be preserved.
1. Compression aids venous blood return and prevents stasis.
2. Skin care is necessary to avoid skin breakdown. Extended removal of stocking or device defeats purpose.
3. Pulses indicate arterial perfusion of extremity. With coexisting arteriosclerotic

\end{figure}

\section*{TIBIA AND FIBULA}

The most common fracture below the knee is one of the tibia (and fibula) that results from a direct blow, falls with the foot in a flexed position, or a violent twisting motion. Fractures of the tibia and fibula often occur in association with each other. The patient presents with pain, deformity, obvious hematoma, and considerable edema. Frequently, these fractures are open and involve severe soft tissue damage because there is little subcutaneous tissue in the area.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Peroneal nerve damage is assessed. If nerve function is impaired, the patient is unable to dorsiflex the great toe and has diminished sensation in the first web space. Tibial artery damage is assessed by evaluating pulses, skin temperature, and color and by testing the capillary refill response. Hemiarthrosis or ligament damage may occur with fracture near the joint.

The patient is monitored for an anterior compartment syndrome. Symptoms include pain unrelieved by medications and increasing with plantar flexion, tense and tender muscle lateral to tibial crest, and paresthesia.

\section*{Medical Management}

Most closed tibial fractures are treated with closed reduction and initial immobilization in a long leg walking cast or a patellar tendon-bearing cast. Reduction must be relatively accurate in relation to angulation and rotation. As with other lower extremity fractures, the leg should be elevated to control edema. Partial weight bearing is usually prescribed after 7 to 10 days. Activity decreases edema and increases circulation. The cast is changed to a short leg cast or brace in 3 to 4 weeks, which allows for knee motion. Fracture healing takes 6 to 10 weeks. At times it is difficult to maintain reduction, and percutaneous pins may be placed in the bone and held in position by an external fixator.

Comminuted fractures may be treated with skeletal traction, internal fixation with intramedullary nails or plates and screws,
or external fixation. External support may be used with internal fixation. Hip, foot, and knee exercises are encouraged within the limits of the immobilizing device. Partial weight bearing is begun when prescribed and is progressed as the fracture heals in 4 to 8 weeks.

Open fractures are treated with external fixation. Distal fractures with extensive soft tissue damage heal slowly and may require bone grafting.

Continued neurovascular evaluation is needed. The development of compartment syndrome requires prompt recognition and resolution to prevent permanent functional deficit. Other complications include delayed union, infection, impaired wound edge healing due to limited soft tissue, and loosening of the internal fixation hardware.

\section*{RIB}

Uncomplicated fractures of the ribs occur frequently in adults and usually result in no impairment of function. Because these fractures produce painful respiration, the patient tends to decrease respiratory excursions and refrains from coughing. As a result, tracheobronchial secretions are not mobilized, aeration of the lung is diminished, and a predisposition to pneumonia and atelectasis results. To help the patient cough and take deep breaths, the nurse may splint the chest with her hands. Occasionally, the physician administers intercostal nerve blocks to relieve pain and to permit productive coughing.

Chest strapping to immobilize the rib fracture is not used, because decreased chest expansion may result in pneumonia and atelectasis. The pain associated with rib fracture diminishes significantly in 3 or 4 days, and the fracture heals within 6 weeks. In addition to pneumonia and atelectasis, complications may include a flail chest, pneumothorax, and hemothorax. The management of patients with these conditions is discussed in Chapter 23.

\section*{THORACOLUMBAR SPINE}

Fractures of the thoracolumbar spine may involve (1) the vertebral body, (2) the laminae and articulating processes, and (3) the spinous processes or transverse processes. The T12 to L2 area of
the spine is most vulnerable to fracture. Fractures generally result from indirect trauma caused by excessive loading, sudden muscle contraction, or excessive motion beyond physiologic limits. Osteoporosis contributes to vertebral body collapse (compression fracture).

Stable spinal fractures are caused by flexion, extension, lateral bending, or vertical loading. The anterior structural column (vertebral bodies and disks) or the posterior structural column (neural arch, articular processes, ligaments) has been disrupted. Unstable fractures occur with fracture-dislocations and exhibit disruption of both anterior and posterior structural columns. The potential for neural damage exists.

The patient with a spinal fracture presents with acute tenderness, swelling, paravertebral muscle spasm, and change in the normal curves or in the gap between spinous processes. Pain is greater with moving, coughing, or weight bearing. Immobilization is essential until initial assessments have determined whether there is any spinal cord injury and whether the fracture is stable or unstable. Few spinal fractures are associated with neurologic deficits. If spinal cord injury with neurologic deficit does occur, it usually requires immediate surgery (laminectomy with spinal fusion) to decompress the spinal cord.

\section*{Medical Management}

Stable spinal fractures are treated conservatively with limited bed rest. The head of the bed is elevated less than 30 degrees until the acute pain subsides (several days). Analgesics are prescribed for pain relief. The patient is monitored for a transient paralytic ileus caused by associated retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Sitting is avoided until the pain subsides. A spinal brace or plastic thoracolumbar orthosis may be applied for support during progressive ambulation and resumption of activities.

The patient with an unstable fracture is treated with bed rest, possibly with the use of a special turning device (eg, Stryker frame) to maintain spinal alignment. Neurologic status is monitored closely during the preoperative and postoperative periods. Within 24 hours after fracture, open reduction, decompression, and fixation with spinal fusion and instrument stabilization are usually accomplished. Postoperatively, the patient may be cared for on the turning device or in a bed with a firm mattress. Progressive ambulation is begun a few days after surgery, with the patient using a body brace orthosis. Patient teaching emphasizes good posture, good body mechanics, and, after healing is sufficient, back-strengthening exercises. (Spinal cord injury is discussed in Chapter 63.)

\section*{Amputation}

Amputation is the removal of a body part, usually an extremity. Amputation of a lower extremity is often made necessary by progressive peripheral vascular disease (often a sequela of diabetes mellitus), fulminating gas gangrene, trauma (crushing injuries, burns, frostbite, electrical burns), congenital deformities, chronic osteomyelitis, or malignant tumor. Of all these causes, peripheral vascular disease accounts for most amputations of lower extremities. (See Chapter 31 for more information.)

Amputation is used to relieve symptoms, improve function, and save or improve the patient's quality of life. If the health care team communicates a positive attitude, the patient adjusts to the amputation more readily and actively participates in the rehabilitative plan, learning how to modify activities and how to use assistive devices for ADLs and mobility.

\section*{Levels of Amputation}

Amputation is performed at the most distal point that will heal successfully. The site of amputation is determined by two factors: circulation in the part, and functional usefulness (ie, meets the requirements for the use of the prosthesis).

The circulatory status of the extremity is evaluated through physical examination and specific studies. Muscle and skin perfusion is important for healing. Doppler flowmetry, segmental blood pressure determinations, and transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) are valuable diagnostic aids. Angiography is performed if revascularization is considered an option.

The objective of surgery is to conserve as much extremity length as possible. Preservation of knee and elbow joints is desired. Figure 69-16 shows the levels at which an extremity may be amputated. Almost any level of amputation can be fitted with a prosthesis.

The amputation of toes and portions of the foot causes minor changes in gait and balance. A Syme amputation (modified ankle disarticulation amputation) is performed most frequently for extensive foot trauma and produces a painless, durable extremity end that can withstand full weight-bearing. Below-knee amputations are preferred to above-knee amputations because of the importance of the knee joint and the energy requirements for walking. Knee disarticulations are most successful with young, active patients who are able to develop precise control of the prosthesis. When above-knee amputations are performed, all possible length is preserved, muscles are stabilized and shaped, and hip contractures are prevented for maximum ambulatory potential. Most people who have a hip disarticulation amputation must rely on a wheelchair for mobility.

Upper extremity amputations are performed to preserve the maximum functional length. The prosthesis is fitted early for maximum function.

A staged amputation may be used when gangrene and infection exist. Initially, a guillotine amputation is performed to remove the necrotic and infected tissue. The wound is débrided and allowed to drain. Sepsis is treated with systemic antibiotics. In a few days, after the infection has been controlled and the patient's condition has stabilized, a definitive amputation with skin closure is performed.

\section*{Complications}

Complications that may occur with amputation include hemorrhage, infection, skin breakdown, phantom limb pain, and joint contracture. Because major blood vessels have been severed, massive bleeding may occur. Infection is a risk with all surgical procedures. The risk for infection increases with contaminated wounds after traumatic amputation. Skin irritation caused by the prosthesis may result in skin breakdown. Phantom limb pain is caused by the severing of peripheral nerves. Joint contracture is caused by positioning and a protective flexion withdrawal pattern associated with pain and muscle imbalance.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objective of treatment is to achieve healing of the amputation wound, the result being a nontender residual limb (stump) with healthy skin for prosthesis use. Healing is enhanced by gentle handling of the residual limb, control of residual limb edema through rigid or soft compression dressings, and use of aseptic technique in wound care to avoid infection.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-099.jpg?height=1107&width=1396&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=309}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 69-16 Levels of amputation are determined by circulatory adequacy, type of prosthesis, function of the part, and muscle balance. (A) Levels of amputation of upper extremity. (B) Levels of amputation of lower extremity.}
\end{figure}

A closed rigid cast dressing is frequently used to provide uniform compression, to support soft tissues, to control pain, and to prevent joint contractures. Immediately after surgery, a sterilized residual limb sock is applied to the residual limb. Felt pads are placed over pressure-sensitive areas. The residual limb is wrapped with elastic plaster-of-paris bandages while firm, even pressure is maintained. Care is taken not to constrict circulation.

For the patient with a lower extremity amputation, the plaster cast may be equipped to attach a temporary prosthetic extension (pylon) and an artificial foot. This rigid dressing technique is used as a means of creating a socket for immediate postoperative prosthetic fitting. The length of the prosthesis is tailored to the individual patient. Early minimal weight bearing on the residual limb with a rigid cast dressing and a pylon attached produces little discomfort. The cast is changed in about 10 to 14 days. Elevated body temperature, severe pain, or a loose-fitting cast may necessitate earlier replacement.

A removable rigid dressing may be placed over a soft dressing to control edema, to prevent joint flexion contracture, and to protect the residual limb from unintentional trauma during transfer activities. This rigid dressing is removed several days after surgery for wound inspection and is then replaced to control edema. The dressing facilitates residual limb shaping.

A soft dressing with or without compression may be used if there is significant wound drainage and frequent inspection of the residual limb (stump) is desired. An immobilizing splint may be incor-
porated in the dressing. Stump (wound) hematomas are controlled with wound drainage devices to minimize infection.

\section*{Rehabilitation}

Patients who require amputation because of severe trauma are usually, but not always, young and healthy, heal rapidly, and participate in a vigorous rehabilitation program. Because the amputation is the result of an injury, the patient needs psychological support in accepting the sudden change in body image and in dealing with the stresses of hospitalization, long-term rehabilitation, and modification of lifestyle. Patients who undergo amputation need support as they grieve the loss, and they need time to work through their feelings about their permanent loss and change in body image. Their reactions are unpredictable and can include anger, bitterness, and hostility.

The multidisciplinary rehabilitation team (patient, nurse, physician, social worker, psychologist, prosthetist, vocational rehabilitation worker) helps the patient achieve the highest possible level of function and participation in life activities (Fig. 69-17). Prosthetic clinics and amputee support groups facilitate this rehabilitation process. Vocational counseling and job retraining may be necessary to help patients return to work.

Psychological problems (eg, denial, withdrawal) may be influenced by the type of support the patient receives from the rehabilitation team and by how quickly ADLs and use of the

EIGURE 69-17 Many amputees receive prostheses soon after surgery and begin learning how to use them with the help and support of the rehabilitation team, which includes nurses, physicians, physical therapists, and others.
prosthesis are learned. Knowing the full options and capabilities available with the various prosthetic devices can give the patient a sense of control over the disability.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING AN AMPUTATION}
Assessment

Before surgery, the nurse must evaluate the neurovascular and functional status of the extremity through history and physical assessment. If the patient has experienced a traumatic amputation, the nurse assesses the function and condition of the residual limb. The nurse also assesses the circulatory status and function of the unaffected extremity. If infection or gangrene develops, the patient may have associated enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and purulent drainage. A culture is taken to determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy.

The nurse evaluates the patient's nutritional status and creates a plan for nutritional care, if indicated. For wound healing, a balanced diet with adequate protein and vitamins is essential.

Any concurrent health problems (eg, dehydration, anemia, cardiac insufficiency, chronic respiratory problems, diabetes mellitus) need to be identified and treated so that the patient is in the best possible condition to withstand the trauma of surgery. The use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasoconstrictors, or vasodilators may influence management and wound healing.

The nurse assesses the patient's psychological status. Determination of the patient's emotional reaction to amputation is essential for nursing care. Grief response to a permanent alteration in body image is normal. An adequate support system and professional counseling can help the patient cope in the aftermath of amputation surgery.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to amputation
- Risk for disturbed sensory perception: phantom limb pain related to amputation
- Impaired skin integrity related to surgical amputation
- Disturbed body image related to amputation of body part
- Ineffective coping, related to failure to accept loss of body part
- Risk for anticipatory and/or dysfunctional grieving related to loss of body part
- Self-care deficit: feeding, bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, or toileting, related to loss of extremity
- Impaired physical mobility related to loss of extremity

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Postoperative hemorrhage
- Infection
- Skin breakdown

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals of the patient may include relief of pain, absence of altered sensory perceptions, wound healing, acceptance of altered body image, resolution of the grieving process, independence in self-care, restoration of physical mobility, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Surgical pain can be effectively controlled with opioid analgesics, nonpharmaceutical interventions, or evacuation of the hematoma or accumulated fluid. Pain may be incisional or may be caused by inflammation, infection, pressure on a bony prominence, or hematoma. Muscle spasms may add to the patient's discomfort. Changing the patient's position or placing a light sandbag on the residual limb to counteract the muscle spasm may improve the patient's level of comfort. Evaluation of the patient's pain and responses to interventions is an important part of the nurse's role in pain management. The pain may be an expression of grief and alteration of body image.

\section*{MINIMIZING ALTERED SENSORY PERCEPTIONS}

Amputees may experience phantom limb pain soon after surgery or 2 to 3 months after amputation. It occurs more frequently may in above-knee amputations. The patient describes pain or unusual sensations, such as numbness, tingling, or muscle cramps, as well as a feeling that the extremity is present, crushed, cramped, or twisted in an abnormal position. When a patient describes phantom pains or sensations, the nurse acknowledges these feelings and helps the patient modify these perceptions.

Phantom sensations diminish over time. The pathogenesis of the phantom limb phenomenon is unknown. Keeping the patient active helps decrease the occurrence of phantom limb pain. Early
intensive rehabilitation and stump desensitization with kneading massage brings relief. Distraction techniques and activity are helpful. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound, or local anesthetics may provide relief for some patients. In addition, beta-blockers may relieve dull, burning discomfort; antiseizure medications control stabbing and cramping pain; and tricyclic antidepressants are used to improve mood and coping ability.

\section*{PROMOTING WOUND HEALING}

The residual limb must be handled gently. Whenever the dressing is changed, aseptic technique is required to prevent wound infection and possible osteomyelitis.

NURSING ALERT If the cast or elastic dressing inadvertently comes off, the nurse must immediately wrap the residual limb with an elastic compression bandage. If this is not done, excessive edema will develop in a short time, resulting in a delay in rehabilitation. The nurse notifies the surgeon if a cast dressing comes off, so that another cast can be applied.

Residual limb shaping is important for prosthesis fitting. The nurse instructs the patient and family in wrapping the residual limb with elastic dressings (Figs. 69-18 and 69-19). After the incision is healed, the nurse teaches the patient to care for the residual limb.

\section*{ENHANCING BODY IMAGE}

Amputation is a reconstructive procedure that alters the patient's body image. The nurse who has established a trusting relationship with the patient is better able to communicate acceptance of the patient who has experienced an amputation. The nurse encourages the patient to look at, feel, and then care for the residual limb. It is important to identify the patient's strength and resources to facilitate rehabilitation. The nurse assists the patient to regain the previous level of independent functioning. The patient who is accepted as a whole person is more readily able to resume responsibility for self-care; self-concept improves, and body-image changes are accepted. Even with highly motivated patients, this process may take months.

\end{figure}

\section*{HELPING THE PATIENT TO RESOLVE GRIEVING}

The loss of an extremity (or part of one) may come as a shock even if the patient was prepared preoperatively. The patient's behavior (eg, crying, withdrawal, apathy, anger) and expressed feelings (eg, depression, fear, helplessness) will reveal how the patient is coping with the loss and working through the grieving process. The nurse acknowledges the loss by listening and providing support.

The nurse creates an accepting and supportive atmosphere in which the patient and family are encouraged to express and share their feelings and work through the grief process. The support from family and friends promotes the patient's acceptance of the loss. The nurse helps the patient deal with immediate needs and become oriented to realistic rehabilitation goals and future independent functioning. Mental health and support group referrals may be appropriate.

\section*{PROMOTING INDEPENDENT SELF-CARE}

Amputation of an extremity affects the patient's ability to provide adequate self-care. The patient is encouraged to be an active participant in self-care. The patient needs time to accomplish these tasks and must not be rushed. Practicing an activity with consistent, supportive supervision in a relaxed environment enables the patient to learn self-care skills. The patient and the nurse need to maintain positive attitudes and to minimize fatigue and frustration during the learning process.

Independence in dressing, toileting, and bathing (shower or tub) depends on balance, transfer abilities, and physiologic tolerance of the activities. The nurse works with the physical therapist and occupational therapist to teach and supervise the patient in these self-care activities.

The patient with an upper extremity amputation has self-care deficits in feeding, bathing, and dressing. Assistance is provided only as needed; the nurse encourages the patient to learn to do
these tasks, using feeding and dressing aids when needed. The nurse, therapists, and prosthetist work with the patient to achieve maximum independence.

\section*{HELPING THE PATIENT TO ACHIEVE PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Positioning assists in preventing the development of hip or knee joint contracture in the patient with a lower extremity amputation. Abduction, external rotation, and flexion of the lower extremity are avoided. Depending on the surgeon's preference, the residual limb may be placed in an extended position or elevated for a brief period after surgery. The foot of the bed is raised to elevate the residual limb.

1NURSING ALERT The residual limb should not be placed on a pillow, because a flexion contracture of the hip may result.

The nurse encourages the patient to turn from side to side and to assume a prone position, if possible, to stretch the flexor muscles and to prevent flexion contracture of the hip. The nurse discourages sitting for prolonged periods, to prevent flexion contracture. The legs should remain close together to prevent an abduction deformity.

Postoperative ROM exercises are started early, because contracture deformities develop rapidly. ROM exercises include hip and knee exercises for below-knee amputations and hip exercises for above-knee amputations. It is important that the patient understand the importance of exercising the residual limb.

The upper extremities, trunk, and abdominal muscles are exercised and strengthened. The extensor muscles in the arm and the depressor muscles in the shoulder play an important part in crutch walking. The patient uses an overhead trapeze to change position and strengthen the biceps. The patient may flex and
extend the arms while holding weights. Doing push-ups while seated strengthens the triceps muscles. Exercises, such as hyperextension of the residual limb, conducted under the supervision of the physical therapist or occupational therapist, also aid in strengthening muscles as well as increasing circulation, reducing edema, and preventing atrophy.

Because an upper extremity amputee uses both shoulders to operate the prosthesis, the muscles of both shoulders are exercised. A patient with an above-the-elbow amputation or shoulder disarticulation is likely to develop a postural abnormality caused by loss of the weight of the amputated extremity. Postural exercises are helpful.

Strength and endurance are assessed, and activities are increased gradually to prevent fatigue. As the patient progresses to independent use of the wheelchair, use of ambulatory aids, or ambulation with a prosthesis, the nurse emphasizes safety considerations. Environmental barriers (eg, steps, inclines, doors, wet surfaces) are identified, and methods of managing them are practiced. It is important to anticipate, identify and manage problems associated with the use of the mobility aids (eg, pressure on the axillae from crutches, skin irritation of the hands from wheelchair use, residual limb irritation from a prosthesis).

Amputation of the leg changes the center of gravity; therefore, the patient may need to practice position changes (eg, standing from sitting, standing on one foot). The patient is taught transfer techniques early and is reminded to maintain good posture when getting out of bed. A well-fitting shoe with a nonskid sole should be worn. During position changes, the patient should be guarded and stabilized with a transfer belt at the waist to prevent falling.

As soon as possible, the patient with a lower extremity amputation is assisted to stand between parallel bars to allow extension of the temporary prosthesis to the floor with minimal weight bearing. How soon after surgery the patient is allowed to touch down the artificial foot depends on the patient's physical status and wound healing. As endurance increases and balance is achieved, ambulation is started with the use of parallel bars or crutches. The patient learns to use a normal gait, with the residual limb moving back and forth while the patient is walking with the crutches. To prevent a permanent flexion deformity from occurring, the residual limb should not be held up in a flexed position.

The patient with an upper extremity amputation is taught how to carry out the ADLs with one arm. The patient is started on one-handed self-care activities as soon as possible. The use of a temporary prosthesis is encouraged. The patient who learns to use the prosthesis soon after the amputation is less dependent on one-handed self-care activities.

A patient with an upper extremity amputation may wear a cotton T-shirt to prevent contact between the skin and shoulder harness and to promote absorption of perspiration. The prosthetist advises about cleaning the washable portions of the harness. Periodically, the prosthesis is inspected for potential problems.

The residual limb must be conditioned and shaped into a conical form to permit accurate fit, maximum comfort, and function of the prosthetic device. Elastic bandages, an elastic residual limb shrinker, or an air splint is used to condition and shape the residual limb. The nurse teaches the patient or a member of the family the correct method of bandaging.

Bandaging supports the soft tissue and minimizes the formation of edema while the residual limb is in a dependent position. The bandage is applied in such a manner that the remaining muscles required to operate the prosthesis are as firm as possible, whereas those muscles that are no longer useful atrophy. An im-
properly applied elastic bandage contributes to circulatory problems and a poorly shaped residual limb.

Effective preprosthetic care is important to ensure proper fitting of the prosthesis. The major problems that can delay prosthetic fitting during this period are (1) flexion deformities, (2) nonshrinkage of the residual limb, and (3) abduction deformities of the hip.

The physician usually prescribes activities to condition or "toughen" the residual limb in preparation for a prosthesis. The patient begins by pushing the residual limb into a soft pillow, then into a firmer pillow, and finally against a hard surface. The patient is taught to massage the residual limb to mobilize the surgical incision site, decrease tenderness, and improve vascularity. Massage is usually started once healing has occurred and is first done by the physical therapist. Skin inspection and preventive care are taught.

The prosthesis socket is custom molded to the residual limb by the prosthetist. Prostheses are designed for specific activity levels and patient abilities. Types of prostheses include hydraulic, pneumatic, biofeedback-controlled, myoelectrically controlled, and synchronized prostheses.

Adjustments of the prosthetic socket are made by the prosthetist to accommodate the residual limb changes that occur during the first 6 months to 1 year after surgery. A light plaster cast, an elastic bandage, or a shrinking sock is used to limit edema during periods when the patient is not wearing the permanent prosthesis.

Some patients are not candidates for a prosthesis and are thus nonambulatory amputees. If use of a prosthesis is not possible, the patient is instructed in the use of a wheelchair to achieve independence. A special wheelchair designed for patients who have had amputations is recommended. Because of the decreased weight in the front, a regular wheelchair may tip backward when the patient sits in it. In an amputee wheelchair, the rear axle is set back about 5 cm (2 inches) to compensate for the change in weight distribution.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

After any surgery, efforts are made to reestablish homeostasis and to prevent problems related to surgery, anesthesia, and immobility. The nurse assesses body systems (eg, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary) for problems associated with immobility (eg, pneumonia, anorexia, constipation, urinary stasis) and institutes corrective management. Avoiding problems associated with immobility and restoring physical activity are necessary for maintenance of health.

Massive hemorrhage due to a loosened suture is the most threatening problem. The nurse monitors the patient for any signs or symptoms of bleeding. It is also important to monitor the patient's vital signs and to observe the suction drainage.

> NURSING ALERT Immediate postoperative bleeding may develop slowly or may take the form of a massive hemorrhage resulting from a loosened suture. A large tourniquet should be in plain sight at the patient's bedside so that, if severe bleeding occurs, it can be applied to the residual limb to control the hemorrhage. The nurse immediately notifies the surgeon in the event of excessive bleeding.

Infection is a frequent complication of amputation. Patients who have undergone traumatic amputation have a contaminated wound. The nurse administers antibiotics as prescribed. It is important to monitor the incision, dressing, and drainage for indications of infection (eg, change in color, odor, or consistency of drainage; increasing discomfort). The nurse also monitors for
systemic indicators of infection (eg, elevated temperature) and promptly reports indications of infection to the surgeon.

Skin breakdown may result from immobilization or from pressure from various sources. The prosthesis may cause pressure areas to develop. The nurse and the patient assess for breaks in the skin. Careful skin hygiene is essential to prevent skin irritation, infection, and breakdown. The healed residual limb is washed and dried (gently) at least twice daily. The skin is inspected for pressure areas, dermatitis, and blisters. If they are present, they must be treated before further skin breakdown occurs. Usually, a residual limb sock is worn to absorb perspiration and to prevent direct contact between the skin and the prosthetic socket. The sock is changed daily and must fit smoothly to prevent irritation caused by wrinkles. The socket of the prosthesis is washed with a mild detergent, rinsed, and dried thoroughly with a clean cloth. The nurse advises the patient that the socket must be thoroughly dry before the prosthesis is applied.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching the Patient to Manage Self-Care}

Before discharge to the home or to a rehabilitation facility, the nurse encourages the patient and family to become active participants in care. They participate, as appropriate, in skin care and residual limb care and in the management of the prosthesis. The patient receives ongoing instructions and practice sessions in learning how to transfer and how to use mobility aids and other assistive devices safely. The nurse explains the signs and symptoms of complications that must be reported to the physician (Chart 69-5)

\section*{Continuing Care in the Home and Community}

After the patient has achieved physiologic homeostasis and has demonstrated achievement of major health care goals, rehabilitation continues either in a rehabilitation facility or at home. Continued support and supervision by the home care nurse are essential.

Before the patient's discharge to the home, the nurse should assess the home environment. Modifications are made to ensure the
patient's continuing care, safety, and mobility. An overnight or weekend experience at home may be tried to identify problems that were not identified on the assessment visit. Physical therapy and occupational therapy may continue in the home or on an outpatient basis. Transportation to continuing health care appointments must be arranged. The social service department of the hospital or the community agency managing continued health care may be of great assistance in securing personal assistance and transportation services.

During follow-up health visits, the nurse evaluates the patient's physical and psychosocial adjustment. Periodic preventive health assessments are necessary. Frequently, an elderly spouse is unable to provide the assistance required, and additional help at home is needed. Modifications in the plan of care are made on the basis of such findings. Often, the patient and family find involvement in an amputee support group to be of value; here, they are able to share problems, solutions, and resources. Talking with those who have successfully dealt with a similar problem may help the patient develop a satisfactory solution.

Because patients and their family members and health care providers tend to focus on the most obvious needs and issues, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of continuing health promotion and screening practices, such as regular physical examinations and diagnostic screening tests. Those patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past are instructed in their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your church is participating in a women's soccer league and asks you to help out with first aid on the field. Common injuries you would expect include sprains, strains, and, possibly, dislocations and fractures. What specific assessment would you make to differentiate these problems? Discuss the emergency management for each of these problems. Explain your rationale for these emergency interventions.
2. A 46-year-old man experiences an open fracture of his right ankle while skiing. The orthopedic surgeon recommends surgery and external fixation. The patient asks why surgery is needed-a lot of his friends have broken their ankles, have not had surgery, and have just had a cast put on for a couple of weeks. What would you include in your
discussion of the need for surgery and external fixation? Describe the anticipated postoperative care, monitoring to prevent complications, and activity restrictions.
3. A middle-aged patient who had been hospitalized for 3 days with a fractured pelvis is making plans for discharge. His wife approaches you and expresses concern that he has become very irritable and that he "just doesn't seem to be himself." Analyze this information and identify the possible causes for this behavior. Describe additional data that you would seek to further assess the situation.
4. You make a home health care visit to a middle-aged patient with type 2 diabetes who had a partial foot amputation 4 days ago because of peripheral vascular disease and gangrene. What is the rationale for the assessment data you gather to assist you in determining the patient's progress? What findings might suggest that the patient is developing a problem? Describe your plan of action for each of these potential problems. What home environment factors would you include in your assessment of the home care situation?

\section*{Management of Patients With Infectious Diseases}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Differentiate between colonization, infection, and disease.
2. Use information obtained from the microbiology report to interpret infectious disease evidence.
3. Identify federal and local resources available to the nurse seeking information about infectious diseases.
4. Identify the merit of vaccines recommended for health care workers.
5. Identify the reasons for Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions and discuss recommended behaviors.
6. Describe the concept of emerging infectious diseases and factors that lead to the development of these diseases.
7. List potential biological warfare agents and describe recommended precautions
8. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with sexually transmitted disease.
9. Describe home health care measures that reduce the risk for infection.
10. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with infectious diseases.

$A_{n}$infectious disease is any disease caused by the growth of pathogenic microbes in the body. It may or may not be communicable (ie, contagious). Modern science has controlled, eradicated, or decreased the incidence of many infectious diseases. However, increases in other infections, such as those caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms and emerging infectious diseases, are of great concern. Examples of these types of infectious diseases are highlighted in this chapter. Other infectious diseases are discussed in the appropriate chapters, such as the information on tuberculosis (TB) found in Chapter 23.

It is important to understand infectious causes and treatment for contagious, serious, and common infections. Table $70-1$ presents an overview of many infectious diseases, their causative organisms, mode of transmission, and usual incubation periods (ie, time between contact and development of the first signs and symptoms).

The nurse has an important role in infection control and prevention activities. Educating patients may decrease their risk of becoming infected or may decrease the sequelae of infection. Using appropriate barrier precautions, observing prudent hand hygiene, and ensuring aseptic care of intravenous catheters and other interventional equipment also assists in reducing infections.

\section*{The Infectious Process}

A complete chain of events is necessary for infection to occur. Figure 70-1 illustrates the elements of the chain and identifies weak links where health care workers' interventions can interrupt the chain. The necessary elements of infection include the following:
- A causative organism
- A reservoir of available organisms
- A portal or mode of exit from the reservoir
- A mode of transmission from reservoir to host
- A susceptible host
- A mode of entry to host

\section*{ELEMENTS OF INFECTION}

\section*{Causative Organism}

The types of microorganisms that cause infections are bacteria, rickettsiae, viruses, protozoa, fungi, and helminths.

\section*{Reservoir}

Reservoir is the term used for any person, plant, animal, substance, or location that provides nourishment for microorganisms and enables further dispersal of the organism. Infections may be prevented by eliminating the causative organisms from the reservoir.

\section*{Mode of Exit}

The organism must have a mode of exit from a reservoir. An infected host must shed organisms to another or to the environment before transmission can occur. Organisms exit through the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, the genitourinary tract, and the blood.

\section*{Route of Transmission}

A route of transmission is necessary to connect the infectious source with its new host. Organisms may be transmitted through sexual contact, skin-to-skin contact, percutaneous injection, or
bacteremia: laboratory-proven presence of bacteria in the bloodstream
carrier: person who carries an organism without apparent signs and symptoms; one who is able to transmit an infection to others
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): federal agency responsible for monitoring endemic and epidemic disease, for recommending strategies to decrease disease incidence, and for developing guidelines to reduce risk to patients and health care workers
colonization: microorganisms present in or on a host, without host interference or interaction and without eliciting symptoms in the host
disease: state in which the infected host displays a decline in health due to the infection
emerging infectious diseases: human infectious diseases with incidence increased within the past two decades or potential increase in the near future
fungemia: a bloodstream infection caused by a fungal organism
high-level disinfection: removal of all microorganisms, with the possible exception of spores. This level of disinfection is appropriate for instruments that come in
contact with mucous membranes but that cannot be sterilized because of mechanical issues.
host: person who provides living conditions to support a microorganism
immune: person with protection from a previous infection or immunization who resists reinfection when re-exposed to the same agent
incubation period: time between contact and onset of signs and symptoms
infection: condition in which the host interacts physiologically and immunologically with a microorganism
latency: time interval after primary infection when a microorganism lives within the host without producing clinical evidence
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): Staphylococcus aureus bacterium that is not susceptible to extended-penicillin antibiotic formulas, such as methicillin, oxacillin, or nafcillin normal flora: persistent nonpathogenic organisms colonizing a host
nosocomial infection: infection acquired in the hospital that was not present or incubating at the time of hospital admission reservoir: any person, plant, animal, substance, or location that provides living
conditions for microorganisms and that enables further dispersal of the organism
Standard Precautions: strategy of assuming all patients may carry infectious agents and using appropriate barrier precautions for all health care worker-patient interactions
sterilization: complete removal of all microorganisms
susceptible: not possessing immunity to a particular pathogen
transient flora: organisms that have been recently acquired and are likely to be shed in a relatively short period
Transmission-Based Precautions: precautions used in addition to Standard Precautions when contagious or epidemiologically significant organisms are recognized. The three types of TransmissionBased Precautions are Airborne, Droplet, and Contact Precautions.
vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA): Staphylococcus aureus bacterium that is not susceptible to vancomycin
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE): Enterococcus bacterium that is resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin
virulence: degree of pathogenicity of an organism

\end{table}
infectious particles carried in the air. A person who carries, or transmits, an organism and who does not have apparent signs and symptoms of infection is called a carrier.

It is important to recognize that different organisms require specific routes of transmission for infection to occur. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is almost always transmitted by the airborne route. Health care providers do not "carry" M. tuberculosis bacteria on their hands or clothing. In contrast, bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus are easily transmitted from patient to patient on the hands of health care providers.

When appropriate, the nurse should explain routes of disease transmission to patients. For example, a nurse may explain that sharing a room with a patient who is infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not pose a risk because intimate contact (ie, sexual or parenteral) is necessary for transmission to occur.

\section*{Susceptible Host}

For infection to occur, the host must be susceptible (ie, not possessing immunity to a particular pathogen). Previous infection or vaccine administration may render the host immune (ie, not sus-
ceptible) to further infection with an agent. Many infections are prevented because of the powerful human immune defense. Although exposure to potentially infectious microorganisms occurs essentially on a constant basis, our elaborate immune systems generally prevent infection from occurring. The immune-suppressed person has much greater susceptibility than the normal, healthy host.

\section*{Portal of Entry}

A portal of entry is needed for the organism to gain access to the host. For example, airborne M. tuberculosis does not cause disease when it settles on the skin of an exposed host. The only entry route for the bacterium that is of concern is through the respiratory system.

\section*{COLONIZATION, INFECTION, AND DISEASE}

Relatively few anatomic sites (eg, brain, blood, bone, heart, vascular system) are sterile. Bacteria found throughout the body usually provide beneficial normal flora to compete with potential

The term colonization is used to describe microorganisms present without host interference or interaction. Understanding the principle of colonization facilitates interpretation of microbiologic reports. Organisms reported in microbiology results often reflect colonization rather than infection.

\section*{Infection}

Infection indicates a host interaction with an organism. A patient colonized with S. aureus may have staphylococci on the skin without any skin interruption or irritation. If the patient had an incision, $S$. aureus could enter the wound, with an immune system reaction of local inflammation and routing of white cells to the site. Clinical evidence of redness, heat, and pain and laboratory evidence of white cells on the wound specimen smear suggest infection. In this example, the host identifies the staphylococci as foreign. Infection is recognized by the host reaction and by organism identification.

\section*{Disease}

It is important to recognize the difference between infection and disease. Infectious disease is the state in which the infected host displays a decline in wellness due to the infection. When the host interacts immunologically with an organism but remains symptom free, the definition of disease has not been met. M. tuberculosis is an example of an organism that often persists as infection without producing disease. The host may become infected after exposure to the tubercle bacillus. The person is infected when bacteria are first detected by nonspecific immunologic recognition and later as newly sensitized T cells propagate daughter lines of TB-specific protective cells. After this initial infection, the untreated host has a low probability of actually becoming ill. About $90 \%$ of hosts infected with the M. tuberculosis do not develop TB, the disease. Figure 70-2 depicts response to bacterial infection at the cellular level and at the host level.

\section*{MICROBIOLOGY REPORT}

The primary source of information about most bacterial infections is the microbiology report. The microbiology report should be viewed as a tool to be used along with clinical indicators to determine whether a patient is colonized, infected, or diseased.

FIGURE 70-2 Biologic spectrum of response to bacterial infection at the cellular level (left) and of the intact host (right). Redrawn from Evans, A. S., \& Brachman, P. S. (1998). Bacterial infections in humans. New York: Plenum.

When specimens are sent to the laboratory for culture, results usually show three components: the smear and stain, the culture and organism identification, and the antimicrobial susceptibility (ie, sensitivity). As a marker for the likelihood of infection, the smear and stain generally provides the most helpful information because it describes the mix of cells present at the site at the time of specimen collection. Culture and sensitivity processes specify which organisms are recognized and which antibiotics inhibit growth.

\section*{Infection Control and Prevention}

\section*{ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN INFECTION PREVENTION}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are federal agencies involved in controlling and preventing infection.

\section*{Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}

The impact of infectious diseases changes through time as microorganisms mutate, as human behavior patterns shift, or as therapeutic options change. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) serve an important function in providing timely scientific recommendations about many of the situations that a nurse may face when caring for or teaching a patient with an infectious disease. The CDC routinely publishes recommendations, guidelines, and summaries. Through its Internet site (http://www. cdc.gov) and its weekly journal, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the CDC reports significant cases, outbreaks, environmental hazards, or other public health problems. Examples of important CDC guidelines and summaries are Guide-
lines for Preventing the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health Care Facilities, Recommendations for Prevention of HIV Transmission in Health Care Settings, Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, and Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices.

\section*{Occupational Safety and Health Administration}

In contrast to the CDC goal of disease reduction, the goal of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the reduction of risk exposure. CDC Guidelines are voluntary, whereas OSHA publishes mandatory regulations and imposes fines on those found to be noncompliant. OSHA requires that all health care providers have routine educational updates about prevention of bloodborne pathogens and about TB control. Because each health care institution is required to prepare and disseminate to its employees a bloodborne exposure plan and a TB exposure plan, nurses should be familiar with the details of control in their specific institutions.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION IN THE COMMUNITY}

Prevention and control of infection in the community are goals shared by the CDC and state and local public health departments. Much of public health emphasis is placed on prevention to avoid outbreaks and other situations that require control. Methods of infection prevention include sanitation techniques (eg, water purification, disposal of sewage and other potentially infectious materials), regulated health practices (eg, handling, storage, packaging, preparation of food by institutions), and immunization programs. In the United States, immunization programs have markedly decreased the incidence of infectious diseases.

\section*{Vaccination Programs}

The goal of vaccination programs is to use wide-scale efforts to prevent specific infectious diseases from occurring in a population. Public health decisions about vaccine campaign implementation efforts are complex. Risks and benefits for the individual and the community must be evaluated in terms of morbidity, mortality, and financial benefit.

The most successful vaccine programs are those for the prevention of smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. Concerns that smallpox may be reintroduced as an act of biowarfare have led to a decision that medical first responders and selected others should again receive small pox vaccine. Bioterrorism is addressed in Chapter 72.

More than 25 vaccines are licensed in the United States. Vaccines are made of antigen preparations in a suspension and are intended to produce a human immune response to protect the host from future encounters with the organism. No vaccine is completely safe for all recipients. Some people are allergic to the antigen or the carrier substance. When live organisms are used as antigen, the actual disease (often with a modified course) may follow. Contraindications on package inserts of a vaccine must be heeded. These guidelines detail studied experience with allergy and other complications and provide crucial information about refrigeration, storage, dosage, and administration.

Variations to the recommended vaccination schedule should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the patient's risk factors and ability to return for follow-up vaccinations at the appointed time. For example, although the first dose of measles vaccine is recommended at the age of 12 to 15 months, babies in developing countries (where measles contributes significantly to childhood morbidity and mortality) should be vaccinated at 9 months.

The standard recommended vaccination schedule for infants and children as developed by the CDC is shown in Table 70-2. The schedule is revised as epidemiologic evidence warrants, and nurses are advised to consult the CDC to determine the most recent schedule.

Vaccine recommendations for adults are designed to protect those with underlying diseases that increase infection risk, those with potential for occupational exposure, and those who may be exposed to infectious agents during travel. Immunosuppressed adults (including those who have had splenectomy) should be vaccinated for pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae), meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis), and Haemophilus influenzae. Health care workers should be immune to measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B , and varicella. It is strongly recommended that all of the previously described adult groups and those with asthma or other chronic respiratory conditions receive annual influenza vaccine.

Information about individual vaccines or the most current vaccine schedules may be found on the Internet (http://www. cdc.gov/nip/publications/ACIP.list). The CDC also provides a 24-hour telephone hotline (800-232-2522) for information about routine pediatric or adult vaccine advice. Advice about optimal vaccination for travelers is available on the Internet (http:// www.cdc.gov/travel/vaccinat), by phone (877-FYI-TRIP), and by a toll-free fax number (888-232-3299) to request information.

Nurses should ask parents or adult vaccine recipients to provide information about any problems encountered after vaccination. As mandated by law, a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form must be completed with the following
information: type of vaccine received, timing of vaccination, onset of the adverse event, current illnesses or medication, history of adverse events after vaccination and demographic information about the recipient. Forms are obtained by phoning 1-800-8227967 or through the Internet (http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vaers.htm).

The incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella, and diphtheria, is affected by immigration from developing countries. Vaccine campaigns in developing countries are often financially and logistically constrained, and immigrants from such areas may be more likely than U.S. residents to be unprotected and may increase the potential pathways for epidemic spread. Individual risk and epidemic risk are reduced when vaccination campaigns reach all communities, including those with a high proportion of immigrants.

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS}

Patients who have experienced previous anaphylaxis or similar reactions; patients who have developed encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) dose; and those who have developed other moderate or severe sequelae after a previous dose should not receive further doses. DTP is often deferred for the child who previously developed a fever higher than $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ within 48 hours of vaccination or who had a seizure or developed a shocklike state within 3 days of previous vaccination. Live vaccines usually are not indicated for patients or close contacts of patients with severe immunosuppression (eg, HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, significant corticosteroid use, use of immunosuppressive medications to prevent transplant rejection). The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine should not be administered to pregnant women.

\section*{MEASLES, MUMPS, AND RUBELLA VACCINE}

Since the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines were licensed, reported cases of these diseases have decreased by more than $99 \%$ in the United States (ie, fewer than 500 cases per year since 1999). All public health departments are encouraged to vigorously promote vaccination for all children and for susceptible adults unless contraindicated. Routine MMR vaccination should be given to children at 12 to 15 months of age, with repeat dosing at 4 to 6 years of age (Atkinson et al., 2002).

All who work in health care should demonstrate immunity to these three viruses by one of the following: birth date before 1957, documented administration of two doses of vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity, or documentation of physician-diagnosed measles or mumps.

Side Effects. Epidemiologic evidence supports that the risk for side effects is greater in nonimmune vaccine recipients than in those receiving repeat doses. Patients should be advised that fever, transient lymphadenopathy, or hypersensitivity reaction might occur. Antipyretics may be used to decrease the risk for fever, but aspirin should be avoided in infants and children because of the risk for Reye's syndrome.

\section*{VARICELLA (CHICKENPOX) VACCINE}

Varicella zoster is the causative viral agent of chickenpox and herpes zoster. In its natural state, the varicella virus attacks most individuals as children, causing disseminated disease in the form of chickenpox. Chickenpox is often more severe in adults. Transmission occurs by the airborne and contact routes. With rare exception, varicella infects an individual only once. The in-

This schedule indicates the recommended ages for routine administration of currently licensed childhood vaccines, as of December 1, 2002, for children through age 18 years. Any dose not given at the recommended age should be given at any subsequent visit when indicated and feasible. Blue shading indicates age groups that warrant special effort to administer those vaccines not previously given. Additional vaccines may be licensed and recommended during the year. Licensed combination vaccines may be used whenever any components of the combination are indicated and the vaccine's other components are not contraindicated. Providers should consult the manufacturers' package inserts for detailed recommendations.
1. Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). All infants should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine soon after birth and before hospital discharge; the first dose may also be given by age 2 months if the infant's mother is HBsAg -negative. Only monovalent HepB can be used for the birth dose. Monovalent or combination vaccine containing HepB may be used to complete the series. Four doses of vaccine may be administered when a birth dose is given. The second dose should be given at least 4 weeks after the first dose, except for combination vaccines which cannot be administered before age 6 weeks. The third dose should be given at least 16 weeks after the first dose and at least 8 weeks after the second dose. The last dose in the vaccination series (third or fourth dose) should not be administered before age 6 months.

Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HepB and 0.5 mL Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth at separate sites. The second dose is recommended at age $1-2$ months. The last dose in the vaccination series should not be administered before age 6 months. These infants should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs at $9-15$ months of age.

Infants born to mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown should receive the first dose of the HepB series within 12 hours of birth. Maternal blood should be drawn as soon as possible to determine the mother's HBsAg status; if the HBsAg test is positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible (no later than age 1 week). The second dose is recommended at age $1-2$ months. The last dose in the vaccination series should not be administered before age 6 months.
2. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). The fourth dose of DTaP may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided 6 months have elapsed since the third dose and the child is unlikely to return at age 15-18 months. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids ( Td ) is recommended at age 11-12 years if at least 5 years have elapsed since the last dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. Subsequent routine Td boosters are recommended every 10 years.
3. Haemophilus influenzae type $\mathbf{b}$ ( $\mathbf{H i b}$ ) conjugate vaccine. Three Hib conjugate vaccines are licensed for infant use. If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB® or ComVax® [Merck]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. DTaP/Hib combination products should not be used for primary immunization in infants at ages 2,4 or 6 months, but can be used as boosters following any Hib vaccine.
4. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The second dose of MMR is recommended routinely at age $4-6$ years but may be administered during any visit, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the first dose and that both doses are administered beginning at or after age 12 months. Those who have not previously received the second dose should complete the schedule by the 11-12 year old visit.
5. Varicella vaccine. Varicella vaccine is recommended at any visit at or after age 12 months for susceptible children, ie, those who lack a reliable history of chickenpox. Susceptible persons aged $\geq 13$ years should receive two doses, given at least 4 weeks apart.
6. Pneumococcal vaccine. The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is recommended for all children age $2-23$ months. It is also recommended for certain children age 24-59 months. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is recommended in addition to PCV for certain high-risk groups. See MMWR 2000;49(RR-9);1-38.
7. Hepatitis A vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for children and adolescents in selected states and regions, and for certain highrisk groups; consult your local public health authority. Children and adolescents in these states, regions, and high risk groups who have not been immunized against hepatitis A can begin the hepatitis A vaccination series during any visit. The two doses in the series should be administered at least 6 months apart. See MMWR 1999;48(RR-12);1-37.
8. Influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccine is recommended annually for children age $\geq 6$ months with certain risk factors (including but not limited to asthma, cardiac disease, sickle cell disease, HIV, diabetes, and household members of persons in groups at high risk; see MMWR 2002;51(RR-3);1-31), and can be administered to all others wishing to obtain immunity. In addition, healthy children age 6-23 months are encouraged to receive influenza vaccine if feasible because children in this age group are at substantially increased risk for influenza-related hospitalizations. Children aged $\leq 12$ years should receive vaccine in a dosage appropriate for their age $(0.25 \mathrm{~mL}$ if age 6-35 months or 0.5 mL if aged $\geq 3$ years). Children aged $\leq 8$ years who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses separated by at least 4 weeks.

cubation period is about 2 weeks (range, 10 to 21 days). During a prodrome of general malaise (often noticed about 2 days before the rash develops), the newly infected host is capable of transmitting the virus to other susceptible contacts. Typically, the rash is vesicular and pustular and spreads rapidly from few to many lesions in a matter of hours. New lesion formation continues for 2 to 3 days, with lesions appearing at different stages throughout this time. By the fourth symptomatic day, the lesions begin to dry, and new lesions usually do not develop. Fever is common during the 4 to 6 days of rash progression. When the lesions have crusted, the patient is no longer contagious to others.

Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is a localized rash caused by recurrent varicella. Vesicles are restricted to areas supplied by single associated nerve groups. Varicella may be transmitted from the rash of those with shingles to people who are susceptible to varicella.

The varicella vaccine was first recommended as part of the routine vaccine schedule in the United States in 1996. The vaccine is effective in preventing chickenpox in approximately $85 \%$ of those vaccinated and significantly reduces the severity in almost all those who get the disease despite vaccination (Atkinson et al., 2002). The vaccine should not be given to those who have depressed immune function, are pregnant, have received blood products in the past 6 months, or have demonstrated allergy to varicella vaccine.

\section*{INFLUENZA VACCINE}

Influenza is an acute viral disease that predictably and periodically causes worldwide epidemics. Epidemics occur every 2 to 3 years, with a highly variable degree of severity. An average estimated excess of 20,000 deaths per year have been attributed to influenza or its sequelae (ie, pneumonia and cardiopulmonary collapse) in vulnerable groups between 1977 and 1995 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2001d).

Each year, a new vaccine is available. It is composed of the three virus strains (usually two type A influenza and one type B influenza strains) considered most likely to occur in the coming season. When the presumed influenza agents have been correctly anticipated and included in that year's vaccine, vaccine offers approximately $70 \%$ to $90 \%$ protection for healthy children and young adults. Although less effective in the elderly (as low as $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ in the frail elderly), it decreases the severity of illness in those who do get infected, is $50 \%$ to $70 \%$ effective in preventing pneumonia and hospitalization, and is $80 \%$ effective in preventing death. In extended care facilities, risk of transmission is greatly reduced by vaccination of all residents (CDC, 2001d).

The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee of the Public Health Service recommends annual influenza vaccinations for the following groups at risk for influenza complications: those older than 50 years of age, residents of extended care facilities, those with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, and those with diabetes, immunosuppression, or renal dysfunction. Vaccination is also advised for children (eg, those with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) who require long-term aspirin therapy to reduce the likelihood of developing Reye's syndrome. Health care providers and household members of those in high-risk groups should receive the vaccine to reduce the risk of transmission to those vulnerable to influenza sequelae. Vaccine campaigns among health care workers and patients should be intensified when there is evidence of community influenza disease.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION IN THE HOSPITAL}

Nurses specializing in infection control are responsible for agencywide policy development and program direction. Infection risk is significantly increased as patient care equipment becomes more complex and as more devices that disrupt naturally protective anatomic barriers are used. Staff nurses play an important role in risk reduction by paying careful attention to hand hygiene, by ensuring careful administration of prescribed antibiotics, and by following procedures to reduce the risks associated with patient care devices.

Each year, an estimated 2 million patients in the United States acquire nosocomial infections while hospitalized. Approximately 240,000 additional residents of long-term care facilities become infected each year. With the anticipated growth of the elderly population, this number may increase to approximately 750,000 by 2005 (Jarvis, 2001).

The CDC estimates that approximately one third of all nosocomial infections could be prevented with effective infection control programs. An effective program includes the following components: a program of surveillance for nosocomial infections and vigorous control efforts, at least one infection control practitioner for every 250 hospital beds, a trained hospital epidemiologist, and feedback to surgeons about individual surgical site infections. Unfortunately, many hospitals have not introduced all four required aspects, and only an estimated $9 \%$ of expected infections are prevented (Scheckler et al., 1998).

\section*{Specific Organisms With Nosocomial Infection Potential}

\section*{CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE}

Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacterium with significant nosocomial potential. Infection is usually preceded by antibiotics that disrupt normal intestinal flora and allow the antibiotic-resistant C. difficile spores to proliferate within the intestine.

The organism causes pathology by releasing toxins into the lumen of the bowel. In pseudomembranous colitis, the most extreme form of C. difficile infection, debris from the injured lumen of the bowel and from white blood cells accumulate in the form of pseudomembranes or studded areas of the colon. The destruction of such a large anatomic area can produce profound sepsis.

Because antibiotics are used so extensively in the hospital setting, most hospitalized patients are at risk for infection with C. difficile. The nosocomial potential is increased because the spore is relatively resistant to disinfectants and can be spread on the hands of health care providers after contact with equipment that has previously been contaminated with C. difficile. Control is best achieved by intensifying cleaning, using Contact Precautions for infected patients, and stressing glove use and hand hygiene for all care workers.

\section*{METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS}

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a common nosocomial infection in hospitals and extended care facilities. MRSA refers to $S$. aureus organisms that are resistant to methicillin or its comparable pharmaceutical agents, oxacillin and nafcillin. Because of the pathogenicity of S. aureus, there has been concern about antibiotic resistance since the discovery of penicillin in the 1940s. Soon after penicillin was introduced, S. aureus became all but universally penicillin resistant. Fortunately, alternative therapies in the form of cephalosporins and, more importantly, synthetic
penicillin solutions such as methicillin were introduced. It was not until the late 1970s that S. aureus showed resistance to methicillin. At that time, the prevalence of the organism was originally linked epidemiologically to the IV/injecting drug use community. Since the late 1960s, however, MRSA has become increasingly more prevalent, and transmission within hospitals and nursing homes has been well documented.

Linezolid and vancomycin are the preferred alternative treatments for serious MRSA infection. However, there is concern that MRSA will eventually also become resistant to these medications because they are used so commonly. For the first time, in April 2002, a patient in Michigan was diagnosed with an S. aureus infection that was fully resistant to vancomycin (ie, vancomycinresistant S. aureus [VRSA]). The CDC and other professional organizations have focused preventive efforts against the threat of transmission of this strain and the development of similar strains in other patients. The threat of the growth of VRSA is considered a public health catastrophe because many patients with S. aureus infections are likely to have a poor outcome (CDC, 2002b).

Health care providers often transmit MRSA to patients because S. aureus easily colonizes skin. Because colonization is seldom recognized, the health care provider must assume that every patient contact offers the possibility of MRSA exposure. Although there is no evidence that MRSA is more virulent than other strains of staphylococci, the colonized patient faces the likelihood of infection with MRSA when invasive procedures, such as intravenous therapy, respiratory therapy, or surgery, are performed. The patient colonized with MRSA also serves as a reservoir of resistant organisms to be transmitted to others. MRSA acquired in the hospital may persist as normal flora in the patient in the future.

\section*{VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCUS}

Enterococcus is a gram-positive bacterium that is part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. It can produce significant disease when allowed to infect blood, wounds, or urine. Enterococcus is the second most frequently isolated source of nosocomial infection in the United States.

Enterococcus has several traits that make it an ideal nosocomial organism. The host carries an abundance of the organism even in a noninfected state; the organism is bile resistant and can withstand harsh anatomic sites, such as the intestine; Enterococcus has the potential for resistance to many antibiotics, so that therapeutic agents reducing local bacterial competition may leave it to replicate freely; and the organism endures well on the hands of health care providers and on environmental objects.

As a relatively resistant organism at baseline, therapy for $E n-$ terococcus has been essentially limited to penicillin formulations (eg, ampicillin) or vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin). In the 1980s, resistance to all of these agents was first reported. Between 1994 and 1999, the CDC recorded a more than $40 \%$ increase in the percentage of cases of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infections in intensive care unit patients (CDC, 2001c).

This rapidly growing problem has serious implications. Because many strains of VRE are resistant to all other antimicrobial therapies, clinicians are left without effective therapy for what was once seen as a relatively common infection. VRE infections may serve as a reservoir of genes coded for vancomycin resistance that may be transferred to the even more prevalent and virulent S. aureus. The first case of a patient infected with VRSA, illustrates this concern, as that patient was infected with VRE and VRSA.

The gene that commonly causes resistance in VRE was found in both organisms, which strongly suggested genetic transfer between species (CDC, 2002b).

\section*{Preventing Nosocomial Bloodstream Infections (Bacteremia and Fungemia)}

Reducing the risk of nosocomial bloodstream infections requires preventive activities (in addition to Standard and TransmissionBased Precautions, which are discussed later). If a nosocomial bloodstream infection occurs, early diagnosis is important to prevent complications, such as endocarditis and brain abscess. Mortality rates may be as high as $25 \%$ for infection with some organisms. The estimated cost attributed to catheter-related bloodstream infections is $\$ 3,700$ to $\$ 29,000$ per case (Mermel, 2000).

Bacteremia is defined as laboratory-proven presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. Fungemia is a bloodstream infection caused by a fungal organism. Any vascular access device (VAD) can serve as the source for a bloodstream infection. Contamination can occur from the patient's own flora traversing the exterior of a catheter or by contamination of internal tubing during manipulation. The intravenous fluid itself can become contaminated and serve as a source of infection. Most hospitalized patients receive VADs, and increasingly, long-term central catheters are used to provide intravenous therapy to outpatients in a clinic or home setting. In all instances, the nurse must use appropriate care to reduce the risk of bacteremia and to be alert for signs of bacteremia. Chart 70-1 identifies conditions that suggest the presence of nosocomial VAD-related bacteremia or fungemia.

\section*{DISINFECTING SKIN}

During the insertion of all VADs, there must be strict attention to aseptic technique. Those inserting VADs must vigorously wash their hands before insertion. Those inserting central catheters should use surgical technique, including sterile gloves, sterile gowns with long sleeves, masks, and a large drape over the patient. The preferred solution to disinfect the insertion site is chlorhexidine gluconate, which first became available as a skin preparation solution in the United States in 2001. Alternative solutions are povidone iodine or alcohol. Triple-antibiotic ointment should not be used on the insertion site because it has been

\section*{Conditions That Suggest the Presence of Nosocomial Vascular Access Device-Related Bacteremia or Fungemia}
- The patient has catheter in place, appears septic, but has no obvious reason to suggest predisposition to sepsis.
- There is no infection at another body site to indicate probable source of sepsis.
- The site of vascular line insertion is red, swollen, or draining (especially purulent drainage).
- The patient has a central vascular line in place at the onset of sepsis.
- The bloodstream infection is caused by Candida species or by common skin organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus species, or Corynebacterium species.
- The patient remains septic after appropriate therapy without removal of the vascular access device.
shown to lead to increased colonization with Candida species (Mermel, 2000).

There is no apparent difference in risk or benefit when comparing the use of transparent polyurethane dressings or gauze dressings. However, if blood is oozing from the catheter insertion site, a gauze dressing should be used. The most important aspects for either material are that the dressing should be applied using aseptic technique and that the dressing should be sealed along its entire perimeter (Mermel, 2000).

\section*{USING GUIDE WIRES}

Guide wires should not be used routinely when replacing central venous catheters. However, they may be used if there is no evidence of infection and insertion risk is unacceptably high, as when the patient has a coagulopathy or is obese.

\section*{CHANGING INFUSION SETS, CAPS, AND SOLUTIONS}

Infusion sets and stopcock caps should be changed no more frequently than every 4 days, unless an infusion set is used for the delivery of blood or lipid solutions. Infusion sets and tubing for blood, blood products, or lipid emulsions should be changed within 24 hours of initiating the infusion. Blood infusions should finish within 4 hours of hanging the blood; lipid solutions should be completed within 24 hours of hanging. There are no guidelines for the appropriate intervals for the hang time of other solutions. Injection ports should be cleaned with $70 \%$ alcohol or an iodophor before accessing the system (Mermel, 2000).

Nurses have an important role in the prevention of bloodstream infections as they assess patients for evidence of infection, make daily VAD site inspections, and monitor the interval of line changes. Signs of sepsis in patients with indwelling vascular lines should be promptly assessed and treated.

\section*{Isolation Precautions}

Isolation precautions are guidelines created to prevent transmission of microorganisms in hospitals. In 1997, the Hospital Infection

\section*{Table 70-3 - Comparing Hand Hygiene Methods}

Hand Decontamination with Alcohol-Based Product
- After contact with body fluids, excretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, or wound dressings as long as hands are not visibly soiled
- After contact with a patient's intact skin (as after taking pulse or blood pressure or lifting a patient)
- In patient care, when moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site
- After contact with inanimate objects in the patient's immediate vicinity
- Before caring for patients with severe neutropenia or other forms of severe immune suppression
- Before donning sterile gloves when inserting central catheters
- Before inserting urinary catheters or other devices that do not require a surgical procedure
- After removing gloves

Hand Washing
- When hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with biologic material from patient care
- When healthcare workers do not tolerate waterless alcohol product

Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), along with the CDC, implemented two tiers of isolation precautions. The first tier, called Standard Precautions, was designed for the care of all patients in the hospital and is the primary strategy for preventing nosocomial infections. The second tier, called Transmission-Based Precautions, was designed for care of patients with known or suspected infectious diseases spread by airborne, droplet, or contact routes.

\section*{STANDARD PRECAUTIONS}

The tenets of Standard Precautions are that all patients are colonized or infected with microorganisms, whether or not there are signs or symptoms, and that a uniform level of caution should be used in the care of all patients. The elements of Standard Precautions include hand hygiene, use of gloves and other barriers (eg, mask, eye protection, face shield, gown), handling of patient care equipment and linen, environmental control, prevention of injury from sharps devices, and patient placement. Hand hygiene, glove use, needlestick prevention, and avoidance of splash or spray of body fluids are discussed in the following sections. Chart 52-3 in Chapter 52 describes the Standard Precautions in detail.

Hand Hygiene. The most frequent cause of infection outbreaks in health care institutions is transmission by the hands of health care workers. Hands should be washed or decontaminated frequently during patient care. Table 70-3 describes the recommended situations for hand hygiene.

When hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with biologic material from patient care, hands should be washed with soap and water. In intensive care units and other locations in which virulent or resistant organisms are likely to be present, antimicrobial agents (eg, chlorhexidine gluconate, iodophors, chloroxylenol, triclosan) may be used. Effective hand washing requires at least 15 seconds of vigorous scrubbing with special attention to the area around nail beds and between fingers, where there is high bacterial burden. Hands should be thoroughly rinsed after this washing.

If hands are not visibly soiled, health care providers are strongly encouraged to use alcohol-based, waterless antiseptic agents for routine hand decontamination. These solutions are superior to soap or antimicrobial handwashing agents in their speed of action and effectiveness against bacteria and viruses. Because they are formulated with emollients, they are usually better tolerated than other agents, and because they can be used without sinks and towels, health care workers have been found to be more compliant with their use. Nurses working in home health care or other settings where they are relatively mobile should carry pocket-sized containers of alcohol-based solutions (Zaragoza et al., 1999).

Normal skin flora usually consist of coagulase-negative staphylococci or diphtheroids. In the health care setting, employees may temporarily carry bacteria (ie, transient flora) such as $S$. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other organisms with strong pathogenic potential. Generally, transient flora are superficially attached and are shed with hand hygiene and skin regeneration.

Hand washing or disinfection reduces the amount of benign normal flora and transient bacteria and decreases the risk of transfer to other patients. All health care settings should have programs to evaluate compliance with hand disinfection by all who care for patients.

Nurses should not wear artificial fingernails or extenders when providing patient care. These items have been epidemiologically linked to several significant outbreaks of infections. Natural nails should be kept less than 0.25 -inch ( $0.6-\mathrm{cm}$ ) long, and nail polish should be removed when chipped, because it can support increased bacterial growth (CDC, 2002a).

Glove Use. Gloves provide an effective barrier for hands from the microflora associated with patient care. Gloves should be worn when a health care worker has contact with any patient's secretions or excretions and must be discarded after each patient care contact. Because hospital organisms colonizing health care workers' hands can proliferate in the warm, moist environment provided by gloves, hands must be thoroughly washed with soap after gloves are removed. As patient advocates, nurses have an important role in promoting hand washing and glove use by other hospital workers, such as laboratory personnel, technicians, and others who have contact with patients.

Latex gloves are often preferred over vinyl gloves because of greater comfort and fit and because some studies indicate that they afford greater protection from exposure. Their increased use in recent years, however, has been accompanied by increased reports of allergic reactions to latex among health care workers. Reactions range from local skin irritation to more severe reactions, including generalized dermatitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, angioedema, and anaphylaxis (see Chap. 53).

The nurse who experiences irritation or allergic reaction associated with exposure to latex should report symptoms to an occupational health specialist or private physician. Suggested methods for reducing the incidence of such reactions include use of vinyl gloves, powder-free gloves, or "low-protein" latex gloves.

Needlestick Prevention. The most important aspect of reducing the risk of bloodborne infection is avoidance of percutaneous injury. Extreme care is essential in all situations in which needles, scalpels, and other sharp objects are handled. Used needles should not be recapped. Instead, they are placed directly into punctureresistant containers in the vicinity of their use. If a situation dictates that a needle must be recapped, the nurse must use a mechanical device to hold the cap or use a one-handed approach to decrease the likelihood of skin puncture. Since 2001, OSHA has required nurses to use needleless devices and other instruments designed to prevent injury from sharps when appropriate (Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], 2001).

Avoidance of Spray and Splash Exposure. When the health care provider is involved in an activity in which body fluids may be sprayed or splashed, appropriate barriers must be used. If a splash to the face may occur, goggles and facemask are warranted. If the health care worker is handling material that may soil clothing or is involved in a procedure in which clothing may be splashed with biologic material, a cover gown should be worn.

\section*{TRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTIONS}

Some microbes are so contagious or epidemiologically significant that precautions in addition to the Standard Precautions should be used when such organisms are recognized. The CDC recommends a second tier of precautions, called Transmission-Based Precautions. The additional safety measures are called Airborne, Droplet, and Contact Precautions (Garner, 1996).

Airborne Precautions are required for patients with presumed or proven pulmonary TB or chickenpox. Airborne Precautions are also advised if, as a victim of bioterrorism, a patient is suspected of having smallpox. When hospitalized, patients should be put in rooms with negative air pressure; the door should remain closed, and health care providers should wear an N-95 respirator (ie, protective mask) at all times while in the patient's room.

Droplet Precautions are used for organisms that can be transmitted by close, face-to-face contact, such as influenza or meningococcal meningitis. While taking care of a patient requiring

Droplet Precautions, the nurse should wear a facemask, but because the risk of transmission is limited to close contact, the door may remain open. The CDC advises that negative-pressure rooms should be used in hospitals if available.

Contact Precautions are used for organisms that are spread by skin-to-skin contact, such as antibiotic-resistant organisms or C. difficile. Contact Precautions are designed to emphasize cautious technique for organisms that have serious epidemiologic consequences or those easily transmitted by contact between health care worker and patient. The principles of transmission control used in the Standard Precautions are accentuated. When possible, the patient requiring contact isolation is placed in a private room to facilitate hand hygiene and protection of garments from environmental contamination. Masks are not needed, and doors do not need to be closed (Chart 70-2).

\section*{Emerging Infectious Diseases}

As defined by the CDC, emerging infectious diseases are diseases of infectious origin with human incidences that have increased within the past two decades or that are likely to increase in the near future (CDC, 1994). Examples of emerging infectious diseases are presented within this section: West Nile virus, Legionnaires' disease, Lyme disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Table 70-1 provides an overview of infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases.

Many factors contribute to newly emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases. These include travel, globalization of food supply and central processing of food, population growth and increased urban crowding, population movements (eg, war, famine, disaster), ecologic changes, human behavior (eg, risky sexual behavior, IV/injection drug use), antimicrobial resistance, environmental sources, and breakdown in public health measures.

These diseases are important from an epidemiologic standpoint because their incidence has not yet stabilized. As physicians and scientists are learning about the pattern of disease in a community, patients and their families often have increased anxiety about these diseases. During times of increased concern about bioterrorism, whether triggered by actual events or by hoaxes, nurses have an increased responsibility to rationally separate facts from fears. In discussions with patients and other caregivers, it is important to keep the focus on what is known and to clarify the plan for diagnosis, treatment, and containment.

\section*{WEST NILE VIRUS}

The West Nile virus was first recognized in the 1930s in Africa and first seen in humans the United States in 1999. The 1999 epidemic was distressing as residents of New York City reported to hospitals with initially undiagnosable meningitis. Most human infections are asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, headache and fever are most frequently reported. Less than $1 \%$ of those infected develop more severe illness, including meningitis (CDC, 2001e).

The incubation period (ie, from mosquito bite to onset of symptoms) is between 5 and 15 days. There is no treatment for West Nile virus infection. Patients are supported by fluid replacement, airway management, and standard nursing care when meningitis symptoms are present.

Birds are the natural reservoir for the virus and since 1999, the population of infected birds in the eastern United States has in-

creased steadily. Mosquitoes become infected when feeding on birds and can transmit the virus to animals and humans. Most communities in the eastern United States have developed a public health surveillance system to estimate the prevalence in birds and mosquitoes. There is no human-to-human transmission of the virus and no evidence of transfer from infected birds to humans. However, as a precaution, it is wise to teach people in affected areas to wear gloves if handling a dead bird (CDC, 2002c).

\section*{LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE}

Legionnaires' disease is a multisystem illness that usually includes pneumonia and is caused by the gram-negative bacteria, Legionella pneumophila. Named after an outbreak of the disease among people attending a convention of the American Legion in 1976, its potential to cause outbreaks has been demonstrated numerous times in hospitals and other settings. Legionella organisms are found in many man-made and naturally occurring water sources. Although the organisms may initially be introduced in low numbers, growth is enhanced by water storage, scaling (biofilm) on the inside of water towers, temperatures ranging from $25^{\circ}$ to $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $77^{\circ}$ to $107^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ), and certain amoebae frequently present in water that can support intracellular growth of legionellae.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
L. pneumophila is transmitted by an aerosolized route from an environmental source to an individual's respiratory tract. It is not transmitted from person to person. In hospitals, patients may be exposed to aerosols created by cooling towers, water sources from plumbing, and respiratory therapy equipment. Because underlying medical conditions can increase host susceptibility and subsequent severity of disease and because hospital plumbing systems are often very complex, outbreaks occur in hospitals more frequently than at other centers within the community. Mortality rates among hospitalized patients are about twofold greater than those for people with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia (CDC, 2002e).

\section*{Risk Factors}

Risk factors strongly associated with Legionella infection include diseases that lead to severe immunosuppression, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hematologic malignancy, end-stage renal disease, or use of immunosuppressive agents. Other factors associated with increased risk include advanced age, diabetes, alcohol abuse, smoking, and other pulmonary disease.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The lungs are the principal organs of infection; however, disease without pulmonary involvement has been reported. Other organs may also be involved. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days. Early symptoms may include malaise, myalgias, headache, and dry cough. With disease progression, the patient develops increased pulmonary symptoms, including productive cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Patients are usually febrile, and body temperatures may reach $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(39.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and higher. Diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints commonly accompany the array of pulmonary symptoms. In severe cases, multiorgan involvement and failure may follow.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Laboratory tests available for the diagnosis of Legionella include culture (ie, using special microbiologic methods and media), immunofluorescent microscopy, antibody titer interpretation, and urinary antigen detection. Diagnosis of Legionella by antibody titer requires evidence that titers have increased at least fourfold over time. A single elevated titer is not sufficient to determine current disease. The urinary antigen test (for L. pneumophila serotype 1, the most prevalent subspecies) is helpful because urine is easy to obtain and the test remains positive after initial antibiotic treatment. This persistent marker especially aids in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia as patients are frequently treated empirically. Legionella cultures rapidly become negative after antibiotic treatment, even when the patient's condition is deteriorating. Frequently, more than one laboratory test is used in the diagnosis of Legionella because no one test is $100 \%$ sensitive. The diagnostic approach generally involves accumulation of information obtained from the history, physical examination, x-rays, laboratory findings, and assessment of therapeutic effectiveness. Chest x-ray abnormalities may vary in severity and in location of the diseased site.

\section*{Medical Management}

Azithromycin (Zithromax) is considered the antibiotic of choice. Other options include clarithromycin (Biaxin), erythromycin (Ilotycin), and levofloxacin (Levaquin).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nursing management described for the patient with any pneumonia (see Chap. 23) should form the basis of care for the patient with Legionella pneumonia. Special isolation techniques are not used for these patients because there is no evidence of transmission between humans.

\section*{LYME DISEASE}

Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted to humans by ticks. It is more common in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, where the deer tick (Ixodes dammini) is prevalent. Ticks may feed on infected white-tailed deer or whitefooted mice and then serve as a vector to transmit disease to humans. Lyme disease is less common in the western U.S. states, where the California black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus), capable of transmitting Lyme disease, prefers to feed on reptiles, which do not carry B. burgdorferi.

Lyme disease can be manifested by a wide range of symptoms and severity. In its early form, a rash is often present and may be accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy. In later stages, neurologic manifestations ranging from Bell's palsy to Guillain-Barrélike syndrome or dementia are possible. Other sites that may be affected include skin, joints, heart, and eyes.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The rash frequently associated with Lyme disease, known as erythema migrans, is often described as having an expanding bull'seye appearance. It may be confused with a spider bite. The diagnosis may be made when a patient has this typical rash and at least one late manifestation (eg, arthritis, facial palsy, meningitis, carditis) along with laboratory confirmation of infection.

\section*{Medical Management}

Doxycycline (Vibramycin), ceftriaxone (Rocephin), and azithromycin are among the commonly used antibiotics. Treatment regimens are usually for 3 to 4 weeks. Patients should be encouraged to complete the full course of therapy and to report changes in symptoms during therapy, because the regimen may need to be altered if treatment appears to be failing.

\section*{HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME}

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is caused by a member of the Hantavirus family of viruses. In the United States, the Sin Nombre hantavirus causes severe cardiopulmonary illness with a case mortality rate of approximately $50 \%$. Cases occur most frequently in the western U.S. states, but the rodents known to carry the virus are found throughout the country (Vaheri \& Calisher, 2002).

The diagnosis of HPS should be suspected in patients who live in rural areas, who may have had exposure to rodents, and who report fever, aching muscles, and nausea. Thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration are also common.

Although no specific treatment for HPS has been approved, early treatment with ribavirin (Virazole) may reduce mortality. Early identification, assessment, and maintenance of respiratory status are the most important aspects of care for these patients. Intake and output should be monitored closely, because overhydration is possible with resultant cardiopulmonary compromise.

Reduction of risk requires strategies to reduce human contact with rodents and their droppings. Public health programs and clinics in rural areas should regularly teach people to eliminate food sources of rodents in areas close to humans. Openings in walls or cabinets should be sealed. Traps should be used in areas such as sheds and barns in which rodents may enter and in which humans work. Gloves should be worn when removing the animal from the trap. The trap should be disinfected with a $1: 10$ bleach solution. People entering such areas should be taught to avoid stirring up dust or breathing potentially contaminated dust. Brooms and vacuum cleaners should be used with caution; areas that may emit dust while being cleaned should be first dampened with a bleach solution to reduce viral contaminants and the potential for dust dispersion.

\section*{EBOLA AND MARBURG VIRUSES}

The Ebola and Marburg viruses are known as filoviruses. Since the 1960s, they have been the source for approximately 20 out-
breaks. Both viruses have been prepared as biological weapons and cause great concern because of the extreme virulence and high mortality rates associated with infection.

The clinical course differs among patients, but often includes fever, rash, and encephalitis. Symptoms usually occur rapidly, and with both viruses, the course of the illness often progresses rapidly to profound hemorrhage, organ destruction, and shock. The mortality rate approaches $90 \%$. When patients survive, the recovery period is often prolonged, with weakness, malaise, and cachexia common.

Despite aggressive research, the natural reservoirs for filoviruses have not yet been found, but it is thought that humans are infected only incidentally after exposure to an unrecognized host or by insect bite. Human-to-human transmission usually occurs after exposure to blood or other body fluid. When transmission is percutaneous, it appears that a very low inoculum of contaminated blood is required for transmission to occur. The virus can also be spread by mucous membrane exposure. Although airborne transmission does not appear to be a likely mode of transmission, the possibility has not been entirely eliminated. All involved in caring for patients with filoviruses must adhere to strict infection control measures. It is advisable that systems be set up to have objective monitors to ensure that each nurse or other health care worker wears complete protective equipment in the form of cap, goggles, masks, gown, gloves, and shoe covers.

Because there have been no cases diagnosed in the United States, it is likely that early signs of disease may be initially misclassified. The diagnosis should be considered in a patient who has a febrile, hemorrhagic illness after traveling to Asia or Africa or who has handled animals or animal carcasses from those parts of the world. Because neither hospital nor local public health laboratories would be able to confirm a diagnosis, the CDC should be contacted immediately when Ebola and Marburg viruses are suspected to be the cause of illness.

No antivirals have been approved or show promise against Ebola and Marburg. Treatment is largely supportive maintenance of the circulatory system and respiratory systems. It is likely that the infected patient would need ventilator and dialysis support through the acute phases of illness.

Supportive care for a patient with such a devastating disease requires psychological support for the patient and family. The natural fear of an untreatable, aggressive disease would likely be intensified because of the rarity of the disease. The patient, his family, health care workers, and others in the community will need substantial, coordinated education about the known and unknown elements. Intervention may be required from those trained to provide psychological support for traumatic or terrorist events.

\section*{SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS)}

In March 2003, the World Health Organization issued a global warning about the appearance of a newly recognized type of pnemonia, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS is an influenza-like disease, with patients presenting with fever and cough. A minority will progress to experience respiratory distress. The disease was first recognized in China, with a second generation of cases erupting quickly in Hong Kong, Vietnam, and over 17 other countries in a number of weeks.

The pattern of worldwide dissemination was largely attributed to travel because of strong epidemiologic evidence that patients
from many countries had shared common exposures. SARS serves as an example of how suddenly benign microorganisms, especially viruses, can mutate to become important human pathogens. The epidemic illustrates important principles of public health and infection control. Before the disease came to the attention of the WHO, transmission to nurses and other health care professionals occured frequently. Once patients were appropriately isolated, with health care workers using barrier precautions and cleaning contaminated surfaces carefully, transmission was effectively reduced or prevented.

\section*{TRAVEL AND IMMIGRATION}

Historically, migration of populations has often led to epidemics of disease in countries where people have no immunity to the disease. Because of trade, immigration, and wars, yellow fever, malaria, hookworm, leprosy, smallpox, measles, mumps, syphilis, and many other infectious diseases have been brought to the Western Hemisphere. More recently, the HIV epidemic was transmitted worldwide by means of travel and immigration.

Few diseases carried by travelers spread efficiently in the United States environment because of enforced vaccination, clean water, and insect and rodent control. However, there is growing concern that vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, may be transmitted by mosquitoes if a reservoir of infected humans is established. The CDC maintains an active surveillance system to prospectively monitor and halt the incidence of many diseases.

\section*{Immigration and Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease Syndrome}

The fact that AIDS reached pandemic proportions in less than a decade after its recognition attests to the efficiency of world travel in spreading disease. The significance of such rapid transmission rates is especially dramatic in that HIV essentially requires intimate contact between two people through sexual activity or sharing blood through needles.

The reservoir of HIV-1 in the United States is estimated to be approximately 800,000 to 900,000 people, with approximately 40,000 new cases each year. It was probably first introduced in the 1970s when asymptomatically infected travelers returned to the United States after having acquired the virus in other countries. HIV-2, which is similar to HIV-1 in causing immunodeficiency but less contagious in the early stages, is most prevalent in West Africa. The public health challenge is to set up surveillance and control mechanisms for this disease so that it is not regularly introduced into the United States. Because HIV-2 is rare, patients with signs of immune dysfunction do not need to be routinely tested for it. However, patients with immunodeficiency should be tested for HIV-2 if they have negative HIV-1 confirmatory test results or have traveled from countries where HIV-2 is prevalent. All donated blood must be screened for HIV-2. Routine seroprevalence studies are conducted to validate low prevalence in the United States (Grant \& DeCock, 2001).

\section*{Immigration and Tuberculosis}

Although there are substantive plans to eliminate TB in the United States, it remains a growing epidemic in developing nations. Immigration has always been an important influence in the dynamic epidemiology of TB in the United States. In 2001, the incidence
of TB was eight times greater in the foreign-born than in the native-born population of the United States (CDC, 2001h).

The association between immigration and transmission risk is greatest in urban areas because these locations are frequently heavily populated and visited by foreign-born people. These locales are also often the epicenter of the HIV epidemic, a population with suppressed immunity to TB. The combination of social, financial, and immunologic risks makes the goal of TB elimination in the United States very challenging.

A positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test establishes that TB infection has occurred at some time in a person's life. Because it does not provide information about current infectivity, it cannot be used to determine transmission potential. The complexity of PPD interpretation is increased because of the common use of the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine in many foreign countries. After receiving BCG, individuals are often PPD positive for a prolonged time, decreasing the ability of the PPD to serve as a TB screen.

\section*{Immigration and Vector-Borne Diseases}

Malaria, yellow fever, and dengue are diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality throughout the developing world. These diseases are spread by infected mosquitoes. Many other vector-borne parasitic diseases in developing countries rely on mosquitoes and other organisms to complete their life cycles and transmit disease.

Dengue fever is an example of the risk of imported vectorborne disease. The disease is caused by a virus that is spread through human populations by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The mosquitoes thrive in tropical zones and breed in stagnant water sources. Travelers, immigrants, and returning military personnel can serve as reservoirs of infection. A recent increase of dengue virus in the Caribbean has caused concern that outbreaks may occur in the United States in areas where there are vector mosquitoes.

Infection from dengue produces flulike symptoms of fever, chills, eye pain, joint pain, and sometimes, a hyperpigmented rash. Symptoms often wax and wane and are generally self-limited. A small proportion of patients may develop hemorrhagic disease, which can be life-threatening in extreme forms. There is no specific treatment for this infection. Control efforts rely on local effective mosquito control.

\section*{DIARRHEAL DISEASES}

In developing countries of the world, infectious diarrhea kills about 4 million people per year. In the United States, it is estimated that children younger than 5 years of age experience more than 20 million episodes of diarrheal diseases each year, with about 400 deaths per year attributed to such episodes. Dehydration is the most important factor for the morbidity and mortality associated with diarrheal disease. Dehydration is largely controllable by using rehydration therapy (Guerrant \& Steiner, 2000).

\section*{Transmission}

The portal of entry of all diarrheal pathogens is oral ingestion. Although the food we eat is far from sterile, the high acidity of the stomach and the antibody-producing cells of the small bowel generally serve to decrease the potential of pathogens. If the number of organisms is large enough, or if the food neutralizes the acidic environment, infection can occur. Decreased gastric acid-
ity with disruption of normal bowel flora (as occurs after surgery), use of antimicrobial agents, and the immune dysfunction of AIDS all decrease intestinal defenses.

\section*{Specific Causes}

There are many viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes for diarrheal diseases. Rotavirus is the most significant viral cause of diarrhea in young children. Common causes of bacterial infection include Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia species. Parasitic infections of importance include Giardia and Cryptosporidium species and Entamoeba histolytica.

\section*{ESCHERICHIA COLI}
E. coli is the most common aerobic organism colonizing the large bowel. When E. coli organisms are cultured from fecal specimens, the results seldom suggest pathology, but rather reflect normal flora. However, certain strains of E. coli with increased virulence (ie, degree of pathogenicity of an organism) have been responsible for significant outbreaks in recent years. These stronger pathologic strains are subgrouped as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) because of their production of enterotoxins. ETEC strains often cause cholera-like disease, with rapid, severe dehydration and an increased risk of death.

Recent outbreaks of an E. coli species, 0157:H7, have often been linked to the ingestion of undercooked beef. This bacterium lives in the intestines of cattle and can be introduced into meat at the time of slaughter. Prevention of disease from this strain of E. coli is aimed at teaching the public to cook ground beef thoroughly (ie, until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear).

\section*{SALMONELLA INFECTION}

Salmonella is a gram-negative bacillus with many species, including the very pathogenic Salmonella typhi (ie, typhoid fever). Of the nontyphi species, most organisms are prevalent in animal food sources. It is estimated that Salmonella species contaminate more than $50 \%$ of commercially available chicken products and are frequently found in eggs (intact and with broken shells), in raw milk, and occasionally in beef (Crump et al., 2002). Approximately $40 \%$ of the deaths caused by Salmonella occur in nursing home residents. The high mortality rate reflects the seriousness of the infection in the elderly, who often have weakened immune systems (CDC, 2000a).

There is great variability of symptoms associated with Salmonella species infection, including an asymptomatic carrier state, gastroenteritis, and systemic infection. Diarrhea with gastroenteritis is common. Disseminated disease and bacteremia, whether accompanied by diarrhea or not, is less common.

The person with Salmonella-caused diarrhea can be a source for transmission to others. The importance of good hygiene should be emphasized, and health care workers should use special care when handling bedpans, stool specimens, or other objects that may have fecal contamination. Hand washing is imperative after any contact with a person with Salmonella diarrhea. Patients with gastroenteritis generally are not treated with antibiotics because antibiotic use may increase the period of time that the patient carries the bacteria while not improving the clinical outcome. However, those with systemic salmonellosis require antimicrobial therapy.

\section*{SHIGELLA INFECTION}

The Shigella species is a gram-negative organism that invades the lumen of the intestine and causes disease and severe watery (pos-
sibly bloody) diarrhea. Shigella species spread through the fecaloral route, with easy transmission from one person to another. Small numbers of organisms are needed to cause disease. Because transmission occurs easily with improper hygiene, it is not surprising that Shigella organisms disproportionately affect pediatric populations. Disease in the very young may infrequently be complicated by pulmonary or neurologic symptoms.

Antimicrobial therapy should be instituted early. Frequently, initial therapy choices must be altered when final microbiologic testing reveals the organism's sensitivity.

\section*{CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS}

In the United States, diarrheal disease attributed to Campylobacter species surpasses that recorded for Salmonella and Shigella species. The organism is found abundantly in animal food sources. It is especially common in poultry but can also be found in beef and pork. Transmission appears to be almost entirely by the fecal-oral route, with food sources representing the reservoir of organism. Direct person-to-person transmission appears to be less common than for other enteric pathogens, such as Shigella.

Cooking and storing food at appropriate temperatures protects against Campylobacter. It is important that kitchen utensils used in meat preparation be kept away from other food to prevent Campylobacter transmission.

After a person is infected, the organism directly attacks the lumen of the intestine and may cause disease through enterotoxin release. Symptoms can range from mild abdominal cramping and minimal diarrhea to severe disease with profuse watery bloody diarrhea and debilitating abdominal cramping. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended only for those who are seriously ill.

\section*{GIARDIA LAMBLIA}

Giardia lamblia is a protozoan. Transmission occurs when food or drink is contaminated with viable cysts of the organism. People often become infected while traveling to endemic areas in industrialized and nonindustrialized countries of the world or by drinking contaminated water from mountain streams within the United States. The organism can be transmitted by close contact, as occurs in day care settings. Transmission by sexual contact has also been documented.

Frequently, the infection goes unnoticed. Infection is often recognized more easily in children than in adults. In extreme cases, the patient may experience abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea, usually described as containing mucus and fat but not blood. Microscopic examination of stool specimens reveals the trophozoite or cyst stages of the parasitic life cycle.

Metronidazole (Flagyl) is commonly used to treat Giardia, but success rates for this and alternative therapies are inconsistent. Patients with Giardia infections should be instructed that the organism can be easily transmitted in family or group settings. Personal hygiene measures should be reinforced, and those who travel or camp where water is not treated and filtered should be advised to avoid local water supplies unless water is purified before drinking or used in cooking.

\section*{VIBRIO CHOLERA}

Although reported cases of cholera have been rare in the United States in recent decades, no discussion of infectious diarrhea is complete without mention of this very serious infectious disease. Historically, epidemics of cholera have influenced all aspects of life-from medical to political-and infection rates have been
significant enough to destroy governments and armies. Cholera is always a concern when wars or natural disasters result in inadequately processed wastewater. Vibrio cholera also may be found naturally in brackish rivers and coastal waters.

The V. cholera organism is a gram-negative organism with several different serotypes. The type usually associated with epidemics is toxigenic V. cholera 01. The organism is transmitted by contaminated food or water. Most recent cases in the United States have been from contaminated shellfish found in the Gulf of Mexico or by visitors who have brought contaminated shellfish into the United States.

Cholera causes disease with a very rapid onset of copious diarrhea in which up to 1 L of fluid per hour can be lost. Dehydration, with subsequent cardiopulmonary collapse may cause rapid progression from onset of signs and symptoms to death. The principal therapy is rehydration. Rehydration efforts should be vigorous and sustained. If oral rehydration cannot be accomplished, the patient should be hospitalized for intravenous therapy support.

In the United States, cholera should be suspected in patients who have watery diarrhea after eating shellfish harvested from the Gulf of Mexico. Confirmation of the causative organism can be made by stool culture. It is imperative that all cases are reported to local and state public health authorities. People traveling to areas where cholera occurs regularly should remember the simple rule of thumb: "boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it".

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA}

\section*{Assessment}

The most important element of assessment in the patient with diarrhea is to determine hydration status. The goal of rehydration is to correct the dehydration. Assessment includes evaluation for thirst, oral mucous membrane dryness, sunken eyes, a weakened pulse, and loss of skin turgor. Careful observation for these signs is especially important in cases of rapidly dehydrating diseases (most notably cholera) and in younger children.

Intake and output measurements are crucial in determining fluid balance. Liquid stool should be measured and recorded along with a record of the frequency of stools. It is important to note the consistency and appearance of stool as key indicators of the type and severity of the diarrheal disease. The presence of mucus or blood should also be documented.

When conducting a health history, the nurse must determine whether the patient has recently traveled, whether the patient is being treated with antibiotics, whether the patient has been in contact with anyone who has recently had diarrheal disease, and what the patient has recently eaten. Frequently, patients attribute the most recent meals eaten as the cause of symptoms. However, the incubation period for most diarrheal conditions is longer than the time interval between meals, and the nurse needs to get detailed information about the meal preceding the illness and about all food intake in the previous 3 to 4 days. When eliciting this kind of history, it is helpful to ask the patient to list every food tasted. The nurse also asks patients if they are employed in a food preparation service, because the local public health departments should be notified about any patient with infectious diarrhea who works in the food industry.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Deficient fluid volume related to fluid lost through diarrhea
- Deficient knowledge about the infection and the risk of transmission to others

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Bacteremia
- Hypovolemic shock

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The most important goals are maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, increased knowledge about the disease and risk of transmission, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{CORRECTING DEHYDRATION ASSOCIATED WITH DIARRHEA}

The patient is assessed to determine the degree of dehydration. This assessment helps determine the amount and route of rehydration needed. Oral therapy can rehydrate most patients. Oral rehydration therapy is a strategy used to reduce the severe complications of diarrheal disease regardless of causative agent. It is inexpensive and effective, but it is often underused because of sustained cultural beliefs discouraging oral intake during episodes of diarrhea. After much refinement of the formula, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nation's International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) agreed on the makeup of a single solution for treatment of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance associated with cholera and other forms of diarrheal disease. The solution contains (in millimoles per liter) sodium, 90 ; potassium, 20; chloride, 80; citrate, 10; and glucose, 111.

\section*{Mild Dehydration}

The patient exhibits dry mucous membranes of the mouth and increased thirst. The rehydration goal at this level is to deliver about 50 mL of oral rehydration solution (ORS) per 1 kg of weight over a 4-hour interval.

\section*{Moderate Dehydration}

Sunken eyes, loss of skin turgor, and dry oral mucous membranes are common manifestations. An infant may have a sunken fontanel. The rehydration goal is about $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 4 hours for the patient with moderate dehydration.

\section*{Severe Dehydration}

The patient with severe dehydration shows signs of shock (ie, rapid thready pulse, cyanosis, cold extremities, rapid breathing, lethargy, or coma) and should receive intravenous replacement until hemodynamic and mental status return to normal. When improvement is evident, the patient can be treated with ORS.

\section*{ADMINISTERING REHYDRATION THERAPY}

In the United States, commercially available preparations, such as Pedialyte and Rice-Lyte, have been effective fluid and electrolyte replacements for children with viral diarrheal disorders common
in this country. When diarrheal losses are very high ( $>10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ per hour), however, the lower sodium concentrations of these formulas make them less appropriate than the WHO formula.

For the hospitalized child, diarrheal fluid loss should be weighed, and ORS should be administered at a rate of 1 mL for each gram of diarrheal stool. Stool losses can be estimated so that the patient receives about $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ ORS for each diarrheal stool.

It is important for children and adults suffering from acute diarrheal symptoms to maintain caloric intake. Infants who are breastfed should continue to feed on demand; those who are receiving formula should receive full-strength, lactose-free or lactosereduced formulas immediately after rehydration. Children who normally eat semisolid or solid food should have that food offered. Recommended foods include starches, cereals, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. Foods that are high in simple sugars, such as undiluted apple juice or gelatin, should be avoided.

Because diarrheal episodes are often accompanied by vomiting, rehydration and refeeding can be difficult. Oral rehydration therapy should be delivered frequently in small amounts. When vomiting is persistent, small children often require frequent administration of fluids by spoonfuls rather than by drinking from a bottle or a cup. Intravenous therapy is necessary for the patient who is severely dehydrated or in shock.

\section*{INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND PREVENTING SPREAD OF INFECTION}

Public health nurses, school nurses, and others who are involved in patient teaching should emphasize principles of safe food preparation, with special attention to meat preparation and cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until no longer pink, and all meat should be maintained at temperatures below $40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ or above $140^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. In planning events for groups of people, adequate provision for storage and reheating to meet temperature thresholds is important. When preparing food, it is important to use different surfaces, knives, and other equipment for meat and nonmeat items.

Diarrheal diseases discussed in this section must be reported to local or state health departments. The goal of reporting is to provide information that will be used to assess disease incidence trends and to identify at the earliest point if there is a restaurant or other food preparation establishment that has served contaminated food.

The need for rehydration and refeeding should be taught to parents of children with diarrheal disease. Beliefs about illness and food patterns may have a traditional or cultural basis, and any teaching of health facts requires cultural sensitivity.

Good hygiene in the health care delivery and home settings must be a focus when caring for patients with infectious diarrheal diseases. The principles of hand washing and glove use that are emphasized with Standard Precautions are important aspects of disease control.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Bacteremia}
E. coli and Salmonella and Shigella species are all organisms that can be introduced into the bloodstream and disseminate to other organs. Blood cultures should be done for the acutely febrile patient with diarrhea. If initial smear results reveal gram-negative organisms, antibiotic therapy is instituted.

\section*{Hypovolemic Shock}

Shock associated with diarrheal diseases demands accurate intake and output assessment and vigorous fluid replacement. In rare instances, patients with severe fluid imbalance require intensive care nursing support with aggressive hemodynamic monitoring.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include the following:
1. Attains fluid balance
a. Output approximates intake
b. Mucous membranes appear moist
c. Normal skin turgor
d. Adequate amounts of fluids and calories ingested
e. Absence of vomiting
f. Stools of normal color and consistency
2. Acquires knowledge and understanding about infectious diarrhea and transmission potential
a. Takes proper precautions to prevent spread of infection to others
b. Describes principles and techniques of safe food storage, preparation, and cooking
3. Absence of complications
a. Temperature within normal range
b. Negative blood culture reports
c. Achieves fluid balance

\section*{SexuallyTransmitted Diseases}

A sexually transmitted disease (STD) is a disease acquired through sexual contact with an infected person. Table 70-4 identifies diseases that can be classified as STDs.

Other organisms can be transmitted during sexual contact, although they are generally not considered to be STDs. For example, G. lamblia, usually associated with contaminated water, can also be transmitted through sexual exposure.

STDs are the most common infectious diseases in the United States and are epidemic in most parts of the world (Chart 70-3). Portals of entry of STD microorganisms and sites of infection include the skin and mucosal linings of the urethra, cervix, vagina, rectum, and oropharynx.

In June 2001, U.S. Surgeon General Satcher published a document entitled, The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior. This document discusses the public health impact of sexually transmitted diseases

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 70-4 - Conditions Classified as Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and Their Routes of Transmission} \\
\hline DISEASE & ROUTE(S) OF TRANSMISSION \\

\hline Chlamydia & Sexual \\

\hline Herpes simplex & Sexual \\
\hline HIV infection/AIDS & Sexual, percutaneous, perinatal \\
\hline Human papillomavirus (HPV) & Sexual \\
\hline Syphilis & Sexual, perinatal \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Risk Factors for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)}

The risk for acquiring STDs increases for individuals who engage in the following high-risk behaviors:
- Having sexual relations with infected individuals, with multiple partners, or with prostitutes
- Engaging in oral or anal sex
- Using IV/injection drugs

In addition, the rising incidence of STDs in adolescents reflects an increase in sexual activity among individuals in that age group.
and other problems associated with lack of sexual responsibility. The Surgeon General reports that approximately 12 million Americans become infected with an STD each year. He encourages educators and health care providers to study methods of influencing irresponsible behavior and to provide education and services appropriate to the communities they serve (Satcher, 2001). STDs (eg, human papillomavirus, herpesvirus, Chlamydia, gonorrhea) are also discussed in Chapter 47.

\section*{Prevention}

Education about prevention of STDs includes information about risk factors and behaviors that can lead to infection. Included in this education is information about the relative value of condoms in reducing risk for infection.

The use of a condom to provide a protective barrier from transmission of STD-related organisms has been broadly promoted, especially since the recognition of HIV/AIDS. At first referred to as a method to ensure safe sex, the use of condoms has been shown to reduce but not eliminate the risk of transmission of HIV and other venereal diseases. The term safer sex more appropriately connotes the public health message to be used when promoting the use of condoms.

\section*{Significance}

STDs provide a unique set of challenges for nurses, physicians, and public health officials. Because of perceived stigma and possible threat to emotional relationships, those with symptoms of STDs are often reluctant to seek health care in a timely fashion. Similar to many other infectious diseases, STDs may progress without symptoms. A delay in diagnosis and treatment is potentially harmful because the risk of complications for the infected individual and the risk of transmission to others increase over time.

Infection with one STD suggests the possibility of infection with other organisms as well. After one STD is identified, diagnostic evaluation for others should be performed. The possibility of HIV infection should be pursued when any STD is diagnosed.

\section*{HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS}

HIV is the causative agent of AIDS. The definition of AIDS, as determined by the CDC, has changed several times since the syndrome was first recognized in 1981. In general, the definition sets a point in the continuum of HIV pathogenesis in which the host has clinically demonstrated profound immune dysfunction. Many opportunistic infections and neoplasms serve as markers
for immunosuppression severity. Since 1993, the AIDS definition has also included a CD4-positive (CD4 ${ }^{+}$) cell count of less than 200 as a threshold criterion. $\mathrm{CD4}^{+}$cells are a subset of lymphocytes and one of the targets of HIV infection.

HIV is transmitted through sexual contact, percutaneous injection of contaminated blood, or perinatally from infected mother to fetus. Most people infected by the percutaneous route are intravenous or injecting drug users who share contaminated needles, but transmission is also remotely possible through contaminated blood transfusion. Since 1985, all blood transfusions have been screened, and transfusion-related transmission of HIV is now extremely unlikely. Additional information on HIV is provided in Chapter 52.

\section*{Risk to Health Care Workers}

\section*{NEEDLESTICK INJURIES}

Health care workers can be infected through the percutaneous route if needlestick or other injury from a sharp object introduces contaminated blood. Prospective studies of this risk demonstrate that less than $1 \%$ of such occupational exposures (in which the source patient is infected with HIV) lead to transmission (CDC 2001a). Despite the rarity of transmission, health care workers are advised to take extreme care to avoid needlestick or mucous membrane exposure to blood of all patients. Since 2001, em-
ployers in health care institutions are required to provide devices designed to reduce the risk of needlestick and other injury when such devices are found to be beneficial. Since 1996, the CDC has recommended postexposure prophylaxis for significant occupational exposures to HIV. Counseling about the advisability of prophylaxis and appropriate medication and dose selection should be made on a case-by-case basis. Table 70-5 provides the recommended algorithm to determine which combination of antiretroviral drugs should be offered to the exposed health care worker. All health care workers should understand the need to report a needlestick or other percutaneous exposure immediately (CDC, 2001f).

\section*{SYPHILIS}

Syphilis is an acute and chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is acquired through sexual contact or may be congenital in origin.

\section*{Stages of Syphilis}

In the untreated person, the course of syphilis can be divided into three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. These stages reflect the time from infection and the clinical manifestations observed in that period, and are the basis for treatment decisions.

}

Primary syphilis occurs 2 to 3 weeks after initial inoculation with the organism. A painless lesion at the site of infection is called a chancre. Untreated, these lesions usually resolve spontaneously within about 2 months.

Secondary syphilis occurs when the hematogenous spread of organisms from the original chancre leads to generalized infection. The rash of secondary syphilis generally occurs about 2 to 8 weeks after the chancre and involves the trunk and the extremities, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Transmission of the organism can occur through contact with these lesions. Generalized signs of infection may include lymphadenopathy, arthritis, meningitis, hair loss, fever, malaise, and weight loss.

After the secondary stage, there is a period of latency, during which the infected person has no signs or symptoms of syphilis. Latency can be interrupted by a recurrence of secondary syphilis.

Tertiary syphilis is the final stage in the natural history of the disease. It is estimated that between $20 \%$ and $40 \%$ of those infected do not exhibit signs and symptoms of this final stage. In this stage, syphilis presents as a slowly progressive, inflammatory disease with the potential to affect multiple organs. The most common manifestations at this level are aortitis and neurosyphilis, as evidenced by dementia, psychosis, paresis, stroke, or meningitis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Because syphilis shares symptoms with many diseases, clinical history and laboratory evaluation are important. The conclusive diagnosis of syphilis can be made by direct identification of the spirochete obtained from the chancre lesions of primary syphilis. Serologic tests used in the diagnosis of secondary and tertiary syphilis require clinical correlation in interpretation. The serologic tests are summarized as follows:
- Nontreponemal or reagin tests, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or the rapid plasma reagin circle card test (RPR-CT), are generally used for screening and diagnosis. After adequate therapy, the test result is expected to decrease quantitatively until it is read as negative, usually about 2 years after therapy is completed.
- Treponemal tests, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) and the microhemagglutination test (MHA-TP), are used to verify that the screening test did not represent a false-positive result. Positive results usually are positive for life and therefore are not appropriate to determine therapeutic effectiveness.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of all stages of syphilis is administration of antibiotics. Penicillin G benzathine is the medication of choice for early syphilis or latent syphilis of less than 1 year's duration. It is administered by intramuscular injection at a single session. The same therapy is recommended for patients with early latent syphilis. Patients with late latent or latent syphilis of unknown duration should receive three injections at 1 -week intervals. Patients who are allergic to penicillin are usually treated with doxycycline. The patient treated with penicillin is monitored for 30 minutes after the injection to observe for a possible allergic reaction.

Treatment guidelines established by the CDC are updated on a regular basis. Recommendations provide special guidelines for treatment in the setting of pregnancy, allergy, HIV infection, pediatric infection, congenital infection, and neurosyphilis (CDC, 2002d).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Syphilis is a reportable communicable disease. In any health care facility, a mechanism should be in place to ensure that all patients who are diagnosed are reported to the state or local public health department to ensure community follow-up. The public health department is responsible for interviewing the patient to determine sexual contacts, so that contact notification and screening can be initiated.

Lesions of primary and secondary syphilis may be highly infective. Gloves are worn when having direct contact with lesions, and hands are washed after gloves are removed. Isolation in a private room is not required (Chart 70-4).

\section*{GONORRHEA}
$N$. gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative bacterium that is transmitted primarily through sexual contact. Infection can also occur in neonates as a result of contact during birth. N. gonorrhoeae can cause mucosal, local, or disseminated infection. Asymptomatic infection is somewhat common.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Gonorrhea most frequently manifests with local manifestations. In men, urethritis and epididymitis are the most common symptoms. Gonorrhea is more likely to be asymptomatic in women than in men. The uterine cervix is the primary site of local infection, and symptoms often include urinary tract infection, increased vaginal discharge, and itching. The most common complication of localized gonococcal infection in women is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), in which the organism infects the uterus, fallopian tubes, or peritoneal fluid. A complication of gonococcal PID is increased risk for ectopic pregnancy and bilateral tubal occlusion, which results in infertility.

In rare circumstances, the organism may disseminate in untreated, infected people. Other systemic signs, such as arthritis or dermatitis, can accompany bacteremia. In rare instances, valves of the heart can be infected with $N$. gonorrhoeae, or gonococcal meningitis can develop.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient is assessed for fever; for urethral, vaginal, and rectal discharge; and for signs of arthritis. Culture and sensitivity studies are the usual and preferred methods of diagnosing and verifying effectiveness of therapy. In the male patient, specimens are obtained from the urethra, anal canal, and pharynx. In the female

- The patient is instructed to complete the full course of therapy if multiple penicillin injections are required.
- The patient with primary or secondary syphilis is assured that with proper treatment, skin lesions and other sequelae of infection will improve, and serology eventually will reflect cure.
- The patient is instructed to refrain from sexual contact with previous or current partners until they have been treated.
patient, cultures are obtained from the endocervix, pharynx, and anal canal. When obtaining these cultures, the nurse should wear disposable gloves and wash hands thoroughly after glove removal. Lubricating jelly is not used for the vaginal examination because it may contain substances that inhibit growth or kill some pathogens, decreasing the microbiologic test accuracy. Instead, water is used as the lubricant. Because N. gonorrhoeae organisms are susceptible to environmental changes, specimens must be delivered to the laboratory immediately after they are obtained.

\section*{Medical Management}

The CDC-recommended treatment for gonorrheal infections is administration of ceftriaxone (Rocephin) (or cefixime [Suprax], ciprofloxacin [Cipro], or ofloxacin [Floxin]) along with doxycycline. Doxycycline is added to first-line therapy to treat presumptive Chlamydia trachomatis, which commonly causes coinfection in patients with gonorrhea. Patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea who are treated with CDC-recommended therapy do not routinely need to return for a proof-of-cure visit. If the patient reports a new episode of symptoms or tests reveal gonorrhea again, the most likely explanation is reinfection rather than treatment failure. Serologic testing for syphilis and HIV should be offered to patients with gonorrhea, because any STD increases the risk for other STD infections.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Gonorrhea is a reportable communicable disease. In any health care facility, a mechanism should be in place to ensure that all patients diagnosed with gonorrhea are reported to the local public health department to ensure follow-up of the patient. The public health department also is responsible for interviewing the patient to identify sexual contacts, so that contact notification and screening can be initiated.

\section*{CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS}
C. trachomatis is a bacterium that requires attachment to the host cell, invasion, intracellular growth, and replication. This requirement for intracellular growth, which is similar to that of viruses, has made the identification and laboratory testing more difficult than for organisms that grow and replicate independently, but advances have made diagnosis and screening much more available.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

In women, the most frequent clinical manifestation is PID, but symptoms often are so subtle that pathologic progression can occur without detection. Long-term effects may include chronic pain, increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, postpartum endometritis, and infertility.

Transmission of infection from an infected pregnant woman to her vaginally born infant is common. About $20 \%$ to $50 \%$ of infected infants develop chlamydial conjunctivitis, and about $20 \%$ develop chlamydial pneumonia (Schacter \& Grossman, 2001).

Although men infected with Chlamydia are frequently asymptomatic, they easily transmit the infection to their sexual partners.

Urethritis is the most common illness associated with infection in the heterosexual man with symptoms. Among homosexual men, the rectum is the common site of infection.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Chlamydia should be suspected in cases of gonorrhea, nongonorrheal urethritis, PID, and epididymitis. Diagnostic tools include cell culture techniques and a relatively wide range of nonculture techniques, including immunologic assays, DNA probes, and enzyme-sensitive tests.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of chlamydial infection is usually administration of doxycycline or azithromycin. Neither of these antibiotics is recommended during pregnancy. CDC guidelines should be used to determine alternative therapy for the patient who is pregnant or allergic or who has complicated chlamydial infection. The patient and the sexual partner must be treated.

\section*{Prevention and Patient Education}

The target group for preventive patient teaching about C. trachomatis is the adolescent and young adult population. Abstinence, postponing the age of initial sexual exposure, limiting the number of sexual partners, and use of condoms for barrier protection should be promoted. It should also be stressed that screening for Chlamydia and treating infection at an early stage are important to decrease disease progression common to women and to decrease the likelihood of infection in infants.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE}

\section*{Assessment}

The patient should be asked to describe the onset and progression of symptoms and to characterize any lesions by location and by describing drainage, if present. Protecting confidentiality is important when discussing sexual issues. When a detailed sexual history is necessary, it is important to respect the patient's right to privacy. Brief explanations of why the information is asked are often helpful. Clarification of terms may be necessary if the patient or nurse uses words unfamiliar to the other. Asking specific information about sexual contacts usually should be done only when the nurse is part of a team that will contact the partners for follow-up. In the history-taking process, discussion about the patient's understanding of responsibility to inform sexual partners may be helpful in determining patient teaching goals.

During physical examination, the examiner looks for rashes, lesions, drainage, discharge, or swelling. Inguinal nodes are palpated to elicit tenderness and to assess swelling. Women are examined for abdominal or uterine tenderness. The mouth and throat are examined for signs of inflammation or exudate. The nurse wears gloves while examining the mucous membranes, and gloves are changed and replaced after vaginal or rectal examination.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge about the disease and risk for spread of infection and reinfection
- Anxiety related to anticipated stigmatization and to prognosis and complications
- Noncompliance with treatment

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Increased risk for ectopic pregnancy
- Infertility
- Transmission of infection to fetus resulting in congenital abnormalities and other outcomes
- Neurosyphilis
- Gonococcal meningitis
- Gonococcal arthritis
- Syphilitic aortitis
- HIV-related complications

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Major goals are increased patient understanding of the natural history and treatment of the infection, reduction in fear, increased compliance with therapeutic and preventive goals, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND PREVENTING SPREAD OF DISEASE}

Education about and prevention of the spread of STDs to others is often accomplished simultaneously. Discussion about risk factors should emphasize that the same behaviors that led to infection with one STD may introduce risk for any other STD, including HIV. Methods used to contact sexual partners should be discussed. The patient should understand that, until the partner has been treated, continued sexual exposure to the same person may lead to reinfection. Patients may need help in planning discussion with partners. If the patient is especially apprehensive about this aspect, referral to a social worker or other specialist may be appropriate. Such support is especially important when the patient has newly diagnosed HIV infection.

The relative value of condoms in reducing the risk for infection with STDs should be addressed. When appropriate, the patient should be encouraged to discuss any reasons for resistance to condom use, so that decision making about this preventive method can be facilitated.

The infected patient should be told what the causative organism is and should receive an explanation of the usual course of the infection (including interval of potential communicability to others) and possible complications. The nurse should stress the importance of following therapy as prescribed and the need to report any therapeutic side effects or symptom progression.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

When appropriate, the patient is encouraged to discuss anxieties and fear associated with the diagnosis, therapy, or prognosis. By individualizing teaching efforts, factual information applied to specific needs may offer reassurance. For example, patients with HIV should be encouraged to participate in well-coordinated programs in which support, education, counseling, and therapeutic goals are combined. Such programs are designed to offer coordinated care throughout the course of disease progression.

\section*{INCREASING COMPLIANCE}

In group settings (eg, offered in an outpatient obstetric setting) or in a one-on-one setting, open discussion about STD information facilitates patient teaching. Discomfort can be reduced by factual explanation of causes, consequences, treatments, prevention, and responsibilities. Because most communities have expanded STD prevention resources, referrals to appropriate agencies can complement individual educational efforts and ensure that later questions or uncertainties can be addressed by experts. Patients can obtain more information by using the CDC website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/dstd/disease) or by using the voice mail number (1-888-CDC FACT).

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Infertility and Increased Risk for Ectopic Pregnancy}

STDs may lead to PID and, with it, increased risk for ectopic pregnancy and infertility.

\section*{Congenital Infections}

All STDs can be transmitted to infants in utero or at the time of birth. Complications of congenital infection can range from localized infection (eg, throat infection with N. gonorrhoeae) to congenital abnormalities (eg, stunting of growth or deafness from congenital syphilis), to life-threatening disease (eg, congenital herpes simplex virus).

\section*{Neurosyphilis, Gonococcal Meningitis, Gonococcal Arthritis, Syphilitic Aortitis}

STDs can cause disseminated infection. The central nervous system may be infected, as seen in cases of neurosyphilis or gonococcal meningitis. Gonorrhea that infects the skeletal system may result in gonococcal arthritis. Syphilis can infect the cardiovascular system by forming vegetative lesions on the mitral or aortic valves.

\section*{Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Related Complications}

HIV, which is primarily spread as an STD, leads to the profound immunosuppression of AIDS. Complications of HIV infection include many opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis carinii, Cryptococcus neoformans, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium avium.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include the following:
1. Acquires knowledge and understanding of STDs
2. Demonstrates a less anxious demeanor
a. Discusses anxieties and goals for treatment
b. Inspects self for lesions, rashes, and discharge
c. Accepts support education, and counseling when indicated
d. Assists with sharing information about infection to sexual partners
e. Discusses risk-reduction behaviors and safer sex practices
3. Complies with treatment
a. Achieves effective treatment
b. Reports for follow-up examination if necessary
4. Absence of complications

\section*{Home-Based Care of the Patient With an Infectious Disease}

\section*{REDUCING RISK}

The nurse who cares for the patient in the home should provide infection risk prevention for the patient, the family, and the caregiver (Chart 70-5).

\section*{Reducing Risk to the Patient}

Patients requiring home care are often those with immunosuppression from underlying conditions, such as HIV infection or cancer, or those who have therapy-induced immunosuppression, as occurs with many antineoplastic agents. Careful assessment for signs of infection is important.

\section*{HAND HYGIENE}

Hand washing or use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant in the home is an important preventive strategy. Whether a treatment is performed by the nurse, the family, or the patient, appropriate hand hygiene reduces the risk of transient flora.

\section*{EQUIPMENT CARE}

Health care equipment increases infection risk because it is complex and invasive. All caregivers must be taught to pay careful attention to disinfection and aseptic technique. The nurse and the family members should be alert for any redness, swelling, or drainage around a catheter insertion site. Catheter-related sepsis should be suspected in a patient who has unexplained fever.

There is no recommended interval for the changing of indwelling urinary catheters. The nurse should promptly report to the patient's physician signs of urinary tract infection or of generalized sepsis.

\section*{PATIENT TEACHING}

When assessing the immune-suppressed patient in the home environment for infectious risk, it is important to realize that intrinsic colonizing bacteria and latent viral infections present a greater risk than do extrinsic environmental contaminants. The patient and family need reassurance that their home should be clean but not sterile. Common-sense approaches to cleanliness and risk reduction are helpful. The severely neutropenic patient should refrain from eating uncooked fruits and vegetables. For patients with neutropenia or with T-cell dysfunction (eg, patients with AIDS), it is wise to restrict visits of people with potentially contagious illnesses.

\section*{Reducing Risk to Household Members}

\section*{ESTABLISHING BARRIERS AND PRECAUTIONS}

Establishing careful barriers to infection transmission in the household is an important part of home care. The route of transmission of the organism in question must first be determined. The nurse can then teach household members strategies to reduce their risk of becoming infected. If the patient has active pulmonary TB, the public health department should be contacted to provide screening and treatment for family members. If a patient has shingles (herpes zoster), family members who have had varicella vaccine or who have previously had chickenpox are considered immune and need no precautions. However, if a family member is immunosuppressed or otherwise susceptible to varicella, maintaining physical separation may be an important strategy during the time when the patient has draining lesions.

\section*{FOOD PREPARATION AND PERSONAL HYGIENE}

Organisms transmitted by the fecal-oral route may be readily spread in a household setting unless careful attention to food preparation and personal hygiene is maintained. Family caregivers may be vulnerable to acquiring organisms such as Shigella species and C. difficile when assisting in personal care. Hands should be thoroughly disinfected after such contact. The family should be reassured that common household disinfectants are effective in killing environmental sources of such organisms.

\section*{BLOODBORNE INFECTION RISK}

Family members who assist in the care of a patient with a bloodborne infection such as HIV or hepatitis C should be alert for the potential of transmission if sharp objects contaminated with blood are handled. Family teaching may be designed to discuss the need for caution when shaving the patient, performing dress-
ing changes, or administering any intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous medication. It is important to set up an impenetrable container for the collection of needles, syringes, and vascular access equipment.

The nurse should also teach the family about infections that are and are not contagious to family members. With the exception of TB, the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS do not pose a risk to the healthy family member. Family members should be reassured that dishes are safe to use after being washed with hot water and that linens and clothing are safe to use after being washed in a hot-water cycle.

\section*{Reducing Risk to the Caregiver}

Recognizing that a health history may not identify all active or latent infections, the caregiver should carefully follow Standard Precautions in the home. Setting up a work environment in which hand disinfection and aseptic technique can be accomplished as carefully as they are in a hospital setting is important.

It is important for the home caregiver to receive annual influenza vaccine. This is especially true if the caregiver or the patient is older than 50 years of age, has underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, or has underlying immunosuppression.

\section*{Nursing Process: The Patient With an Infectious Disease}

\section*{Assessment}

Symptoms of infectious diseases vary significantly between and within diseases. For some infections, such as chickenpox (varicella), widely disseminated rash represents the first suggestion of infection, and it occurs in most newly infected people. In other infections, such as TB and HIV, latency is prolonged, and most of those infected do not have symptoms; instead, infection is determined through diagnostic procedures.

History taking, physical examination, and the use of diagnostic tests are important for determining the presence of infection and infectious diseases. The goals of eliciting the history are to establish the likelihood and probable source of infection and the degree of associated pathology and symptoms. The patient's previous medical record is reviewed when possible. In obtaining a health history, some of the following questions may be asked:
- Does the patient have a history of previous or recurrent infections? Is the patient aware of infection with an organism associated with prolonged latency, such as HIV, herpesvirus, or TB?
- Has there been fever? How high has the patient's temperature been? What is the fever pattern? Is the temperature constant, or does it rise and fall? Has fever been associated with chills? Has the patient taken medication to relieve fever?
- Is there cough? Is the cough chronic or acute? Is it associated with shortness of breath? Does the cough produce sputum? Is the sputum bloody? Has the patient had a PPD test performed recently? If so, what were the results? Has the patient been given isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis for TB infection? Has the patient been treated for TB in the past?
- Is there pain? Where is the pain? What is the nature of the pain? Does the patient have sore throat, headache, myalgias, or arthralgias? Is there pain on urination or other activity?
- Is there swelling? Is there drainage associated with the swelling? Is the swollen area warm to touch?
- Is there a draining site? Is the drainage associated with trauma or a previous procedure? Is the drainage purulent or clear?
- Does the patient have diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
- Is there rash? What is the nature of the rash-is it flat, raised, red, crusted, purulent, or lacelike?
- What is the patient's vaccination history?
- Has the patient taken medications that could induce rash?
- Has there been exposure to another person who has an identified infectious disease or rash?
- Has there been an insect or animal bite? Has there been an animal scratch or other exposure to pets, farm animals, or experimental animals?
- What medications are used? Have antibiotics been taken recently or long-term? Is the patient being treated with corticosteroids, immunosuppressing agents, or chemotherapy?
- Is there a history of substance abuse?
- Has the patient been treated in the past for other infectious diseases? Has the patient been hospitalized for infectious diseases?
- If sexual history is pertinent, has there been sexual exposure to another person with a known STD? Has the patient been treated for STDs in the past? Is the patient pregnant, or has she recently been pregnant? Has the patient been tested for HIV?
- Has the patient traveled to or from a developing country or abroad? What was the immunization or antimicrobial prophylaxis used for protection while traveling?
- What is the patient's occupation?

Because infection may occur in any body system, physical examination may reveal signs of infection at any body site. Generalized signs of chronic infection may include significant weight loss or pallor associated with anemia of chronic diseases. Acute infection may manifest with fever, chills, lymphadenopathy, or rash. Localized signs vary significantly according to the source of infection. Purulence, pain, swelling, and redness are strongly associated with localized infection. Cough and shortness of breath may be caused by influenza, pneumonia, or TB, as well as many noninfectious causes.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses related specifically to infection may include the following:
- Risk for infection transmission
- Deficient knowledge about the disease, cause of infection, treatment, and prevention measures
- Risk for imbalanced body temperature (fever) related to the presence of infection
Infection may interrupt normal function of any affected body system. These system alterations can be reviewed through the nursing diagnoses for body systems listed in the appropriate chapters.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Septicemia, bacteremia, or sepsis
- Septic shock
- Dehydration
- Abscess formation
- Endocarditis
- Infectious disease-related cancers
- Infertility
- Congenital abnormalities

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Major goals for the patient may include prevention of spread of infection, increased knowledge about the infection and its treatment, control of fever and related discomforts, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION TRANSMISSION}

Preventing the spread of infection requires an understanding of the usual routes of transmission of the organism. The hospitalized patient may serve as a risk for transmission to other patients if the patient's disease was spread by the airborne route or if infected by an organism such as C. difficile, which can be spread directly to others by persistence of spores in the environment. In these situations, strict adherence to isolation measures is important in reducing the opportunity for spread. Preventing transmission of organisms from patient to patient usually requires participation of the health care team. Transmission of organisms on the hands and gloves of health care workers remains a common source of cross-infection in the hospital or clinic setting.

Nurses serve an important role in preventing the transfer of organisms in two ways. First, as the health professionals who often spend the most time with patients, nurses have a greater opportunity for spreading organisms. It is imperative that nurses disinfect their hands before and after contact with patients and after performing a potentially hand-contaminating activity. Hands must be disinfected each time gloves are removed. For example, the nurse who has performed endotracheal suctioning should remove gloves and wash hands before performing wound care on the same patient.

The second way that nurses reduce hand-to-hand spread is to serve as patient advocates. With the number of health care workers involved in patient care each day, there is a significant opportunity for breaks in hand-hygiene technique. To the degree feasible, the nurse should observe the hand-hygiene activities of other professionals and discuss them when lapses in technique are observed.

\section*{TEACHING ABOUT THE INFECTIOUS PROCESS}

For infectious diseases, interruption of transmission requires diagnosis and patient compliance with the treatment regimen. The nurse's role is to educate and, in some situations, to report the case to public health officials for contact tracing and verification of follow-up.

The nurse must stress the importance of immunization to parents of young children and to others for whom vaccines are recommended, such as patients who are elderly, are immunosuppressed, or have chronic illnesses. Nurses should recognize their
personal responsibility to receive hepatitis B and annual influenza vaccine to reduce potential transmission to self and vulnerable patient groups.

Infectious diseases often seem mysterious and frequently are socially stigmatizing. Patient teaching efforts require empathy and sensitivity. For example, in the past, TB was considered a stigmatized disease. The nurse may need to provide core information to the patient who needs INH prophylaxis in order to promote understanding and allay guilt that the patient may feel.

\section*{CONTROLLING FEVER AND ACCOMPANYING DISCOMFORTS}

Fever must always be investigated to determine whether infection is the source. There is evidence that fever, mediated by the hypothalamus, may potentiate beneficial functions in the syndrome of reactions known as acute-phase reaction. These reactions include changes in liver protein synthesis; alterations in serum metals, such as iron; and increased production of certain classes of white blood cells and other immune system cells. Most fevers are physiologically controlled to stay below $105.8^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(41^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. However, severe fever, as occurs with meningococcal meningitis, may cause heat stroke and other complications. Even milder fevers accompanied by fatigue, chills, and diaphoresis are often uncomfortable for the patient. The physician makes decisions regarding fever control. Whether fever is treated or untreated, adequate fluid intake is important during febrile episodes.

> NURSING ALERT Because fever offers clues about infection severity and success of antibiotic therapy, outpatients with fever should be taught to obtain accurate temperature readings. Frequently, parents know that a child has warm skin but do not disturb the child by taking a temperature reading. Body temperature information can be very helpful in adjusting therapy or in reevaluating a preliminary diagnosis.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The patient with a rapidly progressive infectious disease should have vital signs and level of consciousness closely monitored. X-ray findings and microbiologic, immunologic, hematologic, cytologic, and parasitologic laboratory values must be interpreted in the context of other clinical findings to assess the infectious disease course.

Antibiotic therapy is frequently complex, with modifications necessary because of sensitivity test results and disease progression. It is important to initiate antibiotic therapy as soon as it is prescribed, rather than waiting until routine medication scheduling times. This ensures that therapeutic blood levels can be attained as quickly as possible. The Plan of Nursing Care describes nursing interventions for specific complications of infection.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include the following:
1. Uses appropriate methods to prevent the spread of infection
2. Acquires knowledge about the infectious process
3. Exhibits absence of elevated body temperature

\section*{Plan of Nursing Care \\ Care of the Patient With An Infectious Disease}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for infection transmission}

\section*{Goal: Preventing transmission of infectious agents}

\section*{1. Prevent patient-to-patient infection spread}
a. Provide isolation according to CDC guidelines and Standard Precautions
b. Ensure that patients with airborne infections remain in private rooms during hospital stay. If they must leave their rooms, arrangements should be made to decrease the likelihood of contact with other patients. Rooms should be ventilated according to CDC criteria. Personal protective equipment in the form of N95 respirators should be worn as indicated.

The N95 respirator is the minimal level of personal protection for tuberculosis control. The "N" indicates the filter resistance to oil aerosols; and the " 95 " indicates that the respirator has 95\% effectiveness in filtering test particles (CDC, 1998c).

In any care setting where patients may have increased risk for the sequelae of influenza, annual influenza vaccination should be encouraged for personnel and patients.
c. Ensure that patients with highly transmissible, nonairborne organisms such as Clostridium difficile and Shigella species are physically separated from other patients if hygiene or institutional policy dictates.
2. Prevent health care worker's transfer of organisms from patient to patient
a. Perform hand hygiene (by hand washing or by use of alcohol-based solution) consistently and thoroughly, disinfecting hands before and after each patient contact, and after procedures that offer contamination risk while caring for an individual patient
b. Use gloves when handling any body fluid from any patient. Change gloves between patient care activities, and disinfect hands after gloves are removed.
c. Avoid wearing artificial fingernails or extenders when providing patient care. Keep natural nails less than $1 / 4$ inch long
1. Organisms that are spread through an airborne route or are very contagious through direct contact can be transmitted in a health care setting.
a. CDC isolation strategies are developed to reduce the likelihood of transmission from patient to patient.
b. Engineering controls are important in the prevention of airborne diseases. Influenza vaccine safely reduces risk of illness associated with this highly communicable, and frequently virulent, condition.
- No evidence of patient-to patient transmission of infection
- No evidence of transmission via health care workers
- No occupationally acquired infections in nurses and other health care workers
- No evidence of transmission due to contaminated equipment
- Absence of bacteremia, septicemia, and sepsis
- Absence of urinary tract infections
- Absence of pneumonia
c. Increased prevention strategies are needed when the organism has high epidemic potential.
2. Transfer of organisms on the hands of health care workers is a common route of transmission. Hospital organisms colonizing the hands of health care workers may be virulent.
a. Hand hygiene is important in reducing transient flora on outer epidermal layers of skin. Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are effective methods to reduce transient flora.
b. Gloves provide effective barrier protection. Gloves quickly become contaminated and then become a potential vehicle for the transfer of organisms between patients. Microflora on hands are likely to proliferate while gloves are worn.

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Care of the Patient With An Infectious Disease (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
d. Monitor the hand hygiene and glove use behaviors of health care professionals caring for the patient.
3. Prevent patient-to-health care worker transmission of infection.
a. Avoid risk of infection with tuberculosis
(1) Participate in the early identification of patients with active disease. Patients will be asked about risk factors, symptoms, previous exposure, and PPD status.
(2) Expedite diagnostic work-up with chest x-ray, sputum analysis for organisms, and PPD administration as appropriate.
(3) Maintain engineering controls. Keep the patient in a private room with a closed door.
(4) Use protection in isolation room or when participating in procedures that are likely to generate cough, such as suctioning, intubation, or administering nebulized medications.
b. Avoid risk of transmission of bloodborne diseases such as hepatitis $B$, hepatitis C , and the human immunodeficiency virus
(1) Get hepatitis $B$ vaccination
(2) Use Standard Precautions as defined by the CDC
(3) Use "needleless" syringes and other injury-preventing devices

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}
d. Poor compliance with hand hygiene among health care workers has been well documented and should be anticipated. It is important for the nurse as the patient's advocate to communicate protective behavior.
3. Health care workers may acquire infections occupationally due to close contact with patients.
a. The most important element in the reduction of tuberculosis is early identification. Many of the symptoms of tuberculosis are subtle, and may be first observed by the nurse who has prolonged contact with the patient.
(1) Identification of patients at risk can help to prevent exposure.
(2) Confirmation of diagnosis facilitates development of an appropriate treatment plan, including prevention of spread of infection.
(3) Confining airflow to the immediate vicinity of the patient and exhausting air to the outside reduce the likelihood of transmission to health care workers in areas outside of the patient room.
(4) N95 respirators are designed to reduce health care worker risk.
b. Health care workers can contract bloodborne diseases via percutaneous injury such as needlestick or by contact with blood or bloody body fluids to mucous membranes, such as eyes and mouth.
(1) Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered to reduce risk from this contagious bloodborne virus.
(2) Standard Precautions are based on the recognition that most patients are not identified as infected by physical assessment or history taking. Health care workers must assume that all patients may be infected with bloodborne or other infection and must use barrier precautions appropriately for all patients.
(3) Use of injury-preventing devices decreases risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases.

\caption{Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for imbalanced body temperature (fever) related to the presence of infection
Goal: Patient comfort and return of normal temperature}
\end{figure}

Nursing Diagnosis: Deficient knowledge about disease, cause of infection, and preventive measures
Goal: Acquisition of knowledge about the infectious process
1. Listen carefully to what the patient says about illness and previous treatment.
1. Listening facilitates detection of misunderstanding and misinformation and provides opportunity for education.
- Patient actively participates in treatment.
- Patient complies with infection control measures
2. Provide pertinent explanations about: a. Organism and route of transmission b. Treatment goals c. Follow-up schedule d. Prevention of transmission to others
2. Knowledge about specific diagnoses and treatments may increase compliance.
3. Allow opportunities for questions and discussions
3. The patient's questions indicate issues that need clarification.
4. Understanding of the risks and precautions associated with an infectious disease may reduce the opportunity for further spread.
4. Teach the patient and family about: a. Prophylaxis or immunization, if recommended
b. Community resources, if necessary
c. Means of preventing transmission within the home
1. Monitor temperature, pulse, and respirations at regular intervals
1. Graph fever curve to help evaluate when fever occurs, how long it lasts, and whether it responds to therapy.
- Body temperature within normal limits
- Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance
- Patient comfortable

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Care of the Patient With An Infectious Disease (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

Collaborative Problems: Among potential complications are septicemia, bacteremia, or sepsis, septic shock, dehydration, abscess formation, endocarditis, infectious disease-related cancers, and infertility.
Goal: Absence of complications

\section*{Septicemia, Bacteremia, Sepsis}
1. Monitor patient for evidence of infection at any location.
2. Assess treatment effectiveness of all identified infections.
3. Administer antibiotics as prescribed with first dose given at the earliest time possible.

\section*{Septic Shock}
1. Routinely, and as warranted, monitor vital signs for patients with recognized infections and severely immune suppressed patients at risk for shock. In particular, be alert for signs of:
a. Fever
b. Tachycardia (more than 90 bpm)
c. Tachypnea (more than 20 breaths/min)
d. Evidence of decreased perfusion or dysfunction of vital organs in the form of
(1) Change of mental status
(2) Hypoxemia as measured by arterial blood gases
(3) Elevated lactate levels
(4) Urine output (less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ )
2. Administer antibiotics, fluid replacement, vasopressors, and oxygen as prescribed.

\section*{Dehydration}
1. Assess for dehydration (thirst, dryness of mucous membranes, loss of skin turgor, reduced peripheral pulses, urine output less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ ).
2. Monitor weight.
3. Monitor intake and output and serum electrolyte levels.
4. Replace fluids as needed. If the patient can tolerate oral fluids, offer fluids every $2-4$ hours. Administer intravenous fluids as prescribed.
1. Vigilance for bacterial or fungal infection at any site promotes early recognition and treatment and reduces the likelihood of secondary infections.
2. The natural course of some infections may be rapid unless antibiotics are administered promptly.
3. Prompt treatment will improve outcomes.
1. Early recognition of the signs and prompt treatment of impending shock may reduce the associated severity or mortality.
2. Therapeutic maintenance of hemodynamic and respiratory status is necessary until infection is effectively treated with antimicrobial regimen.
1. Signs of dehydration provide a basis for fluid replacement and suggest possible further complications of circulatory collapse.
2. Rapid changes in weight indicate fluid volume changes.
3. Dehydration produces a deficit in some electrolytes. Decreased urine production may indicate hypovolemia and decreased renal perfusion.
4. When possible, oral hydration is preferable because the patient can select the beverage, control the rate and interval of replacement, and care for self at home. Additionally, the risks associated with vascular devices are avoided. If intravenous fluid is required, intravenous solutions are formulated to facilitate intestinal reabsorption of fluid and electrolytes.
- No episode of infection
- Effective treatment of identified bacterial and fungal infections without progression to bloodstream infection
- Early improvement in septic course
- Absence of symptoms of septic shock
- Hemodynamic and respiratory status within normal range
- Attains fluid balance (output approximates intake: body weight unchanged)
- Mucous membranes appear moist; normal skin turgor
- Serum electrolytes are within normal limits

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Care of the Patient With An Infectious Disease (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Abscess Formation}
1. Assess vascular access sites, wound sites, pressure ulcers, and other appropriate sites for apparent collections of purulent material.
2. Assess the patient who has had abdominal surgery or trauma to abdominal area for localized signs of intra-abdominal abscess. These signs include:
a. Low-grade fever
b. Elevated peripheral white blood cell count
c. Localized pain
d. Abdominal tenderness
e. Visible or palpable mass
f. Postoperative diarrhea
g. GI bleeding
3. Assess patient who has had percutaneous abscess drainage to determine whether drainage has been successful. Be alert for all of the above signs and symptoms.
4. Administer antibiotics as prescribed

\section*{Endocarditis}

\section*{Prevention}
1. Teach patients with the following conditions about the value of antibiotic prophylaxis for events and procedures that may introduce the risk of endocarditis:
a. Valvular disease
b. Congenital heart disease
c. Intracardiac prosthesis
d. Previous endocarditis

\section*{Management}
1. Obtain blood cultures as prescribed; carefully record results. Note persistent bloodstream infections with a particular organism.
2. Obtain a detailed history about the duration of fever in the absence of wellrecognized cause.
3. Administer intravenous antibiotic therapy at prescribed time schedule.

\section*{Rationale Expected Outcomes}
1. Collections of purulent material often require drainage before antimicrobial therapy is effective.
2. Intra-abdominal abscess formation is most common following traumatic or surgical disruption of the GI tract. Signs are often initially subtle.
- Absence of abscess
- Takes antibiotics as prescribed.
3. After percutaneous drainage, recurrent or persistent signs of abscess may indicate the need for surgical treatment.
4. Antibiotics, along with drainage, are the most important elements of intraabdominal abscess management.
1. Patients with underlying valvular disease and other cardiac abnormalities are at increased risk for "seeding" of the cardiac valves during procedures that can cause bacteremia.
- Informs health care professionals of cardiac conditions that require antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures
- Takes prophylactic antibiotics as prescribed
1. A definitive diagnosis of endocarditis requires blood culture confirmation.
2. Endocarditis should be suspected in patients who report an unexplained fever of more than 1 week's duration
3. Intravenous therapy is usually required for cure. The goal of therapy is complete eradication of all organisms. Careful adherence to following the scheduled administration is therefore essential.
- Endocarditis is diagnosed, treated, and cured.

\section*{Infectious Disease-Related Cancers and Infertility}

These potential complications of infectious diseases are prevented by primary avoidance of infection. Management of them is directed toward treating each of them as a non-infectious entity. For example, the management of cancer secondary to hepatitis B is handled as an oncology issue, not as an infectious disease issue.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Several patients on your nursing unit have become infected with the same bacteria. The staff wants to develop a campaign to reduce the risk of bacterial transmission between patients. What issues should be stressed? What products should be available? How can the situation be monitored? What outcome measures can be used to determine success of the campaign?
2. You are supervising a patient care technician who is preparing to perform a venipuncture. The equipment that he has brought into the patient's room does not include gloves. How would you evaluate this situation, and what action would you take? Explain the rationale for your decision.
3. An elderly patient with cardiac disease and diabetes asks you why her physician suggested that she receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. She states that she is afraid the vaccinations will "make me sick." How would you respond to her and explain the situation? Describe the line of reasoning you would follow to persuade her to get the vaccine. If she rejects your explanation, examine the different courses of action you could take and the pros and cons of each strategy.

\section*{Emergency Nursing}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Explain emergency care as a collaborative, holistic approach that includes the patient, the family, and significant others.
2. Discuss priority emergency measures instituted for any patient with an emergency condition.
3. Describe the emergency management of patients with intraabdominal injuries.
4. Identify the priorities of care for the patient with multiple injuries.
5. Compare and contrast the emergency management of patients with heat stroke, frostbite, and hypothermia.

8. Describe the significance of crisis intervention in the care of the rape victim.
9. Differentiate between the emergency care of patients who are overactive, those who are violent, those who are depressed, and those who are suicidal.

$T_{h}$he term emergency management traditionally refers to care given to patients with urgent and critical needs. Because many people lack access to health care, however, the emergency department (ED) is increasingly used for non-urgent problems. Therefore, the philosophy of emergency management has broadened to include the concept that an emergency is whatever the patient or the family considers it to be.

Large numbers of people seek emergency care for serious lifethreatening cardiac conditions, such as myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Priorities for managing these cardiac conditions are discussed in Chapters 27, 28, and 30. Emergency management of trauma and other conditions not found elsewhere in this book are discussed in this chapter. It is assumed that care and treatment are provided under the direction of a physician or emergency nurse practitioner.

\section*{Scope and Practice of Emergency Nursing}

The emergency nurse has had specialized education, training, and experience to gain expertise in assessing and identifying patients' health care problems in crisis situations. In addition, the emergency nurse establishes priorities, monitors and continuously assesses acutely ill and injured patients, supports and attends to families, supervises allied health personnel, and teaches patients and families within a time-limited, high-pressured care environment. Nursing interventions are accomplished interdependently, in consultation with or under the direction of a licensed physician or nurse practitioner. The strengths of nursing and medicine are complementary in an emergency situation. Appropriate nursing and medical interventions are anticipated based on assessment data. The emergency health care staff members work as a team in performing the highly technical, hands-on skills required to care for patients in an emergency situation.

The nursing process provides a logical framework for problem solving in this environment. Patients in the ED have a wide variety of actual or potential problems, and their condition may change constantly. Therefore, nursing assessment must be continuous, and nursing diagnoses change with the patient's condition. Although a patient may have several diagnoses at a given time, the focus is on the most life-threatening ones; often, both independent and interdependent nursing interventions are required.

\section*{ISSUES IN EMERGENCY NURSING CARE}

Emergency nursing is demanding because of the diversity of conditions and situations that, if not unique to the ED, certainly present a challenge (Chart 71-1). These issues include legal issues, occupational health and safety risks for ED staff, and the challenge of providing holistic care in the context of a fast-paced, technology-driven environment in which serious illness and death are confronted on a daily basis. Another dimension of emergency nursing is nursing in disasters. With the increasing use of weapons of terror and mass destruction, the emergency nurse must expand his or her knowledge base to encompass recognizing and treating patients exposed to biologic and other terror weapons and anticipate nursing care in the event of a mass casualty incident. See Chapter 72 for a full discussion of nursing care in disasters, including caring for victims of terrorism.

\section*{Documentation of Consent}

Consent to examine and treat the patient is part of the ED record. The patient must consent to invasive procedures (eg, angiography, lumbar puncture) unless he or she is unconscious or in critical condition and unable to make decisions. If the patient is unconscious and brought to the ED without family or friends, this fact should be documented. Monitoring of the patient's condition, as well as all instituted treatments and the times at which they were performed, must be documented. After treatment, a notation is made on the record about the patient's condition on discharge or transfer and about instructions given to the patient and family for follow-up care.

\section*{Limiting Exposure to Health Risks}

Because of the increasing numbers of people infected with hepatitis B and with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), health care providers are at an increased risk for exposure to communicable diseases through blood or other body fluids. This risk is further compounded in the ED because of the common use of invasive treatments in addition to the wide range of patient conditions. All emergency health care providers should adhere strictly to standard precautions for minimizing exposure.

adherence to transmission-based precautions for patients who are potentially infectious is crucial. Nurses in the ED are usually fitted with a personal high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filter mask apparatus to use when treating patients with airborne diseases.

The potential for exposure to highly contagious organisms, hazardous chemicals or gases, and radiation related to acts of terrorism or natural or manmade disasters present additional risks to ED staff. Refer to Chapter 72 for information about decontamination procedures.

\section*{Providing Holistic Care}

Sudden illness or trauma is a stress to physiologic and psychological homeostasis that requires physiologic and psychological healing. Patients and families experiencing sudden injury or illness often are overwhelmed by anxiety because they have not had time to adapt to the crisis. They experience real and terrifying fear of death, mutilation, immobilization, and other assaults on their personal identity and body integrity. When confronted with trauma, severe disfigurement, severe illness, or sudden death, the family experiences several stages of crisis. The stages begin with anxiety and progress through denial, remorse and guilt, anger, grief, and reconciliation. The initial goal for the patient and family is anxiety reduction, a prerequisite to recovering the ability to cope.

Assessment of the patient and family's psychological function includes evaluating emotional expression, degree of anxiety, and cognitive functioning. Possible nursing diagnoses include anxiety related to uncertain potential outcomes of the illness or trauma and ineffective individual coping related to acute situational crisis. In addition to anxiety, possible nursing diagnoses for the family include anticipatory grieving and alterations in family processes related to acute situational crises.

\section*{PATIENT-FOCUSED INTERVENTIONS}

Those caring for the patient should act confidently and competently to relieve anxiety. Reacting and responding to the patient in a warm manner promotes a sense of security. Explanations should be given on a level that the patient can understand, because
an informed patient is better able to cope positively with stress. Human contact and reassuring words reduce the panic of the severely injured person and aid in dispelling fear of the unknown.

The unconscious patient should be treated as if conscious. That is, the patient should be touched, called by name, and given an explanation of every procedure that is performed. As the patient regains consciousness, the nurse should orient the patient by stating his or her name, the date, and the location. This basic information should be provided repeatedly, as needed, in a reassuring way.

\section*{FAMILY-FOCUSED INTERVENTIONS}

The family is kept informed about where the patient is, how he or she is doing, and the care that is being given. Allowing the family to stay with the patient, when possible, also helps allay their anxieties. Additional interventions are based on the assessment of the stage of crisis that the family is experiencing. Measures to help family members cope with sudden death are presented in Chart 71-2.

Anxiety and Denial. During these stages, family members are encouraged to recognize and talk about their feelings of anxiety. Asking questions is encouraged. Honest answers given at the level of the family's understanding must be provided. Although denial is an ego-defense mechanism that protects one from recognizing painful and disturbing aspects of reality, prolonged denial is not encouraged or supported. The family must be prepared for the reality of what has happened and what may come.

Remorse and Guilt. Expressions of remorse and guilt may be heard, with family members accusing themselves (or each other) of negligence or minor omissions. Family members are urged to

\section*{Helping Family Members Cope With Sudden Death}
- Take the family to a private place.
- Talk to the family together, so that they can mourn together.
- Reassure the family that everything possible was done; inform them of the treatment rendered.
- Avoid using euphemisms such as "passed on." Show the family that you care by touching, offering coffee, and offering the services of a chaplain.
- Encourage family members to support each other and to express emotions freely (grief, loss, anger, helplessness, tears, disbelief).
- Avoid giving sedation to family members; this may mask or delay the grieving process, which is necessary to achieve emotional equilibrium and to prevent prolonged depression.
- Encourage the family to view the body if they wish; this action helps to integrate the loss. Cover disfigured and injured areas before the family sees the body. Go with the family to see the body. Show acceptance by touching the body to give the family "permission" to touch.
- Spend time with the family, listening to them and identifying any needs that they may have for which the nursing staff can be helpful.
- Allow family members to talk about the deceased and what he or she meant to them; this permits ventilation of feelings of loss. Encourage the family to talk about events preceding admission to the emergency department. Do not challenge initial feelings of anger or denial.
- Avoid volunteering unnecessary information (eg, patient was drinking).
verbalize their feelings until they realize that there was probably little that they could have done to prevent the injury or illness.

Anger. Expressions of anger, common in crisis situations, are a way of handling anxiety and fear. Anger is frequently directed at the patient, but it is also often expressed toward the physician, the nurse, or admitting personnel. The therapeutic approach is to allow the anger to be ventilated, then assist the family to identify their feelings of frustration.

Grief. Grief is a complex emotional response to anticipated or actual loss. The key nursing intervention is to help family members work through their grief and to support their coping mechanisms, letting them know that it is normal and acceptable for them to cry, feel pain, and express loss. The hospital chaplain and social services staff both serve as invaluable members of the team when assisting families to work through their grief.

\section*{EMERGENCY NURSING AND THE CONTINUUM OF CARE}

As stated previously, one principle underlying emergency care is that the patient will be rapidly assessed, treated, and referred to the appropriate setting for ongoing care. This makes the ED a very temporary point on the continuum of care. Most patients who receive emergency care are discharged directly from the ED to their homes, and emergency nurses must plan and facilitate the patient's safe discharge and follow-up care in the home and the community.

\section*{Discharge Planning}

Before discharge, instructions for continuing care are given to the patient and the family or significant others. All instructions should be given not only verbally but also in writing, so that the patient can refer to them later. Many EDs have preprinted standard instruction sheets for the more common conditions. These instructions are then individualized for each patient. These instructions may be available in a variety of languages. If they are not available in the language that the patient needs, an interpreter should be used. Instructions should include information about prescribed medications, treatments, diet, activity, and when to contact a health care provider or schedule follow-up appointments. It is imperative that instructions are written legibly, use simple language, and are clear in their teaching. When providing discharge instructions, the nurse also considers any special needs the patient may have related to hearing or visual deficits.

\section*{Community Services}

Before discharge, some patients require the services of a social worker to help them meet continuing health care needs. For patients and families who cannot provide care at home, community agencies (eg, Home Care Nursing Services, Visiting Nurse Association) may be contacted before discharge to arrange services. This is particularly important for elderly patients who need assistance. Identifying continuing health care needs and making arrangements for meeting these needs can prevent return visits to the ED and readmission to the hospital.

For patients who are returning to extended care facilities and for those who already rely on community agencies for continuing health care, communication about the patient's condition
and any changes in health care needs that have occurred must be provided to the appropriate facilities or agencies. This communication is essential to promote continuity of care and to ensure ongoing care to meet the patient's changing health care needs.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The ED is a common point of entry into the health care system for patients 65 years of age and older. In fact, patients in this age group account for more than 99 million visits to emergency facilities each year (see Chart 71-1). Elderly patients typically arrive with one or more presenting conditions involving the skin, cardiovascular system, or abdomen. Nonspecific symptoms, such as weakness and fatigue, episodes of falling, incontinence, and change in mental status, may be manifestations of acute, potentially life-threatening illness in the elderly person. Emergencies in this age group may be more difficult to manage because elderly patients may have
- An atypical presentation
- An altered response to treatment
- A greater risk of developing complications

The elderly patient may perceive the emergency as a crisis signaling the end of an independent lifestyle or even resulting in death. The nurse should give attention to the patient's feelings of anxiety and fear.

The older patient may have fewer sources of social and financial support in addition to frail health. The nurse should assess the psychosocial resources of the patient (and of the caregiver, if necessary) and anticipate discharge needs. Referrals for support services (eg, to the social service department or a gerontologic nurse specialist) may be necessary.

\section*{Principles of Emergency Care}

By definition, emergency care is care that must be rendered without delay. In a hospital ED, several patients with diverse health problems-some life-threatening, some not-may present to the ED simultaneously. One of the first principles of emergency care is triage.

\section*{TRIAGE}

The word triage comes from the French word trier, meaning "to sort." In the daily routine of the ED, triage is used to sort patients into groups based on the severity of their health problems and the immediacy with which these problems must be treated.

Hospital EDs use various triage systems with differing terminology, but all share this characteristic of a hierarchy based on the potential for loss of life. A basic and widely used system uses three categories: emergent, urgent, and non-urgent (Berner, 2001). Emergent patients have the highest priority-their conditions are life threatening, and they must be seen immediately. Urgent patients have serious health problems, but not immediately lifethreatening ones; they must be seen within 1 hour. Non-urgent patients have episodic illnesses that can be addressed within 24 hours without increased morbidity (Berner, 2001). A fourth, increasingly used class is "fast-track." These patients require simple first aid or basic primary care. They may be treated in the ED or safely referred to a clinic or physician's office.

Triage is an advanced skill; emergency nurses spend many hours learning to classify different illnesses and injuries to ensure
that patients most in need of care do not wait to receive it. Protocols may be followed to initiate laboratory or x-ray studies from the triage area while the patient waits for a bed in the ED. Collaborative protocols are developed and used by the triage nurse based on his or her level of experience. Also, nurses in the triage area collect crucial initial data: vital signs and history, neurologic assessment findings, and diagnostic data if necessary. The following questions reflect the minimum information that should be obtained from the patient or from the person who accompanied the patient to the ED. Of course, all answers are documented for reference by other health care providers.
- What were the circumstances, precipitating events, location, and time of the injury or illness?
-When did the symptoms appear?
- Was the patient unconscious after the injury or onset of illness?
- How did the patient get to the hospital?
- What was the health status of the patient before the injury or illness?
- Is there a medical or surgical history? A history of admissions to the hospital?
- Is the patient currently taking any medications, especially hormones, insulin, digitalis, anticoagulants?
- Does the patient have any allergies? If so, what are they?
- Does the patient have any bleeding tendencies?
- When was the last meal eaten? (This is important if general anesthesia is to be given or if the patient is unconscious.)
- Is the patient under a physician's care? What are the name and location of the physician?
- What was the date of the patient's most recent tetanus immunization?

Routine ED triage protocols differ significantly from the triage protocols used in disasters and mass casualty incidents (field triage). Routine hospital triage directs all available resources to the patients who are most critically ill, regardless of potential outcome. In field triage (or hospital triage during a disaster), scarce resources must be used to benefit the most people possible. This distinction affects triage decisions. Refer to Chapter 72 for a complete discussion of triage in mass casualty situations.

\section*{ASSESS AND INTERVENE}

For the patient with an emergent or urgent health problem, stabilization, provision of critical treatments, and prompt transfer to the appropriate setting (intensive care unit, operating room, general care unit) are the priorities of emergency care. Although treatment is initiated in the ED, ongoing definitive treatment of the underlying problem is provided in other settings, and the sooner the patient is stabilized and moved to that area, the better.

A systematic approach to effectively establishing and treating health priorities is the primary survey/secondary survey approach. The primary survey focuses on stabilizing life-threatening conditions. The ED staff work collaboratively and follow the ABCD (airway, breathing, circulation, disability) method:
- Establish a patent airway.
- Provide adequate ventilation, employing resuscitation measures when necessary. (Trauma patients must have the cervical spine protected and chest injuries assessed first.)
- Evaluate and restore cardiac output by controlling hemorrhage, preventing and treating shock, and maintaining or restoring effective circulation.
- Determine neurologic disability by assessing neurologic function using the Glasgow Coma Scale (see Chapter 65).
After these priorities have been addressed, the ED team proceeds with the secondary survey. This includes
- A complete health history and head-to-toe assessment
- Diagnostic and laboratory testing
- Insertion or application of monitoring devices such as electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, arterial lines, or urinary catheters
- Splinting of suspected fractures
- Cleaning and dressing of wounds
- Performance of other necessary interventions based on the individual patient's condition
Once the patient has been assessed, stabilized, and tested, appropriate medical and nursing diagnoses are formulated, initial important treatment is started, and plans for the proper disposition of the patient are made. Many emergent and urgent conditions and priority emergency interventions are discussed in detail in the remaining sections of this chapter.

\section*{Airway Obstruction}

Acute upper airway obstruction is a life-threatening medical emergency. The airway may be partially or completely occluded. If the airway is completely obstructed, permanent brain damage or death will occur within 3 to 5 minutes secondary to hypoxia. Partial obstruction of the airway can lead to progressive hypoxia, hypercarbia, and respiratory and cardiac arrest.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Upper airway obstruction has a number of causes, including aspiration of foreign bodies, anaphylaxis, viral or bacterial infection, trauma, and inhalation or chemical burns. In adults, aspiration of a bolus of meat is the most common cause of airway obstruction. In children, small toys, buttons, coins, and other objects are commonly aspirated in addition to food. Peritonsillar abscesses, epiglottitis, and other acute infectious processes of the posterior pharynx can result in airway obstruction.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Common signs and symptoms include choking, apprehensive appearance, inspiratory and expiratory stridor, labored breathing, use of accessory muscles (suprasternal and intercostal retraction), flaring nostrils, increasing anxiety, restlessness, and confusion. Cyanosis and loss of consciousness develop as hypoxia worsens.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment of the patient who has a foreign object occluding the airway may involve simply asking the person whether he or she is choking and requires help. If the person is unconscious, inspection of the oropharynx may reveal the offending object. X-rays, laryngoscopy, or bronchoscopy also may be performed.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

For elderly patients, especially those in extended care facilities, sedatives and hypnotic medications, diseases affecting motor coordination (eg, Parkinson's disease), and mental dysfunction
(eg, dementia, mental retardation) are risk factors for asphyxiation by food. Nursing staff involved in the care of elderly patients must be aware of the symptoms of upper airway obstruction and be skillful in performing the Heimlich maneuver. Typically, the victim with a foreign body airway obstruction cannot speak, breathe, or cough. The patient may clutch the neck between the thumb and fingers (universal distress signal). The first response is to ask this person whether he or she is choking.

If the patient can breathe and cough spontaneously, a partial obstruction should be suspected. The victim is encouraged to cough forcefully and to persist with spontaneous coughing and breathing efforts as long as good air exchange exists. There may be some wheezing between coughs. If the patient demonstrates a weak, ineffective cough, high-pitched noise while inhaling, increased respiratory difficulty, or cyanosis, the patient should be managed as if there were complete airway obstruction.

After the obstruction is removed, rescue breathing is initiated. If the patient has no pulse, cardiac compressions are instituted. These measures provide oxygen to the brain, heart, and other vital organs until definitive medical treatment can restore and support normal heart and ventilatory activity.

\section*{Management}

Establishing an airway may be as simple as repositioning the patient's head to prevent the tongue from obstructing the pharynx. Alternatively, other maneuvers, such as abdominal thrusts, the head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver, the jaw-thrust maneuver, or insertion of specialized equipment may be needed to open the airway, remove a foreign body, or maintain the airway (Chart 71-3). In all maneuvers, the cervical spine must be protected from injury.

\section*{HEAD-TILT-CHIN-LIFT MANEUVER}

The patient is placed supine on a firm, flat surface. If the patient is lying face down, the body is turned as a unit so that the head, shoulders, and torso move simultaneously with no twisting. Next, the airway is opened using either the head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver or the jaw-thrust maneuver. In the head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver, one hand is placed on the victim's forehead, and firm backward pressure is applied with the palm to tilt the head back. The fingers of the other hand are placed under the bony part of the lower jaw near the chin and lifted up. The chin and the teeth are brought forward almost to occlusion to support the jaw.

NURSING ALERT The head-tilt-chin-lift maneuver, which helps to tilt the head back, should be used only if it is determined that the patient's cervical spine is not injured.

\section*{JAW-THRUST MANEUVER}

After one hand is placed on each side of the patient's jaw, the angles of the victim's lower jaw are grasped and lifted, displacing the mandible forward. This is a safe approach to opening the airway of a victim with suspected neck injury because it can be accomplished without extending the neck.

\section*{OROPHARYNGEAL AIRWAY INSERTION}

An oropharyngeal airway is a semicircular tube or tubelike plastic device that is inserted over the back of the tongue into the lower posterior pharynx in a patient who is breathing spontaneously but unconscious (Chart 71-4). This type of airway pre-
vents the tongue from falling back against the posterior pharynx and obstructing the airway. It also allows health care providers to suction secretions.

\section*{ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION}

The purpose of endotracheal intubation is to establish and maintain the airway in patients with respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia. Endotracheal intubation is indicated for the following reasons: (1) to establish an airway for patients who cannot be adequately ventilated with an oropharyngeal airway, (2) to bypass an upper airway obstruction, (3) to prevent aspiration, (4) to permit connection of the patient to a resuscitation bag or mechanical ventilator, and (5) to facilitate the removal of tracheobronchial secretions (Fig. 71-1). Because the procedure requires skill, endotracheal intubation is performed only by those who have had extensive training. These include physicians, nurse anesthetists, respiratory therapists, flight nurses, and nurse practitioners. The emergency nurse, however, is commonly called upon to assist with intubation.

\section*{ALTERNATIVE INTUBATION METHOD}

If the patient is outside the hospital and cannot be intubated in the field, the emergency medical personnel may insert a Combitube. The tube rapidly provides pharyngeal ventilation. When the tube is inserted into the trachea, it functions like an endotracheal tube.

One of the two balloons around the tube can be inflated. One balloon is large ( 100 mL ) and occludes the oropharynx. This could effectively provide for ventilation through forced air by way of the larynx. The smaller balloon is inflated with 15 mL of air and can effectively occlude the trachea if placed there. Breath sounds are auscultated to make sure that the oropharyngeal cuff does not obstruct the glottis. Patients can be ventilated through either port of the tube, depending on its placement.

\section*{CRICOTHYROIDOTOMY (CRICOTHYROID MEMBRANE PUNCTURE)}

Cricothyroidotomy is the opening of the cricothyroid membrane to establish an airway. This procedure is used in emergency situations in which endotracheal intubation is either not possible or contraindicated, as in airway obstruction from extensive maxillofacial trauma, cervical spine injuries, laryngospasm, laryngeal edema (after an allergic reaction), hemorrhage into neck tissue, or obstruction of the larynx.

After these maneuvers are performed, the patient is assessed for breathing by watching for chest movement and listening and feeling for air movement.

In such a case, nursing diagnoses would include ineffective airway clearance due to obstruction of the tongue, object, or fluids (blood, saliva). The nursing diagnosis may also be ineffective breathing pattern due to obstruction or injury.

\section*{Hemorrhage}

Only a few conditions, such as obstructed airway or a sucking wound of the chest, take precedence over the immediate control of hemorrhage. Stopping bleeding is essential to the care and survival of patients in an emergency or disaster situation. Hemorrhage that results in the reduction of circulating blood volume is a primary cause of shock. Minor bleeding, which is usually venous, generally stops spontaneously unless the patient has a bleeding disorder or has been taking anticoagulants.

HEIMLICH MANEUVER (subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts)

\section*{For standing or sitting conscious patient:}

Stand behind the patient; wrap your arms around the patient's waist, and proceed as follows:
1. Make a fist with one hand, placing the thumb side of the fist against the patient's abdomen, in the midline slightly above the umbilicus and well below the xiphoid process. Grasp the fist with the other hand.
2. Press your fist into the patient's abdomen with a quick inward and upward thrust. Each new thrust should be a separate and distinct maneuver.

\section*{For patient lying (unconscious):}
1. Position patient on the back.
2. Kneel astride the patient's thighs, facing the head.
3. Place the heel of one hand against the patient's abdomen, in the midline slightly above the umbilicus and well below the tip of the xiphoid; place the second hand directly on top of the first.
4. Press into the abdomen with a quick upward thrust.

\section*{Finger sweep:}
1. Open the adult patient's mouth by grasping both the tongue and lower jaw between the thumb and fingers and lifting the mandible (tongue-jaw lift).
2. Insert the index finger of the other hand down along the inside of the cheek and scrape across the back of the throat.
3. Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and maneuver it into the mouth for removal.
Chest thrusts with conscious patient standing or sitting:
1. Stand behind patient with arms under patient's axillae to encircle patient's chest.
2. Place thumb side of your fist on middle of patient's sternum, taking care to avoid xiphoid process and margins of rib cage.
3. Grasp your fist with the other hand and perform backward thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or patient becomes unconscious.
Chest thrust with patient lying (unconscious):
1. Place the patient on the back and kneel close to the side of the patient's body.
2. Place the heel of your hand on the lower half of the sternum.
3. Deliver each chest thrust slowly and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction.

\section*{RATIONALE/AMPLIFICATION}

Air movement is absent in the presence of complete airway obstruction. Oxygen saturation in the blood decreases rapidly because the obstructed airway prevents entry of air into the lungs. Oxygen deficit occurs in the brain, resulting in unconsciousness, with death following rapidly.

The term Heimlich maneuver is used for the sake of uniformity. The terms subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts and abdominal thrusts are used interchangeably, depending on the circumstances.

A subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrust, by elevating the diaphragm, can force air from the lungs to create an artificial cough intended to move and expel an obstructing foreign body from the airway.

This maneuver is to be used only in the unconscious adult patient. This action draws the tongue away from the back of the throat and away from the foreign body that may be lodged there.

Care is used to avoid forcing the object deeper into the throat.

This technique is to be used only in the patient in advanced stages of pregnancy or in the markedly obese person.

Each thrust should be administered with the intent of relieving the obstruction.

This maneuver is used only in the patient in advanced stages of pregnancy or when the rescuer cannot apply the Heimlich maneuver effectively to the unconscious, markedly obese person.

Adapted from Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Tulsa, OK: CPR Publishers, 2001.

The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of shock: cool, moist skin (resulting from poor peripheral perfusion), falling blood pressure, increasing heart rate, delayed capillary refill, and decreasing urine volume (a late sign) (Chart 71-5). The goals of emergency management are to control the bleeding, maintain an adequately circulating blood volume for tissue oxygenation, and prevent shock. Patients who hemorrhage are at risk for cardiac arrest caused by hypovolemia with secondary anoxia. Nursing interventions are carried out collaboratively with other members of the emergency health care team.

\section*{Management}

\section*{FLUID REPLACEMENT}

Whenever a patient is experiencing hemorrhage-whether external or internal-a loss of circulating blood results in a fluid volume deficit and decreased cardiac output. Therefore, fluid replacement is imperative to maintain circulation. Typically, two large-bore intravenous cannulae are inserted to provide a means for fluid and blood replacement, and blood samples are obtained for analysis, typing, and cross-matching. Replacement fluids are

\section*{Inserting an Oropharyngeal Airway}
1. Measure the oral airway alongside the head. The airway should reach from lip to ear.
2. Extend the patient's head by placing one hand under the bony chin (only if the cervical spine is uninjured). With the other hand, tilt the head backward by applying pressure to the forehead while simultaneously lifting the chin forward.
3. Open the patient's mouth.

administered as prescribed, depending on clinical estimates of the type and volume of fluid lost. Replacement fluids may include isotonic electrolyte solutions (lactated Ringer's, normal saline), colloid, and blood component therapy.

Packed red blood cells are infused when there is massive blood loss. In emergencies, O-negative blood is used for women of childbearing age and O-positive blood is used for men and for postmenopausal women. In an emergent situation, there is
4. (A) Insert the oropharyngeal airway with the tip facing up toward the roof of the mouth until it passes the uvula. (B) Rotate the tip 180 degrees so that the tip is pointed down toward the pharynx. This displaces the tongue anteriorly, and the patient then breathes through and around the airway.
5. The distal end of the oropharyngeal airway is in the hypopharynx, and the flange is approximately at the patient's lips. Make sure that the tongue has not been pushed into the airway.

not time to type and cross-match or type and screen blood. O-negative blood provides safe administration of blood immediately without sensitizing an Rh-negative woman to Rh-positive blood. Sensitization can result in difficulties during pregnancy later.

Additional platelets and clotting factors are given when large amounts of blood are needed, because replacement blood is deficient in clotting factors.

NURSING ALERT The infusion rate is determined by the severity of the blood loss and the clinical evidence of hypovolemia. If massive blood replacement is necessary, the blood must be warmed in a commercial blood warmer, because administration of large amounts of blood that has been refrigerated has a core cooling effect that may lead to cardiac arrest.

\section*{CONTROL OF EXTERNAL HEMORRHAGE}

If a patient is hemorrhaging externally (eg, from a wound), a rapid physical assessment is performed as the patient's clothing is
cut away in an attempt to identify the area of hemorrhage. Direct, firm pressure is applied over the bleeding area or the involved artery (Fig. 71-2). Most bleeding can be stopped or at least controlled by application of direct pressure. Otherwise, unchecked arterial bleeding results in death. A firm pressure dressing is applied, and the injured part is elevated to stop venous and capillary bleeding if possible. If the injured area is an extremity, the extremity is immobilized to control blood loss.

Tourniquets. A tourniquet is applied to an extremity only as a last resort when the external hemorrhage cannot be controlled in any other way. Care must be taken when applying a tourniquet because of the risk of loss of the extremity. The tourniquet is applied just proximal to the wound and tied tightly enough to control arterial blood flow. The patient is tagged with a skin-marking pencil or on adhesive tape on the forehead with a "T," stating the location of the tourniquet and the time applied. Periodically, the tourniquet is loosened to prevent irreparable vascular or neurologic damage. If there is arterial bleeding, the tourniquet is removed and a pressure dressing is applied. If the patient has suffered a traumatic amputation with uncontrollable hemorrhage, the tourniquet remains in place until the patient is in the operating room.

\section*{CONTROL OF INTERNAL BLEEDING}

If the patient shows no external signs of bleeding but exhibits tachycardia, falling blood pressure, thirst, apprehension, cool and

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 71-2 Pressure points for control of hemorrhage.}
\end{figure}
moist skin, or delayed capillary refill, internal hemorrhage is suspected. Typically, packed red blood cells (O-negative) are administered at a rapid rate, and the patient is prepared for more definitive treatment (eg, surgery, pharmacologic therapy). Additionally, arterial blood specimens are obtained to evaluate pulmonary function and tissue perfusion and to establish baseline hemodynamic parameters, which are then used as an index for determining the amount of fluid replacement the patient can tolerate and the response to therapy. The patient is maintained in the supine position and monitored closely until hemodynamic or circulatory parameters improve, or until transport to the operating room or intensive care.

\section*{Hypovolemic Shock}

Shock is a condition in which there is loss of effective circulating blood volume. Inadequate organ and tissue perfusion follow, ultimately resulting in cellular metabolic derangements. In any emergency situation, the onset of shock should be anticipated by assessing all injured people immediately. The underlying cause of shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, neurogenic, or septic) must be determined. Of these, hypovolemia is the most common cause (see Chap. 14).

Altered tissue perfusion related to failing circulation, impaired gas exchange related to a ventilation-perfusion imbalance, and decreased cardiac output related to decreased circulating blood volume are possible problems associated with hypovolemic shock. Therefore, the goals of treatment are to restore and maintain tissue perfusion and to correct physiologic abnormalities.

\section*{Management}

For the patient experiencing hypovolemic shock, ensuring a patent airway and maintaining breathing are crucial. Additional ventilatory assistance is given as required. A rapid physical examination is performed to determine the cause of shock.

Restoration of the circulating blood volume is accomplished with rapid fluid and blood replacement as prescribed based on the patient's response to therapy. Blood component therapy helps to optimize cardiac preload, correct hypotension, and maintain tissue perfusion.

Large-gauge intravenous needles or catheters are inserted into peripheral veins. Two or more catheters are necessary for rapid fluid replacement and reversal of hemodynamic instability. The emphasis is on volume replacement. If it is suspected that a major vessel in the chest or abdomen has been disrupted, intravenous lines may be established in both upper and lower extremities.

A central venous pressure (CVP) catheter also may be inserted (in or near the right atrium) to serve as a guide for fluid replacement. Continuous CVP readings give the direction and degree of change from baseline readings. The catheter is also a vehicle for emergency fluid volume replacement.

Intravenous fluids are infused at a rapid rate until systolic blood pressure or CVP rises to a satisfactory level above the baseline measurement or until there is improvement in the patient's clinical condition. Infusion of lactated Ringer's solution is useful initially because it approximates plasma electrolyte composition and osmolality, allows time for blood typing and screening, restores circulation, and serves as an adjunct to blood component therapy.

Blood component therapy may also be prescribed, especially if blood loss has been severe or if the patient continues to hemorrhage. Measures to control hemorrhage are instituted because
hemorrhage compounds the shock state. Serial hematocrit values are obtained if continued bleeding is suspected. Also, the feet are elevated slightly to improve cerebral circulation and promote venous return to the heart. However, this position is contraindicated for patients with head injuries. Unnecessary movement is also avoided.

An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to record urinary output every hour. Urine volume indicates the adequacy of kidney perfusion. However, fluid replacement should not be delayed.

Ongoing nursing surveillance of the total patient is maintained. Blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates, skin temperature, color, pulse oximetry, neurologic status, CVP, arterial blood gases, ECG recordings, hematocrit, hemoglobin, coagulation profile, electrolytes, and urinary output are monitored serially to assess patient response to treatment. Commonly, a flow sheet is used to document these parameters, providing an analysis of trends rather than single values to reveal improvement or deterioration of the patient's condition.

Additionally, the body's defense mechanisms should be supported. The patient should be reassured and comforted. Sedation may be necessary to relieve apprehension. Analgesics are used cautiously to relieve pain. Body temperature is maintained within normal limits to prevent increasing metabolic demands that the body may be unable to meet.

Resuscitation of the patient goes well beyond a normal blood pressure and visual evidence of perfusion. Lactic acidosis is a common side effect of hemorrhage and injury. It is associated with poor cardiac performance and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Base deficit and lactate are measures of successful and complete resuscitation. End points for resuscitation include a serum lactic acid level lower than $2.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ within 24 hours after injury and normalizing vital signs without ongoing hemorrhage.

\section*{Wounds}

Wounds involving injury to soft tissues can vary from minor tears to severe crushing injuries. The types of wounds that may occur are defined in Chart 71-6. The primary goal is to restore the physical integrity and function of the injured tissue, with minimal scarring and without infection. Proper documentation of the wound, using precise descriptions and correct terminology, is essential. Such information may be needed in the future for

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Cluents $71-6$ \\

\end{tabular} \\

\end{tabular}
forensic evidence. Photographs are helpful because they provide an accurate, visible description of the wound.

Determining when and how the wound occurred is important, because a treatment delay exceeding 3 hours increases infection risk. Using aseptic technique, the clinician inspects the wound to determine the extent of damage to underlying structures. Sensory, motor, and vascular function are evaluated for changes that might indicate complications.

\section*{Management}

\section*{WOUND CLEANSING}

Hair around the wound may be clipped or shaved (only as directed) if it is anticipated that the hairs will interfere with wound closure. Typically, the area around the wound is cleaned with normal saline solution or a polymer agent (eg, SureClens). Antibacterial agents, such as povidone-iodine (Betadine) or hydrogen peroxide, should not be allowed to get deep into the wound without thorough rinsing. These agents are used only for the initial cleansing because they injure exposed and healthy tissue, resulting in further cell injury.

If indicated, the area is infiltrated with a local intradermal anesthetic through the wound margins or by regional block. Patients with soft tissue injuries usually have localized pain at the site of injury. The nurse then assists the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant in cleaning and débriding the wound.

The wound is irrigated gently and copiously with sterile isotonic saline solution to remove surface dirt. Devitalized tissue and foreign matter are removed because they impede healing and may encourage infection. Any small bleeding vessels are clamped or tied. Alternatively, hemostasis may be achieved with cauterization. After wound treatment, a nonadherent dressing is commonly applied to protect the wound. The dressing may serve as a splint and also as a reminder to the patient that the area is injured.

\section*{PRIMARY CLOSURE}

The decision to suture a wound depends on the nature of the wound, the time since the injury was sustained, the degree of contamination, and the vascularity of tissues. If primary closure is indicated, the wound is sutured, usually by the physician, with the patient receiving a form of anesthesia known as moderate sedation. Wound closure begins when subcutaneous fat is brought together loosely with a few sutures to close off the dead space. The subcuticular layer is then closed, and finally the epidermis is closed. Sutures are placed near the wound edge, with the skin edges leveled carefully to promote optimal healing. Instead of sutures, sterile strips of reinforced microporous tape or a bonding agent (skin glue) may be used to close clean, superficial wounds.

\section*{DELAYED PRIMARY CLOSURE}

Delayed primary closure may be indicated if tissue has been lost or there is a high potential for infection.

A thin layer of gauze (to ensure drainage and prevent pooling of exudate), covered by an occlusive dressing, may be used. Other options include split-thickness cadaver or porcine xenografts to simulate the function of epithelium. The wound is splinted in a functional position to prevent motion and decrease the possibility of contracture.

If there are no signs of suppuration, the wound may be sutured (with the patient receiving a local anesthetic). Use of antibiotics to prevent infection depends on factors such as how the
injury occurred, the age of the wound, and the risk for contamination. The site is immobilized and elevated to limit accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces of the wound.

Tetanus prophylaxis is administered as prescribed, based on the condition of the wound and the patient's immunization status. The patient is instructed about signs and symptoms of infection and is told to contact the health care provider or clinic if there is sudden or persistent pain, fever or chills, bleeding, rapid swelling, foul odor, drainage, or redness surrounding the wound.

\section*{Trauma}

Trauma, the unintentional or intentional wound or injury inflicted on the body from a mechanism against which the body cannot protect itself, is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Trauma is the leading cause of death in children and in adults younger than 44 years of age (McQuillan, VonReuden, Hartsock, Flynn, \& Whalen, 2002). The incidence is increasing in adults older than 44 years of age. Alcohol and drug abuse are often implicated as factors in both blunt and penetrating trauma.

\section*{Collection of Forensic Evidence}

In assessing and managing any patient with an emergency condition, but especially the patient experiencing trauma, documentation of all that occurs is essential. Included in documentation are descriptions of all wounds, mechanism of injury, time of events, and collection of evidence. In trauma care, the nurse must be exceedingly careful with all potential evidence, handling and documenting it properly.

The basics of care management for patients with traumatic injury include an understanding that trauma in any patient (living or dead) has potential legal, or forensic, implications. Hence, proper management from both a medical and forensic perspective is essential.

When clothing is removed from the patient who has experienced trauma, the nurse must be careful not to cut through or disrupt any tears, holes, blood stains, or dirt present on the clothing. Each piece of clothing should be placed in an individual paper bag. If the clothing is wet, it should be hung to dry. Clothing should not be given to families. Valuables should be placed in the hospital safe or clearly documented as to which family member they were given. If a police officer is present to collect clothing or any other items from the patient, each item is labeled. The transfer of custody to the officer, the officer's name, the date, and the time are documented.

If suicide or homicide is suspected in a deceased trauma patient, the medical examiner will examine the body on site or have the body moved to the coroner's office for autopsy. All tubes and lines must remain in place. The patient's hands must be covered with paper bags to protect evidence on the hands or under the fingernails. In the surviving patient, tissue specimens may be swabbed from the hands and nails as potential evidence. Photographs of wounds or clothing are essential and should include a reference ruler in one photo and one without the ruler.

Documentation should also include any statements made by the patient in the patient's own words and surrounded by quotation marks. A chain of evidence is essential. If the patient's case is adjudicated in the future, clear documentation will assist the judicial process and help to identify the activities that occurred in the ED.

\section*{Injury Prevention}

Any discussion of trauma management must include a discussion of injury prevention. A component of the emergency nurse's daily role is to provide injury prevention information to every patient with whom there is contact, including patients admitted for reasons other than injury. The only way to reduce the incidence of trauma is to prevent the injuries in the first place. Everyone can benefit from injury prevention information. Using the information after leaving the ED or other health care site is the patient's responsibility. However, the information must be provided.

The key to decreasing the incidence of trauma and saving the lives of productive members of society and children is injury prevention. The emergency nurse should make injury prevention part of daily nursing practice.

There are three components of injury prevention. The first is education. Providing information and materials to help prevent violence and to maintain safety at home and in vehicles is important. Involvement in local injury prevention organizations, nursing organizations, and health fairs promotes wellness and safety. In practice, nursing and other health care professionals should avoid using the word "accident," because trauma events are preventable and should be viewed as such rather than as "fate" or "happenstance." Responsibility and accountability must be assigned to traumatic incidents, particularly because of the high rate of trauma recidivism. Those who are at risk for trauma and repeated trauma should be identified and provided with education and counseling directed toward altering risky behaviors and preventing further trauma.

The second component of injury prevention is legislation. Nurses should be actively involved in safety legislation at the local, state, and federal levels. Such legislation is meant to provide universal safety measures, not to infringe on rights.

The third component is automatic protection. Airbags and automatic safety belts are in this category. These mechanisms provide for safety without requiring personal intervention.

\section*{INTRA-ABDOMINAL INJURIES}

Intra-abdominal injuries are categorized as penetrating or blunt trauma. Penetrating abdominal injuries (ie, gunshot wounds, stab wounds) are serious and usually require surgery. Penetrating abdominal trauma results in a high incidence of injury to hollow organs, particularly the small bowel. The liver is the most frequently injured solid organ. In gunshot wounds, the most important factor is the velocity at which the missile enters the body. Highvelocity missiles (bullets) create extensive tissue damage. All abdominal gunshot wounds that cross the peritoneum or are associated with peritoneal signs require surgical exploration. Stab wounds may be managed nonoperatively.

Blunt trauma to the abdomen may result from motor vehicle crashes, falls, blows, or explosions. Blunt trauma is commonly associated with extra-abdominal injuries to the chest, head, or extremities. Patients with blunt trauma are a challenge because of injuries that may be hidden and difficult to detect. The incidence of delayed and trauma-related complications is greater than for penetrating injuries. This is especially true of blunt injuries involving the liver, kidneys, spleen, or blood vessels, which can lead to massive blood loss into the peritoneal cavity.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In conjunction with the history, the abdomen is inspected for obvious signs of injury, including penetrating injuries, bruises, and abrasions. Abdominal assessment continues with auscultation of bowel sounds to provide baseline data from which changes can be noted. Absence of bowel sounds may be an early sign of intraperitoneal involvement, although stress can also decrease or eliminate bowel sounds. Further abdominal assessment may reveal progressive abdominal distention, involuntary guarding, tenderness, pain, muscular rigidity, or rebound tenderness along with changes in bowel sounds, all of which are signs of peritoneal irritation. Hypotension and signs and symptoms of shock may also be noted. Additionally, the chest and other body systems are assessed for injuries that frequently accompany intra-abdominal injuries.

Laboratory studies that aid in assessment include the following:
- Urinalysis to detect hematuria (indicative of a urinary tract injury)
- Serial hematocrit levels to evaluate trends reflecting the presence or absence of bleeding
- White blood cell count to detect elevation (generally associated with trauma)
- Serum amylase analysis to detect rising levels, which suggest pancreatic injury or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract

\section*{INTERNAL BLEEDING}

Hemorrhage frequently accompanies abdominal injury, especially if the liver or spleen has been traumatized. Therefore, the patient is assessed continuously for signs and symptoms of external and internal bleeding. The front of the body, flanks, and back are inspected for bluish discoloration, asymmetry, abrasion, and contusion. Abdominal CT scans permit detailed evaluation of abdominal contents and retroperitoneal examination. Abdominal ultrasound studies can rapidly assess hemodynamically unstable patients to detect intraperitoneal bleeding and pericardial tamponade. This is referred to as the FAST (Focused Assessment for Sonographic Examination of the Trauma Patient) examination. Pain in the left shoulder is common in a patient with bleeding from a ruptured spleen, whereas pain in the right shoulder can result from laceration of the liver. Even though the patient complains of pain, administration of opioids is avoided during the observation period because their effect may obscure the clinical picture.

\section*{INTRAPERITONEAL INJURY}

The abdomen is assessed for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, spasm, increasing distention, and pain. Referred pain is a significant finding because it suggests intraperitoneal injury. To determine whether there is intraperitoneal injury and bleeding, the patient is usually prepared for diagnostic procedures, such as peritoneal lavage, abdominal ultrasonography, or abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage involves the instillation of 1 L of warmed lactated Ringer's or normal saline solution into the abdominal cavity. After a minimum of 400 mL has been returned, a fluid specimen is sent to the laboratory for analysis. Positive laboratory findings include a red blood cell count higher than $100,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, a white blood cell count exceeding $500 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, or the presence of bile, feces, or food.

In patients with stab wounds, sinography may be performed to detect peritoneal penetration. With this procedure, a pursestring suture is placed around the wound, and a small catheter is introduced through the wound. A contrast agent is then introduced through the catheter, and x-rays are taken to identify any peritoneal penetration.

\section*{GENITOURINARY INJURY}

A rectal or vaginal examination is performed to determine any injury to the pelvis, bladder, and intestinal wall. To decompress the bladder and monitor urine output, an indwelling catheter is inserted after a rectal examination (not before). In the male patient, a high-riding prostate gland (abnormal position) discovered during a rectal examination indicates a potential urethral injury.

NURSING ALERT Urethral catheter insertion with a possible urethral injury is contraindicated; a urology consultation and further evaluation of the urethra are required.

\section*{Management}

As indicated by the patient's condition, resuscitation procedures (restoration of airway, breathing, and circulation) are initiated. A patent airway is maintained, and attempts to stabilize the respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems are made. Bleeding is controlled by application of direct pressure to any external bleeding wounds and by occlusion of any chest wounds. Circulating blood volume is maintained with intravenous fluid replacement, including blood component therapy. The patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of shock after an initial response to transfusion therapy, because these are often the first signs of internal hemorrhage.

With blunt trauma, the patient is kept on a stretcher to immobilize the spine. A backboard may be used for transporting the patient to the x-ray department, to the operating room, or to the intensive care unit. Cervical spine immobilization is maintained until cervical x-rays have been obtained and cervical spine injury ruled out.

Knowing the mechanism of injury (eg, penetrating force from a gunshot or knife, blunt force from a blow), is essential to determining the type of management needed. All wounds are located, counted, and documented. If abdominal viscera protrude, the area is covered with sterile, moist saline dressings to keep the viscera from drying.

Typically, oral fluids are withheld in anticipation of surgery, and the stomach contents are aspirated with a nasogastric tube to reduce the risk of aspiration. Nasogastric aspiration also decompresses the stomach in preparation for diagnostic procedures.

Trauma predisposes the patient to infection by disruption of mechanical barriers, exposure to exogenous bacteria from the environment at the time of injury, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (nosocomial infection). Tetanus prophylaxis and broadspectrum antibiotics are administered as prescribed.

Throughout the stay in the ED, the patient's condition is continuously monitored for changes. If there is continuing evidence of shock, blood loss, free air under the diaphragm, evisceration, hematuria, or suspected or known abdominal injury, the patient is rapidly transported to surgery. In most cases, blunt liver and spleen injuries are managed nonoperatively.

\section*{CRUSH INJURIES}

Crush injuries occur when a person is caught between objects, run over by a moving vehicle, or compressed by machinery.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient is observed for the following:
- Hypovolemic shock resulting from extravasation of blood and plasma into injured tissues after compression has been released
- Paralysis of a body part
- Erythema and blistering of skin
- Damaged body part (usually an extremity) appearing swollen, tense, and hard
- Renal dysfunction (prolonged hypotension causes kidney damage and acute renal insufficiency; myoglobinuria secondary to muscle damage can cause acute renal failure)

\section*{Management}

In conjunction with maintaining the airway, breathing, and circulation, the patient is observed for acute renal insufficiency. Injury to the back can cause severe kidney damage. Severe muscular damage causes a significant release of myoglobin, which can result in acute tubular necrosis. Additionally, major soft tissue injuries are splinted early to control bleeding and pain. Again, the serum lactic acid concentration is monitored; a decrease to less than $2.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ is an indication of successful resuscitation (Blow, Magliore, Claridge, Butler, \& Young, 1999).

If an extremity is involved, it is elevated to relieve swelling and pressure. To restore neurovascular function, the physician may perform a fasciotomy (surgical incision to the level of the fascia). Medications for pain and anxiety are then administered as prescribed, and the patient is quickly transported to the operating suite for wound débridement and fracture repair. Then, a hyperbaric chamber (if one is available) can be used for hyperoxygenation of the crushed tissue, if indicated.

\section*{MULTIPLE INJURIES}

Care of the patient with multiple injuries requires a team approach, with one person responsible for coordinating the treatment. Immediately after injury, the body is hypermetabolic, hypercoagulable, and severely stressed. Mortality in patients with multiple injuries is related to the severity of the injuries and the number of systems and organs involved.

Multiple trauma potentially affects every body system. The nursing staff assumes responsibility for assessing and monitoring the patient, ensuring intravenous access, administering prescribed medications, collecting laboratory specimens, and documenting activities and the patient's response.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Gross evidence of trauma may be slight or absent. The injury regarded as the least significant in appearance may be the most lethal. For example, the pelvis fracture not identified until x-ray may be the injury from which the patient is exsanguinating into the pelvic cavity. Another example is a pneumothorax that is insidiously increasing in size, affecting both the heart and lungs, while the staff are focused on the treatment of external lacerations. An obvious amputation of the arm may have already
stopped bleeding from the body's normal response of vasoconstriction, despite being obvious and a devastating injury; meanwhile, the patient may be dying from an internal, not so visible, injury.

\section*{Management}

The goals of treatment are to determine the extent of injuries and to establish priorities of treatment. Any injury interfering with a vital physiologic function (eg, airway, breathing, circulation) is an immediate threat to life and has the highest priority for immediate treatment. Essential life-saving procedures are performed simultaneously by the emergency team. As soon as the pa-
tient is resuscitated, clothes are usually cut off, and a rapid physical assessment is performed. Transfer from field management to the ED must be orderly and controlled, with attention given to the verbal report from emergency medical services. Treatment in a level I trauma center is appropriate for patients experiencing major trauma. Treatment priorities are illustrated in Figure 71-3.

\section*{FRACTURES}

Immediate management of a fracture may determine the patient's outcome and may mean the difference between recovery and disability. When the patient is being examined for fracture, the body part is handled gently and as little as possible. Clothing is cut off

EIGURE 71-3 Management of the patient with multiple injuries.
to visualize the body. Assessment is conducted for pain over or near a bone, swelling (from blood, lymph, and exudate infiltrating the tissue), and circulatory disturbance. The patient is assessed for ecchymosis, tenderness, and crepitation. The nurse must remember that the patient may have multiple fractures accompanied by head, chest, spine, or abdominal injuries.

\section*{Management}

Immediate attention is given to the patient's general condition. Assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation (which includes pulses in the extremities) is conducted. The patient is also evaluated for neurologic or abdominal injuries before the extremity is treated, unless a pulseless extremity is detected.

If a pulseless extremity is identified, repositioning of the extremity to proper alignment is required. If the pulseless extremity involves a fractured hip or femur, Hare traction (a portable in-line traction device) may be applied to assist with alignment. If repositioning is ineffective in restoring the pulse, a rapid totalbody assessment should be completed, followed by transfer of the patient to the operating room for arteriography and possible arterial repair.

After the initial evaluation has been completed, all injuries identified are evaluated and treated. The fractured body part is inspected. Using a systematic head-to-toe approach, the clinician inspects the entire body, observing for lacerations, swelling, and deformities, including angulation (bending), shortening, rotation, and asymmetry. All peripheral pulses, especially those distal to the fractured extremity, are palpated. The extremity is also assessed for coolness, blanching, and decreased sensation and motor function, which are indicative of injury to the extremity's neurovascular supply.

A splint is applied before the patient is moved. Splinting immobilizes the joint above and below the fracture, relieves pain, restores or improves circulation, prevents further tissue injury, and prevents a closed fracture from becoming an open one. To splint an extremity, one hand is placed distal to the fracture and some traction is applied while the other hand is placed beneath the fracture for support. The splints should extend beyond the joints adjacent to the fracture. Upper extremities must be splinted in a functional position. If the fracture is open, a moist, sterile dressing is applied.

After splinting, the vascular status of the extremity is checked by assessing color, temperature, pulse, and blanching of the nail bed. If there is evidence of neurovascular compromise, the splint is removed and reapplied. In addition, any complaints of pain or pressure are investigated. (See Chap. 69 for a complete description of fracture management.)

\section*{Environmental Emergencies}

\section*{HEAT STROKE}

Heat stroke is an acute medical emergency caused by failure of the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body. It usually occurs during extended heat waves, especially when they are accompanied by high humidity. People at risk are those not acclimatized to heat, elderly and very young people, those unable to care for themselves, those with chronic and debilitating diseases, and those taking certain medications (eg, major tranquilizers, anticholinergics, diuretics, beta-adrenergic blocking agents). Exertional heat stroke occurs in healthy individuals during sports or work activities (eg, exercising in extreme heat and humidity). Hyperthermia
results because of inadequate heat loss. This type of heat stroke can also cause death. See Chart 71-7 for prevention strategies.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Most heat-related deaths occur in the elderly, because their circulatory systems are unable to compensate for stress imposed by heat. Elderly people have a decreased ability to perspire as well as a decreased thirst mechanism to compensate for heat.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Heat stroke causes thermal injury at the cellular level, resulting in widespread damage to the heart, liver, kidney, and blood coagulation. Recent patient history reveals exposure to elevated ambient temperature or excessive exercise during extreme heat. When assessing the patient, the nurse notes the following symptoms: profound central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (manifested by confusion, delirium, bizarre behavior, coma); elevated body temperature ( $40.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left[105^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right]$ or higher); hot, dry skin; and usually anhidrosis (absence of sweating), tachypnea, hypotension, and tachycardia.

\section*{Management}

The primary goal is to reduce the high temperature as quickly as possible, because mortality is directly related to the duration of hyperthermia. Simultaneous treatment focuses on stabilizing oxygenation using the ABCs of basic life support.

After the patient's clothing is removed, the core (internal) temperature is reduced to $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(102^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ as rapidly as possible. One or more of the following methods may be used as directed:
- Cool sheets and towels or continuous sponging with cool water
- Ice applied to the neck, groin, chest, and axillae while spraying with tepid water
- Cooling blankets
- Iced saline lavage of the stomach or colon if the temperature does not decrease
- Immersion of the patient in a cold water bath (if possible)

During cooling, the patient is massaged to promote circulation and maintain cutaneous vasodilation. An electric fan is positioned so that it blows on the patient to augment heat dissipation by convection and evaporation. The patient's temperature is con-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-154.jpg?height=137&width=159&top_left_y=1976&top_left_x=1121)

\section*{Chart 71-7 \\ Health Promotion: Preventing Heat Stroke}
- Advise the patient to avoid immediate reexposure to high temperatures; hypersensitivity to high temperatures may remain for a considerable time.
- Emphasize the importance of maintaining adequate fluid intake, wearing loose clothing, and reducing activity in hot weather.
- Advise athletes to monitor fluid losses and weight loss during workout activities or exercise and to replace fluids.
- Advise the patient to use a gradual approach to physical conditioning, allowing sufficient time for acclimatization.
- Direct frail elderly patients living in urban settings with high environmental temperatures to places where air conditioning is available (eg, shopping mall, library, church).
stantly monitored with a thermistor placed in the rectum, bladder, or esophagus to evaluate core temperature. Caution is used to avoid hypothermia and to prevent hyperthermia, which may recur spontaneously within 3 to 4 hours.

Throughout treatment, the patient's status is monitored carefully, including vital signs, ECG findings (for possible myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and dysrhythmias), CVP, and level of responsiveness, all of which may change with rapid alterations in body temperature. A seizure may be followed by recurrence of hyperthermia. To meet tissue needs exaggerated by the hypermetabolic condition, $100 \%$ oxygen is administered. The patient may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to support failing cardiopulmonary systems.

Intravenous infusion therapy of normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution is initiated as directed to replace fluid losses and maintain adequate circulation. Fluids are administered carefully because of the dangers of myocardial injury from high body temperature and poor renal function. Cooling redistributes fluid volume from the periphery to the core.

Urine output is also measured frequently, because acute tubular necrosis is a complication of heat stroke from rhabdomyolysis (myoglobin in the urine). Blood specimens are obtained for serial testing to detect bleeding disorders, such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and for serial enzyme studies to estimate thermal hypoxic injury to the liver, heart, and muscle tissue. Permanent liver, cardiac, and CNS damage may occur.

Additional supportive care may include dialysis for renal failure, antiseizure agents to control seizures, potassium for hypokalemia, and sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis. Benzodiazepines or chlorpromazine may be prescribed to suppress seizure activity. Patient education regarding the prevention of heat stroke (ie, adequate fluid intake, staying out of the sun especially between 10 AM and 2 PM ) is also important to prevent a recurrence of heat stroke.

\section*{FROSTBITE}

Frostbite is trauma from exposure to freezing temperatures and actual freezing of the tissue fluids in the cell and intercellular spaces. It results in cellular and vascular damage. Body parts most frequently affected by frostbite include the feet, hands, nose, and ears. Frostbite ranges from first degree (redness and erythema) to fourth degree (full-depth tissue destruction).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A frozen extremity may be hard, cold, and insensitive to touch and may appear white or mottled blue-white. The extent of injury from exposure to cold is not always initially known. The history of the patient should include environmental temperature, duration of exposure, humidity, and the presence of wet conditions.

\section*{Management}

The goal of management is to restore normal body temperature. Constrictive clothing and jewelry that could impair circulation are removed. If the lower extremities are involved, the patient should not be allowed to ambulate.

\footnotetext{
NURSING ALERT If the patient requires transport, do not initiate rewarming. During transport, rewarming procedures may not be able to be maintained. In addition, any further cooling or freezing experience will cause significant damage to the already frozen body part.
}

Controlled yet rapid rewarming is instituted. The extremity is usually placed in a $37^{\circ}$ to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ circulating bath for 30 - to 40 -minute spans. This treatment is repeated until circulation is effectively restored. Early rewarming appears to decrease the amount of ultimate tissue loss. During rewarming, an analgesic for pain is administered as prescribed, because the rewarming process may be very painful. To avoid further mechanical injury, the body part is not handled. Massage is contraindicated.

Once rewarmed, the part is protected from further injury and is elevated to help control swelling. Sterile gauze or cotton is placed between affected fingers or toes to prevent maceration. A foot cradle may be used to prevent contact with bedclothes if the feet are involved. Blebs, which develop 1 hour to a few days after rewarming, are left intact and not ruptured, especially if they are hemorrhagic.

A physical assessment is conducted with rewarming to observe for concomitant injury, such as soft tissue injury, dehydration, alcohol coma, or fat embolism. Problems such as dehydration, hyperkalemia, and hypovolemia, which occur frequently in people with frostbite, are corrected. Risk for infection is also great; therefore, strict aseptic technique is used during dressing changes, and tetanus prophylaxis is administered as indicated. Antiinflammatory medication is also prescribed.

Additional measures that may be carried out when appropriate include the following:
- Whirlpool bath for the affected extremity to aid circulation, debride necrotic tissue, and help prevent infection
- Escharotomy (incision through the eschar) to prevent further tissue damage, allow for normal circulation, and permit joint motion
- Fasciotomy to treat compartment syndrome

After rewarming, hourly active motion of the affected digits is encouraged to promote maximal restoration of function and to prevent contractures. Refreezing is avoided. The patient is also encouraged to avoid tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine because of their vasoconstrictive effects, which further reduce the already deficient blood supply to injured tissues.

\section*{HYPOTHERMIA}

Hypothermia is a condition in which the core (internal) temperature is $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(95^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ or less as a result of exposure to cold. $\mathrm{Hy}-$ pothermia occurs when a patient loses the ability to maintain body temperature. Urban hypothermia (extreme exposure to cold in an urban setting) is associated with a high mortality rate; elderly people, infants, people with concurrent illnesses, and the homeless are particularly susceptible. Alcohol ingestion increases susceptibility because it causes systemic vasodilation. Trauma victims are also at risk for hypothermia resulting from treatment with cold fluids, unwarmed oxygen, and exposure during examination. The patient may also have frostbite, but the hypothermia takes precedence in treatment.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Hypothermia leads to physiologic changes in all organ systems. There is progressive deterioration, with apathy, poor judgment, ataxia, dysarthria, drowsiness, pulmonary edema, acid-base abnormalities, coagulopathy, and eventual coma. Shivering may be suppressed below a temperature of $32.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(90^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, because the body's self-warming mechanisms become ineffective. The heartbeat and blood pressure may be so weak that peripheral pulses
become undetectable. Cardiac irregularities may also occur. Other physiologic abnormalities include hypoxemia and acidosis.

\section*{Management}

Management consists of continuous monitoring, rewarming, removal of wet clothing, insulation, and supportive care.

\section*{MONITORING}

The $A B C$ s of basic life support are a priority. The patient's vital signs, CVP, urine output, arterial blood gas levels, blood chemistry determinations (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes), and chest x-rays are evaluated frequently. Body temperature is monitored with an esophageal, bladder, or rectal thermistor. Continuous ECG monitoring is performed, because cold-induced myocardial irritability leads to conduction disturbances, especially ventricular fibrillation. An arterial line is inserted and maintained to record blood pressure and to facilitate blood sampling.

\section*{REWARMING}

Rewarming methods include active core (internal) rewarming, active external rewarming, and passive or spontaneous rewarming.

Core rewarming methods include cardiopulmonary bypass, warm fluid administration, warm humidified oxygen by ventilator, and warmed peritoneal lavage. Core rewarming is recommended for severe hypothermia. Monitoring for ventricular fibrillation as the patient passes through $31^{\circ}$ to $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(88^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.90^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ is essential.

Passive external rewarming includes the use of warm blankets or over-the-bed heaters. Passive rewarming of the extremities increases blood flow to the acidotic, anaerobic extremities. The cold blood with high lactic acid levels returning to the core has significant effects on the core temperature and metabolic response, possibly causing cardiac dysrhythmias and electrolyte disturbances.

\section*{SUPPORTIVE CARE}

Supportive care during rewarming includes the following as directed:
- External cardiac compression (only as directed in the very cold patient)
- Defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation. Patients whose temperature is less than $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(90^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ will experience spontaneous ventricular fibrillation if moved or touched. Defibrillation is ineffective in patients with temperatures lower than $31^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(88^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
- Mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and heated humidified oxygen to maintain tissue oxygenation
- Administration of warmed intravenous fluids to correct hypotension and maintain urine output and core rewarming, as described previously
- Administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis if necessary
- Administration of antiarrhythmic medications
- Insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter to monitor fluid status

\section*{NEAR-DROWNING}

Near-drowning is survival for at least 24 hours after submersion. The most common consequence is hypoxemia. Drowning is one of the leading causes of unintentional death in children younger
than 14 years of age. An estimated 7000 drownings and 90,000 near-drownings occur yearly in the United States. There are approximately 1000 deaths by drowning of children every year. Children younger than 4 years of age account for $40 \%$ of drownings (Suominen et al., 2002).

Factors associated with drowning and near-drowning include alcohol ingestion, inability to swim, diving injuries, hypothermia, and exhaustion. Efforts to save the victim should not be abandoned prematurely. Successful resuscitation with full neurologic recovery has occurred in near-drowning victims after prolonged submersion in cold water. This is possible because of a decrease in metabolic demands or the diving reflex.

After resuscitation, hypoxia and acidosis, the primary problems of a victim who has nearly drowned, require immediate intervention in the ED. Resultant pathophysiologic changes and pulmonary injury depend on the type of fluid (fresh or salt water) and the volume aspirated. Fresh water aspiration results in a loss of surfactant, hence an inability to expand the lungs. Salt water aspiration leads to pulmonary edema from the osmotic effects of the salt within the lung. After a person survives submersion, acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting in hypoxia, hypercarbia, and respiratory or metabolic acidosis can occur.

\section*{Management}

Therapeutic goals include maintaining cerebral perfusion and adequate oxygenation to prevent further damage to vital organs. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the factor with the greatest influence on survival. The treatment goal, prevention of hypoxia, is accomplished by ensuring an adequate airway and respiration, thus improving ventilation (which helps to correct respiratory acidosis) and oxygenation. Arterial blood gas analyses are performed to evaluate oxygen, carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate levels and pH . These parameters determine the type of ventilatory support needed. Use of endotracheal intubation with positivepressure ventilation (with PEEP) improves oxygenation, prevents aspiration, and corrects intrapulmonary shunting and ventilationperfusion abnormalities (caused by aspiration of water). If the patient is breathing spontaneously, supplemental oxygen may be administered by mask. However, an endotracheal tube is necessary if the patient does not breathe spontaneously.

Because of submersion, the patient is usually hypothermic. A rectal probe is used to determine the degree of hypothermia. Prescribed rewarming procedures (eg, extracorporeal warming, warmed peritoneal dialysis, inhalation of warm aerosolized oxygen, torso warming) are started during resuscitation. The choice is determined by the severity and duration of hypothermia and available resources. Intravascular volume expansion and inotropic agents are used to manage hypotension and impaired tissue perfusion. ECG monitoring is initiated, because dysrhythmias frequently occur. An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to measure urine output. Hypothermia and accompanying metabolic acidosis may compromise renal function. Nasogastric intubation is used to decompress the stomach and to prevent the patient from aspirating gastric contents.

In case the patient appears deceptively healthy, close monitoring continues with serial vital signs, serial arterial blood gas values, ECG monitoring, intracranial pressure assessments, serum electrolyte levels, intake and output, and serial chest x-rays. After a near-drowning, the patient is at risk for complications, such as hypoxic or ischemic cerebral injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary damage secondary to aspiration, and lifethreatening cardiac arrest.

\section*{DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS}

Decompression sickness (DCS), also called "the bends," occurs in patients who have engaged in diving, high-altitude flying, or flying in commercial aircraft within 24 hours after diving. Although DCS occurs in relatively few divers compared with the number of dives worldwide, its effects can be hazardous. Being aware of DCS and assessing the patient properly will ensure proper management and result in the least morbidity possible.

DCS results from nitrogen bubbles trapped in the body. They may occur in joint or muscle spaces, resulting in musculoskeletal pain, numbness, or hypesthesia. More significantly, nitrogen bubbles can become air emboli in the bloodstream and thereby produce stroke, paralysis, or death. Taking a rapid history about the events preceding the symptoms is essential. Recompression is necessary as soon as possible and may necessitate a low-altitude flight to the nearest hyperbaric chamber.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

To identify DCS, a detailed history is obtained from the patient or diving buddy. Evidence of rapid ascent, loss of air in the tank, buddy breathing, recent alcohol intake or lack of sleep, or a flight within 24 hours after diving suggests the potential for DCS. Note that some patients describe a perfect dive yet still have the signs and symptoms of DCS and must be treated as such.

Signs and symptoms include joint or extremity pain, numbness, hypesthesia, and loss of range of motion. Neurologic symptoms mimicking those of a stroke or spinal cord injury could indicate an air embolus. Cardiopulmonary arrest can also occur with severe cases of DCS. Because of hypoxia, these patients seldom survive. Any neurologic symptoms should be rapidly assessed. All patients with DCS need rapid transfer to a hyperbaric chamber.

\section*{Management}

A patent airway and adequate ventilation are established as described previously, and $100 \%$ oxygen is administered throughout treatment and transport. A chest x-ray is obtained to identify aspiration, and at least one intravenous line is started with lactated Ringer's or normal saline solution.

The cardiopulmonary and neurologic systems are supported as needed. If an air embolus is suspected, the head of the bed should be lowered. The patient's wet clothing is removed, and the patient is kept warm. Transfer to the closest hyperbaric chamber capable of treating DCS is initiated. The Divers Alert Network (DAN) can be contacted by telephone (1-919-684-8111) to locate the nearest chamber. If air transport is necessary, low-altitude flight (below 1000 feet) is required. However, the patient who is awake and alert without central neurologic deficits may be able to travel by ground ambulance or by automobile, depending on the severity of symptoms. Throughout treatment, the patient is continually assessed, and changes are documented. If aspiration is suspected, antibiotics and other treatment may be prescribed.

\section*{ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION}

An anaphylactic reaction is an acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction that occurs within seconds or minutes after exposure to certain foreign substances, such as medications (eg, penicillin, iodinated contrast material), and other agents, such as insect
stings (eg, bee, wasp, yellow jacket, hornet) or foods (eg, eggs, peanuts). Repeated administration of parenteral or oral therapeutic agents (eg, repeated exposures to penicillin) may also precipitate an anaphylactic reaction when initially only a mild allergic response occurred. See Chart 71-8 for anaphylaxis prevention strategies.

An anaphylactic reaction is the result of an antigen-antibody interaction in a sensitized individual who, as a consequence of previous exposure, has developed a special type of antibody (immunoglobulin) that is specific for that particular allergen. The antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE) is responsible for most of the immediate type of human allergic responses. The individual becomes sensitive to a particular antigen after production of IgE to that antigen. A second exposure to the same antigen results in a more severe and more rapid response (see Chap. 53).

Anaphylactic reaction produces a wide range of clinical manifestations, especially respiratory symptoms (difficulty breathing and stridor secondary to laryngeal edema), fainting, itching, swelling of mucous membranes, and a sudden drop in blood pressure secondary to massive vasodilation (see Chart 71-9 and Chapters 15 nd 53 for additional discussion).

\section*{Management}

With an anaphylactic reaction, establishing a patent airway and ventilation is essential. (This is performed while another person administers epinephrine.) Early endotracheal tube intubation is essential to avoid loss of the airway, and oropharyngeal suction may be necessary to remove excessive secretions. Resuscitative

\section*{Preventing Anaphylactic Reactions}
- Be aware of the danger of anaphylactic reactions and the early signs of anaphylaxis.
- Ask the patient about previous allergies to medications, foods, stings, latex, pollen, and so on.
- Before giving a foreign serum or other type of antigenic agent, ask the patient or caregiver whether the agent was received at some earlier time.
- Ask about allergies to eggs.
- Avoid giving medications to patients with hay fever, asthma, or other allergic disorders unless absolutely necessary.
- Avoid giving parenteral medications unless absolutely necessary, because anaphylactic reactions are more likely to occur when the agent is given parenterally.
- Perform a skin test before administration of certain materials known to produce anaphylactic reactions (eg, horse serum). Remember that negative skin test results do not always indicate safety and that skin testing can precipitate anaphylaxis in highly sensitive individuals. Have epinephrine, intravenous infusions, and intubation and tracheostomy equipment available as precautionary measures.
- If the patient is an outpatient, keep him or her in the office, hospital, or clinic for at least 30 minutes after injection of any agent. Caution the patient to return if symptoms develop.
- Caution patients who are highly sensitive (eg, to insect bites and stings) to carry kits equipped to treat insect stings (epinephrine). Instruct the patient, family, and significant others in the use of the emergency supplies.
- Encourage patients with allergies to wear medical identification tags or bracelets.

measures are used, especially for patients with stridor and progressive pulmonary edema. If glottal edema occurs, a cricothyroidotomy is used to provide an airway.

Simultaneously with airway management, aqueous epinephrine is administered as prescribed to provide rapid relief of the hypersensitivity reaction. Epinephrine may be administered again, if necessary and as prescribed. Judgment is used in choosing the route of administration, as follows:
- Subcutaneous injection for mild, generalized symptoms
- Intramuscular injection when the reaction is more severe and progressive, and with concern that vascular collapse will inhibit absorption
- Intravenous route (aqueous epinephrine diluted in saline solution and administered slowly), used in rare instances in which there is complete loss of consciousness and severe cardiovascular collapse. This method may precipitate cardiac dysrhythmias. ECG monitoring with a readily available defibrillator is necessary. This method is controversial and is not usually recommended because it can lead to more distress than is initially present. An intravenous infusion of saline solution is initiated to provide for emergency access to a vein and to treat hypotension.
Additional treatments may include
- Antihistamines to block further histamine binding at target cells
- Aminophylline by slow intravenous infusion for severe bronchospasm and wheezing refractory to other treatment
- Albuterol inhalers or humidified treatments to decrease bronchoconstriction; crystalloids, colloids, or vasopressors to treat prolonged hypotension
- Isoproterenol or dopamine for reduced cardiac output; oxygen to enhance tissue perfusion
- Intravenous benzodiazepines for control of seizures, and corticosteroids for prolonged reaction with persistent hypotension or bronchospasm
After the acute symptoms have been treated, the patient is usually admitted to the hospital for observation. The patient should be informed about ways to prevent anaphylactic reactions. See Chart 71-10 for strategies to limit exposure to stinging insects.

\section*{LATEX ALLERGY}

Another allergy situation with which emergency nurses are dealing on a daily basis is latex allergy. The number of products that contain latex is staggering. Nurses must be aware of latex allergy (health care providers have died from anaphylaxis related to latex allergy) and the potential for patients to react to latex.

There is an increased awareness among manufacturers of the need for products that are latex free. Latex-free gloves are provided for nurses who have latex allergy or who have signs of allergy, such as itching, redness, or rash associated with use of a latex product. Severe anaphylaxis can occur even on first exposure; therefore, recognition of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis is essential. Treatment must be rapid, and the latex product must be removed promptly. See Chapters 19 and 53 for more information about latex allergy.

Limiting Exposure to Stinging Insects
- Avoid places where stinging insects congregate, such as camp and picnic sites, and insect feeding areas, such as flower beds, ripe fruit orchards, garbage, and fields of clover.
- Wear covering on the feet, and avoid going barefoot outdoors, because yellow jackets nest and pollinate on the ground.
- Avoid perfumes, scented soaps, and bright colors, which attract bees.
- Keep car windows closed.
- Spray garbage cans with quick-acting insecticide.
- Secure a professional exterminator to dispose of wasp and hornet nests or beehives in the home area.
- Remain motionless if an insect is buzzing around. Motion, especially running, increases the likelihood of being stung.
- If allergic, carry a self-treatment kit containing injectable and inhalant forms of epinephrine, an oral antihistamine, and written instructions. Carry it with you at all times.
If Stung, Do the Following:
1. Inject self immediately with epinephrine if allergy is known or allergic response occurs.
2. Remove the stinger with one quick scrape of the fingernail. Do not squeeze the venom sac because this may cause injection of additional venom.
3. Clean the area with soapy water, and apply ice.
4. Report to the nearest health care facility for further examination if allergic response or allergy is suspected.

\section*{INJECTED POISONS: STINGING INSECTS}

A person may have an extreme sensitivity to the venoms of the Hymenoptera (bees, hornets, yellow jackets, fire ants, and wasps). Venom allergy is thought to be an IgE-mediated reaction, and it constitutes an acute emergency. Although stings in any area of the body can trigger anaphylaxis, stings of the head and neck are especially serious.

Clinical manifestations range from generalized urticaria, itching, malaise, and anxiety due to laryngeal edema to severe bronchospasm, shock, and death. Generally, the shorter the time between the sting and the onset of severe symptoms, the worse the prognosis.

\section*{Management}

Management includes stinger removal if the bite is from a bee, because the venom is associated with sacs around the barb of the stinger itself. Wound care with soap and water is sufficient for stings. Scratching is avoided because it results in a histamine response. Ice application reduces swelling and also decreases venom absorption. An oral antihistamine and analgesic will decrease the itching and pain.

In the case of an anaphylactic or severe allergic response, epinephrine (aqueous) is injected subcutaneously (not intravenously), and the injection site is massaged to hasten absorption. The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of anaphylactic reaction and treated as necessary (see previous discussion and also Chap. 15). Desensitization therapy should be given to people who have had systemic or significant local reactions.

Patient and family education is an important measure in preventing exposure to stinging insects.

\section*{SNAKE BITES}

Venomous (poisonous) snakes cause 7000 to 8000 bites in the United States each year and result in 12 to 15 deaths. Children between the ages of 1 and 9 years are the most likely victims. The greatest number of bites occur through the daylight hours into early evening during summer months. The most frequent poisonous snakebite occurs from pit vipers. The most common site is the upper extremity. Of these bites, only $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ result in envenomation (injection of a poisonous material by sting, spine, bite, or other means). Venomous snake bites are medical emergencies (Moon \& Galvan, 2000).

Nineteen different species of venomous snakes are found in every part of the United States, with different parts of the country and the world having different types of snakes. Because snake bites are medical emergencies, nurses should be familiar with the types of snakes that are common to the geographic region in which they practice. Snake venom consists primarily of proteins with a broad range of physiologic effects. Multiple organ systems, especially the neurologic, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems, may be affected.

\section*{Management}

Initial first aid at the site of the snake bite includes having the victim lie down, removing constrictive items such as rings, providing warmth, cleansing the wound, covering the wound with a light sterile dressing, and immobilizing the injured body part below the level of the heart. Ice or a tourniquet is not applied. Ini-
tial evaluation in the ED is performed quickly and includes information about the following:
- Whether the snake was venomous or nonvenomous; if the snake is dead, it should be transported to the ED with the patient for identification
- Where and when the bite occurred and the circumstances of the bite
- Sequence of events, signs and symptoms (fang punctures, pain, edema, and erythema of the bite and nearby tissues)
- Severity of poisonous effects
- Vital signs
- Circumference of the bitten extremity or area at several points; the circumference of the extremity that was bitten is compared with the circumference of the opposite extremity
- Laboratory data (complete blood count, urinalysis, and clotting studies)

The course and prognosis of snake bite injuries depend on the kind and amount of venom injected, where on the body the bite occurred, and the general health, age, and size of the victim. There is no one specific protocol for treatment of snake bites. Generally, ice, tourniquets, heparin, and corticosteroids are not used during the acute stage. Corticosteroids are contraindicated in the first 6 to 8 hours after the bite, because they may depress antibody production and hinder the action of antivenin (antitoxin manufactured from the snake venom and used to treat snake bites).

Parenteral fluids may be used to treat hypotension. If vasopressors are used to treat hypotension, their use should be short-term. Surgical exploration of the bite is rarely indicated. Typically, the patient is observed closely for at least 6 hours. The patient is never left unattended.

\section*{ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIVENIN (ANTITOXIN)}

Although envenomation is rare, it can occur with snake bites. An assessment of progressive signs and symptoms is essential before considering administration of antivenin, which is most effective if administered within 12 hours after the snake bite. The dosage depends on the type of snake and the estimated severity of the bite. Children may require more antivenin than adults because their smaller bodies are more susceptible to toxic effects of venom. A skin or eye test should be performed before the initial dose to detect allergy to the antivenin. However, because even the skin test can cause an anaphylactic reaction, patients should not be tested unless antivenin is to be given.

Before administering antivenin and every 15 minutes thereafter, the circumference of the affected part is measured proximally. Premedication with diphenhydramine and cimetidine decreases the allergic response to antivenin. Antivenin is administered as an intravenous infusion whenever possible, although intramuscular administration can be used. Depending on the severity of the bite, the antivenin is diluted in 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline solution; the fluid volume may be reduced for children. The infusion is started slowly, and the rate is increased after 10 minutes if there is no reaction. The total dose should be infused during the first 4 to 6 hours after poisoning. The initial dose is repeated until symptoms decrease. After the symptoms decrease, the circumference of the affected part should be measured every 30 to 60 minutes for the next 48 hours to detect symptoms of compartment syndrome (swelling, loss of pulse, increased pain, and paresthesias).

The most common cause of allergic reaction to the antivenin is its too-rapid infusion, although about $3 \%$ of patients with neg-
ative skin test results develop reactions not related to infusion rate. Reactions may consist of a feeling of fullness in the face, urticaria, pruritus, malaise, and apprehension. These symptoms may be followed by tachycardia, shortness of breath, hypotension, and shock. In this situation, the infusion should be stopped immediately and intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl) administered. Vasopressors are used for patients in shock, and resuscitation equipment must be on standby while antivenin is infusing.

\section*{Poisoning}

A poison is any substance that, when ingested, inhaled, absorbed, applied to the skin, or produced within the body in relatively small amounts, injures the body by its chemical action. Poisoning from inhalation and ingestion of toxic materials, both intentional and unintentional, constitutes a major health hazard and an emergency situation. Emergency treatment is initiated with the following goals:
- To remove or inactivate the poison before it is absorbed
- To provide supportive care in maintaining vital organ systems
- To administer a specific antidote to neutralize a specific poison
- To implement treatment that hastens the elimination of the absorbed poison

\section*{INGESTED (SWALLOWED) POISONS}

Swallowed poisons may be corrosive. Corrosive poisons include alkaline and acid agents that can cause tissue destruction after coming in contact with mucous membranes. Alkaline products include lye, drain cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, bleach, nonphosphate detergents, oven cleaners, and button batteries (batteries used to power watches, calculators, or cameras). Acid products include toilet bowl cleaners, pool cleaners, metal cleaners, rust removers, battery acid.

\section*{Management}

Control of the airway, ventilation, and oxygenation are essential. In the absence of cerebral or renal damage, the patient's prognosis depends largely on successful management of respiration and circulation. Measures are instituted to stabilize cardiovascular and other body functions. ECG, vital signs, and neurologic status are monitored closely for changes. Shock, which may result from the cardiodepressant action of the substance ingested, from venous pooling in lower extremities, or from reduced circulating blood volume resulting from increased capillary permeability, is treated. An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to monitor renal function. Blood specimens are obtained to test for concentration of drug or poison.

Efforts are initiated to determine what substance was taken; the amount; time since ingestion; signs and symptoms, such as pain or burning sensations, any evidence of redness or burn in the mouth or throat, pain on swallowing or an inability to swallow, vomiting, or drooling; age and weight of the patient; and pertinent health history.

Measures are instituted to remove the toxin or decrease its absorption. The patient who has ingested a corrosive poison is given

\footnotetext{
NURSING ALERT The area poison control center should be called if an unknown toxic agent has been taken or if it is necessary to identify an antidote for a known toxic agent.
}
water or milk to drink for dilution. However, dilution is not attempted if the patient has acute airway edema or obstruction or if there is clinical evidence of esophageal, gastric, or intestinal burn or perforation. The following gastric emptying procedures may be used as prescribed:
- Syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting in the alert patient.
- Gastric lavage for the obtunded patient (Chart 71-11). Gastric aspirate is saved and sent to the laboratory for testing (toxicology screens)
- Activated charcoal administration if poison is one that is absorbed by charcoal
- Cathartic, when appropriate

NURSING ALERT Vomiting is never induced after ingestion of caustic substances (acid or alkaline) or petroleum distillates.

The specific chemical or physiologic antagonist (antidote) is administered as early as possible, to reverse or diminish the effects of the toxin. If these measures are ineffective, procedures are initiated to remove the ingested substance. These procedures include administration of multiple doses of charcoal, diuresis (for substances excreted by the kidneys), dialysis, and hemoperfusion. Hemoperfusion involves detoxification of the blood by processing it through an extracorporeal circuit and an adsorbent cartridge containing charcoal or resin, after which the cleaned blood is returned to the patient.

Throughout detoxification, the patient's vital signs, CVP, and fluid and electrolyte balance are monitored closely. Hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias are possible. Seizures are also possible because of CNS excitement from the poison or from oxygen deprivation. If the patient complains of pain, analgesics are administered cautiously. Severe pain causes vasomotor collapse and reflex inhibition of normal physiologic functions.

After the patient's condition has stabilized and discharge is imminent, written material indicating the signs and symptoms of potential problems related to the poison ingested and signs or symptoms requiring evaluation by a physician should be given to the patient. If poisoning was determined to be a suicide attempt, a psychiatric consultation should be requested before the patient is discharged. In cases of inadvertent poison ingestion, poison prevention and home poison-proofing instructions should be provided to the patient and family.

\section*{INHALED POISONS: CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING}

Carbon monoxide poisoning may occur as a result of industrial or household incidents or attempted suicide. It is implicated in more deaths than any other toxin except alcohol. Carbon monoxide exerts its toxic effect by binding to circulating hemoglobin and thereby reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Hemoglobin absorbs carbon monoxide 200 times more readily than it absorbs oxygen. Carbon monoxide-bound hemoglobin, called carboxyhemoglobin, does not transport oxygen.

Because the CNS has a critical need for oxygen, CNS symptoms predominate with carbon monoxide toxicity. A person suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning may appear intoxicated (from cerebral hypoxia). Other signs and symptoms include headache, muscular weakness, palpitation, dizziness, and confusion, which can progress rapidly to coma. Skin color, which can range from pink or cherry-red to cyanotic and pale, is not a reliable sign. Pulse oximetry is also not valid, because the hemoglobin

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Assisting With Gastric Lavage}

Gastric lavage is the aspiration of stomach contents and washing out of the stomach by means of a large-bore gastric tube. Gastric lavage is contraindicated after acid or alkali ingestion, in the presence of seizures, or after ingestion of hydrocarbons or petroleum distillates. It is particularly dangerous after ingestion of strong corrosive agents.

\section*{Purposes:}
- For urgent removal of ingested substance to decrease systemic absorption
- To empty the stomach before endoscopic procedures
- To diagnose gastric hemorrhage and to arrest hemorrhage

\section*{Equipment:}

Large-bore Levin tubes or large-bore Ewald tube
Large irrigating syringe with adapter
Large plastic funnel with adapter to fit tube
Water-soluble lubricant
Tap water or appropriate antidote (milk, saline solution, sodium bicarbonate solution, fruit juice, activated charcoal)
Container for aspirate; suction apparatus
Nasotracheal or endotracheal tubes with inflatable cuffs
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-161.jpg?height=340&width=591&top_left_y=550&top_left_x=1143)

Containers for specimens

\section*{PROCEDURE}
1. Remove dentures and inspect the oral cavity for loose teeth.
2. Measure the distance between the bridge of the nose and the xiphoid process. Mark the tube with indelible pencil or tape.
3. Lubricate the tube with water-soluble lubricant.
4. If comatose, the patient is intubated with a cuffed nasotracheal or endotracheal tube before placement of the nasogastric tube.
5. Place the patient in a left lateral position with the head lowered about 15 degrees.
6. Pass the tube orally while keeping the patient's head in a neutral position. Pass the tube to the adhesive marking or about 50 cm (20 in). Encourage patient to swallow to assist with passage of the tube. Then lower the head of the stretcher or bed. Have standby suction available.
7. Aspirate the stomach contents with the syringe attached to the tube before instilling water or an antidote. Save the specimen for analysis. Ensure correct placement before installation.
8. Remove the syringe. Attach the funnel to the end of the tube, or use a $50-\mathrm{mL}$ syringe to instill solution in the gastric tube. The volume of fluid placed in the stomach should be small.
9. Elevate the funnel above the patient's head and pour 150 to 200 mL of solution into the funnel.
10. Lower the funnel and siphon the gastric contents into the container or connect to suction.
11. Save samples of the first two washings.
12. Repeat the lavage procedure until the returns are relatively clear and no particulate matter is seen.
13. At the completion of lavage:
a. The stomach may be left empty.
b. An adsorbent (powder form of activated charcoal mixed with water to form a liquid the consistency of thick soup) may be instilled in the tube and allowed to remain in the stomach.
c. A saline cathartic may be instilled in the tube.
14. Pinch off the tube during removal or maintain suction while the tube is being withdrawn. Keep the patient's head lower than the body.
15. Warn the patient that his stools will turn black from the charcoal.

During gastric lavage, the patient is positioned on the left side, which allows the gastric contents to pool and decreases the passage of fluid into the duodenum during lavage.

\section*{RATIONALE/AMPLIFICATION}
1. This will prevent aspiration of teeth.
2. This distance is a rule-of-thumb measurement of the distance the tube must be passed to reach the stomach. This avoids curling and kinking of excess tubing in the stomach.
3. Lubrication eases insertion of the tube.
4. A cuffed nasotracheal or endotracheal tube decreases the risk of aspiration of gastric contents.
5. This position decreases passage of gastric contents into the duodenum during lavage.
6. The depth of insertion of the tube varies according to the size of the patient. If the tube enters the trachea instead of the esophagus, the patient will experience coughing, dyspnea, stridor, and cyanosis. Positive confirmation of tube placement is accomplished by x-ray.
7. Aspiration is carried out to determine that the tube is in the stomach and to remove the stomach contents. Positive confirmation of tube placement is accomplished by x-ray.
8. Overfilling of the stomach may cause regurgitation and aspiration or force the stomach contents through the pylorus.
9. Gravity allows the solution to flow into the tube.
10. The fluid should flow in freely and drain by gravity.
11. Keep the first washing sample isolated from other washings for toxicologic analysis.
12. This usually requires a total volume of at least 2 L ; some clinicians advocate the use of 5 to 20 L .
13.
a. The stomach is kept empty if no further medications are required.
b. Activated charcoal reduces absorption by adsorbing (attaching to its surface) a wide range of substances; it renders the poison inaccessible to the circulation, thereby reducing its toxicity.
c. A cathartic may be given to hasten the elimination of remaining ingested material.
14. Pinching off the tube prevents aspiration and the initiation of the gag reflex. Keeping the patient's head lower than the body also helps to prevent initiation of the gag reflex.
is well saturated. It is not saturated with oxygen, but the pulse oximeter reads the saturation as such and presents the false impression that the patient is well oxygenated and in no danger. Exposure to carbon monoxide requires immediate treatment.

\section*{Management}

Goals of management are to reverse cerebral and myocardial hypoxia and to hasten elimination of carbon monoxide. Whenever a patient inhales a poison, the following general measures apply:
- Carry the patient to fresh air immediately; open all doors and windows.
- Loosen all tight clothing.
- Initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation if required; administer oxygen.
- Prevent chilling; wrap the patient in blankets.
- Keep the patient as quiet as possible.
- Do not give alcohol in any form.

In addition, for the patient with carbon monoxide poisoning, carboxyhemoglobin levels are analyzed on arrival at the ED and before treatment with oxygen if possible. Then $100 \%$ oxygen is administered at atmospheric or hyperbaric pressures to reverse hypoxia and accelerate the elimination of carbon monoxide. Oxygen is administered until the carboxyhemoglobin level is less than $5 \%$. The patient is monitored continuously. Psychoses, spastic paralysis, ataxia, visual disturbances, and deterioration of mental status and behavior may persist after resuscitation and may be symptoms of permanent brain damage.

When unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning occurs, the health department should be contacted, so that the dwelling or building in question can be inspected. A psychiatric consultation is warranted if poisoning was determined to be a suicide attempt.

\section*{SKIN CONTAMINATION POISONING (CHEMICAL BURNS)}

Skin contamination injuries from exposure to chemicals are challenging because of the large number of offending agents with diverse actions and metabolic effects. The severity of a chemical burn is determined by the mechanism of action, the penetrating strength and concentration, and the amount and duration of exposure of the skin to the chemical.

\section*{Management}

The skin should be drenched immediately with running water from a shower, hose, or faucet.

NURSING ALERT Water should not be applied to burns from lye or white phosphorus because of the potential for an explosion or for deepening of the burn. All evidence of these chemicals should be brushed off the patient before any flushing.

A constant stream of water should continue as the patient's clothing is being removed. The skin of health care personnel assisting the patient should be appropriately protected if the burn is extensive or if the agent is significantly toxic or is still present. Prolonged lavage with generous amounts of tepid water is important.

In the meantime, attempts to determine the identity and characteristics of the chemical agent are necessary for future treat-
ment. The standard burn treatment appropriate for the size and location of the wound (antimicrobial treatment, débridement, tetanus prophylaxis as prescribed) is instituted. The patient may require plastic surgery for further wound management. The patient is instructed to have the affected area reexamined at 24 and 72 hours and in 7 days because of the risk for underestimating the extent and depth of these types of injuries.

\section*{FOOD POISONING}

Food poisoning is a sudden illness that occurs after ingestion of contaminated food or drink. Botulism is a serious form of food poisoning that requires continual surveillance. See Chart 71-12 for assessment questions.

\section*{Management}

The key to treatment is determining the source and type of food poisoning. If possible, the suspected food should be brought to the medical facility and a history obtained from the patient or family.

Food, gastric contents, vomitus, serum, and feces are collected for examination. The patient's respirations, blood pressure, sensorium, CVP (if indicated), and muscular activity are monitored closely. Measures are instituted to support the respiratory system. Death from respiratory paralysis can occur with botulism, fish poisoning, and other food poisonings.

Because large volumes of electrolytes and water are lost by vomiting and diarrhea, fluid and electrolyte balance is also an important area to assess. Severe vomiting produces alkalosis, and severe diarrhea produces acidosis. Hypovolemic shock may also occur from severe fluid and electrolyte losses. The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, including lethargy, rapid pulse rate, fever, oliguria, anuria, hypotension, and delirium. Weight and serum electrolyte levels are obtained for future comparisons.

Measures to control nausea are also important to prevent vomiting, which could further exacerbate fluid and electrolyte imbalances. An antiemetic medication is administered parenterally as prescribed if the patient cannot tolerate fluids or medications by mouth. For mild nausea, the patient is encouraged to take sips of weak tea, carbonated drinks, or tap water. After nausea and

\section*{Food Poisoning}

Use the following questions to elicit information about the circumstances surrounding the possibility of food poisoning:
- How soon after eating did the symptoms occur? (Immediate onset suggests chemical, plant, or animal poisoning.)
- What was eaten in the previous meal? Did the food have an unusual odor or taste? (Most foods causing bacterial poisoning do not have unusual odor or taste.)
- Did anyone else become ill from eating the same food?
- Did vomiting occur? What was the appearance of the vomitus?
- Did diarrhea occur? (Diarrhea is usually absent with botulism and with shellfish or other fish poisoning.)
- Are any neurologic symptoms present? (These occur in botulism and in chemical, plant, and animal poisoning.)
- Does the patient have a fever? (Fever is characteristic in salmonella, ingestion of fava beans, and some fish poisoning.)
- What is the patient's appearance?
vomiting subside, clear liquids are usually prescribed for 12 to 24 hours, and the diet is gradually progressed to a low-residue, bland diet.

\section*{Substance Abuse}

Substance abuse is the misuse of specific substances to alter mood or behavior; drug and alcohol abuse are two examples of substance abuse. Drug abuse is the use of drugs for other than legitimate medical purposes. People who use drugs often take a variety of drugs simultaneously (such as alcohol, barbiturates, opioids, and tranquilizers), and the combination may have additive and addictive effects. IV/injecting drug users are at increased risk for HIV infection, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and hepatitis B and are the most frequent victims of tetanus in the United States.

Clinical manifestations vary with the substance used, but the underlying principles of management are essentially the same. Table 71-1 identifies commonly abused drugs, listing their clinical manifestations and therapeutic management. Treatment goals for a patient suffering from drug overdose are to support the respiratory and cardiovascular functions, to enhance clearance of the agent, and to provide for safety of the patient and staff.

\section*{ACUTE ALCOHOL INTOXICATION}

Alcohol is a psychotropic drug that affects mood, judgment, behavior, concentration, and consciousness. Many heavy drinkers are young adults or people older than 60 years of age. There is a high prevalence of alcoholism among ED patients. Because patients who abuse alcohol return frequently to the ED, they often frustrate and tax the patience of the health care professionals who care for them. Their management requires patience and thoughtful, accurate, long-term treatment.

Alcohol, or ethanol, is a direct multisystem toxin and CNS depressant that causes drowsiness, incoordination, slurring of speech, sudden mood changes, aggression, belligerence, grandiosity, and uninhibited behavior. In excess, it also can cause stupor, coma, and death. In the ED, the patient is assessed for head injury, hypoglycemia (which mimics intoxication), and other health problems. Possible nursing diagnoses include ineffective breathing pattern related to CNS depression and risk for violence (self-directed or directed at others) related to severe intoxication from alcohol.

\section*{Management}

Treatment involves detoxification of the acute poisoning, recovery, and rehabilitation. Commonly, the patient uses mechanisms of denial and defensiveness. The nurse should approach the patient in a nonjudgmental manner, using a firm, consistent, accepting, and reasonable attitude. Speaking in a calm and slow manner is helpful because alcohol interferes with thought processes. If the patient appears intoxicated, hypoxia, hypovolemia, and neurologic impairment must be ruled out before it is assumed that the patient is intoxicated. Typically, a blood specimen is obtained for analysis of the blood alcohol level.

If drowsy, the patient should be allowed to sleep off the state of alcoholic intoxication. During this time, maintenance of a patent airway and observation for symptoms of CNS depression are essential. The patient should be undressed and kept warm with blankets. On the other hand, if the patient is noisy or belligerent, sedation may be necessary. If sedation is used, the patient should
be monitored carefully for hypotension and decreased level of consciousness.

Additionally, the patient is examined for alcohol withdrawal delirium and also for injuries and organic disease, such as head injury, seizures, pulmonary infections, hypoglycemia, and nutritional deficiencies, that may be masked by alcoholic intoxication. People with alcoholism suffer more injuries than the general population. Also, acute alcohol intoxication is the cause of trauma for many nonalcoholic patients. Pulmonary infections are also more common in patients with alcoholism, resulting from respiratory depression, an impaired defense system, and a tendency toward aspiration of gastric contents. The patient may show little increase in temperature or white blood cell count. The patient may be hospitalized or admitted to a detoxification center in an effort to examine problems underlying substance abuse.

\section*{ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME/DELIRIUM TREMENS}

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is an acute toxic state that occurs as a result of sudden cessation of alcohol intake after a bout of heavy drinking or, more usually, after prolonged intake of alcohol. Severity of symptoms depends on how much alcohol was ingested and for how long. Delirium tremens may be precipitated by acute injury or infection (pneumonia, pancreatitis, hepatitis) and is the most severe form of AWS.

Patients with AWS show signs of anxiety, uncontrollable fear, tremor, irritability, agitation, insomnia, and incontinence. They are talkative and preoccupied and experience visual, tactile, olfactory, and auditory hallucinations that often are terrifying. Autonomic overactivity occurs and is evidenced by tachycardia, dilated pupils, and profuse perspiration. Usually, all vital signs are elevated in the alcoholic toxic state. Delirium tremens is a lifethreatening condition and carries a high mortality rate.

\section*{Management}

The goals of management are to give adequate sedation and support to allow the patient to rest and recover without danger of injury or peripheral vascular collapse. A physical examination is performed to identify preexisting or contributing illnesses or injuries (eg, head injury, pneumonia). A drug history is obtained to elicit information that may facilitate adjustment of any sedative requirements. Baseline blood pressure is determined, because the patient's subsequent treatment may depend on blood pressure changes.

Usually, the patient is sedated as directed with a sufficient dosage of benzodiazepines to establish and maintain sedation, which reduces agitation, prevents exhaustion, prevents seizures, and promotes sleep. The patient should be calm, able to respond, and able to maintain an airway safely on his or her own. A variety of medications and combinations of medications are used (for example, chlordiazepoxide [Librium], lorazepam, and clonidine). Haloperidol or droperidol may be administered for severe acute AWS. Dosages are adjusted according to the patient's symptoms (agitation, anxiety) and blood pressure response.

The patient is placed in a calm, nonstressful environment (usually a private room) and observed closely. The room remains lighted to minimize the potential for illusions and hallucinations. Homicidal or suicidal responses may result from hallucinations. Closet and bathroom doors are closed to eliminate shadows. Someone is designated to stay with the patient as much as possible. The presence of another person has a reassuring and calming effect,

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

\section*{THERAPEUTIC MANAGEMENT}
1. Ensure airway and ventilation.
2. Control seizures.
3. Monitor cardiovascular effects; have lidocaine and defibrillator available.
4. Treat for hyperthermia.
5. If cocaine was ingested, use charcoal to treat.
6. Refer for psychiatric evaluation and treatment in an inpatient unit that eliminates access to the drug. Include drug rehabilitation counseling.
1. Support respiratory and cardiovascular functions.
2. Establish an intravenous (IV) line; obtain blood for chemical and toxicologic analysis. Patient may be given bolus of glucose to eliminate possibility of hypoglycemia.
3. Give narcotic antagonist (naloxone hydrochloride [Narcan]) as prescribed to reverse severe respiratory depression and coma.
4. Continue to monitor level of responsiveness and respirations, pulse, and blood pressure. Duration of action of naloxone hydrochloride is shorter than that of heroin; repeated dosages may be necessary.
5. Send urine for analysis; opiates can be detected in urine.
6. Obtain an electrocardiogram.
7. Do not leave patient unattended; he or she may lapse back into coma rapidly. Clinical status may change from minute to minute. Hemodialysis may be indicated for severe drug intoxication.
8. Monitor for pulmonary edema, which is frequently seen in patients who abuse/overdose on narcotics.
9. Refer patient for psychiatric and drug rehabilitation evaluation before discharge.
1. Maintain airway and provide respiratory support.
2. Endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy is considered if there is any doubt about the adequacy of airway exchange.
a. Check airway frequently.
b. Perform suctioning as necessary.
3. Support cardiovascular and respiratory functions; most deaths result from respiratory depression or shock.
4. Start infusion through large-gauge needle or IV catheter to support blood pressure; coma and dehydration result in hypotension and respond to infusion of intravenous fluids with elevation of blood pressure. Sodium bicarbonate may be prescribed to alkalinize urine; it promotes excretion of barbiturates.
5. Evacuate stomach contents or lavage as soon as possible to prevent absorption; repeated doses of activated charcoal may be administered.

Emergency Management
1. Evaluate and maintain patient's airway, breathing, and circulation.
2. Determine by urine or serum drug screen whether the patient has ingested hallucinogenic drug or has a toxic psychosis.
3. Try to communicate with and reassure the patient.
a. "Talking down" involves understanding the process through which the patient is proceeding and helping him overcome his fears while establishing contact with reality.
b. Remind the patient that fear is common with this problem.
c. Reassure the patient that he is not losing his mind but is experiencing the effect of drugs and that this will wear off.
d. Instruct the patient to keep the eyes open; this reduces the intensity of reaction.
e. Reduce sensory stimuli: minimize noise, lights, movement, tactile stimulation.
4. Sedate the patient as prescribed if hyperactivity cannot be controlled; diazepam (Valium) or a barbiturate may be prescribed.

\section*{Table 71-1 - Emergency Management of Drug Abuse Patients and Patients with Drug Overdose (Continued)}

\section*{THERAPEUTIC MANAGEMENT}
5. Search for evidence of trauma; hallucinogen users have a tendency to "act out" their hallucinations.
6. Manage seizures.
7. Observe patient closely; patient's behavior may become hazardous. Have safety officers stationed near the patient's room.
8. Monitor for hypertensive crisis if patient has prolonged psychosis due to drug ingestion.
9. Place patient in a protected environment under proper medical supervision to prevent self-inflicted bodily harm.

\section*{Management for Phencyclidine Abusers}
1. Place patient in a calm, supportive environment to minimize stimuli; protect from selfinjury.
2. Avoid talking down.
3. Do not leave patient unobserved. Treat symptoms as they occur.

2. Assess for hypotension
a. Insert indwelling urinary catheter for comatose patient; decreased urinary volume is an index of reduced renal flow associated with reduced intravascular volume or vascular collapse.
b. Start volume expansion with saline or dextrose as prescribed.
3. Evacuate stomach contents; emesis; lavage; activated charcoal; cathartic.
4. Start ECG monitoring. Observe for dysrhythmias.
5. Administer flumazenil (Romazicon), the benzodiazepine antagonist (reversal agent)
6. Refer patient for psychiatric evaluation (potential suicide intent).
1. Treat respiratory depression.
2. Induce gastric emptying by lavage.
3. Give activated charcoal to adsorb aspirin; a cathartic may be administered with charcoal to help ensure intestinal cleansing.
4. Support patient with IV infusions as prescribed to establish hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances.
5. Enhance elimination of salicylates as directed by forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, peritoneal dialysis, or hemodialysis, according to severity of intoxication.

which helps the patient maintain contact with reality. Any visual misrepresentations (illusions) are explained, to orient the patient to reality.

NURSING ALERT Restraints are used as prescribed, if necessary, if the client is aggressive or violent, but only when other alternatives have been unsuccessful. The least restrictive device that will prevent the patient from injuring self or others is used. Caution is taken to ensure that restraints are applied properly and that they are not impairing circulation to any part of the body or interfering with respirations. Restraints must be released according to protocol. Physical observation (eg, skin integrity, circulatory status, respiratory status) is ongoing, and the patient's response is documented.

Fluid losses may result from gastrointestinal losses (vomiting), profuse perspiration, and respiration (hyperventilation). In addition, the patient may be dehydrated as a result of alcohol's effect of decreasing antidiuretic hormone. The oral or intravenous route is used to restore fluid and electrolyte balance.

Temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure are recorded frequently (every 30 minutes in severe forms of delirium) in anticipation of peripheral circulatory collapse or hyperthermia (the two most lethal complications). Phenytoin (Dilantin) or other antiseizure medications may be prescribed to prevent or control repeated withdrawal seizures.

Frequently seen complications include infections (eg, pneumonia), trauma, hepatic failure, hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular problems. Hypoglycemia may accompany alcohol withdrawal,
because alcohol depletes liver glycogen stores and impairs gluconeogenesis; many patients with alcoholism also are malnourished. Parenteral dextrose may be prescribed if the liver glycogen level is depleted. Orange juice, Gatorade, or other forms of carbohydrates are given to stabilize the blood glucose level and counteract tremulousness. Supplemental vitamin therapy and a high-protein diet are provided as prescribed to counteract vitamin deficiency. The patient should be referred to an alcoholic treatment center for follow-up care and rehabilitation.

\section*{Violence, Abuse, and Neglect}

\section*{FAMILY VIOLENCE, ABUSE, AND NEGLECT}

EDs are often the first place where victims of family violence, abuse, or neglect go to seek help. Each year in the United States 3 to 4 million women experience domestic violence, and up to one third of all women will be in a domestic violence situation in their lifetime. One million women are severely beaten each year. Approximately 2 to 3 million children are seriously abused, an additional 5 million children are maltreated, and 1 to 2 million elders are abused or neglected (Guth, Pachter, 2000). Among women who are pregnant, $4 \%$ to $14 \%$ will suffer physical violence from their intimate partner, with $10 \%$ to $24 \%$ of this population having been abused during the year before they became pregnant. These statistics are startlingly higher for teenagers, of whom $20 \%$ are assaulted while pregnant. The severity of the abuse increases and is associated with battering during pregnancy. Domestic violence is the leading cause of death for young African American women (Campbell, 1999; Harrell et al., 2002). On the average, between $6 \%$ and $28 \%$ of women seen in the ED have suffered abuse, with up to $6 \%$ of these patients seeking treatment for a complaint related to a recent event. Between $20 \%$ and $35 \%$ of all ED visits relate to continuous abuse. Young women are most likely to suffer nonlethal violent acts that result in visits to the ED (Moskowitz, Griffith, DiScala, \& Sege, 2001). ED nurses must be aware that men and persons with disabilities are also victims of domestic violence and should include questions to that effect in their evaluations. Elder abuse takes many forms, including physical and psychological abuse, neglect, violation of personal rights, and financial abuse.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

When victims of abuse seek treatment, they may present with physical injuries or with health problems, such as anxiety, insomnia, or gastrointestinal symptoms, that are related to stress. They usually do not identify their abuser.

The possibility of abuse should be investigated whenever a person presents with multiple injuries that are in various stages of healing, when injuries are unexplained, and when the explanation does not fit the physical picture (Chart 71-13). The possibility of neglect should be investigated whenever a dependent person with adequate resources and a designated care provider shows evidence of inattention to hygiene, to nutrition, or to known medical needs (eg, unfilled medication prescriptions, missed appointments with health care providers). In the ED, the most common physical injuries seen are unexplained bruises, lacerations, abrasions, head injuries, or fractures. The most common clinical manifestations of neglect are malnutrition and dehydration.

\section*{Abuse, Maltreatment, and Neglect}

The following questions may be helpful when assessing a patient for abuse, maltreatment, and neglect:
- I noticed that you have a number of bruises. Can you tell me how they happened? Has anyone hurt you?
- You seem frightened. Has anyone ever hurt you?
- Sometimes patients tell me that they have been hurt by someone at home or at work. Could this be happening to you?
- Are you afraid of anyone at home or work? Or of anyone with whom you come in contact?
- Has anyone failed to help you to take care of yourself when you needed help?
- Has anyone prevented you from seeing friends or other people whom you wish to see?
- Have you signed any papers that you did not understand or did not wish to sign?
- Has anyone forced you to sign papers against your will?

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Nurses in EDs are in an ideal position to provide early detection and interventions for victims of domestic violence. This requires an acute awareness of the signs of possible abuse, maltreatment, and neglect. Nurses must be skilled in interviewing techniques that are likely to elicit accurate information. A careful history is crucial in the screening process. Asking questions in privateaway from others-may be helpful in eliciting information about abuse, maltreatment, and neglect.

Whenever evidence leads one to suspect abuse or neglect, an evaluation with careful documentation of descriptions of events and drawings or photos of injuries is important, because the medical record may be used as part of a legal document. Assessment of the patient's general appearance and interactions with significant others, an examination of the entire surface area of the body, and a mental status examination are crucial.

\section*{Management}

Whenever abuse, maltreatment, or neglect is suspected, the health care worker's primary concern should be the safety and welfare of the patient. Treatment focuses on the consequences of the abuse, violence, or neglect and on prevention of further injury. Protocols of most EDs require that a multidisciplinary approach be used. Nurses, physicians, social workers, and community agencies work collaboratively to develop and implement a plan for meeting the patient's needs.

If in immediate danger, the patient should be separated from the abusing or neglecting person whenever possible. On the basis of this danger, or on the basis of injuries or neglected medical conditions, hospitalization is justified until alternative plans are made. However, it must be remembered that third-party payers may not approve hospitalization that is based solely on abuse or neglect.

When abuse or neglect is considered to be the result of stress experienced by a caregiver who is no longer able to cope with the burden of caring for an elderly person or a person with chronic disease or a disability, respite services may be necessary. Support groups may be helpful to these caregivers. When mental illness of the abuser or neglecter is responsible for the situation, alternative living arrangements may be required.

Nurses must be mindful that competent adults are free to accept or refuse the help that is offered to them. Some patients will insist on remaining in the home environment where the abuse or neglect is occurring. The wishes of patients who are competent and not cognitively impaired should be respected. However, all possible alternatives and available resources should be explored with the patient.

Mandatory reporting laws in most states require health care workers to report suspected abuse to an official agency, usually Adult (or Child) Protective Services. All that is required for reporting is the suspicion of abuse. The health care worker is not required to prove anything. Likewise, health care workers who report suspected abuse are immune to civil or criminal liability if the report is made in good faith. Subsequent home visits resulting from the report of suspected abuse are a part of gathering information about the patient in the home environment. In addition, many states have resource hotlines for use by health care workers and by patients who seek answers to questions about abuse and neglect.

\section*{SEXUAL ASSAULT}

The definition of rape is forced sexual acts, especially vaginal or anal penetration. Perpetrators and victims may be either male or female. The feminist movement has focused on the rights and care of rape victims, and law enforcement agencies are becoming increasingly sensitive and aggressive in managing these crimes. Rape crisis centers offer support, educate victims, and help them through the subsequent courtroom experience.

The manner in which the patient is received and treated in the ED is important to his or her future psychological well-being. Crisis intervention should begin when the patient enters the health care facility. The patient should be seen immediately. Most hospitals have a written protocol that reflects consideration for the victim's physical and emotional needs as well as forensic evidence collection that is required.

\section*{The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner}

In many states, there is the opportunity for emergency nurses to become trained sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs). The role allows for specific training in forensic evidence collection, history taking, documentation, and ways to approach the patient and family. Specialized training also includes proper photography and the use of colposcopy. Colposcopy increases assessment by examination for microtrauma through magnification. Evidence is collected through photography, videography, and analysis of specimens. Another tool useful to SANEs is the light-staining microscope, which enables the examiner to identify motile and nonmotile sperm and infection. This tool saves time and also enhances assessment. SANEs complement the ED staff and can spend more time with both the patient and police officers investigating the incident.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient's reaction to rape has been termed rape trauma syndrome and is seen as an acute stress reaction to a life-threatening situation. The nurse performing the assessment is aware that the patient may go through several phases of psychological reactions (Dole, 1996; Ritchie, 1998):

\footnotetext{
- An acute disorganization phase, which may manifest as an expressed state in which shock, disbelief, fear, guilt, humilia-
}
tion, anger, and other such emotions are encountered or as a controlled state in which feelings are masked or hidden and the victim appears composed
- A phase of denial and unwillingness to talk about the incident, followed by a phase of heightened anxiety, fear, flashbacks, sleep disturbances, hyperalertness, and psychosomatic reactions
- A phase of reorganization, in which the incident is put into perspective. Some victims never fully recover and go on to develop chronic stress disorders and phobias.

\section*{Management}

The goals of management are to give sympathetic support, to reduce the emotional trauma of the patient, and to gather available evidence for possible legal proceedings. All of the interventions have the ultimate goal of having the patient regain control over his or her life.

Throughout the patient's stay in the ED, the patient's privacy and sensitivity must be respected. The patient may exhibit a wide range of emotional reactions, such as hysteria, stoicism, or feelings of being overwhelmed. Support and caring are crucial. The patient should be reassured that anxiety is natural and asked whether a support person may be called. Appropriate support is available from professional and community resources. The Rape Victim Companion Program, if available in the community, can be contacted, and services of a volunteer can be requested. The patient should never be left alone.

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

A written, witnessed informed consent must be obtained from the patient (or parent or guardian if the patient is a minor) for examination, for taking of photographs, and for release of findings to police. A history is obtained only if the patient has not already talked to a police officer, social worker, or crisis intervention worker. The patient should not be asked to repeat the history. Any history of the event that is obtained should be recorded in the patient's own words. The patient is asked whether he or she has bathed, douched, brushed teeth, changed clothes, urinated, or defecated since the attack, because these actions may alter interpretation of subsequent findings. The time of admission, time of examination, date and time of the alleged rape, and the patient's emotional state and general appearance (including any evidence of trauma, such as discoloration, bruises, lacerations, secretions, or torn and bloody clothing) are documented.

For the physical examination, the patient is helped to undress and is draped properly. Each item of clothing is placed in a separate paper bag. Plastic bags are not used because they retain moisture; moisture may promote mold and mildew formation, which can destroy evidence. The bags are labeled and given to appropriate law enforcement authorities.

The patient is examined (from head to toe) for injuries, especially injuries to the head, neck, breast, thighs, back, and buttocks. Body diagrams and photographs aid in documenting the evidence of trauma. The physical examination focuses on the following:
- External evidence of trauma (bruises, contusions, lacerations, stab wounds)
- Dried semen stains (appearing as crusted, flaking areas) on the patient's body or clothes
- Broken fingernails and body tissue and foreign materials under nails (if found, samples are taken)
- Oral examination, including a specimen of saliva and prescribed cultures of gum and tooth areas

Pelvic and rectal examinations are also performed. The perineum and other areas are examined with a Wood lamp or other filtered ultraviolet light. Areas that appear fluorescent may indicate semen stains. The color and consistency of any discharge present is noted. A water-moistened rather than a lubricated vaginal speculum is used for the examination. Lubricant contains chemicals that may interfere with later forensic testing of specimens and acid phosphatase determinations. The rectum is examined for signs of trauma, blood, and semen. During the examination, the patient should be advised of the nature and necessity of each procedure and given the rationale for each question asked.

\section*{SPECIMEN COLLECTION}

During the physical examination, numerous laboratory specimens may be collected, including the following:
- Vaginal aspirate, examined for presence or absence of motile and nonmotile sperm
- Secretions (obtained with a sterile swab) from the vaginal pool for acid phosphatase, blood group antigen of semen, and precipitin test against human sperm and blood
- Separate smears from the oral, vaginal, and anal areas
- Culture of body orifices for gonorrhea
- Blood serum for syphilis and HIV testing; a sample of serum for syphilis may be frozen and saved for future testing
- Pregnancy test if there is a possibility that the patient may be pregnant
- Any foreign material (leaves, grass, dirt), which is placed in a clean envelope
- Pubic hair samples obtained by combing or trimming. Several pubic hairs with follicles are placed in separate containers and identified as the patient's hairs.

To preserve the chain of evidence, each specimen is labeled with the name of the patient, the date and time of collection, the body area from which the specimen was obtained, and the names of personnel collecting specimens. Then the specimens are given to a designated person (eg, crime laboratory technician), and an itemized receipt is obtained.

\section*{TREATING POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF RAPE}

After the initial physical examination is completed and specimens have been obtained, any associated injuries are treated as indicated. The patient is given the option of prophylaxis against sexually transmitted disease. Ceftriaxone (Rocephin), administered intramuscularly with $1 \%$ lidocaine (Xylocaine), may be prescribed as prophylaxis for gonorrhea. Doxycycline (Vibramycin) taken for 10 days may be prescribed as prophylaxis for syphilis and chlamydia.

Antipregnancy measures may be considered if the patient is of childbearing age, is not using contraceptives, and is at high risk in her menstrual cycle. A postcoital contraceptive medication, such as Ovral, which contains estrogen ethinyl estradiol and progestin norgestrel, may be prescribed after a pregnancy test. To promote effectiveness, Ovral should be administered within 12 to 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after intercourse. The 21-day package rather than the 28-day package is prescribed, so that the patient does not take the inert tablets by mistake. An antiemetic may be administered as prescribed to decrease discomfort from
side effects. A cleansing douche, mouthwash, and fresh clothing are usually offered.

\section*{FOLLOW-UP CARE}

The patient is informed of counseling services to prevent longterm psychological effects. Counseling services should be made available to both the patient and the family. A referral is made to the Rape Victim Companion Program, if available. Appointments for follow-up surveillance for pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, and HIV testing also are made.

The patient is encouraged to return to his or her previous level of functioning as soon as possible. When leaving the health care facility, the patient should be accompanied by a family member or friend.

\section*{VIOLENCE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT}

Not only do ED staff members encounter patients who are violent from substance abuse, injury, or other emergencies, but they may also encounter violent situations in the rest of the environment. Patients and families waiting for assistance are increasingly volatile. Often, waiting rooms are the site for dissatisfaction, fear, and anger to be acted out in violence. Some EDs assign security officers to the area and have installed metal detectors to identify weapons and protect patients, families, and staff. It is not unusual for a patient to come to the ED armed. Nurses and other personnel must be prepared to deal with such circumstances.

\section*{Management}

Safety is the first priority. Protecting the ED on a daily basis will prevent any untoward events from occurring. Protection of the department provides protection for the patients, families, and staff. It is essential that all nurses be aware of the environment in which they are working.

Metal detectors, silent alarm systems, and secured entry into the department assist in maintaining safety. Members of gangs and feuding families need to be separated in the ED, in the waiting room, and later in the inpatient nursing unit to avoid angry confrontations. Security officers should be ready to assist at all times. The department should be able to be locked against entry if security is at all in question.

Patients from prison and those who are under guard need to be shackled to the bed with appropriate assessment. The same assessment and care that are provided to patients with hand or ankle restraints are provided to patients with handcuffs. In addition, the following precautions are taken:
- Never release the hand or ankle restraint (handcuff).
- Always have a guard present in the room.
- Place the patient face down on the stretcher to avoid injury from head-butting, spitting, or biting.
- Use restraints on any violent patient as needed.
- Administer medication if necessary to control violent behavior until definitive treatment can be obtained.

In the case of gunfire in the ED, self-protection is a priority. There is no advantage to protecting others if the caregivers are also injured. Security officers and police must gain control of the situation first; then care is provided to the injured.

\section*{Psychiatric Emergencies}

A psychiatric emergency is an urgent, serious disturbance of behavior, affect, or thought that makes the patient unable to cope with life situations and interpersonal relationships. A patient presenting with a psychiatric emergency may display overactive or violent, underactive or depressed, or suicidal behaviors.

The most important concern of the ED personnel is determining whether the patient is at risk for injuring self or others. The aim is to try to maintain the patient's self-esteem (and life, if necessary) while providing care. Determining whether the patient is currently under psychiatric treatment is important so that contact can be made with the therapist or physician who works with the patient.

\section*{OVERACTIVE PATIENTS}

Patients who display disturbed, uncooperative, and paranoid behavior and those who feel anxious and panicky may be prone to assaultive and destructive impulses and abnormal social behavior. Intense nervousness, depression, and crying are evident in some patients. Disturbed and noisy behavior may be exacerbated or compounded by alcohol or drug intoxication.

\section*{Management}

A reliable source is needed to identify events leading to the crisis, and a history is obtained. Past mental illness, hospitalizations, injuries, serious illnesses, use of alcohol or drugs, crises in interpersonal relationships, or intrapsychic conflicts are explored. Because abnormal thoughts and behavior may be manifestations of an underlying physical disorder, such as hypoglycemia, stroke, epilepsy, head injury, or drug or alcohol toxicity, a physical assessment is performed when possible.

The immediate goal is to gain control of the situation. If the patient is potentially violent, security or local police should be nearby. Restraints are used as a last resort and as prescribed. Approaching the patient with a calm, confident, and firm manner is therapeutic and has a calming effect. Helpful interventions include the following:
- Introduce yourself by name.
- Tell the patient, "I am here to help you."
- Repeat the patient's name from time to time.
- Speak in one-thought sentences and be consistent.
- Give the patient space and time to slow down.
- Show interest in, listen to, and encourage the patient to talk about personal thoughts and feelings.
- Offer appropriate and honest explanations.

A psychotropic agent (ie, one that exerts an effect on the mind) may be prescribed for emergency management of functional psychosis. However, personality disorders cannot and should not be treated with psychotropic medications; nor are psychotropic medications used if the patient's behavior results from use of hallucinogens (eg, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]).

Agents such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and haloperidol (Haldol) act specifically against psychotic symptoms of thought fragmentation and perceptual and behavioral aberrations. The initial dosage depends on the patient's body weight and the severity of the symptoms. After administration of the initial dose, the patient is observed closely to determine the degree of change in psychotic behavior. Subsequent dosages depend on the patient's response.

Typically, after stabilization, the patient is transferred to a psychiatric unit or psychiatric outpatient treatment is arranged.

\section*{VIOLENT BEHAVIOR}

Violent and aggressive behavior, usually episodic, is a means of expressing feelings of anger, fear, or hopelessness about a situation. Usually, the patient has a history of outbursts of rage, temper tantrums, or impulsive behavior. People with a tendency for violence frequently lose control when intoxicated with alcohol or drugs. Family members are the most frequent victims of their aggression (see earlier discussion). Patients with a propensity for violence include those intoxicated by drugs or alcohol; those going through drug or alcohol withdrawal; and those diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenic state, acute organic brain syndrome, acute psychosis, paranoid character, borderline personality, or antisocial personality disorders.

\section*{Management}

The goal of treatment is to bring the violence under control. A specially designated room with at least two exits should be used for the interview. The door of the room should be kept open, and the nurse should remain in clear view of the staff, staying between the patient and the door. However, the patient's exit to the door must not be blocked, because the patient may feel trapped and threatened. No objects that could be used as weapons should be in sight, in the room, or carried in with health care personnel. If the interviewer feels anxious or uneasy about the patient's response, security staff, a family member, or another health care worker should be asked to remain in the hall nearby in the event that additional help is needed. The patient should never be left alone, because this may be interpreted as rejection or provide an opportunity for self-harm.

To bring the violence under control, it is crucial to use a calm, noncritical approach while remaining in control of the situation. Sudden movements are avoided. External calm and structure in conjunction with providing the patient some space may help the patient gain control. If the patient is carrying a weapon, the emergency health care provider should ask that it be surrendered. If the patient is unwilling to surrender the weapon, the security staff is called. If necessary, the security staff may seek further assistance from the local police department.

The patient's violent behavior is a crisis situation for the patient and the ED. Crisis intervention, achieved by talking and listening to the patient, is best accomplished by expressing an interest in the patient's well-being while attempting to tune in to the patient and remain firm. The patient's agitated state is acknowledged by statements such as, "I want to work with you to relieve your distress."

The patient is allowed the opportunity to ventilate anger verbally. If the patient is delusional, challenging the patient is avoided. Trying to hear what the patient is saying, conveying an expectation of appropriate behavior, and making the patient aware that help is available are key. The patient should be informed that violent behavior may be frightening others and that violence is not acceptable. Help that is available in crisis situations (from a clinic, ED, or mental health facility) should be described and offered. Often, the offer of protection by hospitalization is welcomed by the patient, who fears losing control or harming self or others. If the patient does not calm down, security personnel or police intervention may be necessary.

If these measures fail to alleviate the patient's tension, medication may be prescribed (rapid sedation with haloperidol, diazepam,
or chlorpromazine) to reduce tension, anxiety, and hyperactivity. Restraints must be prescribed by a physician. They are applied with a minimum of force and only when necessary and when other alternatives have been unsuccessful.

> NURSING ALERT The least restrictive device to prevent the patient from injuring self or others is used. Caution is taken to ensure that restraints are applied properly. Restraints should be used with verbal intervention to calm the patient and promote compliance. Appropriate personnel must be available when applying restraints (in such a way that they do not impair circulation to any part of the body or interfere with breathing). Physical observation (eg, skin integrity, circulatory status, respiratory status) is ongoing, and the patient's response is documented.

After combativeness, agitation, and fear have decreased, the patient is referred for further mental health treatment.

\section*{POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER}

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of characteristic symptoms after a psychologically stressful event that is considered outside the range of normal human experience (eg, rape, combat, motor vehicle crash, natural catastrophe, terrorist attack). Symptoms of this disorder include intrusive thoughts and dreams, phobic avoidance reaction (avoidance of activities that arouse recollection of the traumatic event), heightened vigilance, exaggerated startle reaction, generalized anxiety, and societal withdrawal. PTSD may be acute, chronic, or delayed.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment includes an evaluation of the patient's pretrauma history, the trauma itself, and posttrauma functioning. PTSD often presents as multiple readmissions to the ED for minor or recurring complaints without evidence of injury. The patient is allowed to discuss the traumatic event and permitted to grieve.

\section*{Management}

The patient's goal is to organize and begin to integrate the experience so that he or she can return to the pretrauma level of functioning as soon as possible. Emergency management focuses on the patient's presenting behaviors. A wide range of interventions are carried out, including crisis intervention strategies, establishing a trusting and sharing relationship, and educating the patient and family about stress management and support services available in the community. Psychiatric support may be useful to the patient.

\section*{UNDERACTIVE OR DEPRESSED PATIENTS}

In the ED , depression may be seen as the primary condition bringing the patient to the health care facility, or it may be masked by anxiety and somatic complaints. The depressed person has a mood disturbance.

Clinical manifestations may include sadness, apathy, feelings of worthlessness, self-blame, suicidal thoughts, desire to escape, avoidance of simple problems, anorexia and weight loss, decreased interest in sex, sleeplessness, and ceaseless activity or reduction in activity. The agitated depressed individual may exhibit motor restlessness and severe anxiety.

\section*{Management}

The depressed patient benefits from ventilating personal feelings and should be provided an opportunity to talk about personal problems while emergency health care personnel listen in a calm, unhurried manner. Information about a perceived or real illness or a sudden worsening of depression is an important clue. Any patient who is depressed may be at risk for suicide.

Attempts are made to find out whether the patient has thought about or attempted suicide. Questions such as, "Have you ever thought about taking your own life?" may be helpful. Generally, the patient is relieved to have an opportunity to discuss personal feelings. If the patient is seriously depressed, relatives should be notified. The patient should never be left alone, because suicide is usually committed in solitude.

The patient needs to understand that depression is treatable. Antidepressant and antianxiety agents may be prescribed. Crisis and supportive services in the community, including mental health centers, telephone counseling and referral, suicide prevention centers, group therapy, and marital and family counseling, should be offered to the patient and family. Usually, the patient is referred for psychiatric consultation or to a psychiatric facility.

\section*{SUICIDAL PATIENTS}

Attempted suicide is an act that stems from depression (eg, loss of a loved one, loss of body integrity or status, poor self-image) and can be viewed as a cry for help and intervention. Males are at greater risk than females. Others at risk are elderly people; young adults; people who are enduring unusual loss or stress; those who are unemployed, divorced, widowed, or living alone; those showing signs of significant depression (eg, weight loss, sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, suicidal preoccupation); and those with a history of a previous suicide attempt, suicide in the family, or psychiatric illness.

Being aware of people at risk and assessing for specific factors that predispose a person to suicide are key management strategies. Specific signs and symptoms of potential suicide include the following:
- Communication of suicidal intent, such as preoccupation with death or talking of someone else's suicide (eg, "I'm tired of living. I've put my affairs in order. I'm better off dead. I'm a burden to my family")
- History of a previous suicide attempt (the risk is much greater in these cases)
- Family history of suicide
- Loss of a parent at an early age
- Specific plan for suicide
- A means to carry out the plan

\section*{Management}

Emergency management focuses on treating the consequences of the suicide attempt (eg, gunshot wound, drug overdose) and preventing further self-injury. A patient who has made a suicidal gesture may do so again. Crisis intervention is employed to determine suicidal potential, to discover areas of depression and conflict, to find out about the patient's support system, and to determine whether hospitalization or psychiatric referral is necessary. Depending on the patient's potential for suicide, the patient may be admitted to the intensive care unit, referred for follow-up care, or admitted to the psychiatric unit.

\section*{2 Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A young woman arrives at the ED by ambulance after a car crash. She is immobilized on a backboard with a cervical collar. An oxygen mask is in place. You note shallow, slow respirations and no movement of the left chest wall. She complains of pain in her abdomen, and it is tense. Her left leg is angulated. How would you prioritize the patient's needs? Develop an assessment strategy, identify diagnostic studies that will benefit the patient, and describe the patient's treatment needs.
2. A man who was out ice fishing all day, wearing sneakers instead of his boots, comes to the ED for treatment of frostbite of his feet. His friends have been massaging his feet en route to the ED. The patient insists that his feet be placed in a pan of hot water. Describe how you would respond and the explanation you would give to this patient. How would you proceed with managing this patient's care? Describe the treatment dilemmas for this type of injury.
3. A young woman with a toddler in her arms waits her turn in line at the triage desk of the ED. The child is crying and rubbing her eyes and face. You overhear the mother telling another patient that the child has had an allergic reaction to her first soft-cooked egg, which the child smeared on her face. While waiting, the child becomes quiet and pale in color. Analyze this information. What is your immediate response? What action would you take and what is the rationale for your decision?
4. An elderly patient is brought to the ED by her son. She is complaining of pain in her hip, and the son says that she tripped over her oxygen tubing and fell. On initial assessment you notice that the patient has many bruises on her body in varying stages of resolution. What conclusions might you draw from these findings, and how might you proceed to evaluate the situation to determine your course of action?

\section*{Terrorism, Mass Casualty, and Disaster Nursing}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{on completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Identify the necessary components of an emergency operations plan.
2. Discuss how triage in a disaster differs from triage in an emergency.
3. Develop a plan of care for a patient experiencing short- or long-term psychological effects after a disaster.
4. Evaluate the different levels of personal protection and decontamination procedures that may be necessary during an event involving mass casualties or weapons of mass destruction.
5. Describe isolation precautions necessary for bioterrorism agents.
6. Identify the differences among the various chemical agents used in terrorist events, their effects, and the decontamination and treatment procedures that are necessary.
7. Determine the injuries associated with varying levels of radiation or chemical exposure and the associated decontamination processes.

$T_{h}$he possibility and reality of mass casualties associated with disasters, terrorism, and biological warfare are not new to human history; nor is the concept of using weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). In fact, the use of WMDs dates as far back as the 6 th century BC for biological weapons and the year 436 BC for chemical weapons (U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease, 1996; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense, 1999). However, geopolitical forces and interests, the "shrinking globe," and the availability of destructive technology have brought the possibility of more terrorist events to our doorsteps. Examples include the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah building; the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City; the total destruction of the World Trade Center towers and the damage to the Pentagon on September 11, 2001; and the anthrax exposures that same year. Terrorism has become increasingly sophisticated, organized, and therefore effective. In is no longer a question of whether it will happen, but when it will happen again.

In 1999, a government agency called the National Domestic Preparedness Organization was developed to coordinate preparedness in the event of a terrorist attack (Kotzmann, 1999). The Department of Homeland Security was created after the September 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate federal and state efforts to combat terrorist activity. In 2001 and 2002, all acute care facilities across the nation were asked to present detailed plans to their health departments on how they would handle situations involving WMDs.

As distressing as terrorism and warfare are, they are just two of the manmade reasons that health care providers need to plan for mass casualties. Airplane crashes, train crashes, and toxic substance spillages are other manmade disasters that can result in casualties and tax the resources of health care facilities and their communities. In addition to manmade disasters, natural phenomena such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, and earthquakes kill and injure hundreds of thousands of people worldwide each year. The acute care facility must be prepared for any and all of these disasters. This chapter focuses on disaster preparedness, especially providing information about possible terrorist-sponsored injuries and illnesses that can occur after biological, chemical, and nuclear or radiation attacks. Information about the process of responding to these emergencies is applicable to other types of mass disasters as well.

\section*{EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS}

\section*{Federal, State, and Local Responses}

There are many resources available at the federal, state and local levels to assist in the management of disasters and emergencies. Disasters are often assigned levels, which indicate the anticipated
level of response (Chart 72-1). A list of the local resources with specific instructions about how and when to contact them should be readily available and frequently reviewed for needed updates. The following are a few of the resources that may be of assistance during a mass casualty incident (MCI) or a disaster.

\section*{FEDERAL AGENCIES}

There are many federal resources that can be accessed through a process of requests. The state authorities must request the federalization of resources through the proper channels. This request for federal resources generally is made when local resources have become or are in the process of becoming depleted.

Federal resources include organizations such as Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Each of these federal departments oversees hundreds of agencies that may respond to MCIs. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) (under the DOJ) may be used for scene control and collection of forensic evidence. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can activate teams such as the Urban Search and Rescue Teams (USRTs). The DHSS administers the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS). The NDMS has many medical support teams, such as Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs), Disaster Mortuary Response Teams (DMORTs), Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams (VMATs), and National Medical Response Teams for Weapons of Mass Destruction (NMRTs).

The DMAT provides medical personnel who can set up and staff a field hospital; there are many DMATs located across the country. There are only four NMRTs: the mobile California, North Carolina, and Colorado teams and the Washington, DC team, which is stationary. These specialty teams were developed to respond to situations involving WMDs. They consist of specially trained medical and technical personnel. The National Guard is also a resource, with some guard units functioning as Civil Strike Teams (CSTs).

Also included in federal resources are the teams from the CDC. This is the lead federal agency for disease prevention and control activities and provides backup support to state and local health departments. An additional support is available from the American Red Cross, which provides many support systems and shelter as needed.

\section*{STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES}

Some of the state and local agencies may be the same agencies already listed (eg, local CDC and FBI agencies). Other state and local resources may include the American Red Cross, poison
biological warfare: use of a biological agent, such as anthrax, as a WMD
chemical warfare: use of a chemical agent, such as chlorine, as a WMD
decontamination: process of removing, or rendering harmless, contaminants that have accumulated on personnel, patients, and equipment
mass casualty incident (MCI): situation in which the number of casualties exceeds the number of resources
material safety data sheet (MSDS): provides chemical information to employees and health care providers regarding specific agents; includes chemical name, physical data, chemical ingredients, fire and explosive hazard data, health and reactive data, spill or leak procedures, special protection information, and special precautions. Established under the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, also known as the Worker's Right to Know.
nuclear warfare: use of nuclear contamination as a WMD
Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA): federal agency established for worker safety and protection
personal protective equipment (PPE): equipment beyond standard precautions; may include level $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}$, and D equipment.

control centers, and other local volunteer organizations. The Metro Medical Response Teams Systems (MMRS) are local teams that are located in cities deemed to be possible terrorist targets and are funded for specialty response to WMDs. Many state and federal task forces have been developed to assist in the development and improvement of civilian medical response to chemical and biological terrorism.

Most cities and all states have an Office of Emergency Management (OEM). The OEM coordinates the disaster relief efforts at the state and local levels. The OEM is responsible for providing interagency coordination during an emergency. It maintains a corps of emergency management personnel, including responders, planners, and administrative and support staff.

\section*{THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM}

The Incident Command System (ICS) is a management tool for organizing personnel, facilities, equipment, and communication for any emergency situation. The federal government mandates that the ICS be used during emergencies. Under this structure, one person is designated as incident commander. This person must be continuously informed of all activities and informed about any deviation from the established plan (Currance \& Bronstein, 1999; Lewis \& Aghababian, 1996; Londorf, 1995). Whereas the ICS is primarily a field structure and process, aspects of it are used at the level of an individual hospital's emergency response plan as well.

\section*{Hospital Emergency Preparedness Plans}

Every facility is required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) to create a plan for emergency preparedness and to practice this plan twice a year (Burgess, Kirk, Burron, \& Cisek, 1999; JCAHO, 2000). Generally these plans are developed under the Environment of Care Committee or Safety Committee and are overseen by an administrative liaison.

Before the basic emergency operations plan (EOP) can be developed, the planning committee of the facility first evaluates the community to anticipate the types of natural and manmade disasters that might occur. This is not a difficult task and should be a responsibility of the local facility, safety committee, safety officer, or emergency department (ED) manager. This information can be gathered by questioning local law enforcement and fire departments and assessing the amount of air or train traffic, automobile traffic, and flood, earthquake, tornado, or hurricane activity. Consideration is given to special situations such as proximity to chemical plants, nuclear facilities, or military bases that may enhance the community's potential for manmade disasters. Federal, judicial, or financial buildings, schools, and any places where large groups of people gather can be considered high-risk areas.

The planning committee must have a realistic understanding of its resources. It must determine, for example, whether the facility has a pharmaceutical stockpile available to treat specific chemical or biological agents (Anteau, 1997; Stopford, 2000). Another scenario that might be anticipated, the dispersal of a pulmonary intoxicant or choking agent, requires that emergency operations planners find out how many ventilators would be available in the facility and in the community. The committee might also outline how staff would triage and assign priority to patients when the number of ventilators is limited. Multiple factors influence a facility's ability to respond effectively to a sudden influx of injured patients, and the committee must anticipate various scenarios to improve its preparedness.

\section*{COMPONENTS OF EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN}

Once the initial assessment is complete, the facility develops the EOP. Essential components of the plan are as follows:
- An activation response: The EOP activation response of a health care facility should define where, how, and when the response is initiated.
- An internallexternal communication plan: Communication is critical for all parties involved, including communication to and from the prehospital arena (Heightman, 1999; Lewis \& Aghababian, 1996; Mickelson, Burno, \& Schario, 1999).
- A plan for coordinated patient care: A response is planned for coordinated patient care into and out of the facility, including transfers to other facilities. The site of the disaster can determine where the greater number of patients may self-refer.
- Security plans: A coordinated security plan involving facility and community agencies is key to the control of an otherwise chaotic situation.
- Identification of external resources: External resources are identified, including local, state, and federal resources and information about how to activate these resources.
- A plan for people management and traffic flow: "People management" includes strategies to manage the patients, the public, the media, and personnel. Specific areas are assigned, and a designated person is delegated to manage each of these areas (Anteau, 1997; Lewis \& Aghababian, 1996).
- A data management strategy: A data management plan for every aspect of the disaster will save time at every step. A backup system for charting, tracking, and staffing is developed if the facility has a computer system.
- Deactivation response: Deactivation of the response is as important as activation; resources should not be overused. The person who decides when the facility is able to go from the disaster response back to daily activities is clearly identified. Any possible residual effects of a disaster must be considered before this decision is made (Anteau, 1997).
- A post-incident response: Often facilities see increased volumes of patients up to 3 months after an incident. Post-incident response must include a critique and a debriefing for all parties involved, immediately and again at a later date.
- A plan for practice drills: Practice drills that include community participation allow for troubleshooting any issues before a real-life incident occurs.
- Anticipated resources: Food and water must be available for staff, families, and others who may be at the facility for an extended period.
- Mass casualty incident planning: MCI planning includes such issues as mass fatality and morgue readiness.
- An educational plan for all of the above: A strong educational plan for all personnel regarding each step of the plan allows for improved readiness and additional input for fine-tuning of the EOP (Howard, 2001; Kotzmann, 1999; Anteau, 1997; Burgess et al., 1999; Lewis \& Aghababian, 1996; Heightman, 2000; Levitin \& Siegelson, 1996).
The EOP should also include a structure that defines roles for all employees in each emergency situation. The most common structure is the ICS described earlier, but applied at the level of the hospital itself instead of at the site of the disaster. For example, an administrator, possibly the nurse executive, will act as Incident Commander within the hospital and coordinate all aspects of the implementation of the plan. Other personnel will be designated to perform key roles, such as resource manager or patient disposition coordinator. Such a predetermined organization is essential to minimize confusion, ensure that all key operations are directed, and promote a well-coordinated response.

\section*{INITIATING THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN}

Notification of a disaster situation to a facility varies with each situation. Generally, the notification to the facility comes from outside sources unless the initial incident occurred at the facility. The disaster activation plan should clearly state how the EOP is to be initiated. If communication is functioning, field incident command will give notice of the approximate number of arriving patients, although the number of self-referring patients will not be known.

\section*{Identifying Patients and Documenting Patient Information}

Patient tracking is a critical component of casualty management. Disaster tags, which are numbered and include triage priority, name, address, age, location and description of injuries, and treatments or medications given, are used to communicate patient information. The tag should be securely placed on the patient and remain with the patient at all times. The tag number and the patient's name are recorded in a disaster log. The log is used by the command center to track patients, assign beds, and provide families with information.

\section*{Triage of Disaster Victims}

Triage is the sorting of casualties to determine priority of health care needs and the proper site for treatment. In nondisaster situations, health care workers assign a high priority and allocate the most resources to those who are the most critically ill. For example, a young man who has a chest injury and is in full cardiac arrest would receive advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including medications, chest tubes, intravenous fluids, blood, possibly even emergency surgery in an effort to restore life. In a disaster, however, when health care providers are faced with a large number of casualties, the fundamental principle guiding resource allocation is to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Decisions are based on the likelihood of survival and consumption of available resources. Therefore, this same patient, and others with conditions associated with a high mortality rate, would be assigned a low triage priority in a disaster situation, even if the person is conscious. Although this may sound uncaring, from an ethical standpoint the expenditure of limited resources
on individuals with a low chance of survival, and denial of those resources to others with serious but treatable conditions, cannot be justified.

The triage officer rapidly assesses those injured at the disaster scene. Victims are immediately tagged and transported or given life-saving interventions. One person performs the initial triage while other emergency services personnel perform life-saving measures (eg, intubation) and transport patients. Although emergency medical services personnel carry out initial field triage, secondary and continuous triage at all subsequent levels of care is essential.

Staff should control all entrances to the acute care facility so that incoming patients are directed to the triage area first. The triage area may be outside the entry or just at the door of the ED. This allows all patients, including those arriving by medical transport and those who walk in, to be triaged. Some patients already seen in the field will be reclassified in the triage area, based on their current presentation.

\section*{TRIAGE CATEGORIES}

Triage categories separate patients according to severity of injury and use a color-coded tagging system so that the triage category is immediately obvious. There are several triage systems in use across the country, and every nurse should be aware of the system used by his or her facility and community. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) triage system is one that is widely used and is presented here. It consists of four colors-red, yellow, green, and black. Each color signifies a different level of priority. Table 72-1 describes each category and gives examples of how different injuries would be classified.

\section*{Managing Internal Problems}

Each facility must determine its supply lists based on its own needs assessment. The Red Cross has developed a basic survival/ shelter resource kit. The EOP committee should determine the top 10 critical medications used during normal day-to-day operations and then anticipate which other medications may be required in a disaster or an MCI. For example, the hospital might plan to have available a stockpile of cyanide kits or antibiotics used in treating biological agents. Information should be available about local resources for stocking or restocking any of the basic and special supplies, how those supplies are requested, and the time required to receive those supplies.

\section*{Communicating With the Media and Family}

Communication is a key component of disaster management. Communication within the vast team of disaster responders is paramount; however, effective, informative communication with the media and worried family members is also crucial.

\section*{MANAGING MEDIA REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION}

Although the media have an obligation to report the news and can play a significant positive role in communication, the number of reporters, newscasters, and their support teams can be overwhelming, possibly compromising operations and patient confidentiality. A clearly defined process for managing the media, which includes a designated spokesperson, a site for the dissemination of information (away from patient care areas), and a regular schedule for providing updates should be part of the disaster plan.

Such a plan helps to prevent the release of contradictory or inaccurate information. Initial statements should focus on current efforts and what is being done to better understand the scope and

\begin{table}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
impact of the situation. Information about casualties should not be released. Security staff should not allow media personnel access to patient care areas.

\section*{CARING FOR FAMILIES}

Friends and family members converging on the scene must be cared for by the facility. They may be feeling intense anxiety, shock, or grief and should be provided with information and updates about their loved ones as soon as possible and regularly thereafter. They should not be in the triage or treatment areas, but in a designated area staffed by available social service workers, counselors, therapists, or clergy. Access to this area should be controlled to prevent families from being disturbed. See Chart 72-2 for a discussion of cultural variables to consider when coping with disaster-related injuries and death.

\section*{The Role of Nursing in Disaster Response Plans}

The role of the nurse during a disaster varies. The nurse may be asked to perform outside his or her area of expertise and may take on responsibilities normally held by physicians or advanced practice nurses. For example, a critical care nurse may intubate a patient or even insert chest tubes. Wound débridement or suturing may be performed by staff registered nurses. A nurse may serve as the triage officer.

Although the exact role of a nurse in disaster management depends on the specific needs of the facility at the time, it should be clear which nurse or physician is in charge of a given patient care area and which procedures each individual nurse may or may not perform. Assistance can be obtained through the incident command center, and nonmedical personnel can provide services where possible. For example, family members can provide nonskilled interventions for their loved ones. Nurses should remember that nursing care in a disaster focuses on essential care from a perspective of what is best for all patients.

New settings and atypical roles for nurses arise during a disaster: the nurse may provide shelter care in a temporary housing area, or bereavement support and assistance with identification of deceased loved ones. Individuals may require crisis intervention, or the nurse may participate in counseling other staff members and in critical incident stress management (CISM). At-risk populations may also require special considerations during a disaster (Chart 72-3).

\section*{CONSIDERING ETHICAL CONFLICTS}

Disasters represent a disparity between the resources of the health care agency and the needs of the victims. This generates ethical
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5fb53341af1d0ed10184g-181.jpg?height=768&width=845&top_left_y=186&top_left_x=112)
dilemmas for the nurses and other providers of care. Issues include conflicts related to
- Rationing care
- Futile therapy
- Consent
- Duty
- Confidentiality
- Resuscitation
- Assisted suicide

Nurses may find it difficult to not provide medical care to the dying, or to withhold information to avoid spreading fear and panic. Clinical scenarios that are unimaginable in normal circumstances, confront the nurse in extreme instances. Other ethical dilemmas may arise out of health care providers' instinct for self-protection and protection of their families. For example, what should a pregnant nurse do when incoming disaster victims have been exposed to radiation, yet too few nurses are available?

Nurses can plan for the ethical dilemmas they will face during disasters by establishing a framework for evaluating ethical questions before they arise and by identifying and exploring possible responses to difficult clinical situations. They can consider how the fundamental ethical principles of utilitarianism, beneficence, and justice will influence their decisions and care in disaster response.

\section*{MANAGING BEHAVIORAL ISSUES}

Although most people pull together and function during a disaster, both individuals and communities suffer immediate and sometimes long-term psychological trauma. Common responses to disaster include
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Somatization (fatigue, general malaise, headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin rashes)
- Posttraumatic stress disorder
- Substance abuse
- Interpersonal conflicts
- Impaired performance

Factors that influence an individual's response to disaster include the degree and nature of the exposure to the disaster, loss of friends and loved ones, existing coping strategies, available resources and support, and the personal meaning attached to the event. Other factors, such as loss of home and valued possessions, extended exposure to danger, and exposure to toxic contamination, also influence response and increase the risk of adjustment problems. Those exposed to the dead and injured, eyewitnesses and those endangered by the event, the elderly, children, emergency first-responders, and medical personnel caring for victims are considered to be at higher risk for emotional sequelae.

Nurses can assist disaster victims by providing active listening and emotional support, giving information, and referring patients to a therapist or social worker. Health care workers must refer individuals to mental health care services, because experience has shown that few disaster victims seek these services and early intervention minimizes psychological consequences. Nurses can also discourage victims from subjecting themselves to repeated exposure to the event through media replays and news articles, and encourage them to return to normal activities and social roles when appropriate.

\section*{Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM)}

CISM is an approach to preventing and treating the emotional trauma that can affect emergency responders as a consequence of their jobs and that can also occur to anyone involved in a disaster or MCI. Critical incident stress management is handled by CISM teams that are available to the OEM. There are 350 such teams in the United States. All branches of emergency services have CISM teams, as do the military and many industries (eg, airline industry).

Components of a management plan include education before an incident about critical incident stress and coping strategies; field support (ensuring that staff get adequate rest, food and fluids, and rotating work loads) during an incident; and defusings, debriefings, demobilization, and follow-up care after the incident.

Defusing is a process by which the individual receives education about recognition of stress reactions and management strategies for handling stress. Debriefing is a more complicated intervention; it involves a 2 - to 3 - hour process during which participants are asked about their emotional reactions to the incident, what symptoms they may be experiencing (eg, flashbacks, difficulty sleeping, intrusive thoughts), and other psychological ramifications. In follow-up, members of the CISM team contact the participants of a debriefing and schedule a follow-up meeting if necessary. People with ongoing stress reactions are referred to mental health specialists.

\section*{PREPARING FOR TERRORISM}

\section*{Recognition and Awareness}

Being prepared for terrorism as a health care provider includes awareness of the potential for covert use of WMDs, self-protection, and early detection, containment, or decontamination of substances and agents that may affect others by secondary exposure. The strength of many toxins, today's mobile society, and long incubation periods for some substances can result in an epidemic that can quickly and silently spread across the entire country. For example, there must be awareness that the healthy person with a
rapid onset of flu-like symptoms can have an ominous illness, as occurred with the anthrax exposures in 2001.

Health care personnel should have a heightened awareness for trends that may suggest deliberate dispersal of toxic or infectious agents (Howard, 2001). The following are some general principles of awareness that should raise suspicion:
- Beware of an unusual increase in the number of people seeking care for fever or respiratory or gastrointestinal complaints.
- Take note of an unusual illness for the time of year. Clusters of patients from a single location should raise suspicion. Clusters can be from a specific geographical location, such as a city, or from a single sporting or entertainment event.
- A large number of rapidly fatal cases should raise suspicion, especially when death occurs within 72 hours after hospital admission.
- Any increase in disease incidence in a normally healthy population should also raise suspicion. These cases should be reported to the state health department and to the CDC (Chettle, 2001).
An extensive patient history is taken in an attempt to identify the agent involved. This history includes an occupational, work, and environmental assessment in addition to the regular admission history. An exposure history contains, at a minimum, information about current and past exposures to possible hazards and an assessment of the patient's typical day and any deviations in routines. The work history includes, at a minimum, a description of all previous jobs, including short-term, seasonal, and part-time employment and any military service. The environmental history includes assessment of present and previous home locations, water supply, and any hobbies, to name a few factors. The admission history should include such information as recent travel and contact with others who have been ill or have recently died of a fatal illness. This is just a brief review of the extensive history that may need to be obtained to identify an exposure agent. This type of history should become a universal part of admission processes at all health care facilities (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2000).

Suspicions or findings are reported to the appropriate resources in the facility and to proper authorities in the community. Resources can include the Infection Control Department, material safety data sheets (MSDS), the state Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the local poison control center, and many Internet sites (Chettle, 2001). Reporting furnishes data elements to those agencies responsible for epidemiology and response. Reporting also allows for sharing of information among facilities and jurisdictions and can help determine the source of infections or exposure and prevent further exposures and even deaths.

\section*{Personal Protective Equipment}

Another component of preparedness and response involves the protection of the health care provider by additional personal protective equipment (PPE). Chemical or biological agents and radiation are silent killers and are generally colorless and odorless. The purpose of PPE is to shield individuals from the chemical, physical, and biological hazards that may exist when caring for contaminated patients. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has divided protective clothing and respiratory protection into four categories, level A through level D:
- Level A protection is worn when the highest level of respiratory, skin, eye, and mucous membrane protection is required. Briefly, this includes a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) available in the prehospital arena. This also includes a fully encapsulating, vapor-tight, chemicalresistant suit with chemical-resistant gloves and boots.
- Level B is similar to level A and is selected when the situation requires the highest level of respiratory protection but a lesser level of skin and eye protection. This level of protection includes the SCBA and a chemical-resistant suit (Currance \& Bronstein, 1999).
- Level C protection requires the air-purified respirator (APR), which uses filters or sorbent materials to remove harmful substances from the air. A chemical-resistant coverall with splash hood, chemical-resistant gloves, and boots are included in level C protection.
- Level D protection is basically the work uniform.

Level C and Level D PPE are the levels most often used in hospital facilities (Currance \& Bronstein, 1999).

Protective equipment must be donned before contact with a contaminated patient. The acute care facility's standard precaution PPE (levels D or C) generally is not adequate for protection from a contaminated patient. The health care provider must use equipment that is capable of providing protection against the agent involved. This may mean using a splash suit along with a full-face positive- or negative-pressure respirator (a filter-type gas mask) or even an SCBA for medical personnel in the field (Burgess et al., 1999; Currance \& Bronstein, 1999; JCAHO, 2000).

No single combination of PPE is capable of protecting against all hazards. Under no circumstances should responders wear any PPE without proper training, practice, and fit testing of respirator masks as necessary.

\section*{Decontamination}

Decontamination, the process of removing accumulated contaminants, is critical to the health and safety of health care providers by preventing secondary contamination. The decontamination plan should establish procedures and educate employees about decontamination procedures, identify the equipment needed and methods to be used, and establish methods for disposal of contaminated materials (Currance \& Bronstein, 1999).

Although many principles and theories surround decontamination of a patient, authorities agree that, to be effective, decontamination must include a minimum of two steps. The first step is removal of the patient's clothing and jewelry and then rinsing the patient with water. Depending on the type of exposure, this step alone can remove a large amount of the contamination and decrease secondary contamination (Burgess et al., 1999). The second step consists of a thorough soap-and-water wash and rinse. When patients arrive at the facility from a prehospital provider, it should not be assumed that they have been thoroughly decontaminated.

\section*{WEAPONS OF TERROR}

\section*{Biological Weapons}

Biological weapons are weapons that spread disease among the general population or the military. Use of biological weapons dates far back into history, but improved production techniques and genetic engineering have expanded the potential for widespread casualties as a result of biological weaponry.

\section*{EFFECTS OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS}

Biological warfare is a covert method of severely affecting the target. Overall, biological weapons are easily obtained and easily disseminated, and they result in significant mortality and morbidity. The potential use of biological agents calls for continuous increased surveillance by health departments and an increased index of suspicion by clinicians. Many biological weapons result in signs and symptoms similar to those of common disease processes.

Biological agents are delivered in either a liquid or dry state, applied to foods or water, or vaporized for inhalation or direct contact. Vaporization may be accomplished through spray or explosives loaded with the agent. With increased travel, an agent could be released in one city and affect people in other cities thousands of miles away. The vector can be an insect, animal, or person, or there may be direct contact with the agent itself.

The following is a discussion of two of the agents most likely to be used or weaponized. Table 72-2 describes other easily weaponized biological agents.

\section*{ANTHRAX}

Bacillus anthracis is a naturally occurring gram-positive, encapsulated rod that lives in the soil in the spore state throughout the world. The bacterium sporulates (is liberated) when exposed to air and is infective only in the spore form. Contact with infected animal products (raw meat) or inhalation of the spores results in infection. Cattle and other herbivores are vaccinated against anthrax to prevent transmission through contaminated meat.

It is believed that approximately 8000 to 50,000 spores must be inhaled to put a person at risk. As an aerosol, anthrax is odorless and invisible and can travel a great distance before disseminating; hence, the site of release and the site of infection can be miles apart.

Anthrax is recognized as the most likely weaponized biological agent available. Anthrax has been known as a highly debilitating agent for centuries. It is believed that the plague in 1500 BC Egypt was caused by anthrax (Spencer, Whitman \& Morton, 2001). In 1979, Sverdlosk, Russia, experienced the intentional release of anthrax, with widespread mortality and morbidity. Anthrax was released with the sarin gas attack in Tokyo, Japan, in 1995; however, the method of release chosen was poorly designed for effect.

Anthrax is caused by replicating bacteria that release toxin resulting in hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis. The incubation period is from 1 to 6 days. There are three primary methods of infection: skin contact, inhalation, and gastrointestinal ingestion. Skin lesions (the most common infection) cause edema with pruritis and macule or papule formation resulting in ulceration with 1 - to $3-\mathrm{mm}$ vesicles. A painless eschar develops, which falls off in 1 to 2 weeks.

Ingestion of anthrax results in fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally ascites. If massive diarrhea develops, decreased intravascular volume becomes the primary treatment concern. The bacterium affects the terminal ileum and cecum. Sepsis can occur. Treatment is fluoroquinolones or tetracycline.

The inhalation form of anthrax is the most severe. Its symptoms mimic those of the flu, and usually treatment is sought only when the second stage of severe respiratory distress occurs. At this point, even antibiotic therapy will not halt the progress of the disease. The inhalation form can have an incubation period of up to 60 days, making it difficult to identify the source of the bacterium. Initial signs and symptoms include cough, headache, fever, vomiting, chills, weakness, mild chest discomfort, dyspnea, and syncope, without rhinorrhea or nasal congestion.

Most patients have a brief recovery period followed by the second stage within 1 to 3 days, characterized by fever, severe respiratory distress, stridor, hypoxia, cyanosis, diaphoresis, hypotension, and shock. These patients require optimization of oxygenation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and ventilatory and hemodynamic support. More than $50 \%$ of these patients have hemorrhagic mediastinitis on chest x-ray (a hallmark sign) (Spencer, Whitman, \& Morton 2001; Altman, 2002; Inglesby et al., 1999). The disease can also progress to include meningitis with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Death results in approximately 24 to 36 hours after the onset of severe respiratory distress. The mortality rate nears $100 \%$.

Treatment. Presently anthrax is penicillin sensitive; however, the Russian government has been involved in the production of penicillin-resistant anthrax. Recommended treatment includes penicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, or doxycycline. If antibiotic treatment begins within 24 hours after exposure, death can be prevented (Franz \& Zajtchuk, 2000). In a mass casualty situation, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is recommended. Treatment is continued for 60 days. For patients who have been directly exposed to anthrax but have no signs and symptoms of disease, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is used for prophylaxis for 60 days.

When caring for a patient infected with anthrax, standard precautions are all that are necessary. The patient is not contagious, and the disease cannot be spread from person to person. Equipment should be cleaned using standard hospital disinfectant. After death, cremation is recommended because the spores can survive for decades and represent a threat to morticians and forensic medicine personnel.

\section*{SMALLPOX}

Variola is classified as a DNA virus. It has an incubation period of approximately 12 days. It is extremely contagious and is spread by direct contact, contact with clothing or linens, or by droplets from person to person only after the fever has decreased and the rash phase has begun (Inglesby et al., 1999). There is an associated $30 \%$ case-fatality rate. Aerosolization of the virus would result in widespread dissemination. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared smallpox eradicated in 1977 and stopped worldwide vaccination in 1980. In the United States, the last child was vaccinated in 1972. Therefore, a large portion of the current population has no immunity to the virus. Recently, plans have been instituted in the U.S. for smallpox vaccination, with health care personnel being the first to receive the vaccine.

Smallpox was used as biowarfare during the French and Indian War in 1754-1767, when blankets from smallpox patients were sent into the Indian camps, resulting in greater than $50 \%$ fatality rates (Inglesby et al., 1999). Smallpox virus survives for up to 24 hours in cool temperatures and low humidity.

Signs and symptoms include high fever, malaise, headache, backache, and prostration. After 1 to 2 days, a maculopapular rash appears, evolving at the same rate and beginning on the face, mouth and pharynx, and forearms (Fig 72-1). Only then does the rash progress to the trunk and also become vesicular to pustular (Inglesby et al., 1999; Hagstad, 2000; Franz \& Zajtchuk, 2000). There is a large amount of the virus in the saliva and pustules. Smallpox (variola) is contagious only after the appearance of the rash. Variola major has a $30 \%$ case fatality rate. Hemorrhagic smallpox includes all of the above signs and symptoms with the addition of a dusky erythema and petechiae to frank hemorrhage of the skin and mucous membranes, resulting in death by day 5 or 6 . Variola minor produces fewer constitutional symptoms and a sparse rash.

Treatment. Treatment includes supportive care with antibiotics for any additional infection. The patient must be isolated with the use of transmission precautions. Laundry and biological wastes should be autoclaved before being washed with hot water and bleach. Standard decontamination of the room is effective. All persons who have household or face-to-face contact with the patient after the fever begins should be vaccinated within 4 days to prevent infection and death (Franz \& Zajtchuk, 2000; Inglesby et al., 1999). A patient with a temperature of $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ) or higher within 17 days after exposure requires isolation. Postvaccination encephalitis occurs in approximately 1 of every 300,000 patients and has a $25 \%$ fatality rate. Cremation is preferred for all deaths, because the virus can survive in scabs for up to 13 years.

\section*{Chemical Weapons}

Agents that may potentially be used in chemical warfare are overt agents in that the effects are more apparent and occur more quickly than those caused by biological weapons. Agents are available and well-known, result in major mortality and morbidity,
and cause panic and social disruption. There are many agents, including those that affect nerves (sarin, soman), those that affect blood (cyanide), those that are vesicants (lewisite, nitrogen and sulfur mustard, phosgene), heavy metals (arsenic, lead), volatile toxins (benzene, chloroform), pulmonary agents (chlorine), and corrosive acids (nitric acid, sulfuric acid) (Table 72-3). Chlorine, phosgene, and cyanide are widely used in industry and therefore are readily available.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF CHEMICALS}

Volatility. Volatility is the tendency for a chemical to become a vapor. The most volatile agents are phosgene and cyanide. Most chemicals are heavier than air, except for hydrogen cyanide. Therefore, in the presence of most chemicals, the victim should stand up to avoid heavy exposure (because the chemical will sink toward the floor or ground).

Persistence. Persistence means that the chemical is less likely to vaporize and disperse. More volatile chemicals do not evaporate very quickly. Most industrial chemicals are not very persistent.

Weaponized agents (chemicals developed as weapons by the military) are more likely than industrial chemicals to penetrate and cause secondary exposure as well.

Toxicity. Toxicity is the potential of an agent to cause injury to the body. The median lethal dose (LD50) is the amount of the chemical that will cause death in $50 \%$ of those who are exposed. The median effective dose (ED50) is the amount of the chemical that will cause signs and symptoms in $50 \%$ of those who are exposed. The concentration time (CT) is the concentration released multiplied by the time exposed ( $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ ). For example, if 1000 mg of a chemical were released and the time of exposure to this amount of chemical was 10 minutes, then the concentration time would be $10,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$.

Latency. Latency is the time from absorption to the appearance of symptoms. Sulfur mustards and pulmonary agents have the longest latency, whereas vesicants, nerve agents, and cyanide produce symptoms within seconds.

\section*{LIMITING EXPOSURE}

Evacuation is essential, as are removal of clothing and decontamination as close to the scene as possible and before transport of the person exposed. Soap and water are effective means of decontamination in most cases. Staff involved in decontamination efforts must wear PPE and contain the runoff after decontamination procedures.

\section*{VESICANTS}

Vesicants are chemicals that cause blistering and result in burning, conjunctivitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, hematopoietic suppression, and death. Examples of vesicants include lewisite, phosgene, nitrogen mustard, and sulfur mustard. In World War I and in the Iran-Iraq conflict of 1980-1988, vesicants were used to disable the opponent. Vesicants were the primary incapacitating agents, resulting in minimal (less than $5 \%$ ) death but large numbers of injured (Brennan, Waeckerle, Sharp, \& Lillibridge, 1999). Liquid sulfur mustard was the most frequently used vesicant in these conflicts. It is an oily liquid with a garlic odor, has a long latent period, and penetrates the skin if not rapidly removed. The skin damage is irreversible but is seldom fatal ( $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ mortality).

The initial presentation after exposure to a vesicant is similar to that of a large superficial to partial-thickness burn in the warm and moist areas of the body (ie, perineum, axillae, antecubital spaces). There is stinging and erythema for approximately 24 hours, followed by pruritus, painful burning, and small vesicle formation after 2 to 18 hours. These vesicles can coalesce into large, fluidfilled bullae. Lewisite and phosgene result in immediate pain after exposure. Tissue damage occurs within minutes.

If the eye is exposed, there is pain, photophobia, lacrimation, and decreased vision. This progresses to conjunctivitis, blepharospasm, corneal ulcer, and corneal edema.

Respiratory effects are more serious and often are the cause of mortality with vesicant exposure. Purulent fibrinous pseudomembrane discharge leads to obstruction of the airways. Gastrointestinal exposure includes nausea and vomiting, leukopenia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Appropriate decontamination includes soap and water. Scrubbing and the use of hypochlorite solutions should be avoided, because they increase penetration. Once the substance has penetrated, it cannot be removed. Eye exposure requires copious irrigation. For respiratory exposure, intubation and bronchoscopy to remove necrotic tissue are essential. With lewisite exposure, dimercaprol (BAL in oil) is administered intravenously for sys-
temic toxicity and topically for skin lesions. All persons with sulfur mustard exposures should be monitored for 24 hours for delayed (latent) effects.

\section*{NERVE AGENTS}

The most toxic agents in existence are the nerve agents such as sarin, soman, tabun, VX, and organophosphates (pesticides). They are inexpensive, effective in small quantities, and easily dispersed. In the liquid form, nerve agents evaporate into a colorless, odorless vapor. Organophosphates are similar in nature to the nerve agents used in warfare and are readily available. Nerve agents can be inhaled or absorbed percutaneously or subcutaneously. These agents bond with acetylcholinesterase, so that acetylcholine is not removed; the adverse result is continuous stimulation (hyperstimulation) of the nerve endings. Carbamates, which are insecticides originally extracted from the Calabar bean, are derivatives of carbamic acid; they are nerve agents that specifically inhibit acetylcholinesterase for several hours and then spontaneously become unbound from the acetylcholinesterase. Organophosphates, however, require the formation of new enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) before function can be restored.

A very small drop of agent is enough to result in sweating and twitching at the site of exposure. A larger amount results in more systemic symptoms. Effects can begin anywhere from 30 minutes up to 18 hours after exposure. The more common organophosphates and carbamates that are used in agriculture (sevin and malathion) result in less severe symptoms than do those used in warfare.

Signs and symptoms of nerve gas exposure are those of cholinergic crisis and include bilateral miosis, visual disturbances, increased gastrointestinal motility, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, substernal spasm, indigestion, bradycardia and atrioventricular block, bronchoconstriction, laryngeal spasm, weakness, fasciculations, and incontinence. The patient must be examined in a dark area to truly identify miosis. Neurologic responses include insomnia, forgetfulness, impaired judgment, depression, and irritability. A lethal dose results in loss of consciousness, seizures, copious secretions, fasciculations, flaccid muscles, and apnea.

Decontamination with copious amounts of soap and water or saline solution for 8 to 20 minutes is essential. The water is blotted, not wiped, off. Fresh $0.5 \%$ hypochlorite solution can also be used. The airway is maintained, and suctioning is frequently required. One must be aware that plastic airway equipment will absorb sarin gas, resulting in continued exposure to the agent.

Treatment. Intravenous atropine 2 to 4 mg is administered, followed by 2 mg every 3 to 8 minutes for up to 24 hours of treatment. Alternatively, intravenous atropine 1 to $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{hr}$ may be administered until clear signs of anticholinergic activity have returned (decreased secretions, tachycardia, and decreased gastrointestinal motility). Another medication is pralidoxime; which allows cholinesterase to become active against acetylcholine. Pralidoxime 1 to 2 g in 100 to 150 mL of normal saline solution should be administered over 15 to 30 minutes. Pralidoxime has no effect on secretions and may have any of the following side effects: hypertension, tachycardia, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, and diplopia.

Diazepam (Valium) or other benzodiazepines should be administered for seizures, to decrease fasciculations, and to alleviate apprehension and agitation. The military provides all military personnel with Mark I autoinjectors, which contain 2 mg atropine and 600 mg pralidoxime chloride. Diazepam is administered by a partner.

\section*{BLOOD AGENTS}

Blood agents have a direct effect on cellular metabolism, resulting in asphyxiation through alterations in hemoglobin. Examples include hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride. Cyanide is an agent that has profound systemic effects. It is commonly used in the mining of gold and silver and in the plastics and dye industries. In 1984, the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, released large amounts of cyanide in an industrial disaster, and hundreds of deaths occurred.

A cyanide release is often associated with the odor of bitter almonds. In house fires, cyanide is released during the combustion of plastics, rugs, silk, furniture, and other construction materials. There is a significant correlation between blood cyanide and carbon monoxide levels in fire victims, and most often the cause of death is cyanide.

Cyanide can be ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes.

Cyanide is protein bound and inhibits aerobic metabolism, leading to respiratory muscle failure, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and death. Inhalation of cyanide results in flushing, tachypnea, tachycardia, nonspecific neurologic symptoms, stupor, coma, and seizure preceding respiratory arrest.

Emergency Treatment. Rapid administration of the following medications is essential to the successful management of cyanide exposure: amyl nitrate, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. First, the patient is intubated and placed on a ventilator. Next, amyl nitrate pearls are crushed and placed in the ventilator reservoir to induce methemoglobinemia. Cyanide has a $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ higher affinity for methemoglobin than it does for hemoglobin; it binds methemoglobin to form either cyanomethemoglobin or sulfmethemoglobin. The cyanomethemoglobin is then detoxified in the liver by the enzyme rhodanase. Next, sodium nitrite is administered intravenously, also to induce the rapid formation of methemoglobin. Sodium thiosulfate is then administered intravenously; it has a higher affinity for cyanide than methemoglobin does and stimulates the conversion of cyanide to sodium thiocyanate, which can be renally excreted. There are side effects of these emergency medications: sodium nitrite can result in severe hypotension, and thiocyanate can cause vomiting, psychosis, arthralgia, and myalgia.

The production of methemoglobin is contraindicated in patients with smoke inhalation, because they already have decreased oxygen-carrying capacity secondary to the carboxyhemoglobin produced by smoke inhalation. An alternative suggested treatment for cyanide poisoning is hydroxycobalamin (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12} \mathrm{a}$ ). Hydroxyocobalamin binds cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ ). It must be administered intravenously in large doses. Administration of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ a can result in transient pink discoloration of mucous membranes, skin, and urine. In high doses, tachycardia and hypertension can occur, but they usually resolve within 48 hours.

\section*{PULMONARY AGENTS}

Pulmonary agents such as phosgene and chlorine destroy the pulmonary membrane that separates the alveolus from the capillary bed. Hence, the person exposed cannot release carbon dioxide or acquire oxygen. Capillary leak results in fluid-filled alveoli. Phosgene and chlorine both vaporize, rapidly causing this pulmonary injury. Phosgene has the odor of fresh-mown hay.

Signs and symptoms include pulmonary edema with shortness of breath, especially during exertion. Cough starts as a hacking
cough followed by frothy sputum production. A mask is the only protection required. Phosgene does not injure the eyes.

\section*{Nuclear Radiation Exposure}

The threat of nuclear warfare or radiation exposure is very real with the availability of nuclear material and easily concealed simple devices, such as the so-called dirty bomb, for dispersal. A dirty bomb is a conventional explosive (eg, dynamite) that is packaged with radioactive material that scatters when the bomb is detonated. It disperses radioactive material and may be called a radiologic weapon, but is not a nuclear weapon, which is a complex nuclear fission reaction that is thousands of times more devastating than the dirty bomb.

Sources of radioactive material include not only nuclear weapons but reactors and simple radioactive samples, such as weapons-grade plutonium or uranium, freshly spent nuclear fuel, or medical supplies (eg, radium, certain cesium isotopes) used in cancer treatments and radiography machines. Exposure of a large number of people can be accomplished by placing a radioactive sample in a public place. Thousands may be exposed this way; some may be immediately affected, and others may require health monitoring for many years to assess long-term effects.

History has demonstrated the effectiveness of these weapons in the devastating results of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. The effects of radiation exposure also were felt by the inhabitants of a small town in Brazil, who in 1987 found and opened a small canister of cesium 137 and rubbed the blue powder on themselves; 249 people were sickened, and 4 died (Jagminas \& Suner, 2001). In 1983, a hospital sample was stolen in Mexico, resulting in the release of radioactive material among some scrap metal. A year later, the radiation contamination was detected when the scrap metal was inadvertently transported into the Los Alamos National Laboratory and triggered a Geiger counter.

On a larger scale, nuclear reactor incidents have occurred in the Chernobyl (1986) and Three Mile Island (1979) nuclear facilities. There were 31 official deaths on the day of the Chernobyl incident, which involved a core meltdown and explosion, releasing radiation throughout the community. The long-term effects of this incident, including increased incidence of thyroid cancers and leukemia, continue to be evaluated. Reactors, however, follow very strict security measures and protocols for prevention of core meltdown. These measures decrease the possibility of a radiation incident from a reactor.

\section*{TYPES OF RADIATION}

Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are in balance in the nucleus. The protons repel each other, because they are all positively charged. The number of protons is specific for each element in the periodic table. There is a specific ratio of protons and neutrons for each different atom, and the result is element stability. When an element is radioactive, there is an imbalance in the nucleus resulting from an excess of neutrons.

To achieve stability, a radioactive nuclide can eject particles until the most stable number (an even number) of protons and neutrons exists. A proton can become a neutron by ejecting a positron; conversely, a neutron can become a proton by ejecting a negative electron. An alpha particle is released when two protons and two electrons are ejected.

Alpha particles cannot penetrate the skin. A thin layer of paper or clothing is all that is necessary to protect the skin from alpha-radiation. However, this low-level radiation can enter the
body through inhalation, ingestion, or injection (open wound). Only localized damage will occur.

Beta particles have the ability to moderately penetrate the skin to the layer in which skin cells are being produced. This highenergy radiation can cause skin damage if the skin is exposed for a prolonged period and can cause injury if beta particles become internal by penetrating the skin.

Gamma-radiation is a short-wavelength electromagnetic energy that is emitted when there is excess core nucleus energy. Gamma particles are penetrating. It is difficult to shield against gamma-radiation. X-rays are an example of gamma-radiation. Gamma-radiation often accompanies both alpha- and betaparticle emission.

\section*{MEASUREMENT AND DETECTION}

Radiation is measured in several different units. The rad is the basic unit of measurement. A rad is equivalent to 0.01 joule of energy per kilogram of tissue. To determine the damaging effect of the rad, a conversion to the rem (Roentgen equivalent man) is necessary. The rem reflects the type of radiation absorbed and the potential for damage. For example, 200,000 mrem will result in mild radiation sickness ( $1 \mathrm{rem}=1000$ millirem) (Jagminas \& Suner, 2001). Typical natural yearly exposure for an individual is 360 mrem. Another important concept is half-life. The half-life of a radioactive product is the time it takes to lose one half of its radioactivity.

Radiation is invisible. The only means of detection is through a device that determines the exposure per minute. There are various devices for this purpose. The Geiger counter (or GeigerMueller survey meter) can measure background radiation quickly through detection of gamma- and some beta-radiation. With highlevel radiation, the Geiger counter may underestimate exposure. Other devices include the ionization chamber survey meter, alpha monitors, and dose-rate meters. Personal dosimeters are simple tools to identify radiation exposure and are worn by radiology personnel.

\section*{EXPOSURE}

Exposure is affected by time, distance, and shielding. The longer a person is within the radiation area, the higher the exposure. Also, the larger the amount of radioactive material in the area, the greater the exposure. The farther away the person is from the radiation source, the lower the exposure. Shielding from the radiation source also decreases exposure. One should never touch radioactive materials directly.

Three types of radiation-induced injury can occur: external irradiation, contamination with radioactive materials, and incorporation of radioactive material into body cells, tissues, or organs.

External irradiation exposure occurs when all or part of the body is exposed to radiation that penetrates or passes completely through the body. In this type of exposure, the patient is not radioactive and does not require special isolation or decontamination measures. Irradiation does not necessarily constitute a medical emergency.

Contamination occurs when the body is exposed to radioactive gases, liquids, or solids either externally or internally. If internal, the contaminant can be deposited within the body. Contamination requires immediate medical management to prevent incorporation.

Incorporation is the actual uptake of radioactive material into the cells, tissues, and susceptible organs. The organs involved are usually the kidneys, bone, liver, and thyroid.

Sequelae of contamination and incorporation can occur days to years later. The thyroid gland can be largely protected from ra-
diation exposure by administration of stable iodine (potassium iodide, or KI) before or promptly after the intake of radioactive iodine (WHO, 1999).

Priorities in the treatment of any type of radiation exposure are always treatment of life-threatening injuries and illnesses first, followed by measures to limit exposure, contamination control, and finally decontamination.

\section*{DECONTAMINATION}

Hospital and countywide disaster plans should be in effect when managing a radiation disaster. Access restriction is essential to prevent contamination of other areas of the hospital. Triage outside the hospital is the most effective means of preventing contamination of the facility itself. Floors are covered to prevent tracking of contaminants throughout the treatment areas. Strict isolation precautions should be in effect. Waste is controlled through double-bagging and the use of plastic-lined containers outside of the facility.

Staff are required to wear protective clothing, such as waterresistant gowns, two pairs of gloves, masks, caps, goggles, and booties. Dosimetry devices should be worn by all staff members participating in patient care. The radiation safety officer in the hospital should be notified immediately to assist with surveys (using a radiation survey meter) of the incoming patients and to provide dosimeters to all staff personnel involved with patient care of exposed victims. There is minimal risk to staff if the patients are properly surveyed and decontaminated. The majority of patients can be safely decontaminated with soap and water.

Each patient arriving at the hospital should be first surveyed with the radiation survey meter for external contamination and then directed toward the decontamination area as needed. Decontamination occurs outside of the ED with a shower, collection pool, tarp, and collection containers for patient belongings, as well as soap, towels, and disposable paper gowns for patients. Water runoff needs to be contained. Patients who are uninjured can perform self-decontamination with the use of handheld showers. After the patient has showered, a resurvey should be conducted to determine whether the radioactive contaminants have been removed. Additional washings should occur until the patient is free of contamination. It is important to ensure during showers that previously clean areas are not contaminated with runoff from the washed contaminated areas (eg, hair should be washed in the bent-over position to protect the body from contamination).

Biologic samples should be taken through nasal and throat swabs, and a complete blood count with differential should be obtained. Wounds should be irrigated and then covered with a water-resistant dressing prior to total body decontamination.

Internal contamination or incorporation requires decontamination through catharsis and/or gastric lavage with chelating agents (agents that bind with radioactive substances and are then excreted). Samples of urine, feces, and vomitus are surveyed to determine internal contamination levels.

\section*{ACUTE RADIATION SYNDROME}

Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) can occur after exposure to radiation. It is the dose rather than the source that determines whether ARS develops. Factors that determine whether the patient's response to exposure will result in ARS include a high dose (minimum 100 rad ) and rate of radiation with total body exposure and penetrating-type radiation. Age, medical history, and genetics also affect the outcome after exposure. The effects follow a predictable course. Table 72-4 identifies the phases of ARS.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 72-4 - Phases of Effects of Radiation Exposure}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline PHASE & TIME OF OCCURRENCE & SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS \\
\hline Prodromal phase (presenting symptoms) & 48-72 hr after exposure & Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue High-dose radiation-fever, respiratory distress, and increased excitability \\
\hline Latent phase (a symptom-free period) & \begin{tabular}{l}
After resolution of prodromal phase; can last up to 3 wk \\
With high-dose radiation-latent period is shorter
\end{tabular} & Decreasing lymphocytes, leukocytes, thrombocytes, red blood cells \\
\hline Illness phase & After latent period phase & Infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, bleeding, diarrhea, shock, and altered level of consciousness \\
\hline Recovery phase OR & After illness phase & Can take weeks to months for full recovery \\
\hline Death & After illness phase & Increased intracranial pressure is a sign of impending death \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Each body system is affected differently in ARS. Systems with cells that rapidly reproduce are the most affected. The effects on the hematopoietic system include decreased numbers of lymphocytes, granulocytes, thrombocytes, and reticulocytes. It is the first system affected and serves as an indicator of the severity of radiation exposure (Jarrett, 2001; Jagminas \& Suner, 2001). A marker of outcome is the absolute lymphocyte count at 48 hours after exposure. A significant exposure would be indicated by lymphocyte counts of 300 to 1200 per cubic millimeter of blood (the normal lymphocyte count is 1500 to $3000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ). Barrier precautions should be implemented to protect the patient from infection. Neutrophils decrease within 1 week, platelets decrease within 2 weeks, and red blood cells decrease within 3 weeks. Hemorrhagic complications, fever, and sepsis are common.

The gastrointestinal system, with its rapidly producing cells, is also readily affected by radiation. Doses of radiation required to produce symptoms are approximately 600 rad or higher (Jagminas \& Suner, 2001). The gastrointestinal symptoms usually occur at the same time as the changes in the hematopoietic system. Nausea and vomiting occur within 2 hours after exposure. Sepsis, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and opportunistic infections can occur as complications. An ominous sign is the presence of high fever and bloody diarrhea; these typically appear on day 10 after exposure.

The central nervous system is affected with doses greater than 1000 rad (Jagminas \& Suner, 2001). The symptoms occur when damage to the blood vessels of the brain results in fluid leakage. Signs and symptoms include cerebral edema, nausea, vomiting, headache, and increased intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure heralds a poor outcome and imminent death. Central nervous system injury with this amount of exposure is irreversible and occurs before hematopoietic or gastrointestinal system symptoms appear. Cardiovascular collapse is usually seen in conjunction with these injuries.

Depending on the dose, skin effects can also occur. With exposure of 600 to 1000 rad, erythema occurs; it can disappear within hours, and then reappear. The exposed patient must be evaluated hourly for the presence of erythema. With exposures greater than 1000 rad, desquamation (radiation dermatitis) of the skin occurs. Necrosis becomes evident within a few days to months at doses greater than 5000 rad. Skin signs are an indication of the dose of radiation exposure.

Secondary injury can occur when the radiation exposure occurs during a traumatic event such as a blast or burn. Trauma in addition to radiation exposure increases patient mortality. Attention must first be directed toward the primary assessment for trauma. Airway, breathing, circulation, and fracture reduction require immediate attention. All definitive treatments must occur within the first 48 hours. Thereafter, all surgical procedures should be delayed for 2 to 3 months because of the potential for delayed wound healing and the possible development of opportunistic infections several weeks after exposure.

\section*{SURVIVAL}

There are three categories of predicted survival after radiation exposure: probable, possible, and improbable. Triage of victims at the scene, after decontamination, is conducted with the routine system for disaster triage. Presenting signs and symptoms determine the potential for survival and therefore the category of predicted survival during triage.

Probable survival victims have either no initial symptoms or only minimal symptoms (eg, nausea and vomiting), or these symptoms resolve within a few hours. These patients should receive a complete blood count and may be discharged with instructions to return if any symptoms recur.

Possible survivors are those who present with nausea and vomiting that persists for 24 to 48 hours. They will experience a latent period, during which leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia occur. Barrier precautions and protective isolation are implemented if the patient's lymphocyte count is less than $1200 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. Supportive treatment includes administration of blood products, prevention of infection, and provision of enhanced nutrition.

The improbable survival group is composed of those who have received more than 800 rad of total body penetrating irradiation. Acutely, people in this group demonstrate vomiting, diarrhea, and shock. Any neurologic symptoms suggest a lethal dose of radiation (Jarrett, 2001). These patients still require decontamination, to prevent contamination of the area. Personal protection is essential, because it is virtually impossible to fully decontaminate these patients since all of their internal organs have been irradiated. The survival time is variable; however, death usually ensues swiftly due to shock. If there are no neurologic symptoms, the patient may be alert and oriented, similar to a patient with
extensive burns. In a mass casualty situation, the nurse should expect to triage these patients into the black category, where they will receive comfort measures and emotional support. If it is not a mass casualty situation, aggressive fluid and electrolyte therapy are essential.

Although radiation, biological, and chemical events are not everyday events, when they do occur every facility and every nurse will need to know the basics of caring for affected patients.

Any terrorist-sponsored or unintentional radiation release can be sizeable and may require the entire hospital and prehospital staff to be prepared, recognize signs and symptoms of exposure, and rapidly treat victims without contamination of personnel, visitors, patients, or the facility itself.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are the triage nurse at the receiving facility for casualties after a tornado. Five patients arrive at the same time. Together with the surgeon on duty, you must identify the patients' needs. You are presented with an elderly man with a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, color ashen, tense abdomen, and only carotid pulses present; a 7-year-old child with a bleeding scalp laceration who has a Glasgow Coma Score of 8 and needs intubation; the 30 -year-old mother of the child, who is crying hysterically, is walking, and appears to have no pain or visible injuries; a 15-year-old girl who complains of pain in her left leg, with obvious deformity at the calf but good pulses in the foot; and a 65-year-old woman who arrives in a police car holding her right wrist, which is cool, ecchymotic, and painful with good pulses. How would you classify these patients?

Family members, members of the press, and city officials begin arriving at the hospital in large numbers. How would you expect these people to be managed? How will the family members be cared for?
2. A patient arrives at the triage desk complaining of sudden onset of high fever and respiratory flu-like symptoms. What are the signs and symptoms that you should identify if considering a biological warfare agent? Which agents cause pneumonia-like signs and symptoms? What precautions would be taken to protect staff?
3. Multiple patients begin arriving at the ED complaining of burning eyes and difficulty breathing. All of these persons work at the railroad, where there are often tanker trucks transporting chemical agents. What should you do first? Where do you find information about chemical agents and their treatment?
4. You are a member of the disaster committee at your hospital. What are the elements of the disaster plan that you will be sure to include? How will you plan for triage? What types of PPE will you purchase?

\section*{Understanding Clinical Pathways}

Clinical pathways (also called critical pathways) are care plans developed collaboratively by physicians, nurses, physical therapists, technicians, pharmacists, speech therapists, case managers, and other staff members involved in patient care. Nurses are instrumental in ensuring the successful use of clinical pathways and can best contribute by gaining a thorough understanding of why and how pathways are used.

\section*{UNDERSTANDING AND USING CLINICAL PATHWAYS IN PATIENT CARE}

Clinical pathways grew out of financial upheaval in the health care industry. They represent a significant change in how patient care is managed. In the past (and currently for many patients), each health care discipline developed its own plan of care and used the patient's chart (medical record) as the primary communication tool. Each care provider needed to read the notes written by other care providers of other disciplines to get a complete picture of the plan of care and the patient's progress. Although there was probably general agreement about how patient progress would be facilitated and measured, individual steps in the processes of care and outcomes to be achieved were not usually specifically articulated. The physician managed the case and most patients remained in the hospital until they required very little care or could be transferred to a convalescent center. The length of hospital stay was not an issue; 2 to 3 weeks in an acute care facility was not unusual.

\section*{COST AND EFFECTS}

Although this system worked for decades, it was expensive. Not including charges for diagnostic tests or treatments, each day in the hospital could easily cost $\$ 800$ or more. The federal government and, later, insurance companies balked at paying these costs when highly skilled care was no longer needed. So they determined how many days of hospitalization a patient with a specific diagnosis required and decided to reimburse the insured parties only for that number of days. At the same time, hospitals tried to obtain meaningful financial data about the costs of hos-pital-based patient care-where the greatest costs were generated and how they could be reduced. Decreasing the length of stay was seen as one way to save money. As hospital stays became shorter and shorter, nurses and physicians began to express concerns about the quality of care. Patients were discharged to home or rehabilitation centers much sooner than before. They were weaker, had relatively fresh incisions, or often could not perform even minimal self-care independently. Regulatory agencies and consumers shared these concerns and demands arose for hard data demonstrating that patients were not being harmed.

This scenario compelled hospital administrators and clinicians to develop a new way to measure and manage costs, quality, and outcomes. Thoughtful examination of how patient care was provided exposed inefficiencies and highlighted the lack of face-toface communication among disciplines. It became apparent that patient care could be managed more cost-effectively, possibly saving hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly. Hospitals adopted a system known as case management to address these issues.

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}

Under case management, care is planned collaboratively so that important events, such as initiation of physical therapy, home care consultation, or discontinuation of invasive treatments, occur on a schedule that clinicians, through experience or research, have identified as optimum for enhancing recovery. Care is mapped out by day or by other pivotal time intervals and goals or desired outcomes are specified for each time frame. When the patient has met all the goals, he or she is ready for discharge to home or to the next level of care. Responsibility for monitoring an individual patient's progress and tracking variance or deviation from the pathway is given to the case manager who usually but not always is a nurse. The tool on which all this information is contained is the clinical pathway. The purposes of a clinical pathway are to
- Promote quality care and improve clinical outcomes
- Standardize important aspects of care
- Reduce unnecessary delays in care
- Reduce costs

\section*{ELEMENTS OF A CLINICAL PATHWAY}

Clinical pathways are now used in a variety of settings and cover diverse diagnoses and conditions. They are often developed by individual organizations and, although the format varies from institution to institution, clinical pathways have major features in common.

\section*{Patient Population}

The first important element of the clinical pathway is the patient population (Fig. AP-1A). Each pathway clearly specifies the patients appropriate for inclusion on the pathway. Pathways tend to cover patient groups in which the treatment and recovery are relatively predictable. Institutions typically use a diagnosis-related group (DRG) to identify patients, but qualifiers may be added. For example, a pathway for community-acquired pneumonia may exclude patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or underlying obstructive pulmonary disease because those patients require highly individualized treatment plans and may not respond as quickly to intervention as patients without these underlying disorders.

\section*{Time Frames}

All pathways are divided into useful time frames (Fig. AP-1 $B$ ). The identified time frame may be minutes, hours, days, weeks, or phases. Conditions requiring emergency treatment (myocardial infarction, head injury, stroke) might be divided into 15-minute intervals, whereas conditions requiring chronic care (chronic pain, spinal cord injury rehabilitation) may be divided into
weekly or monthly intervals. An example of interventions by phases might be seen in postanesthesia care pathways.

\section*{Interventional Categories}

Interventional categories consist of the groups of activities that make up a comprehensive treatment plan and are shown in the left-hand column of the pathway (Fig. AP-1C). Although the order in which they are listed varies, these categories typically include
- Tests
- Treatments and nursing interventions
- Consultations
- Medications
- Diet
- Activity
- Patient and family education
- Discharge planning

Clinical pathway teams begin working with a blank grid and fill in the appropriate interventions. The discipline responsible for the intervention recommends the optimal timing.

\section*{Outcomes}

Defined outcomes provide the focus for patient care activities and unify the various disciplines. All well-written pathways include outcomes identified for each time interval (Fig. AP-1D). They should be realistic, reflect incremental progress, and be achievable by $90 \%$ of the population. Pathway outcomes are similar in content and language to the goals or expected outcomes written into nursing plans of care; physiologic, psychological, social, and educational outcomes are included to capture all elements of complete recovery.

\section*{Variance Record}

The variance record (Fig. AP-2) is an extremely important part of the pathway and represents the mechanism through which improvements in patient care can be accomplished. Variance is defined as any deviation from the pathway. Because all events on the pathway are critical to recovery, deviations can have a negative impact on outcomes. If the pathway calls for a specific test or treatment on day 2 and it is not carried out on day 2 , a variance has occurred. If the patient is to ambulate 3 times a day and ambulates only once, a variance has occurred. The variance and the causes are recorded. Some variance records require a written note and others use code numbers (see Fig. AP-2). Many hospitals have developed or purchased software so that variance can be recorded electronically.

Case managers collect and analyze the variance data to identify trends in patient care and outcomes. For example, a pneumonia pathway may specify that the first dose of antibiotics be given within 3 hours of admission to the hospital (delays in administration of the first dose of an antibiotic are associated with increased morbidity and mortality). The case manager reviews the variance records and determines that only $40 \%$ of pneumonia patients are receiving the antibiotic in that time frame. Assessment of the problem reveals that delays are a result of the length of time it takes for the medication order to be taken off the chart and delivered to the pharmacy, and the length of time it takes for the medication to be delivered. The pneumonia pathway team discusses this problem and determines that the first

\end{figure}
dose of medication should be given in the emergency department since the emergency department stocks these medications. The pathway is revised to reflect this change in care. At the next review, the case manager reports that $92 \%$ of pneumonia patients on the clinical pathway received their antibiotics within 1 to 2 hours of admission. This scenario illustrates how pathway use and variance data collection provide the forum for assessing a problem, determining a plan of action, implementing the plan, and evaluating the effectiveness of the plan.

\section*{THE NURSE'S ROLE}

Nurses have a key role in all aspects of clinical pathway use. Participating in the development of the pathway is the first step. Because they begin and end the chain of staff involved in delivering care, nurses possess a unique perspective in how health care systems work to enhance or impede the delivery of care. In the above example about antibiotic administration, staff nurses were able to identify the problem quickly and suggest solutions. Other staff

from other disciplines, being single links in the chain, cannot supply this global view of the problem.

Nurses are also responsible for initiating the pathway on appropriate patients and ensuring that the various events occur as planned. In some care settings or conditions, case managers who are advanced practice nurses closely follow pathway patients; in others,
staff nurses or community-based nurses function as case managers. In any environment, enhancing and monitoring outcome achievement is a nursing activity. Patients are often given a printed patient pathway for reference. The pathway describes the care plan in simple language and pictures. The nurse discusses the pathway with the patient and focuses on achieving specific outcomes.

Nurses are also responsible for completing required documentation. Practices vary, but well-designed pathways strive for simplicity and should not duplicate documentation required elsewhere. For example, a separate nursing plan of care is not necessary when using a clinical pathway. The outcome section of the pathway usually requires documentation; other areas may need to be checked off or initialed so that other providers can readily see what has been accomplished. Documenting variance and initiating steps to address the variance are equally important as is participating in redesigning care practices to promote the highest quality of cost-effective care.

\section*{PATHWAYS IN PRACTICE}

Several pathways are provided in the following pages to demonstrate the variety of formats the nurse may encounter. Figure AP-3 is a pathway used at Medical College of Ohio for patients with
acute ischemic stroke. The time frame ( 3 to 5 days) is identified at the top of the pathway and in the Expected Outcomes portion. The pathway provides clear expected outcomes as well as a variety of checklists identifying all significant and sequential aspects of patient care. Figure AP-4 is a pathway used at the Wilmer Eye Institute of the Johns Hopkins Hospital for a patient having eye surgery. Figure AP-5 appears to be different from typical pathways, although it contains all the elements of a pathway and also functions as a physician order sheet. (Note: Days 2 and 3 have been omitted.)

Whatever format is used or condition treated, clinical pathways are documents in transition; they will change as research suggests better treatment strategies and as variance data are analyzed. Nurses' participation in these processes is essential for the successful implementation of clinical pathways and, ultimately, the opportunity to improve patient care.
