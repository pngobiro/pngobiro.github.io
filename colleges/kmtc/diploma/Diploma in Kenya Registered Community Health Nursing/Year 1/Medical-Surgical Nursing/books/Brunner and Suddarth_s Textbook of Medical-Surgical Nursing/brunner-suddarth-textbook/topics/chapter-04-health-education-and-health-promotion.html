                        <p>Effective health education lays a solid foundation for individual and community wellness. Teaching is an integral tool that all nurses use to assist patients and families in developing effective health behaviors and in altering lifestyle patterns that predispose people to health risks. Health education is an influential factor directly related to positive patient care outcomes.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The changes in today's health care environment mandate the use of an organized approach to health education so that patients can meet their specific health care needs. Significant factors for the nurse to consider when planning patient education include the availability of health care outside the conventional hospital setting, the employment of diverse health care providers to accomplish care management goals, and the increased use of alternative strategies rather than traditional approaches to care. The careful consideration of these factors can provide patients with the comprehensive information that is essential for making informed decisions about health care. Demands from consumers for comprehensive information about their health issues throughout the life cycle accentuate the need for holistic health education to occur in every patient-nurse encounter.</p>
                        <p>The nurse as a teacher is challenged, not only to provide specific patient and family education, but also to focus on the educational needs of communities. Health education is important to nursing care, because it can determine how well individuals and families are able to perform behaviors conducive to optimal self-care.</p>
                        <p>Teaching, as a function of nursing, is included in all state nurse practice acts and in the Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice of the American Nurses Association (ANA, 1998). Health education is an independent function of nursing practice and is a primary responsibility of the nursing profession. All nursing care is directed toward promoting, maintaining, and restoring health; preventing illness; and assisting people to adapt to the residual effects of illness. Many of these nursing activities are accomplished through health education or patient teaching.</p>
                        <p>Every contact a nurse has with a health care consumer, whether that person is ill or not, should be considered an opportunity for health teaching. Although the person has a right to decide whether or not to learn, the nurse has the responsibility to present information that will motivate the person to recognize the need to learn. Therefore, the nurse must seize opportunities both inside and outside health care settings to facilitate wellness. Educational environments can include homes, hospitals, community health centers, places of business, service organizations, shelters, and consumer action or support groups.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE PURPOSE OF HEALTH EDUCATION</h3>
                        <p>This emphasis on health education stems in part from the public's right to comprehensive health care, which includes up-to-date health information. It also reflects the emergence of an informed public that is asking more significant questions about health and the health care services it receives. Because of the importance American society places on health and the responsibility each of us has to maintain and promote our own health, members of the health care team, specifically nurses, are obligated to make health education consistently available. Without adequate knowledge and training in self-care skills, consumers cannot make effective decisions about their health.</p>
                        <p>People with chronic illnesses are among those most in need of health education. As the life span of our population continues to increase, the number of people with such illnesses will also increase. People with chronic illness need health care information to participate actively in and assume responsibility for much of their own care. Health education can help these individuals to adapt to illness, prevent complications, carry out prescribed therapy, and solve problems when confronted with new situations. It can also prevent crisis situations and reduce the potential for rehospitalization resulting from inadequate information about selfcare. The goal of health education is to teach people to live life to its healthiest—that is, to strive toward achieving their maximum health potential.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the public's right to and desire for health education, patient education is also a strategy for reducing health care costs by preventing illness, avoiding expensive medical treatments, decreasing lengthy hospital stays, and facilitating earlier discharge. For health care agencies, offering community wellness programs is a public relations tool for increasing patient satisfaction and for developing a positive image of the institution. Patient education is also a cost-avoidance strategy for those who believe that positive staff-patient relationships avert malpractice suits.</p>

                        <p>One of the goals of patient education is to encourage people to adhere to their therapeutic regimen. Adherence to a therapeutic regimen usually requires that the person make one or more lifestyle changes to carry out specific activities that promote and maintain health. Common examples of behaviors facilitating health include taking prescribed medications, maintaining a healthy diet, increasing daily activities and exercise, self-monitoring for signs and symptoms of illness, practicing specific hygienic measures, seeking periodic health evaluations, and performing other therapeutic and preventive measures. The fact that many people do not adhere to their prescribed regimens cannot be ignored or minimized; rates of adherence are generally low, especially when the regimens are complex or of long duration.</p>
                        <p>Nonadherence to prescribed therapy has been the subject of many studies. For the most part, the findings have been inconclusive, and no one predominant causative factor has been found. Instead, a wide range of variables appears to influence the degree of adherence:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Demographic variables, such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and level of education</li>
                            <li>Illness variables, such as the severity of the illness and the relief of symptoms afforded by the therapy</li>
                            <li>Therapeutic regimen variables, such as the complexity of the regimen and uncomfortable side effects</li>
                            <li>Psychosocial variables, such as intelligence, availability of significant and supportive people (especially family members), attitudes toward health professionals, acceptance or denial of illness, and religious or cultural beliefs</li>
                            <li>Financial variables, especially the direct and indirect costs associated with a prescribed regimen</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse's success with health education is determined by ongoing assessment of the variables affecting the patient's capacity to adopt specific behaviors, to obtain resources, and to maintain a helpful social environment (Murray & Zentner, 2001). Teaching programs are more likely to succeed if the variables affecting the patient's adherence are identified and considered in the teaching plan.</p>
                        <p>The problem of nonadherence to therapeutic regimens is a substantial one that must be remedied before patients can achieve their maximum self-care capabilities and health potential. Surprisingly, a patient's need for knowledge has not been found to be a sufficient stimulus for acquiring knowledge and thereby enabling complete adherence to a health regimen. Teaching programs directed toward stimulating patient motivation produce varying degrees of adherence. The variables of choice, establishment of mutual goals, and the quality of the patient-provider relationship directly influence the behavioral changes that can result from patient education (Rankin & Stallings, 2000). These factors are directly linked to motivation for learning.</p>
                        <p>Using a learning contract can also be a motivator for learning. Such a contract is based on the assessment of patient needs, health care data, and specific, measurable goals (Redman, 2000). A well-designed learning contract is realistic and positive; it also includes measurable goals, with a specific time frame and reward system for goal achievement. The learning contract is recorded in writing and contains methods for ongoing evaluation.</p>
                        <p>The value of the contract lies in its clarity, specific delineation of what is to be accomplished, and usefulness for evaluating behavioral change. In a typical learning contract, a series of goals is established, beginning with small, easily attainable objectives and progressing to more advanced goals. Frequent, positive reinforcement is provided as the person moves from one goal to the next. An example of incremental goals would be a weight reduction program based on losing 1 to 2 pounds per week rather than one that merely identifies a general goal of losing 30 pounds.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Gerontologic Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Nonadherence to therapeutic regimens is a significant problem for elderly people, leading to increased morbidity and mortality and increased cost of treatment (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000).</p>
                        <p>Many nursing home admissions and hospital admissions are linked to nonadherence.</p>
                        <p>Elderly people frequently have one or more chronic illnesses that are managed with numerous medications and complicated by periodic acute episodes. Elderly people may also have other problems that affect adherence to therapeutic regimens, such as increased sensitivity to medications and their side effects, difficulty in adjusting to change and stress, financial constraints, forgetfulness, inadequate support systems, lifetime habits of self-treatment with over-the-counter medications, visual and hearing impairments, and mobility limitations. To promote adherence among the elderly, time and effort must be taken to assess all variables that may affect health behavior (Fig. 4-1). The nurse must also consider that cognitive deficiencies may be manifested by the elderly person's inability to draw inferences, apply information, or understand the major teaching points (Eliopoulos, 2000). The patient's strengths and limitations must be assessed in order to use existing strengths to compensate for limitations. Above all, health care professionals must work together to provide continuous, coordinated care; otherwise, the efforts of one health care professional may be negated by those of another.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-3" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">The Nature of Teaching and Learning</span></h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Learning can be defined as acquiring knowledge, attitudes, or skills. Teaching is defined as helping another person to learn. These definitions indicate that the teaching-learning process is an active one, requiring the involvement of both teacher and learner in the effort to reach the desired outcome, a change in behavior. The teacher does not simply give knowledge to the learner, but instead serves as a facilitator of learning.</p>
                        <p>In general, there is no definitive theory about how learning occurs and how it is affected by teaching. However, learning can be affected by factors such as readiness to learn, the learning environment, and the teaching techniques employed (Bastable, 1997; Green & Kreuter, 1999).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LEARNING READINESS</h3>
                        <p>One of the most significant factors influencing learning is the person's learning readiness. For adults, readiness is based on culture, personal values, physical and emotional status, and past experiences in learning. The teachable moment for an adult occurs when the content and skills being taught are congruent with the task to be accomplished (Redman, 2000).</p>
                        <p>Culture encompasses values, ideals, and behaviors, and the traditions within each culture provide the framework for solving the issues and concerns of daily living. Because people with different cultural backgrounds hold different values, lifestyles and choices about health care vary. Culture is a major variable influencing readiness to learn because it affects how a person learns and what information can be learned. Sometimes people will not accept health teaching because it conflicts with culturally mediated values. Before beginning health teaching, the nurse must perform an individual cultural assessment instead of relying only on generalized assumptions about a particular culture. A patient's social and cultural patterns must be appropriately incorporated into the teaching-learning interaction. Chart 4-1 describes cultural assessment components to consider when formulating a teaching plan.</p>
                        <p>An individual's values include beliefs about what are desirable and undesirable behaviors. The nurse must know what value the patient places on health and health care. In clinical situations, patients express their values through the actions performed and the level of knowledge pursued (Andrews & Boyle, 1998). When the nurse lacks knowledge about the cultural values of the patient being instructed, misunderstanding, lack of cooperation, and negative health outcomes may occur (Leininger, 1991). Each person's values and behaviors can be either an asset or a deficit to the readiness to learn. Therefore, no amount of health education will be accepted by patients unless their values and beliefs about health and illness are respected (Giger & Davidhizar, 1999).</p>
                        <p>Physical readiness is of vital importance, because until a person is physically capable of learning, attempts at teaching and learning may be both futile and frustrating. For example, someone in acute pain will be unable to focus attention away from the pain long enough to concentrate on learning. Likewise, a person who is short of breath will concentrate on breathing rather than on learning.</p>
                        <p>Emotional readiness also affects the motivation to learn. A person who has not accepted an existing illness or the threat of illness will not be motivated to learn. People who do not accept a therapeutic regimen, or who view it as conflicting with their present lifestyle, may consciously avoid learning about it. Until a person recognizes the need to learn and demonstrates an ability to learn, teaching efforts may be thwarted. However, it is not always wise to wait for a patient to become emotionally ready to learn, because that time might never come unless efforts are made by the nurse to stimulate the individual's motivation.</p>
                        <p>Illness and the threat of illness are usually accompanied by anxiety and stress. The nurse who recognizes such reactions can use simple explanations and instructions to alleviate these anxieties and provide further motivation to learn. Because learning involves changes in behavior, it normally produces mild anxiety, which can often be a useful motivating factor.</p>
                        <p>Emotional readiness can be promoted by creating a warm, accepting, positive atmosphere and by establishing realistic learning goals. When learners achieve success and a feeling of accomplishment, they experience further motivation for participating in additional learning opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Feedback about progress also motivates learning. Such feedback should be presented in the form of positive reinforcement when learners are successful and in the form of constructive suggestions for improvement when they are unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p>Experiential readiness refers to past experiences that influence a person's ability to learn. Previous educational experiences and life experiences in general are significant determinants of an individual's approach to learning. A person who has had little or no formal education may not be able to understand the instructional materials presented. A person who has had difficulty learning in the past may be hesitant to try again. Many behaviors required for reaching maximum health potential demand a rather extensive background of knowledge, physical skills, and attitudes. Without this background on which to build, learning may be very difficult and very slow. For example, someone who does not understand the basics of normal nutrition may not be able to understand the restrictions of a specific diet. A person who does not view the desired learning as personally meaningful may reject teaching efforts. A person who is not future-oriented may be unable to appreciate many aspects of preventive health teaching. Experiential readiness is closely related to emotional readiness because motivation tends to be stimulated by an appreciation for the need to learn and by those learning tasks that are familiar, interesting, and meaningful.</p>
                        <p>Before initiating a teaching-learning program, it is important to assess the learner's physical and emotional readiness to learn, as well as his or her ability to learn what is being taught. This information then becomes the basis for establishing goals that can motivate the person to learn. Involving the learner in the establishment of mutually acceptable goals serves the purpose of encouraging active involvement in the learning process and a willingness to share the responsibility for learning.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT</h3>
                        <p>Although learning can take place without a teacher, most people who are attempting to learn new or altered health behaviors will need the services of a nurse for at least part of the time. The interpersonal interaction between the learner and the nurse who is attempting to meet the individual's learning needs may be formal or informal, depending on the method and techniques of teaching that are found to be most appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Learning can be optimized by minimizing external variables that interfere with the learning process. For example, the room temperature, lighting, noise levels, and other environmental conditions should be appropriate to the learning situation. Also, the time selected for teaching should be suited to the individual's needs. Scheduling a teaching session at a time of day when the patient is fatigued, uncomfortable, or anxious about a pending diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, or when visitors are present, does not provide an environment conducive to learning. However, if family members are to participate in providing care, the sessions should be timed to take place when the family is present so that they can learn any necessary skills or techniques.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TEACHING TECHNIQUES</h3>
                        <p>Teaching techniques and methods enhance learning if they are appropriate to the individual's needs. Numerous techniques are available, including lectures, group teaching, and demonstrations, all of which can be enhanced with specially prepared teaching materials. The lecture or explanation method of teaching is commonly used but should always be accompanied by discussion. Discussion is important because it affords the learner an opportunity to express feelings and concerns, to ask questions, and to receive clarification.</p>
                        <p>Group teaching is appropriate for some people because it allows them not only to receive needed information, but also to feel secure as members of a group. Those with similar problems or learning needs have the opportunity to identify with each other and gain moral support and encouragement. However, not everyone relates or learns well in groups, and some people may not benefit from such experiences. Also, if group teaching is used, assessment and follow-up of each individual are imperative to ensure that each has gained sufficient knowledge and skills.</p>
                        <p>Demonstration and practice are essential ingredients of a teaching program, especially when teaching skills. It is best to demonstrate the skill and then allow the learner ample opportunity for practice. When special equipment is involved, such as syringes for injections, colostomy bags, dialysis equipment, dressings, or suction apparatus, it is important to teach with the same equipment that will be used in the home setting. Learning to perform a skill with one kind of equipment and then having to change to a different kind may lead to confusion, frustration, and mistakes.</p>
                        <p>Teaching aids that are available to enhance learning include books, pamphlets, pictures, films, slides, audio and video tapes, models, programmed instruction, and computer-assisted learning modules. Such teaching aids are invaluable when used appropriately and can save a significant amount of personnel time and related cost. However, all such aids should be reviewed before use to ensure that they meet the individual's learning needs. Human interaction and discussion cannot be replaced by teaching technologies but may be enhanced by them (Nursing Research Profile 4-1).</p>
                        <p>Reinforcement and follow-up are important because learning takes time. Allowing ample time to learn and reinforcing what is learned are important teaching strategies; a single teaching session is rarely adequate. Follow-up sessions are imperative to promote learners' confidence in their abilities and to plan for additional teaching sessions. For hospitalized patients who may not be able to transfer what they have learned in the hospital to the home setting, follow-up after discharge is essential to ensure that they have realized the full benefits of a teaching program.</p>

                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Purpose</h5>
                            <p>There were two main purposes for conducting this study. The first purpose was to evaluate the relevance and usefulness of a brochure designed to facilitate understanding about menopause and other related female health concerns. The second purpose was to describe the information needs of healthy women at menopause.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Study and Sample Design</h5>
                            <p>The study design was descriptive-correlational and utilized a questionnaire designed by the researchers. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed, and 161 women (ages 26 to 69 years) completed the survey. This convenience sample consisted of women who came to a nurse-managed cancer screening center. These women saw the brochure on display at the center; if they asked for a copy, they were also given a questionnaire to complete and return.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Findings</h5>
                            <p>The participants indicated that they were premenopausal (45%), postmenopausal (40%), or uncertain of menopausal status (15%). Ninety-nine percent of the women said that the brochure was very easy to read and understand. Eighty percent found the information very relevant and important, while 31% found it somewhat relevant and important. Eighty-eight percent thought that the material in the brochure would motivate them to talk with their health care provider, and 10% did not know if it would. The topics most likely to be discussed with a health care provider were hormone replacement therapy, bone mineral density testing, risk and prevention of osteoporosis, and management of menopause.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing Implications</h5>
                            <p>Written educational materials are useful strategies for providing health information. Women want and will seek out information regarding menopause, particularly information that helps them to make menopause management decisions. Nurses need to obtain detailed and accurate health histories from women in order to assist them to determine their menopausal status and other individual health needs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TEACHING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</h3>
                        <p>When providing health information to people who are affected by disabilities, the individual needs of the person must be assessed and incorporated into the teaching plan; teaching techniques and the imparting of information may need to be altered to accommodate them. Specific groups of people with physical disabilities, emotional disabilities, hearing and visual impairments, learning disabilities, and developmental disabilities require that the nurse be aware of their health promotion needs and institute new or modified approaches to teach them about their health. Table 4-1 outlines some of the teaching strategies to use when teaching a person with a disability.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">GERONTOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
                        <p>Nurses caring for elderly people must be aware of how the normal changes that occur with aging affect learning abilities and how an elderly person can be assisted to adjust to these changes. Above all, it is important to recognize that just because a person is elderly does not mean that he or she cannot learn. Studies have shown that older adults can learn and remember if information is paced appropriately, is relevant, and is followed by appropriate feedback strategies that apply to all learners (Rankin & Stallings, 2000). Because changes associated with aging vary significantly among elderly people, the nurse should conduct a thorough assessment of each person's level of physiologic and psychological functioning before teaching begins.</p>
                        <p>Changes in cognition with age may include slowed mental functioning; decreased short-term memory, abstract thinking, and concentration; and slowed reaction time. These changes are often accentuated by the health problems that cause the elderly to seek health care in the first place. Effective teaching strategies include a slow-paced presentation of small amounts of material at a time, frequent repetition of information, and the use of reinforcement techniques, such as audiovisual and written materials and repeated practice sessions. Distracting stimuli should be minimized as much as possible in the teaching environment.</p>
                        <p>Sensory changes associated with aging also affect teaching and learning. Teaching strategies to accommodate decreased visual acuity include large-print and easy-to-read materials printed on non-glare paper. Because color discrimination is often impaired, the use of color-coded or highlighted teaching materials may not be effective. To maximize hearing, the teacher must speak distinctly with a normal or lowered pitch, facing the person so that lip reading can occur as needed. Visual cues often help to reinforce verbal teaching.</p>
                        <p>Family members should be involved in teaching sessions when possible. They provide another source for reinforcement of material and can help the learner to recall instructions later. They can also provide valuable assessment information about the person's living situation and related learning needs.</p>
                        <p>When the nurse, the family, and other involved health care professionals work collaboratively to facilitate an elderly person's learning, the chances of success will be maximized. Successful learning for the elderly should result in improved self-care management skills, enhanced self-esteem, and a willingness to learn in future sessions.</p>
