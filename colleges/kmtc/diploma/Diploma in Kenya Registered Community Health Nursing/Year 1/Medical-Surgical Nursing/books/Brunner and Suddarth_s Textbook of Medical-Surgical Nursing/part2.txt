rate are important because the minute ventilation, which is useful in detecting respiratory failure, can be determined from them. Minute ventilation is the volume of air expired per minute. It is equal to the product of the tidal volume and the respiratory rate or frequency. In practice, the minute ventilation is not calculated but is measured directly using a spirometer.

Minute ventilation may be decreased by a variety of conditions that result in hypoventilation. When the minute ventilation falls, alveolar ventilation in the lungs also decreases, and the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ increases. Risk factors for hypoventilation are listed in Chart 21-8.

\section*{Vital Capacity}

Vital capacity is measured by having the patient take in a maximal breath and exhale fully through a spirometer. The normal value depends on the patient's age, gender, body build, and weight.

\section*{NURSING ALERT Most patients can generate a vital capacity twice the volume they normally breathe in and out (tidal volume). If the vital capacity is less than $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$, the patient will be unable to sustain spontaneous ventilation and will require respiratory assistance.}

When the vital capacity is exhaled at a maximal flow rate, the forced vital capacity is measured. Most patients can exhale at least $80 \%$ of their vital capacity in 1 second (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ ) and almost all of it in 3 seconds $\left(\mathrm{FEV}_{3}\right)$. A reduction in $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ suggests abnormal pulmonary air flow. If the patient's $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ and forced vital capacity are proportionately reduced, maximal lung expansion is restricted in some way. If the reduction in $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ greatly exceeds the reduction in forced vital capacity, the patient may have some degree of airway obstruction.

\section*{Inspiratory Force}

Inspiratory force evaluates the effort the patient is making during inspiration. It does not require patient cooperation and thus is
useful in the unconscious patient. The equipment needed for this measurement includes a manometer that measures negative pressure and adapters that are connected to an anesthesia mask or a cuffed endotracheal tube. The manometer is attached and the airway is completely occluded for 10 to 20 seconds while the inspiratory efforts of the patient are registered on the manometer. The normal inspiratory pressure is about $100 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. If the negative pressure registered after 15 seconds of occluding the airway is less than about $25 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, mechanical ventilation is usually required because the patient lacks sufficient muscle strength for deep breathing or effective coughing.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

A wide range of diagnostic studies, described on the following pages, may be performed in patients with respiratory conditions.

\section*{PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS}

Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders. They are performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction. Such tests include measurements of lung volumes, ventilatory
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-001.jpg?height=127&width=135&top_left_y=2077&top_left_x=1121)

\section*{Risk Factors for Hypoventilation}
- Limited neurologic impulses transmitted from the brain to the respiratory muscles, as in spinal cord trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, tumors, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, polio, and drug overdose
- Depressed respiratory centers in the medulla, as with anesthesia and drug overdose
- Limited thoracic movement (kyphoscoliosis), limited lung movement (pleural effusion, pneumothorax), or reduced functional lung tissue (chronic pulmonary diseases, severe pulmonary edema)
function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange (Table 21-7).

PFTs are useful in following the course of a patient with an established respiratory disease and assessing the response to therapy. They are useful as screening tests in potentially hazardous industries, such as coal mining and those that involve exposure to asbestos and other noxious fumes, dusts, or gases. They are useful for screening patients scheduled for thoracic and upper abdominal surgery, and symptomatic patients with a history suggesting high risk.

PFTs generally are performed by a technician using a spirometer that has a volume-collecting device attached to a recorder that demonstrates volume and time simultaneously. A number of tests are carried out because no single measurement provides a complete picture of pulmonary function. The most frequently used PFTs are described in Table 21-7. Technology is available that allows for more complex assessment of pulmonary function. Methods include exercise tidal flow-volume loops, negative expiratory pressure, nitric oxide, and forced oscillation. These assessment methods allow for detailed evaluation of expiratory flow limitations and airway inflammation (Johnson, Beck, Zeballos \& Weisman, 1999).

PFT results are interpreted on the basis of the degree of deviation from normal, taking into consideration the patient's height, weight, age, and gender. Because there is a wide range of normal values, PFTs may not detect early localized changes. The patient with respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sputum production) usually undergoes a complete diagnostic evaluation, even though the results of PFTs are "normal." Trends of results provide information about disease progression as well as the patient's response to therapy.

Patients with respiratory disorders may be taught how to measure their peak flow rate (reflects maximal expiratory flow) at home using a spirometer. This allows them to monitor the progress of therapy, to alter medications and other interventions as needed based on caregiver guidelines, or to notify the health care provider if there is inadequate response to their own interventions. Home care teaching instructions are described in Chapter 24 , which discusses asthma.

\section*{ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS STUDIES}

Measurements of blood pH and of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions are obtained when managing patients with respiratory problems and in adjusting oxygen therapy as needed. The arterial oxygen tension ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) indicates the degree of oxygenation of the blood, and the arterial carbon dioxide tension ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ) indicates the adequacy of alveolar ventilation. Arterial blood gas studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide and the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH . Serial blood gas analysis also is a sensitive indicator of whether the lung has been damaged after chest trauma. Arterial blood gas levels are obtained through an arterial puncture at the radial, brachial, or femoral artery or through an indwelling arterial catheter. Arterial blood gas levels are discussed in detail in Chapter 14.

\section*{PULSE OXIMETRY}

Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin ( $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ ). Although pulse oximetry does not replace arterial blood gas measurement, it is an effective tool to monitor for subtle or sudden changes in oxygen saturation. It is used in all settings where oxygen saturation monitoring is needed, such as the home, clinics, ambulatory surgical settings, and hospitals.

A probe or sensor is attached to the fingertip (Fig. 21-14), forehead, earlobe, or bridge of the nose. The sensor detects changes in oxygen saturation levels by monitoring light signals generated by the oximeter and reflected by blood pulsing through the tissue at the probe. Normal $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ values are $95 \%$ to $100 \%$. Values less than $85 \%$ indicate that the tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, and the patient needs further evaluation. $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ values obtained by pulse oximetry are unreliable in cardiac arrest and shock, when dyes (ie, methylene blue) or vasoconstrictor medications have been used, or when the patient has severe anemia or a high carbon monoxide level.

\begin{table}

EIGURE 21-14 Measuring blood oxygenation with pulse oximetry reduces the need for invasive procedures, such as drawing blood for analysis of oxygen levels. After the pulse oximeter sensor slips easily over a patient's finger, the oxygen saturation level appears on the monitor. The oximeter is portable and ideal for home use.

\section*{CULTURES}

Throat cultures may be performed to identify organisms responsible for pharyngitis. Throat culture may also assist in identifying organisms responsible for infection of the lower respiratory tract. Nasal swabs also may be performed for the same purpose.

\section*{SPUTUM STUDIES}

Sputum is obtained for analysis to identify pathogenic organisms and to determine whether malignant cells are present. It also may be used to assess for hypersensitivity states (in which there is an increase in eosinophils). Periodic sputum examinations may be necessary for patients receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive medications for prolonged periods because these agents are associated with opportunistic infections. In general, sputum cultures are used in diagnosis, for drug sensitivity testing, and to guide treatment.

Expectoration is the usual method for collecting a sputum specimen. The patient is instructed to clear the nose and throat and rinse the mouth to decrease contamination of the sputum. After taking a few deep breaths, the patient coughs (rather than spits), using the diaphragm, and expectorates into a sterile container.

If the sputum cannot be raised spontaneously, the patient often can be induced to cough deeply by breathing an irritating aerosol of supersaturated saline, propylene glycol, or some other agent delivered with an ultrasonic nebulizer. Other methods of collecting sputum specimens include endotracheal aspiration, bronchoscopic removal, bronchial brushing, transtracheal aspiration, and gastric aspiration-usually for tuberculosis organisms (see Chap. 23). Generally, the deepest specimens (those from the base of the lungs) are obtained in the early morning after they have accumulated overnight.

The specimen is delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours by the patient or nurse. Allowing the specimen to stand for several hours in a warm room results in the overgrowth of contaminant organisms and may make it difficult to identify the organisms (especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis). The home care nurse may assist patients who need help obtaining the sample or who cannot deliver the specimen to the laboratory in a timely fashion.

\section*{IMAGING STUDIES}

Imaging studies, including x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and radioisotope diagnostic scans may be part of any diagnostic workup, ranging from a determination of the extent of infection in sinusitis to tumor growth in cancer.

\section*{Chest X-Ray}

Normal pulmonary tissue is radiolucent; therefore, densities produced by fluid, tumors, foreign bodies, and other pathologic conditions can be detected by x-ray examination. A chest x-ray may reveal an extensive pathologic process in the lungs in the absence of symptoms. The routine chest x-ray consists of two views-the posteroanterior projection and the lateral projection. Chest x-rays are usually taken after full inspiration (a deep breath) because the lungs are best visualized when they are well aerated. Also, the diaphragm is at its lowest level and the largest expanse of lung is visible. If taken on expiration, x-ray films may accentuate an otherwise unnoticed pneumothorax or obstruction of a major artery.

\section*{Computed Tomography}

CT is an imaging method in which the lungs are scanned in successive layers by a narrow-beam x-ray. The images produced provide a cross-sectional view of the chest. Whereas a chest x-ray shows major contrast between body densities, such as bones, soft tissues, and air, CT scans can distinguish fine tissue density. CT may be used to define pulmonary nodules and small tumors adjacent to pleural surfaces that are not visible on routine chest x-ray, and to demonstrate mediastinal abnormalities and hilar adenopathy, which are difficult to visualize with other techniques. Contrast agents are useful when evaluating the mediastinum and its contents.

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

MRIs are similar to CT scans except that magnetic fields and radiofrequency signals are used instead of a narrow-beam x-ray. MRIs yield a much more detailed diagnostic image than CT scans. MRI is used to characterize pulmonary nodules, stage bronchogenic carcinoma (assessment of chest wall invasion), and evaluate inflammatory activity in interstitial lung disease, acute pulmonary embolism, and chronic thrombolytic pulmonary hypertension (Kauczor \& Kreitner, 2000).

\section*{Fluoroscopic Studies}

Fluoroscopy is used to assist with invasive procedures, such as a chest needle biopsy or transbronchial biopsy, performed to identify lesions. It also may be used to study the movement of the chest wall, mediastinum, heart, and diaphragm, to detect diaphragm paralysis, and to locate lung masses.

\section*{Pulmonary Angiography}

Pulmonary angiography is most commonly used to investigate thromboembolic disease of the lungs, such as pulmonary emboli and congenital abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular tree. It involves the rapid injection of a radiopaque agent into the vasculature of the lungs for radiographic study of the pulmonary vessels.

It can be performed by injecting the radiopaque agent into a vein in one or both arms (simultaneously) or into the femoral vein, with a needle or catheter. The agent also can be injected into a catheter that has been inserted in the main pulmonary artery or its branches or into the great veins proximal to the pulmonary artery.

\section*{Radioisotope Diagnostic Procedures (Lung Scans)}

Several types of lung scans-ventilation-perfusion scan, gallium scan, and positron emission tomography-are used to detect normal lung functioning, pulmonary vascular supply, and gas exchange.

A ventilation-perfusion lung scan is first performed by injecting a radioactive agent into a peripheral vein and then obtaining a scan of the chest to detect radiation. The isotope particles pass through the right side of the heart and are distributed into the lungs in amounts proportional to the regional blood flow, making it possible to trace and measure blood perfusion through the lung. This procedure is used clinically to measure the integrity of the pulmonary vessels relative to blood flow and to evaluate blood flow abnormalities, as seen in pulmonary emboli. The imaging time is 20 to 40 minutes, during which the patient will lie under the camera with a mask fitted over the nose and mouth. This is followed by the ventilation component of the scan. The patient takes a deep breath of a mixture of oxygen and radioactive gas, which diffuses throughout the lungs. A scan is performed to detect ventilation abnormalities in patients who have regional differences in ventilation. It may be helpful in the diagnosis of bronchitis, asthma, inflammatory fibrosis, pneumonia, emphysema, and lung cancer. Ventilation without perfusion is seen with pulmonary emboli.

A gallium scan is a radioisotope lung scan used to detect inflammatory conditions, abscesses, adhesions, and the presence, location, and size of tumors. It is used to stage bronchogenic cancer and record tumor regression after chemotherapy or radiation. Gallium is injected intravenously, and scans are taken at 6,24, and/or 48 hours to evaluate gallium uptake by the pulmonary tissues.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a radioisotope study with advanced diagnostic capabilities. It is used to evaluate lung nodules for malignancy. PET scans can detect and display metabolic changes in tissue, distinguish normal tissue from tissues that are diseased (such as in cancer), differentiate viable from dead or dying tissue, show regional blood flow, and determine the distribution and fate of medications in the body (Shuster, 1998). PET scans are more accurate in detecting malignancies than CT scans (Coleman, 1999; Graeber, Gupta \& Murray, 1999) and have equivalent accuracy in detecting malignant nodules when compared to invasive procedures such as thoracoscopy (Lowe, Fletcher, Gobar et al., 1998).

\section*{ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES}

\section*{Bronchoscopy}

Bronchoscopy is the direct inspection and examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi through either a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or a rigid bronchoscope. The fiberoptic scope is used more frequently in current practice.

The purposes of diagnostic bronchoscopy are: (1) to examine tissues or collect secretions, (2) to determine the location and extent of the pathologic process and to obtain a tissue sample for diagnosis (by biting or cutting forceps, curettage, or brush biopsy), (3) to determine if a tumor can be resected surgically, and (4) to diagnose bleeding sites (source of hemoptysis).

Therapeutic bronchoscopy is used to: (1) remove foreign bodies from the tracheobronchial tree, (2) remove secretions obstructing the tracheobronchial tree when the patient cannot clear them, (3) treat postoperative atelectasis, and (4) destroy and excise lesions.

The fiberoptic bronchoscope is a thin, flexible bronchoscope that can be directed into the segmental bronchi (Fig. 21-15). Because of its small size, its flexibility, and its excellent optical system, it allows increased visualization of the peripheral airways and is ideal for diagnosing pulmonary lesions. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy allows biopsy of previously inaccessible tumors and can be performed at the bedside. It also can be performed through endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes of patients on ventilators. Cytologic examinations can be performed without surgical intervention.

The rigid bronchoscope is a hollow metal tube with a light at its end. It is used mainly for removing foreign substances, investigating the source of massive hemoptysis, or performing endobronchial surgical procedures. Rigid bronchoscopy is performed in the operating room, not at the bedside.

Possible complications of bronchoscopy include a reaction to the local anesthetic, infection, aspiration, bronchospasm, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen level), pneumothorax, bleeding, and perforation.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Before the procedure, a signed consent form is obtained from the patient, and food and fluids are withheld for 6 hours before the test to reduce the risk of aspiration when the cough reflex is blocked by anesthesia. The nurse explains the procedure to the patient to reduce fear and decrease anxiety and administers preoperative medications (usually atropine and a sedative or opioid) as prescribed to inhibit vagal stimulation (thereby guarding against bradycardia, dysrhythmias, and hypotension), suppress the cough reflex, sedate the patient, and relieve anxiety.

NURSING ALERT Sedation given to patients with respiratory insufficiency may precipitate respiratory arrest.

The patient must remove dentures and other oral prostheses. The examination is usually performed under local anesthesia, but general anesthesia may be needed for rigid bronchoscopy. A topical anesthetic such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) may be sprayed on the pharynx or dropped on the epiglottis and vocal cords and into the trachea to suppress the cough reflex and minimize discomfort. Sedatives or opioids are administered intravenously as prescribed to provide moderate sedation.

After the procedure, it is important that the patient takes nothing by mouth until the cough reflex returns, because the preoperative sedation and local anesthesia impair the protective laryngeal reflex and swallowing for several hours. Once the patient demonstrates a cough reflex, the nurse may offer ice chips and eventually fluids. The nurse assesses for confusion and lethargy in the elderly, which may be due to the large doses of lidocaine given during the procedure. The nurse also monitors the patient's res-

\end{figure}
piratory status and observes for hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Any abnormality is reported promptly. The patient is not discharged from the recovery area until adequate cough reflex and respiratory status are present. The nurse instructs the patient and family caregivers to report any shortness of breath or bleeding immediately.

\section*{Thoracoscopy}

Thoracoscopy is a diagnostic procedure in which the pleural cavity is examined with an endoscope (Fig. 21-16). Small incisions are made into the pleural cavity in an intercostal space; the location of the incision depends on the clinical and diagnostic findings. After any fluid present in the pleural cavity is aspirated, the fiberoptic mediastinoscope is inserted into the pleural cavity, and its surface is inspected through the instrument. After the procedure, a chest tube may be inserted, and the pleural cavity is drained by negative-pressure water-seal drainage.

Thoracoscopy is primarily indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions, pleural disease, and tumor staging. Biopsies of the lesions can be performed under visualization for diagnosis.

Thoracoscopic procedures have expanded with the availability of video monitoring, which permits improved visualization of the lung. Such procedures also have been used with the carbon dioxide laser in the removal of pulmonary blebs and bullae and in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax. Lasers have also

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
been used in the excision of peripheral pulmonary nodules. Although the laser does not replace the need for thoracotomy in the treatment of some lung cancers, its use continues to expand because it is less invasive.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Follow-up care in the health care facility and at home involves monitoring the patient for shortness of breath (which might indicate a pneumothorax), and minor activity restrictions, which vary depending on the intensity of the procedure. If a chest tube is in place, monitoring the chest drainage system and chest tube insertion site is essential (see Chap. 25).

\section*{THORACENTESIS}

A thin layer of pleural fluid normally remains in the pleural space. An accumulation of pleural fluid may occur with some disorders. A sample of this fluid can be obtained by thoracentesis (aspiration of pleural fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes). It is important to position the patient as shown in Chart 21-9.

A needle biopsy of the pleura may be performed at the same time. Studies of pleural fluid include Gram's stain culture and sensitivity, acid-fast staining and culture, differential cell count, cytology, pH , specific gravity, total protein, and lactic dehydrogenase.

\section*{BIOPSY}

Biopsy, the excision of a small amount of tissue, may be performed to permit examination of cells from the pharynx, larynx, and nasal passages. Local, topical, or general anesthesia may be administered, depending on the site and the procedure (see also "Lung Biopsy Procedures" below).

\section*{Pleural Biopsy}

Pleural biopsy is accomplished by needle biopsy of the pleura or by pleuroscopy, a visual exploration through a fiberoptic bronchoscope inserted into the pleural space. Pleural biopsy is performed when there is pleural exudate of undetermined origin and when there is a need to culture or stain the tissue to identify tuberculosis or fungi.

\section*{Lung Biopsy Procedures}

When the chest x-ray findings are inconclusive or show pulmonary density (indicating an infiltrate or lesion), biopsy may be performed to obtain lung tissue for examination to identify the nature of the lesion. There are several nonsurgical lung biopsy techniques that are used because they yield accurate information with low morbidity: (1) transcatheter bronchial brushing, (2) transbronchial lung biopsy, or (3) percutaneous (through-the-skin) needle biopsy.

In transcatheter bronchial brushing, a fiberoptic bronchoscope is introduced into the bronchus under fluoroscopy. A small brush attached to the end of a flexible wire is inserted through the bronchoscope. Under direct visualization, the area under suspicion is brushed back and forth, causing cells to slough off and adhere to the brush. The catheter port of the bronchoscope may be used to irrigate the lung tissue with saline solution to secure material for additional studies. The brush is removed from the bronchoscope and a microscopic slide is made. The brush may be cut off and sent to the pathology laboratory for analysis.

This procedure is useful for cytologic evaluations of lung lesions and for the identification of pathogenic organisms (Nocardia, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis carinii, and other pathogens). It is especially useful in the immunologically compromised patient.

A transbronchial lung biopsy uses biting or cutting forceps introduced by a fiberoptic bronchoscope. A biopsy is indicated when a lung lesion is suspected and the results of routine sputum samples and bronchoscopic washings are negative.

Another method of bronchial brushing involves the introduction of the catheter through the transcricothyroid membrane by needle puncture. After this procedure, the patient is instructed to hold a finger or thumb over the puncture site while coughing to prevent air from leaking into the surrounding tissues.

Percutaneous needle biopsy may be accomplished with a cutting needle or by aspiration with a spinal-type needle that provides a tissue specimen for histologic study. Analgesia may be administered before the procedure. The skin over the biopsy site is cleansed and anesthetized and a small incision is made. The biopsy needle is inserted through the incision into the pleura with the patient holding the breath in mid-expiration. Using fluoroscopic monitoring, the surgeon guides the needle into the periphery of the lesion and obtains a tissue sample from the mass. Possible complications include pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage, and empyema.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

After the procedure, recovery and home care are similar to those for bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy. Nursing care involves monitoring the patient for shortness of breath, bleeding, and infection. In preparation for discharge, the patient and/or family is instructed to report pain, shortness of breath, visible bleeding, or redness of the biopsy site or pus to the health care provider immediately. Patients who have undergone biopsy are often anxious because of the need for the biopsy and the potential findings; the nurse must consider this in providing postbiopsy care and teaching.

\section*{Lymph Node Biopsy}

The scalene lymph nodes are enmeshed in the deep cervical pad of fat overlying the scalenus anterior muscle. They drain the lungs and mediastinum and may show histologic changes from intrathoracic disease. When these nodes are palpable on physical examination, a scalene node biopsy may be performed. A biopsy of these nodes may be performed to detect lymph node spread of pulmonary disease and to establish a diagnosis or prognosis in such diseases as Hodgkin's disease, sarcoidosis, fungal disease, tuberculosis, and carcinoma.

Mediastinoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the mediastinum for exploration and biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes that drain the lungs; this examination does not require a thoracotomy. Biopsy is usually performed through a suprasternal incision. Mediastinoscopy is carried out to detect mediastinal involvement of pulmonary malignancy and to obtain tissue for diagnostic studies of other conditions (eg, sarcoidosis).

An anterior mediastinotomy is thought to provide better exposure and diagnostic possibilities than a mediastinoscopy. An incision is made in the area of the second or third costal cartilage. The mediastinum is explored and biopsies are performed on any lymph nodes found. Chest tube drainage is required after the procedure. Mediastinotomy is particularly valuable to determine whether a pulmonary lesion is resectable.

\section*{Chart 21-9}

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Assisting the Patient Undergoing Thoracentesis}

A thoracentesis (aspiration of fluid or air from the pleural space) is performed on patients with various clinical problems. A diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, thoracentesis may be used for:
- Removal of fluid and air from the pleural cavity
- Aspiration of pleural fluid for analysis
- Pleural biopsy
- Instillation of medication into the pleural space

The responsibilities of the nurse and rationale for the nursing actions are summarized below.

\section*{NURSING ACTIVITIES}
1. Ascertain in advance that a chest x-ray has been ordered and completed and the consent form has been signed.
2. Assess the patient for allergy to the local anesthetic to be used. Administer sedation if prescribed.
3. Inform the patient about the nature of the procedure and:
a. The importance of remaining immobile
b. Pressure sensations to be experienced
c. That minimal discomfort is anticipated after the procedure
4. Position the patient comfortably with adequate supports. If possible, place the patient upright or in one of the following positions:
a. Sitting on the edge of the bed with the feet supported and arms and head on a padded over-the-bed table

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. Posteroanterior and lateral chest x -ray films are used to localize fluid and air in the pleural cavity and to aid in determining the puncture site. When fluid is loculated (isolated in a pocket of pleural fluid), ultrasound scans are performed to help select the best site for needle aspiration.
2. If the patient is allergic to the initially prescribed anesthetic, assessment findings provide an opportunity to use a safer anesthetic.
3. An explanation helps to orient the patient to the procedure, assists the patient to mobilize resources, and provides an opportunity to ask questions and verbalize anxiety.
4. The upright position facilitates the removal of fluid that usually localizes at the base of the chest. A position of comfort helps the patient to relax.

Patient positioned for thoracentesis.
b. Straddling a chair with arms and head resting on the back of the chair
c. Lying on the unaffected side with the bed elevated 30 degrees to 45 degrees if unable to assume a sitting position
5. Support and reassure the patient during the procedure.
a. Prepare the patient for the cold sensation of skin germicide solution and for a pressure sensation from infiltration of local anesthetic agent.
b. Encourage the patient to refrain from coughing.
5. Sudden and unexpected movement, such as coughing, by the patient can traumatize the visceral pleura and lung.

\section*{NURSING ACTIVITIES}
6. Expose the entire chest. The site for aspiration is visualized by chest x-ray film and percussion. If fluid is in the pleural cavity, the thoracentesis site is determined by the chest x-ray, ultrasound scanning, and physical findings, with attention to the site of maximal dullness on percussion.
7. The procedure is performed under aseptic conditions. After the skin is cleansed, the physician uses a small-caliber needle to inject a local anesthetic slowly into the intercostal space.
8. The physician advances the thoracentesis needle with the syringe attached. When the pleural space is reached, suction may be applied with the syringe.
a. A $20-\mathrm{mL}$ syringe with a three-way stopcock is attached to the needle (one end of the adapter is attached to the needle and the other to the tubing leading to a receptacle that receives the fluid being aspirated).
b. If a considerable quantity of fluid is removed, the needle is held in place on the chest wall with a small hemostat.
9. After the needle is withdrawn, pressure is applied over the puncture site and a small, sterile dressing is fixed in place.
10. Advise the patient that he or she will be on bed rest and a chest x-ray will be obtained after thoracentesis.
11. Record the total amount of fluid withdrawn from the procedure and document the nature of the fluid, its color, and its viscosity. If indicated, prepare samples of fluid for laboratory evaluation. A specimen container with formalin may be needed for a pleural biopsy.
12. Monitor the patient at intervals for increasing respiratory rate; asymmetry in respiratory movement; faintness; vertigo; tightness in chest; uncontrollable cough; blood-tinged, frothy mucus; a rapid pulse; and signs of hypoxemia.

\section*{RATIONALE}
6. If air is in the pleural cavity, the thoracentesis site is usually in the second or third intercostal space in the midclavicular line because air rises in the thorax.
7. An intradermal wheal is raised slowly; rapid injection causes pain. The parietal pleura is very sensitive and should be well infiltrated with anesthetic before the physician passes the thoracentesis needle through it.
a. When a large quantity of fluid is withdrawn, a three-way stopcock serves to keep air from entering the pleural cavity.
b. The hemostat steadies the needle on the chest wall. Sudden pleuritic chest pain or shoulder pain may indicate that the needle point is irritating the visceral or the diaphragmatic pleura.
9. Pressure helps to stop bleeding and the dressing protects the site.
10. A chest x -ray verifies that there is no pneumothorax.
11. The fluid may be clear, serous, bloody, purulent, etc.
12. Pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, or pyrogenic infection are complications of a thoracentesis. Pulmonary edema or cardiac distress can occur after a sudden shift in mediastinal contents when large amounts of fluid are aspirated.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Postprocedure care focuses on providing adequate oxygenation, monitoring for bleeding, and providing pain relief. The patient may be discharged a few hours after the chest drainage system is removed. The nurse should instruct the patient and family about monitoring for changes in respiratory status, taking into consideration the impact of anxiety about the potential findings of the biopsy on their ability to remember those instructions.

1. After a transbronchial lung biopsy, your patient reports shortness of breath and appears anxious. He is coughing up blood-tinged sputum. Based on your knowledge of the risks associated with lung biopsy, how would you focus your assessment? What physical and psychological nursing interventions would be appropriate for the patient at this time?
2. Your patient is scheduled for a video-assisted thoracoscopy. Describe the postprocedure nursing care and teaching for a patient undergoing this procedure. Identify the specific assessment parameters that are indicated.
3. Your patient has had a thoracentesis to remove pleural fluid for laboratory analysis and to relieve shortness of breath. What assessment should be carried out following the procedure? What teaching is warranted for the patient and family if she is to be discharged an hour after the procedure? How would you modify your instructions to the patient if she lives alone?
4. Your frail, elderly patient has a diagnosis of long-standing cardiac disease and is scheduled for PFTs prior to surgery to repair her cardiac valves. What specific explanations about the tests would you provide to the patient? What problems would you monitor for following the PFT?

\title{
Management of Patients With Upper Respiratory Tract Disorders
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe nursing management of patients with upper airway disorders.
2. Compare and contrast the upper respiratory tract infections with regard to cause, incidence, clinical manifestations, management, and the significance of preventive health care.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with upper airway infection.
4. Describe nursing management of the patient with epistaxis.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients undergoing laryngectomy.

Many upper airway disorders are relatively minor, and their effects are limited to mild and temporary discomfort and inconvenience for the patient. However, other upper airway disorders are acute, severe, and life-threatening and may require permanent alterations in breathing and speaking. Thus, the nurse must have good assessment skills, an understanding of the wide variety of disorders that may affect the upper airway, and an awareness of the impact of these alterations on patients.

Because many of the disorders are treated outside the hospital or at home by patients themselves, patient teaching is an important aspect of nursing care. When caring for patients with acute, life-threatening disorders, the nurse needs highly developed assessment and clinical management skills, along with a focus on rehabilitation needs.

\section*{Upper Airway Infections}

Upper airway infections are common conditions that affect most people on occasion. Some infections are acute, with symptoms that last several days; others are chronic, with symptoms that last a long time or recur. Patients with these conditions seldom require hospitalization. However, nurses working in community settings or long-term care facilities may encounter patients who have these infections. Thus, it is important for the nurse to recognize the signs and symptoms and to provide appropriate care.

\section*{RHINITIS}

Rhinitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation and irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose. It may be classified as nonallergic or allergic. It is estimated that $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the population of the United States has allergic rhinitis (Middleton et al., 1998). Rhinitis may be an acute or chronic condition.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Nonallergic rhinitis may be caused by a variety of factors, including environmental factors such as changes in temperature or humidity, odors, or foods; infection; age; systemic disease; drugs (cocaine) or prescribed medications; or the presence of a foreign body. Drug-induced rhinitis is associated with use of antihypertensive agents and oral contraceptives and chronic use of nasal decongestants. Rhinitis also may be a manifestation of an allergy (see Chap. 53), in which case it is referred to as allergic rhinitis. Figure 22-1 shows the pathological processes involved in rhinitis and sinusitis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of rhinitis include rhinorrhea (excessive nasal drainage, runny nose), nasal congestion, nasal discharge (purulent with bacterial rhinitis), nasal itchiness, and sneezing. Headache may occur, particularly if sinusitis is also present.

\section*{Medical Management}

The management of rhinitis depends on the cause, which may be identified in the history and physical examination. The examiner asks the patient about recent symptoms as well as possible exposure to allergens in the home, environment, or workplace. If viral rhinitis is the cause, medications are given to relieve the symptoms. In allergic rhinitis, tests may be performed to identify possible allergens. Depending on the severity of the allergy, desensitizing immunizations and corticosteroids may be required (see Chap. 53 for more details). If symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, an antimicrobial agent will be used (see "Medical Management of Sinusitis").

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Medication therapy for allergic and nonallergic rhinitis focuses on symptom relief. Antihistamines are administered for sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. Oral decongestant agents are used for nasal obstruction. In addition, intranasal corticosteroids may be used for severe congestion, and ophthalmic agents are used to relieve irritation, itching, and redness of the eyes.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

The nurse instructs the patient with allergic rhinitis to avoid or reduce exposure to allergens and irritants, such as dusts, molds, animals, fumes, odors, powders, sprays, and tobacco smoke. The patient is instructed about the importance of controlling the environment at home and work. Saline nasal or aerosol sprays may be helpful in soothing mucous membranes, softening crusted secretions, and removing irritants. The nurse instructs the patient in the proper use of and technique for administrating nasal medications. To achieve maximal relief, the patient is instructed to blow the nose before applying any medication into the nasal cavity. In the case of infectious rhinitis, the nurse reviews with the patient hand hygiene technique as a measure to prevent transmission of organisms. The nurse teaches methods to treat symptoms of the viral rhinitis. In the elderly and other high-risk populations, the nurse reviews the value of receiving a vaccination
alaryngeal communication: alternative modes of speaking that do not involve the normal larynx; used by patients whose larynx has been surgically removed

erosions on the tongue, palate, gingival, buccal membranes, or lips)
laryngitis: inflammation of the larynx; may be due to voice abuse, exposure to irritants, or infectious organisms
laryngectomy: removal of all or part of the larynx and surrounding structures
pharyngitis: inflammation of the throat; usually viral or bacterial in origin
rhinitis: inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose; may be infectious, allergic, or inflammatory in origin
rhinorrhea: drainage of a large amount of fluid from the nose
sinusitis: inflammation of the sinuses; may be acute or chronic; may be viral, bacterial, or fungal in origin
submucous resection: surgical procedure to correct nasal obstruction due to deviated septum; also called septoplasty

in the fall in order to achieve immunity prior to the beginning of the "flu season."

\section*{VIRAL RHINITIS (COMMON COLD)}

The term "common cold" often is used when referring to an upper respiratory tract infection that is self-limited and caused by a virus (viral rhinitis). Nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, and general malaise characterize it. Specifically, the term "cold" refers to an afebrile, infectious, acute inflammation
of the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity. More broadly, the term refers to an acute upper respiratory tract infection, whereas terms such as "rhinitis," "pharyngitis," and "laryngitis" distinguish the sites of the symptoms. It can also be used when the causative virus is influenza ("the flu"). Colds are highly contagious because virus is shed for about 2 days before the symptoms appear and during the first part of the symptomatic phase. It is estimated that adults in the United States average two to four colds each year. The common cold is the most common cause of absenteeism from work and school (Mandell, Bennett, \& Dolin, 2000).

The six viruses known to produce the signs and symptoms of the viral rhinitis are rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and adenovirus. Each virus may have multiple strains. For example, there are over 100 strains of rhinovirus, which accounts for $50 \%$ of all colds. The incidence of viral rhinitis follows a specific pattern during the year, depending on the causative agent (Fig. 22-2). Even though viral rhinitis can occur at any time of the year, three waves account for the epidemics in the United States:
- In September, just after the opening of school
- In late January
- Toward the end of April

Immunity after recovery is variable and depends on many factors, including a person's natural host resistance and the specific virus that caused the cold.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Signs and symptoms of viral rhinitis are nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal itchiness, tearing watery eyes, "scratchy" or sore throat, general malaise, low-grade fever, chills,

and often headache and muscle aches. As the illness progresses, cough usually appears. In some people, viral rhinitis exacerbates the herpes simplex, commonly called a cold sore (Chart 22-1).

The symptoms last from 1 to 2 weeks. If there is significant fever or more severe systemic respiratory symptoms, it is no longer viral rhinitis but one of the other acute upper respiratory tract infections. Allergic conditions can also affect the nose, mimicking the symptoms of a cold.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is no specific treatment for the common cold or influenza. Management consists of symptomatic therapy. Some measures include providing adequate fluid intake, encouraging rest, preventing chilling, increasing intake of vitamin C, and using expectorants as needed. Warm salt-water gargles soothe the sore throat and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen relieve the aches, pains, and fever in adults. Antihistamines are used to relieve sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Topical (nasal) decongestant agents may re-

\section*{Colds and Cold Sores (Herpes Simplex Virus)}

The herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) produces the familiar herpes labialis, commonly called a cold sore or fever blister. In the past, this painful blisterlike lip sore was thought to be caused by a cold or a fever. Even now that scientists recognize the origin of herpes labialis, the condition is still referred to as a cold sore. The herpes virus infection remains latent in cells of the lips or nose and is activated by stress, sunlight, and febrile illnesses from the common cold to streptococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis, and even malaria.

The incubation period is 2 to 12 days. The virus is transmitted primarily by direct contact with infected secretions. The virus may also be transmitted from an asymptomatic person. Small vesicles, single or clustered, may erupt on the lips, inside the mouth, including the tongue, soft and hard palate, gums, buccal mucosa, and the pharynx. These soon rupture, forming sore shallow ulcers that increase in number. The gums may bleed and feel painful.

The herpes virus may subside spontaneously in 10 to 14 days. If it does not, acyclovir, an antiviral agent, may be administered orally or topically to minimize the symptoms and the duration or length of the flare-up. Analgesics, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) with codeine or aspirin with codeine, are helpful in relieving pain and discomfort. Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) or dyclonine (Dyclone), and over-the-counter preparations, such as Herpecin-L, may relieve oral pain. Applications of drying lotions or liquids may help to dry the lesions.

lieve nasal congestion; however, if they are overused they may create a rebound congestion that may be worse than the original symptoms. Some research suggests that zinc lozenges may reduce the duration of cold symptoms if taken within the first 24 hours of onset (Prasad, Fitzgerald, \& Bao, 2000). Amantadine (Symmetrel) or rimantadine (Flumadine) may be prescribed prophylactically to decrease the signs and symptoms as well. Antimicrobial agents (antibiotics) should not be used because they do not affect the virus or reduce the incidence of bacterial complications.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

Most viruses can be transmitted in several ways: direct contact with infected secretions; inhalation of large particles that land on a mucosal surface from coughing or sneezing; or inhalation of small particles (aerosol) that may be suspended in the air for up to an hour. It is important to teach the patient how to break the chain of infection. Hand washing remains the most effective measure to prevent transmission of organisms. The nurse teaches methods to treat symptoms of the common cold and preventive measures (Chart 22-2).

\section*{ACUTE SINUSITIS}

The sinuses, mucus-lined cavities filled with air that drain normally into the nose, are involved in a high proportion of upper respiratory tract infections. If their openings into the nasal passages are clear, the infections resolve promptly. However, if their drainage is obstructed by a deviated septum or by hypertrophied turbinates, spurs, or nasal polyps or tumors, sinus infection may persist as a smoldering secondary infection or progress to an acute suppurative process (causing purulent discharge). Sinusitis affects over 14\% of the population and accounts for billions of dollars in direct health care costs (Tierney, McPhee, \& Papadakis, 2001). Some individuals are more prone to sinusitis because of their occupations. For example, continuous exposure to environmental hazards such as paint, sawdust, and chemicals may result in chronic inflammation of the nasal passages.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Acute sinusitis is an infection of the paranasal sinuses. It frequently develops as a result of an upper respiratory infection, such as an unresolved viral or bacterial infection, or an exacerbation of allergic rhinitis. Nasal congestion, caused by inflammation, edema, and transudation of fluid, leads to obstruction of the sinus cavities (see Fig. 22-1). This provides an excellent medium for bacterial growth. Bacterial organisms account for more than $60 \%$ of the cases of acute sinusitis, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (Murray \& Nadel, 2001). Dental infections also have been associated with acute sinusitis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of acute sinusitis may include facial pain or pressure over the affected sinus area, nasal obstruction, fatigue, purulent nasal discharge, fever, headache, ear pain and fullness, dental pain, cough, a decreased sense of smell, sore throat, eyelid edema, or facial congestion or fullness. Acute sinusitis can be difficult to differentiate from an upper respiratory infection or allergic rhinitis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A careful history and physical examination are performed. The head and neck, particularly the nose, ears, teeth, sinuses, pharynx, and chest, are examined. There may be tenderness to palpation over the infected sinus area. The sinuses are percussed using the index finger, tapping lightly to determine if the patient experiences pain. The affected area is also transilluminated; with sinusitis, there is a decrease in the transmission of light (see Chap. 21, Fig. 21-8). Sinus x-rays may be performed to detect sinus opacity, mucosal thickening, bone destruction, and air-fluid levels. Computed tomography scanning of the sinuses is the most effective diagnostic tool. It is also used to rule out other local or systemic disorders, such as tumor, fistula, and allergy.

\section*{Complications}

Acute sinusitis, if left untreated, may lead to severe and occasionally life-threatening complications such as meningitis, brain abscess, ischemic infarction, and osteomyelitis. Other complica-
tions of sinusitis, although uncommon, include severe orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of treatment of acute sinusitis are to treat the infection, shrink the nasal mucosa, and relieve pain. There is a growing concern over the inappropriate use of antibiotics for viral upper respiratory infections; such overuse has resulted in antibiotics being less effective (more resistant) in treating bacterial infections such as sinusitis. As a result, careful consideration is given to the potential pathogen before antimicrobial agents are prescribed.

The antimicrobial agents of choice for a bacterial infection vary in clinical practice. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin (Amoxil), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), and erythromycin. Second-line antibiotics include cephalosporins such as cefuroxime axetil (Ceftin), cefpodoxime (Vantin), and cefprozil (Cefzil) and amoxicillin clavulanate (Augmentin). Newer and more expensive antibiotics with a broader spectrum include
macrolides, azithromycin (Zithromax), and clarithromycin (Biaxin). Quinolones such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro), levofloxacin (Levaquin) (used with severe penicillin allergy), and sparfloxacin (Zagam) have also been used. The course of treatment is usually 10 to 14 days. A recent report found little difference in clinical outcomes between first-line and second-line antibiotics; however, costs were greater when newer second-line antibiotics were used (Piccirillo, Mager, Frisse et al., 2001).

Use of oral and topical decongestant agents may decrease mucosal swelling of nasal polyps, thereby improving drainage of the sinuses. Heated mist and saline irrigation also may be effective for opening blocked passages. Decongestant agents such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed, Dimetapp) have proven effective because of their vasoconstrictive properties. Topical decongestant agents such as oxymetazoline (Afrin) may be used for up to 72 hours. It is important to administer them with the patient's head tilted back to promote maximal dispersion of the medication. Guaifenesin (Robitussin, Anti-Tuss), a mucolytic agent, may also be effective in reducing nasal congestion.

In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a public health advisory concerning phenylpropanolamine, which previously had been commonly used in oral decongestants and diet pills. The voluntary recall of products containing this ingredient was based on a study linking its use with hemorrhagic stroke in women. Men may also be at risk (Kernan et al., 2000).

Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec), and fexofenadine (Allegra) may be used if an allergic component is suspected. If the patient continues to have symptoms after 7 to 10 days, the sinuses may need to be irrigated and hospitalization may be required.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

Patient teaching is an important aspect of nursing care for the patient with acute sinusitis. The nurse instructs the patient about methods to promote drainage such as inhaling steam (steam bath, hot shower, and facial sauna), increasing fluid intake, and applying local heat (hot wet packs). The nurse also informs the patient about the side effects of nasal sprays and about rebound congestion. In the case of rebound congestion, the body's receptors, which have become dependent on the decongestant sprays to keep the nasal passages open, close and congestion results after the spray is discontinued.

The nurse stresses the importance of following the recommended antibiotic regimen, because a consistent blood level of the medication is critical to treat the infection. The nurse teaches the patient the early signs of a sinus infection and recommends preventive measures such as following healthy practices and avoiding contact with people who have upper respiratory infections (see Chart 22-2).

The nurse should explain to the patient that fever, severe headache, and nuchal rigidity are signs of potential complications. If fever persists despite antibiotic therapy, the patient should seek additional care.

\section*{CHRONIC SINUSITIS}

Chronic sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses that persists for more than 3 weeks in an adult and 2 weeks in a child. It is estimated that 32 million people a year develop chronic sinusitis.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A narrowing or obstruction in the ostia of the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid sinuses usually causes chronic sinusitis, preventing adequate drainage to the nasal passages. This combined area is known as the osteomeatal complex. Blockage that persists for greater than 3 weeks in an adult may occur because of infection, allergy, or structural abnormalities. This results in stagnant secretions, an ideal medium for infection. The organisms that cause chronic sinusitis are the same as those implicated in acute sinusitis. Immunocompromised patients, however, are at increased risk for developing fungal sinusitis. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common organism associated with fungal sinusitis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations of chronic sinusitis include impaired mucociliary clearance and ventilation, cough (because the thick discharge constantly drips backward into the nasopharynx), chronic hoarseness, chronic headaches in the periorbital area, and facial pain. These symptoms are generally most pronounced on awakening in the morning. Fatigue and nasal stuffiness are also common. In addition, some patients experience a decrease in smell and taste and a fullness in the ears.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A careful history and diagnostic assessment, including a computed tomography scan of the sinuses or magnetic resonance imaging (if fungal sinusitis is suspected), are performed to rule out other local or systemic disorders, such as tumor, fistula, and allergy. Nasal endoscopy may be indicated to rule out underlying diseases such as tumors and sinus mycetomas (fungus balls). The fungus ball is usually a brown or greenish-black material with the consistency of peanut butter or cottage cheese.

\section*{Complications}

Complications of chronic sinusitis, although uncommon, include severe orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, encephalitis, and ischemic infarction.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical management of chronic sinusitis is almost the same as for acute sinusitis. The antimicrobial agents of choice include amoxicillin clavulanate (Augmentin) or ampicillin (Ampicin). Clarithromycin (Biaxin) and third-generation cephalosporins such as cefuroxime axetil (Ceftin), cefpodoxime (Vantin), and cefprozil (Cefzil) have also been effective. Levofloxacin (Levaquin), a quinolone, may also be used. The course of treatment may be 3 to 4 weeks. Decongestant agents, antihistamines, saline sprays, and heated mist may also provide some symptom relief.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

When standard medical therapy fails, surgery, usually endoscopic, may be indicated to correct structural deformities that obstruct the ostia (openings) of the sinus. Excising and cauterizing nasal polyps, correcting a deviated septum, incising and draining the sinuses, aerating the sinuses, and removing tumors are some of the specific procedures performed. When sinusitis is caused by a fungal infection, surgery is required to excise the fungus ball and necrotic tissue and drain the sinuses. Oral and topical cortico-
steroids are usually prescribed. Antimicrobial agents are administered before and after surgery. Some patients with severe chronic sinusitis obtain relief only by moving to a dry climate.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Because the patient usually performs care measures for sinusitis at home, nursing management consists mainly of patient teaching.

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

The nurse teaches the patient how to promote sinus drainage by increasing the environmental humidity (steam bath, hot shower, and facial sauna), increasing fluid intake, and applying local heat (hot wet packs). The nurse also instructs the patient about the importance of following the medication regimen. Instructions on the early signs of a sinus infection are provided and preventive measures are reviewed.

\section*{ACUTE PHARYNGITIS}

Acute pharyngitis is an inflammation or infection in the throat, usually causing symptoms of a sore throat.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Most cases of acute pharyngitis are caused by viral infection. When group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, the most common bacterial organism, causes acute pharyngitis, the condition is known as strep throat (Bisno, 2001). The body responds by triggering an inflammatory response in the pharynx. This results in pain, fever, vasodilation, edema, and tissue damage, manifested by redness and swelling in the tonsillar pillars, uvula, and soft palate. A creamy exudate may be present in the tonsillar pillars (Fig. 22-3).

Uncomplicated viral infections usually subside promptly, within 3 to 10 days after the onset. However, pharyngitis caused by more virulent bacteria such as group A beta-hemolytic streptococci is a more severe illness. If left untreated, the complications can be severe and life-threatening. Complications include sinusitis, otitis media, peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, and cervical adenitis. In rare cases the infection may lead to bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, rheumatic fever, or nephritis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of acute pharyngitis include a fiery-red pharyngeal membrane and tonsils, lymphoid follicles that are swollen and flecked with white-purple exudate, and enlarged and tender cervical lymph nodes and no cough. Fever, malaise, and sore throat also may be present.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Rapid screening tests for streptococcal antigens such as the latex agglutination (LA) antigen test and solid-phase enzyme immunoassays (ELISA), optical immunoassay (OIA), streptolysin titers, and throat cultures are used to determine the causative organism, after which appropriate therapy is prescribed. Nasal swabs and blood cultures may also be necessary to identify the organism (Corneli, 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Viral pharyngitis is treated with supportive measures since antibiotics will have no effect on the organism. Bacterial pharyngitis is treated with a variety of antimicrobial agents.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

If a bacterial cause is suggested or demonstrated, penicillin is usually the treatment of choice. For patients who are allergic to penicillin or have organisms that are resistant to erythromycin (one fifth of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and most $S$. aureus organisms are resistant to penicillin and erythromycin), cephalosporins and macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) may be used. Antibiotics are administered for at least 10 days to eradicate the infection from the oropharynx.

Severe sore throats can also be relieved by analgesic medications, as prescribed. For example, aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be taken at 3- to 6-hour intervals; if required, acetaminophen with codeine can be taken three or four times daily. Antitussive medication, in the form of codeine, dextromethorphan (Robitussin DM), or hydrocodone bitartrate (Hycodan), may be required to control the persistent and painful cough that often accompanies acute pharyngitis.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

A liquid or soft diet is provided during the acute stage of the disease, depending on the patient's appetite and the degree of discomfort that occurs with swallowing. Occasionally, the throat is so sore that liquids cannot be taken in adequate amounts by mouth. In severe situations, fluids are administered intravenously. Otherwise, the patient is encouraged to drink as much fluid as possible (at least 2 to 3 L per day).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse instructs the patient to stay in bed during the febrile stage of illness and to rest frequently once up and about. Used tissues should be disposed of properly to prevent the spread of infection. It is important to examine the skin once or twice daily for

FIGURE 22-3 Pharyngitis-inflammation without exudate. (A) Redness and vascularity of the pillars and uvula are mild to moderate. (B) Redness is diffuse and intense. Each patient would probably complain of a sore throat. From Bickley, L. S. (2003). Bates' guide to physical examination and history taking (8th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.
possible rash, because acute pharyngitis may precede some other communicable diseases (ie, rubella).

Warm saline gargles or irrigations are used depending on the severity of the lesion and the degree of pain. The benefits of this treatment depend on the degree of heat that is applied. The nurse teaches the patient about the recommended temperature of the solution: high enough to be effective and as warm as the patient can tolerate, usually $105^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $110^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(40.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ to $\left.43.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. Irrigating the throat properly is an effective means of reducing spasm in the pharyngeal muscles and relieving soreness of the throat. Unless the purpose of the procedure and its technique are understood clearly by the patient and family, the results may be less than satisfactory.

An ice collar also can relieve severe sore throats. Mouth care may add greatly to the patient's comfort and prevent the development of fissures (cracking) of the lips and oral inflammation when bacterial infection is present. The nurse instructs the patient to resume activity gradually. A full course of antibiotic therapy is indicated in patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection in view of the possible development of complications such as nephritis and rheumatic fever, which may have their onset 2 or 3 weeks after the pharyngitis has subsided. The nurse instructs the patient and family about the importance of taking the full course of therapy and informs them about the symptoms to watch for that may indicate complications.

\section*{CHRONIC PHARYNGITIS}

Chronic pharyngitis is a persistent inflammation of the pharynx. It is common in adults who work or live in dusty surroundings, use their voice to excess, suffer from chronic cough, and habitually use alcohol and tobacco.

Three types of chronic pharyngitis are recognized:
- Hypertrophic: characterized by general thickening and congestion of the pharyngeal mucous membrane
- Atrophic: probably a late stage of the first type (the membrane is thin, whitish, glistening, and at times wrinkled)
- Chronic granular ("clergyman's sore throat"): characterized by numerous swollen lymph follicles on the pharyngeal wall

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients with chronic pharyngitis complain of a constant sense of irritation or fullness in the throat, mucus that collects in the throat and can be expelled by coughing, and difficulty swallowing.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of chronic pharyngitis is based on relieving symptoms, avoiding exposure to irritants, and correcting any upper respiratory, pulmonary, or cardiac condition that might be responsible for a chronic cough.

Nasal congestion may be relieved by short-term use of nasal sprays or medications containing ephedrine sulfate (Kondon's Nasal) or phenylephrine hydrochloride (Neo-Synephrine). If there is a history of allergy, one of the antihistamine decongestant medications, such as Drixoral or Dimetapp, is taken orally every 4 to 6 hours. Aspirin or acetaminophen is recommended for its antiinflammatory and analgesic properties.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

To prevent the infection from spreading, the nurse instructs the patient to avoid contact with others until the fever subsides. Alcohol, tobacco, second-hand smoke, and exposure to cold are avoided, as are environmental or occupational pollutants if possible. The patient may minimize exposure to pollutants by wearing a disposable facemask. The nurse encourages the patient to drink plenty of fluids. Gargling with warm saline solutions may relieve throat discomfort. Lozenges will keep the throat moistened.

\section*{TONSILLITIS AND ADENOIDITIS}

The tonsils are composed of lymphatic tissue and are situated on each side of the oropharynx. The faucial or palatine tonsils and lingual tonsils are located behind the pillars of fauces and tongue, respectively. They frequently serve as the site of acute infection (tonsillitis). Chronic tonsillitis is less common and may be mistaken for other disorders such as allergy, asthma, and sinusitis.

The adenoids or pharyngeal tonsils consist of lymphatic tissue near the center of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Infection of the adenoids frequently accompanies acute tonsillitis. Group A beta-streptococcus is the most common organism associated with tonsillitis and adenoiditis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms of tonsillitis include sore throat, fever, snoring, and difficulty swallowing. Enlarged adenoids may cause mouthbreathing, earache, draining ears, frequent head colds, bronchitis, foul-smelling breath, voice impairment, and noisy respiration. Unusually enlarged adenoids fill the space behind the posterior nares, making it difficult for the air to travel from the nose to the throat and resulting in a nasal obstruction. Infection can extend to the middle ears by way of the auditory (eustachian) tubes and may result in acute otitis media, which can lead to spontaneous rupture of the eardrums and further extension of the infection into the mastoid cells, causing acute mastoiditis. The infection also may reside in the middle ear as a chronic, low-grade, smoldering process that eventually may cause permanent deafness.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A thorough physical examination is performed and a careful history is obtained to rule out related or systemic conditions. The tonsillar site is cultured to determine the presence of bacterial infection. In adenoiditis, if recurrent episodes of suppurative otitis media result in hearing loss, the patient should be given a comprehensive audiometric examination (see Chap. 59).

\section*{Medical Management}

Tonsillectomy is usually performed for recurrent tonsillitis when medical treatment is unsuccessful and there is severe hypertrophy, asymmetry, or peritonsillar abscess that occludes the pharynx, making swallowing difficult and endangering the airway (particularly during sleep). Enlargement of the tonsils is rarely an indication for their removal; most children normally have large tonsils, which decrease in size with age. Despite the continuing debate over the effectiveness of many tonsillectomies, the operation is still a common surgical procedure in the United States.

Tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy is indicated only if the patient has had any of the following problems: repeated bouts of tonsillitis; hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids that could cause obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea; repeated attacks of purulent otitis media; suspected hearing loss due to serous otitis media that has occurred in association with enlarged tonsils and adenoids; and some other conditions, such as an exacerbation of asthma or rheumatic fever. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is initiated for patients undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. The most common antimicrobial agent is oral penicillin, which is taken for 7 days. Amoxicillin and erythromycin are alternatives.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROVIDING POSTOPERATIVE CARE}

Continuous nursing observation is required in the immediate postoperative and recovery period because of the significant risk of hemorrhage. In the immediate postoperative period, the most comfortable position is prone with the head turned to the side to allow drainage from the mouth and pharynx. The nurse must not remove the oral airway until the patient's gag and swallowing reflexes have returned. The nurse applies an ice collar to the neck, and a basin and tissues are provided for the expectoration of blood and mucus.

Bleeding may be bright red if the patient expectorates blood before swallowing it Often, however, the patient swallows the blood, which immediately becomes brown because of the action of the acidic gastric juice.

Hemorrhage is a potential complication after a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. If the patient vomits large amounts of dark blood or bright-red blood at frequent intervals, or if the pulse rate and temperature rise and the patient is restless, the nurse notifies the surgeon immediately. The nurse should have the following items ready for examination of the surgical site for bleeding: a light, a mirror, gauze, curved hemostats, and a waste basin.

Occasionally, suture or ligation of the bleeding vessel is required. In such cases, the patient is taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. After ligation, continuous nursing observation and postoperative care are required, as in the initial postoperative period.

If there is no bleeding, water and ice chips may be given to the patient as soon as desired. The patient is instructed to refrain from too much talking and coughing because these activities can produce throat pain.

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy usually do not require hospitalization and are performed as outpatient surgery with a short length of stay. Because the patient will be sent home soon after surgery, the patient and family must understand the signs and symptoms of hemorrhage. Hemorrhage usually occurs in the first 12 to 24 hours. The patient is instructed to report frank red bleeding to the physician.

Alkaline mouthwashes and warm saline solutions are useful in coping with the thick mucus and halitosis that may be present after surgery. It is important to explain to the patient that a sore throat, stiff neck, and vomiting may occur in the first 24 hours. A liquid or semiliquid diet is given for several days. Sherbet and gelatin are acceptable foods. The patient should avoid spicy, hot, acidic, or rough foods. Milk and milk products (ice cream and yogurt) may be restricted because they may make removal of mucus more difficult.

The nurse explains to the patient that halitosis and some minor ear pain may occur for the first few days. The nurse instructs the patient to avoid vigorous tooth brushing or gargling, since these actions could cause bleeding.

\section*{PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS}

A peritonsillar abscess is a collection of purulent exudate between the tonsillar capsule and the surrounding tissues, including the soft palate. It is believed to develop after an acute tonsillar infection, which progresses to a local cellulitis and abscess.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The usual symptoms of an infection are present, together with such local symptoms as a raspy voice, odynophagia (a severe sensation of burning, squeezing pain while swallowing), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), otalgia (pain in the ear), and drooling. An examination shows marked swelling of the soft palate, often occluding almost half of the opening from the mouth into the pharynx, unilateral tonsillar hypertrophy, and dehydration.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Aspiration of purulent material (pus) by needle aspiration is required to make the appropriate diagnosis. The aspirated material is sent for culture and Gram's stain. A CTscan is performed when it is not possible to aspirate the abscess.

\section*{Medical Management}

Antibiotics (usually penicillin) are extremely effective in controlling the infection in peritonsillar abscess. If antibiotics are prescribed early in the course of the disease, the abscess may resolve without needing to be incised.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

If treatment is delayed, the abscess is evacuated as soon as possible. The mucous membrane over the swelling is first sprayed with a topical anesthetic and then injected with a local anesthetic. Single or repeated needle aspirations are performed to decompress the abscess. The abscess may also be incised and drained. These procedures are performed best with the patient in the sitting position to make it easier to expectorate the pus and blood that accumulate in the pharynx. Almost immediate relief is experienced. Approximately $30 \%$ of patients with peritonsillar abscess have indications for tonsillectomy (Tierney et al., 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Considerable relief may be obtained by the use of topical anesthetic agents and throat irrigations or the frequent use of mouthwashes or gargles, using saline or alkaline solutions at a temperature of $105^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $110^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(40.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ to $\left.43.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. The nurse instructs the patient to gargle at intervals of 1 or 2 hours for 24 to 36 hours. Liquids that are cool or at room temperature are usually well tolerated.

\section*{LARYNGITIS}

Laryngitis, an inflammation of the larynx, often occurs as a result of voice abuse or exposure to dust, chemicals, smoke, and other pollutants, or as part of an upper respiratory tract infection.

It also may be caused by isolated infection involving only the vocal cords.

The cause of infection is almost always a virus. Bacterial invasion may be secondary. Laryngitis is usually associated with allergic rhinitis or pharyngitis. The onset of infection may be associated with exposure to sudden temperature changes, dietary deficiencies, malnutrition, and an immunosuppressed state. Laryngitis is common in the winter and is easily transmitted.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Signs of acute laryngitis include hoarseness or aphonia (complete loss of voice) and severe cough. Chronic laryngitis is marked by persistent hoarseness. Laryngitis may be a complication of upper respiratory infections.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of acute laryngitis includes resting the voice, avoiding smoking, resting, and inhaling cool steam or an aerosol. If the laryngitis is part of a more extensive respiratory infection due to a bacterial organism or if it is severe, appropriate antibacterial therapy is instituted. The majority of patients recover with conservative treatment; however, laryngitis tends to be more severe in elderly patients and may be complicated by pneumonia.

For chronic laryngitis, the treatment includes resting the voice, eliminating any primary respiratory tract infection, eliminating smoking, and avoiding second-hand smoke. Topical corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone dipropionate (Vanceril) inhalation, may also be used. These preparations have no systemic or long-lasting effects and may reduce local inflammatory reactions.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse instructs the patient to rest the voice and to maintain a well-humidified environment. If laryngeal secretions are present during acute episodes, expectorant agents are suggested, along with a daily fluid intake of 3 L to thin secretions.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH UPPER AIRWAY INFECTION}

\section*{Assessment}

A health history may reveal signs and symptoms of headache, sore throat, pain around the eyes and on either side of the nose, difficulty in swallowing, cough, hoarseness, fever, stuffiness, and generalized discomfort and fatigue. Determining when the symptoms began, what precipitated them, what if anything relieves them, and what aggravates them is part of the assessment. It also is important to determine any history of allergy or the existence of a concomitant illness.

Inspection may reveal swelling, lesions, or asymmetry of the nose as well as bleeding or discharge. The nurse inspects the nasal mucosa for abnormal findings such as increased redness, swelling, or exudate, and nasal polyps, which may develop in chronic rhinitis.

The nurse palpates the frontal and maxillary sinuses for tenderness, which suggests inflammation, and then inspects the throat by having the patient open the mouth wide and take a deep breath. The tonsils and pharynx are inspected for abnormal find-
ings such as redness, asymmetry, or evidence of drainage, ulceration, or enlargement.

Next the nurse palpates the trachea to determine the midline position in the neck and to detect any masses or deformities. The neck lymph nodes also are palpated for associated enlargement and tenderness.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective airway clearance related to excessive mucus production secondary to retained secretions and inflammation
- Acute pain related to upper airway irritation secondary to an infection
- Impaired verbal communication related to physiologic changes and upper airway irritation secondary to infection or swelling
- Deficient fluid volume related to increased fluid loss secondary to diaphoresis associated with a fever
- Deficient knowledge regarding prevention of upper respiratory infections, treatment regimen, surgical procedure, or postoperative care

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Sepsis
- Meningitis
- Peritonsillar abscess
- Otitis media
- Sinusitis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include maintenance of a patent airway, relief of pain, maintenance of effective means of communication, normal hydration, knowledge of how to prevent upper airway infections, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING A PATENT AIRWAY}

An accumulation of secretions can block the airway in patients with an upper airway infection. As a result, changes in the respiratory pattern occur, and the work of breathing required to get beyond the blockage increases. The nurse can implement several measures to loosen thick secretions or to keep the secretions moist so that they can be easily expectorated. Increasing fluid intake helps thin the mucus. Use of room vaporizers or steam inhalation also loosens secretions and reduces inflammation of the mucous membranes. To enhance drainage from the sinuses, the nurse instructs the patient about the best position to assume; this depends on the location of the infection or inflammation. For example, drainage for sinusitis or rhinitis is achieved in the upright position. In some conditions, topical or systemic medications, when prescribed, help to relieve nasal or throat congestion.

\section*{PROMOTING COMFORT}

Upper respiratory tract infections usually produce localized discomfort. In sinusitis, pain may occur in the area of the sinuses or
may produce a general headache. In pharyngitis, laryngitis, or tonsillitis, a sore throat occurs. The nurse encourages the patient to take analgesics, such as acetaminophen with codeine, as prescribed, which will help relieve this discomfort. Other helpful measures include topical anesthetic agents for symptomatic relief of herpes simplex blisters (see Chart 22-1) and sore throats, hot packs to relieve the congestion of sinusitis and promote drainage, and warm water gargles or irrigations to relieve the pain of a sore throat. The nurse encourages rest to relieve the generalized discomfort and fever that accompany many upper airway conditions (especially rhinitis, pharyngitis, and laryngitis). The nurse instructs the patient in general hygiene techniques to prevent the spread of infection. For postoperative care following tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, an ice collar may reduce swelling and decrease bleeding.

\section*{PROMOTING COMMUNICATION}

Upper airway infections may result in hoarseness or loss of speech. The nurse instructs the patient to refrain from speaking as much as possible and to communicate in writing instead, if possible. Additional strain on the vocal cords may delay full return of the voice.

\section*{ENCOURAGING FLUID INTAKE}

In upper airway infections, the work of breathing and the respiratory rate increase as inflammation and secretions develop. This, in turn, may increase insensible fluid loss. Fever further increases the metabolic rate, diaphoresis, and fluid loss.

Sore throat, malaise, and fever may interfere with a patient's willingness to eat. The nurse encourages the patient to drink 2 to 3 L of fluid per day during the acute stage of airway infection, unless contraindicated, to thin secretions and promote drainage. Liquids (hot or cold) may be soothing, depending on the illness.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Prevention of most upper airway infections is difficult because of the many potential causes. However, most upper respiratory infections are transmitted by hand-to-hand contact. Therefore, it is important to teach the patient and family how to minimize the spread of infection to others. Other preventive strategies are identified in Chart 22-2. The nurse advises the patient to avoid exposure to others at risk for serious illness if respiratory infection is transmitted. Those at risk include elderly adults, immunosuppressed people, and those with chronic health problems.

The nurse teaches patients and their families strategies to relieve symptoms of upper respiratory infections. These include increasing the humidity level, encouraging adequate fluid intake, getting adequate rest, using warm water gargles or irrigations and topical anesthetic agents to relieve sore throat, and applying hot packs to relieve congestion. The nurse reinforces the need to complete the treatment regimen, particularly when antibiotics are prescribed.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care is rare. However, it may be indicated for the person whose health status was compromised before the onset of the respiratory infection and for those who cannot manage selfcare without assistance. In such circumstances, the home care nurse assesses the patient's respiratory status and progress in recovery. The nurse may advise elderly patients and those who would be at increased risk from a respiratory infection to consider
an annual influenza vaccine. A follow-up appointment with the primary care provider may be indicated for patients with compromised health status to ensure that the respiratory infection has resolved.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

While major complications of upper respiratory infections are rare, the nurse must be aware of them and assess the patient for them. Because most patients with upper respiratory infections are managed at home, patients and their families must be instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms and to seek immediate medical care if the patient's condition does not improve or if the patient's physical status appears to be worsening.

Sepsis and meningitis may occur in patients with compromised immune status or in those with an overwhelming bacterial infection. The patient with an upper respiratory infection and family members are instructed to seek medical care if the patient's condition fails to improve within several days of the onset of symptoms, if unusual symptoms develop, or if the patient's condition deteriorates. They are instructed about signs and symptoms that require further attention: persistent or high fever, increasing shortness of breath, confusion, and increasing weakness and malaise. The patient with sepsis requires expert care to treat the infection, stabilize vital signs, and prevent or treat septicemia and shock. Deterioration of the patient's condition necessitates intensive care measures (eg, hemodynamic monitoring and administration of vasoactive medications, intravenous fluids, nutritional support, corticosteroids) to monitor the patient's status and to support the patient's vital signs. High doses of antibiotics may be administered to treat the causative organism. The nurse's role is to monitor the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory values, administer needed treatment, alleviate the patient's physical discomfort, and provide explanations, teaching, and emotional support to the patient and family.

Peritonsillar abscess may develop following an acute infection of the tonsils. The patient requires treatment to drain the abscess and receives antibiotics for infection and topical anesthetic agents and throat irrigations to relieve pain and sore throat. Follow-up is necessary to ensure that the abscess resolves; tonsillectomy may be required. The nurse assists the patient in administering throat irrigations and instructs the patient and family about the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment regimen and recommended follow-up appointments.

Otitis media and sinusitis may develop with upper respiratory infection. The patient and family are instructed about the signs and symptoms of otitis media and sinusitis and about the importance of follow-up with the primary health care practitioner to ensure adequate evaluation and treatment of these conditions.

\section*{Obstruction and Trauma of the Upper Respiratory Airway}

\section*{OBSTRUCTION DURING SLEEP}

A variety of respiratory disorders are associated with sleep, the most common being sleep apnea syndrome. Sleep apnea syndrome is defined as cessation of breathing (apnea) during sleep.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Sleep apnea is classified into three types:
- Obstructive-lack of air flow due to pharyngeal occlusion
- Central-simultaneous cessation of both air flow and respiratory movements
- Mixed-a combination of central and obstructive apnea within one apneic episode

The most common type of sleep apnea syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, will be presented here.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

It is estimated that 12 million Americans have sleep apnea (National Institute of Health, 2000). It is more prevalent in men, especially those who are older and overweight. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor. Obstructive sleep apnea is defined as frequent and loud snoring and breathing cessation for 10 seconds or more for five episodes per hour or more, followed by awakening abruptly with a loud snort as the blood oxygen level drops. Patients with sleep apnea may experience anywhere from five apneic episodes per hour to several hundred per night. Other symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headache, sore throat, intellectual deterioration, personality changes, behavioral disorders, enuresis, impotence, obesity, and complaints by the partner that the patient snores loudly or is unusually restless during sleep (Chart 22-3).

The obstruction may be caused by mechanical factors such as a reduced diameter of the upper airway or dynamic changes in the upper airway during sleep. The activity of the tonic dilator muscles of the upper airway is reduced during sleep. These sleeprelated changes may predispose the patient to increased upper airway collapse with the small amounts of negative pressure generated during inspiration. Obstructive sleep apnea may be associated with obesity and with other conditions that reduce pharyngeal muscle tone (eg, neuromuscular disease, sedative/ hypnotic medications, acute ingestion of alcohol). The diagnosis of sleep apnea is made based on clinical features plus polysomnographic findings (sleep test), in which the cardiopulmonary status of the patient is monitored during an episode of sleep.

\section*{Chart 22-3 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Obstructive Sleep Apnea}

Clinical features of obstructive sleep apnea include:
Excessive daytime sleepiness
Frequent nocturnal awakening
Insomnia
Loud snoring
Morning headaches
Intellectual deterioration
Personality changes, irritability
Impotence
Systemic hypertension
Dysrhythmias
Pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
Polycythemia
Enuresis

The effects of obstructive sleep apnea can seriously tax the heart and lungs. Repetitive apneic events result in hypoxia and hypercapnia, which triggers a sympathetic response. As a consequence, patients have a high prevalence of hypertension and an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. In patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, the nocturnal hypoxemia may predispose to dysrhythmias.

\section*{Medical Management}

Patients usually seek medical treatment because their partners express concern or because they experience excessive sleeplessness at inappropriate times or settings (eg, while driving a car). A variety of treatments are used. In mild cases, the patient is advised to avoid alcohol and medications that depress the upper airway and to lose weight. In more severe cases involving hypoxemia with severe $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention (hypercapnia), the treatment includes continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure therapy with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. These treatment methods are described in Chapter 25.

Surgical procedures (eg, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) may be performed to correct the obstruction. As a last resort, a tracheostomy is performed to bypass the obstruction if the potential for respiratory failure or life-threatening dysrhythmias exists. The tracheostomy is unplugged only during sleep. Although this is an effective treatment, it is used in a limited number of patients because of its associated physical disfigurement (Murray \& Nadel, 2001).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Treatment of central sleep apnea also includes medication. Protriptyline (Triptil) given at bedtime is thought to increase the respiratory drive and improve upper airway muscle tone. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) and acetazolamide (Diamox) have been recommended for sleep apnea associated with chronic alveolar hypoventilation, but their benefits have not been well established. Administration of low-flow nasal oxygen at night can help relieve hypoxemia in some patients but has little effect on the frequency or severity of apnea.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with obstructive sleep apnea may not recognize the potential consequences of the disorder. Therefore, the nurse explains the disorder in language that is understandable to the
patient and relates symptoms (daytime sleepiness) to the underlying disorder. The nurse also instructs the patient and family about treatments, including the correct and safe use of oxygen, if prescribed.

\section*{EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)}

A hemorrhage from the nose, referred to as epistaxis, is caused by the rupture of tiny, distended vessels in the mucous membrane of any area of the nose. Rarely does epistaxis originate in the densely vascular tissue over the turbinates. Most commonly, the site is the anterior septum, where three major blood vessels enter the nasal cavity: (1) the anterior ethmoidal artery on the forward part of the roof (Kesselbach's plexus), (2) the sphenopalatine artery in the posterosuperior region, and (3) the internal maxillary branches (the plexus of veins located at the back of the lateral wall under the inferior turbinate).

There are a variety of causes associated with epistaxis, including trauma, infection, inhalation of illicit drugs, cardiovascular diseases, blood dyscrasias, nasal tumors, low humidity, a foreign body in the nose, and a deviated nasal septum. Additionally, vigorous nose blowing and nose picking have been associated with epistaxis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of epistaxis depends on the location of the bleeding site. A nasal speculum or headlight may be used to determine the site of bleeding in the nasal cavity. Most nosebleeds originate from the anterior portion of the nose. Initial treatment may include applying direct pressure. The patient sits upright with the head tilted forward to prevent swallowing and aspiration of blood and is directed to pinch the soft outer portion of the nose against the midline septum for 5 or 10 minutes continuously. If this measure is unsuccessful, additional treatment is indicated. In anterior nosebleeds, the area may be treated with a silver nitrate applicator and Gelfoam, or by electrocautery. Topical vasoconstrictors,

such as adrenaline $(1: 1,000)$, cocaine $(0.5 \%)$, and phenylephrine may be prescribed.

If bleeding is occurring from the posterior regions, cotton pledgets soaked in a vasoconstricting solution may be inserted into the nose to reduce the blood flow and improve the examiner's view of the bleeding site. Alternatively, a cotton tampon may be used to try to stop the bleeding. Suction may be used to remove excess blood and clots from the field of inspection. The search for the bleeding site should shift from the anteroinferior quadrant to the anterosuperior, then to the posterosuperior, and finally to the posteroinferior area. The field is kept clear by using suction and by shifting the cotton tampon. Only about $60 \%$ of the total nasal cavity can actually be seen, however.

When the origin of the bleeding cannot be identified, the nose may be packed with gauze impregnated with petrolatum jelly or antibiotic ointment; a topical anesthetic spray and decongestant agent may be used prior to inserting the gauze packing, or a balloon-inflated catheter may be used (Fig. 22-4). The packing may remain in place for 48 hours or up to 5 or 6 days if necessary to control bleeding. Antibiotics may be prescribed because of the risk of iatrogenic sinusitis and toxic shock syndrome.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse monitors the vital signs, assists in the control of bleeding, and provides tissues and an emesis basin to allow the patient to expectorate any excess blood. It is not uncommon for patients to be anxious in response to a nosebleed. Blood loss on clothing and handkerchiefs can be frightening, and the nasal examination and treatment are uncomfortable. Assuring the patient in a calm, efficient manner that bleeding can be controlled can help reduce anxiety.

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

Discharge teaching includes reviewing ways to prevent epistaxis: avoiding forceful nose blowing, straining, high altitudes, and
nasal trauma (including nose picking). Adequate humidification may prevent drying of the nasal passages. The nurse instructs the patient how to apply direct pressure to the nose with the thumb and the index finger for 15 minutes in the case of a recurrent nosebleed. If recurrent bleeding cannot be stopped, the patient is instructed to seek additional medical attention.

\section*{NASAL OBSTRUCTION}

The passage of air through the nostrils is frequently obstructed by a deviation of the nasal septum, hypertrophy of the turbinate bones, or the pressure of nasal polyps, which are grapelike swellings that arise from the mucous membrane of the sinuses, especially the ethmoids. This obstruction also may lead to a condition of chronic infection of the nose and result in frequent episodes of nasopharyngitis. Frequently, the infection extends to the sinuses of the nose. When sinusitis develops and the drainage from these cavities is obstructed by deformity or swelling within the nose, pain is experienced in the region of the affected sinus.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment of nasal obstruction requires the removal of the obstruction, followed by measures to overcome whatever chronic infection exists. In many patients an underlying allergy requires treatment. At times endoscopic surgery is necessary to drain the nasal sinuses. The specific procedure performed depends on the type of nasal obstruction found. Usually, surgery is performed under local anesthesia.

If a deviation of the septum is the cause of the obstruction, the surgeon makes an incision into the mucous membrane and, after raising it from the bone, removes the deviated bone and cartilage with bone forceps. The mucosa then is allowed to fall back in place and is held there by tight packing. Generally, the packing is soaked in liquid petrolatum so that it can be removed easily in 24 to 36 hours. This operation is called a submucous resection or septoplasty.

Nasal polyps are removed by clipping them at their base with a wire snare. Hypertrophied turbinates may be treated by applying an astringent agent to shrink them.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Most of these procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. If the patient is hospitalized, the nurse elevates the head of the bed to promote drainage and to help alleviate discomfort from edema. Frequent oral hygiene is encouraged to overcome dryness caused by breathing through the mouth.

\section*{FRACTURES OF THE NOSE}

The location of the nose makes it susceptible to injury by a wide variety of causes. In fact, nasal fractures are more common than those of any other bone in the body. Fractures of the nose usually result from a direct assault. As a rule, no serious consequences result, but the deformity that may follow often gives rise to obstruction of the nasal air passages and to facial disfigurement.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of a nasal fracture are bleeding from the nose externally and internally into the pharynx, swelling of the soft tissues adjacent to the nose, and deformity.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The nose is examined internally to rule out the possibility that the injury may be complicated by a fracture of the nasal septum and a submucosal septal hematoma. Because of the swelling and bleeding that occur with a nasal fracture, an accurate diagnosis can be made only after the swelling subsides.

Clear fluid draining from either nostril suggests a fracture of the cribriform plate with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Because cerebrospinal fluid contains glucose, it can readily be differentiated from nasal mucus by means of a dipstick (Dextrostix). Usually, careful inspection or palpation will disclose any deviations of the bone or disruptions of the nasal cartilages. An x-ray may reveal displacement of the fractured bones and may help rule out extension of the fracture into the skull.

\section*{Medical Management}

As a rule, bleeding is controlled with the use of cold compresses. The nose is assessed for symmetry either before swelling has occurred or after it has subsided. The patient is referred to a specialist, usually 3 to 5 days after the injury, to evaluate the need to realign the bones. Nasal fractures are surgically reduced 7 to 10 days after the injury.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse instructs the patient to apply ice packs to the nose for 20 minutes four times each day to decrease swelling. The patient who experiences bleeding from the nose (epistaxis) because of injury or for unexplained reasons is usually frightened and anxious. The packing inserted to stop the bleeding may be uncomfortable and unpleasant, and obstruction of the nasal passages by the packing forces the patient to breathe through the mouth. This in turn causes the oral mucous membranes to become dry. Mouth rinses will help to moisten the mucous membranes and to reduce the odor and taste of dried blood in the oropharynx and nasopharynx.

\section*{LARYNGEAL OBSTRUCTION}

Edema of the larynx is a serious, often fatal, condition. The larynx is a stiff box that will not stretch. It contains a narrow space between the vocal cords (glottis) through which air must pass. Swelling of the laryngeal mucous membranes, therefore, may close off the opening tightly, leading to suffocation. Edema of the glottis occurs rarely in patients with acute laryngitis, occasionally in patients with urticaria, and more frequently in patients with severe inflammations of the throat, as in scarlet fever. It is an occasional cause of death in severe anaphylaxis (angioneurotic edema).

Foreign bodies frequently are aspirated into the pharynx, the larynx, or the trachea and cause a twofold problem. First, they obstruct the air passages and cause difficulty in breathing, which may lead to asphyxia; later, they may be drawn farther down, entering the bronchi or a bronchial branch and causing symptoms of irritation, such as a croupy cough, expectoration of blood or mucus, or labored breathing. The physical signs and x-ray findings confirm the diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

When the obstruction is caused by edema resulting from an allergic reaction, treatment includes administering subcutaneous epinephrine or a corticosteroid (see Chap. 53) and applying an
ice pack to the neck. In emergencies caused by obstruction by a foreign body, when signs of asphyxia are apparent, immediate treatment is necessary. Frequently, if the foreign body has lodged in the pharynx and can be visualized, the finger can dislodge it.

If the obstruction is in the larynx or the trachea, the nurse or other rescuer tries the subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrust maneuver (Chart 22-4). If all efforts are unsuccessful, an immediate tracheotomy is necessary (see Chap. 25 for further discussion).

\section*{Cancer of the Larynx}

Cancer of the larynx is a malignant tumor in the larynx (voice box). It is potentially curable if detected early. It represents less than $1 \%$ of all cancers and occurs about four times more frequently in men than in women, and most commonly in persons 50 to 70 years of age. The incidence of laryngeal cancer continues to decline, but the incidence in women versus men continues to increase. Each year in the United States, approximately 9,000 new cases are discovered, and 3,700 persons with cancer of the larynx will die (American Cancer Society, 2002).

Carcinogens that have been associated with the development of laryngeal cancer include tobacco (smoke, smokeless) and alcohol and their combined effects, exposure to asbestos, mustard gas, wood dust, cement dust, tar products, leather, and metals. Other contributing factors include straining the voice, chronic laryngitis, nutritional deficiencies (riboflavin), and family predisposition (Chart 22-5).

A malignant growth may occur in three different areas of the larynx: the glottic area (vocal cords), supraglottic area (area above the glottis or vocal cords, including epiglottis and false cords), and subglottis (area below the glottis or vocal cords to the cricoid). Two thirds of laryngeal cancers are in the glottic area. Supraglottic cancers account for approximately one third of the cases, subglottic tumors for less than $1 \%$. Glottic tumors seldom spread if found early because of the limited lymph vessels found in the vocal cords (Lenhard, Osteen, \& Gansler, 2001).

\section*{Risk Factors for Laryngeal Cancer}

\section*{Carcinogens}

Tobacco (smoke, smokeless)
Combined effects of alcohol and tobacco
Asbestos
Second-hand smoke
Paint fumes
Wood dust
Cement dust
Chemicals
Tar products
Mustard gas
Leather and metals

\section*{Other Factors}

Straining the voice
Chronic laryngitis
Nutritional deficiencies (riboflavin)
History of alcohol abuse
Familial predisposition
Age (higher incidence after 60 years of age)
Gender (more common in men)
Race (more prevalent in African Americans)
Weakened immune system

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Hoarseness of more than 2 weeks' duration is noted early in the patient with cancer in the glottic area because the tumor impedes the action of the vocal cords during speech. The voice may sound harsh, raspy, and lower in pitch. Affected voice sounds are not early signs of subglottic or supraglottic cancer. The patient may complain of a cough or sore throat that does not go away and pain and burning in the throat, especially when consuming hot liquids or citrus juices. A lump may be felt in the neck. Later symptoms include dysphagia, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), unilateral nasal

\section*{Chelpt \\ 22-4 Performing the Abdominal Thrust Maneuver}

To assist a patient or other person who is choking on a foreign object, the nurse performs the abdominal thrust maneuver (sometimes called the Heimlich maneuver) according to guidelines set forth by the American Heart Association. (Note: Hands crossed at the neck is the universal sign for choking.)
1. Stand behind the person who is choking.
2. Place both arms around the person's waist.
3. Make a fist with one hand with the thumb outside the fist.
4. Place thumb side of fist against the person's abdomen above the navel and below the xiphoid process.
5. Grasp fist with other hand.
6. Quickly and forcefully exert pressure against the person's diaphragm, pressing upward with quick, firm thrusts.
7. Apply thrusts 6 to 10 times until the obstruction is cleared.
8. The pressure from the thrusts should lift the diaphragm, force air into the lungs, and create an artificial cough powerful enough to expel the aspirated object.

obstruction or discharge, persistent hoarseness, persistent ulceration, and foul breath. Cervical lymph adenopathy, unplanned weight loss, a general debilitated state, and pain radiating to the ear may occur with metastasis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

An initial assessment includes a complete history and physical examination of the head and neck. This will include assessment of risk factors, family history, and any underlying medical conditions. An indirect laryngoscopy, using a flexible endoscope, is initially performed in the otolaryngologist's office to visually evaluate the pharynx, larynx, and possible tumor. Mobility of the vocal cords is assessed; if normal movement is limited, the growth may affect muscle, other tissue, and even the airway. The lymph
nodes of the neck and the thyroid gland are palpated to determine spread of the malignancy (Haskell, 2001).

If a tumor of the larynx is suspected on an initial examination, a direct laryngoscopic examination is scheduled. This examination is done under local or general anesthesia and allows evaluation of all areas of the larynx. Samples of the suspicious tissue are obtained for histologic evaluation. The tumor may involve any of the three areas of the larynx and may vary in appearance.

Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for over $90 \%$ of the cases of laryngeal carcinoma (Haskell, 2001). The staging of the tumor serves as a framework for the therapeutic regimen. The TNM classification system, developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (Chart 22-6), is the accepted method used to classify head and neck tumors. The classification of the tumor determines the suggested treatment modalities. Because many of
these lesions are submucosal, biopsy may require that an incision be made using microlaryngeal techniques or using a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ laser to transect the mucosa and reach the tumor.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to assess regional adenopathy and soft tissue and to help stage and determine the extent of a tumor. MRI is also helpful in post-treatment follow-up in order to detect a recurrence. Positron emission tomography (PET scan) may also be used to detect recurrence of a laryngeal tumor after treatment.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of laryngeal cancer depends on the staging of the tumor, which includes the location, size, and histology of the tumor and the presence and extent of cervical lymph node involvement. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis depends on a variety of factors: tumor stage, the patient's gender and age, and pathologic features of the tumor, including the grade and depth of infiltration. The treatment plan also depends on whether this is an initial diagnosis or a recurrence. Small glottic tumors, stage I and II, with no infiltration to the lymph nodes are associated with a $75 \%$ to $95 \%$ survival rate. Patients with stage III and IV or advanced tumors have a $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ survival rate and have a $50 \%$ chance of recurrence and a $30 \%$ chance of metastasis. The highest risk of laryngeal cancer recurrence is in the first 2 to 3 years. Recurrence after 5 years is rare and is usually due to a new primary malignancy (Lenhard et al., 2001) (Chart 22-7).

Surgery and radiation therapy are both effective methods in the early stages of cancer of the larynx. Chemotherapy traditionally has been used for recurrence or metastatic disease. It has also been used more recently in conjunction with either radiation

\section*{Chart 22-7• Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{Situation}

A 68-year-old attorney was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx 8 years ago. He was treated successfully with radiation therapy, resulting in an altered voice quality. Recently, he has complained of shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing. In the past few months, he also has noticed a marked change in his voice and physical condition, which he attributed to "winter colds."

After a complete physical exam and an extensive diagnostic workup and biopsy, it is determined that the cancer has recurred at a new primary site. His health care provider recommends surgery (a total laryngectomy) and chemotherapy as the best options. The patient states that he is not willing to "lose my voice and my livelihood" but instead will "take my chances." He has also expressed concern about his quality of life after surgery. His family has approached you about trying to convince him to have surgery.

\section*{Dilemma}

The patient's right to refuse treatment conflicts with the family's wishes and recommendation from his health care provider.

\section*{Discussion}
1. Is the patient making a decision based upon all pertinent information concerning his health status, treatment, options, risk/benefits, and long-term prognosis?
2. What arguments can be made to support the patient's decision to forego treatment?
3. What arguments can be made to question the patient's decision to forego treatment?
therapy to avoid a total laryngectomy or preoperatively to shrink a tumor before surgery. A complete dental examination is performed to rule out any oral disease. Any dental problems are resolved, if possible, prior to surgery. If surgery is to be performed, a multidisciplinary team evaluates the needs of the patient and family to develop a successful plan of care (Forastiere et al., 2001).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Recent advances in surgical techniques for treating laryngeal cancer may minimize the ensuing cosmetic and functional deficits. Depending on the location and staging of the tumor, four different types of laryngectomy (surgical removal of part or all of the larynx and surrounding structures) are considered:
- Partial laryngectomy
- Supraglottic laryngectomy
- Hemilaryngectomy
- Total laryngectomy

Some microlaryngeal surgery can be performed endoscopically. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ laser can be used for the treatment of many laryngeal tumors, with the exception of large vascular tumors.

Partial Laryngectomy. A partial laryngectomy (laryngofissurethyrotomy) is recommended in the early stages of cancer in the glottic area when only one vocal cord is involved. The surgery is associated with a very high cure rate. It may also be performed for a recurrence when high-dose radiation has failed. A portion of the larynx is removed, along with one vocal cord and the tumor; all other structures remain. The airway remains intact and the patient is expected to have no difficulty swallowing. The voice quality may change or the patient may be hoarse.

Supraglottic Laryngectomy. A supraglottic laryngectomy is indicated in the management of early (stage I) supraglottic and stage II lesions. The hyoid bone, glottis, and false cords are removed. The true vocal cords, cricoid cartilage, and trachea remain intact. During surgery, a radical neck dissection is performed on the involved side. A tracheostomy tube (see Chap. 25) is left in the trachea until the glottic airway is established. It is usually removed after a few days and the stoma is allowed to close. Nutrition is provided through a nasogastric tube until there is healing, followed by a semisolid diet. Postoperatively, the patient may experience some difficulty swallowing for the first 2 weeks. Aspiration is a potential complication since the patient must learn a new method of swallowing (supraglottic swallowing). The chief advantage of this surgical procedure is that it preserves the voice, even though the quality of the voice may change. Speech therapy is required before and after surgery. The major problem is the high risk for recurrence of the cancer; therefore, patients are selected carefully.

Hemilaryngectomy. A hemilaryngectomy is performed when the tumor extends beyond the vocal cord but is less than 1 cm in size and is limited to the subglottic area. It may be used in stage I glottic lesions. In this procedure, the thyroid cartilage of the larynx is split in the midline of the neck and the portion of the vocal cord (one true cord and one false cord) is removed with the tumor. The arytenoid cartilage and half of the thyroid are removed. The patient will have a tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube in place for 10 to 14 days following surgery. The patient is at risk for aspiration postoperatively. Some change may occur in the voice quality. The voice may be rough, raspy, and hoarse and have limited projection. The airway and swallowing remain intact.

Total Laryngectomy. A total laryngectomy is performed in the most advanced stage IV laryngeal cancer, when the tumor extends beyond the vocal cords, or for recurrent or persistent cancer following radiation therapy. In a total laryngectomy, the laryngeal structures are removed, including the hyoid bone, epiglottis, cricoid cartilage, and two or three rings of the trachea. The tongue, pharyngeal walls, and trachea are preserved. A total laryngectomy will result in permanent loss of the voice and a change in the airway.

Many surgeons recommend that a radical neck dissection be performed on the same side as the lesion even if no lymph nodes are palpable because metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes is common. Surgery is more difficult when the lesion involves the midline structures or both vocal cords. With or without neck dissection, a total laryngectomy requires a permanent tracheal stoma because the larynx that provides the protective sphincter is no longer present. The tracheal stoma prevents the aspiration of food and fluid into the lower respiratory tract. The patient will have no voice but will have normal swallowing. A total laryngectomy changes the manner in which airflow is used for breathing and speaking, as depicted in Figure 22-5. Complications that may occur include a salivary leak, wound infection from the development of a pharyngocutaneous fistula, stomal stenosis, and dysphagia secondary to pharyngeal and cervical esophageal stricture.

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

The goal of radiation therapy is to eradicate the cancer and preserve the function of the larynx. The decision to use radiation therapy is based on several factors, including the staging of the tumor (usually used for stage I and stage II tumors as a standard treatment option) and the patient's overall health status, lifestyle (including occupation), and personal preference. Excellent results have been achieved with radiation therapy in patients with earlystage (I and II) glottic tumors when only one vocal cord is involved and there is normal mobility (ie, moves with phonation) and in small supraglottic lesions. One of the benefits of radiation therapy is that patients retain a near-normal voice. A few may develop chondritis (inflammation of the cartilage) or stenosis; a small number may later require laryngectomy.

Radiation therapy may also be used preoperatively to reduce the tumor size. Radiation therapy is combined with surgery in advanced (stages III and IV) laryngeal cancer as adjunctive therapy to surgery or chemotherapy, and as a palliative measure. A variety of clinical trials have combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced laryngeal tumors. Early studies suggest that combined modality therapy may improve the tumor's response to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy may be an alternative to a total laryngectomy.

The complications from radiation therapy are a result of external radiation to the head and neck area, which may also include the parotid gland responsible for mucus production. The symptoms may include acute mucositis, ulceration of the mucous membranes, pain, xerostomia (dry mouth), loss of taste, dysphasia, fatigue, and skin reactions. Later complications may include laryngeal necrosis, edema, and fibrosis.

\section*{SPEECH THERAPY}

The loss or alteration of speech is discussed with the patient and family before surgery, and the speech therapist conducts a preoperative evaluation. During this time, the nurse should inform the patient and family about methods of communication that will be available in the immediate postoperative period. These include

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 22-5 Total laryngectomy produces a change in airflow for breathing and speaking. (A) Normal airflow. (B) Airflow after total laryngectomy.}
\end{figure}
writing, lip speaking, and communication or word boards. A system of communication is established with the patient, family, nurse, and physician and implemented consistently after surgery.

A postoperative communication plan is also developed. The three most common techniques of alaryngeal communication are esophageal speech, artificial larynx (electrolarynx), and tracheoesophageal puncture. Training in these techniques begins once medical clearance is obtained from the physician.

Esophageal Speech. Esophageal speech was the primary method of alaryngeal speech taught to patients until the 1980s. The patient needs the ability to compress air into the esophagus and expel it, setting off a vibration of the pharyngeal esophageal segment. The technique can be taught once the patient begins oral feedings, approximately 1 week after surgery. First, the patient
learns to belch and is reminded to do so an hour after eating. Then the technique is practiced repeatedly. Later, this conscious belching action is transformed into simple explosions of air from the esophagus for speech purposes. Thereafter, the speech therapist works with the patient in an attempt to make speech intelligible and as close to normal as possible. Because it takes a long time to become proficient, the success rate is low.

Electric Larynx. If esophageal speech is not successful, or until the patient masters the technique, an electric larynx may be used for communication. This battery-powered apparatus projects sound into the oral cavity. When the mouth forms words (articulated), the sounds from the electric larynx become audible words. The voice that is produced sounds mechanical, and some words may be difficult to distinguish. The advantage is that the patient is able to communicate with relative ease while working to become proficient at either esophageal or tracheoesophageal puncture speech.

Tracheoesophageal Puncture. The third technique of alaryngeal speech is tracheoesophageal puncture (Fig. 22-6). This technique is the most widely used because the speech associated with it most resembles normal speech (the sound produced is a combination of esophageal speech and voice), and it is easily learned. A valve is placed in the tracheal stoma to divert air into the esophagus and out of the mouth. Once the puncture is surgically created and has healed, a voice prosthesis (Blom-Singer) is fitted over the puncture site. To prevent airway obstruction, the prosthesis is removed and cleaned when mucus builds up. A speech therapist teaches the patient how to produce sounds. Moving the tongue and lips to form the sound into words produces speech as before. Tracheoesophageal speech is successful in $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of patients (DeLisa \& Gans, 1998).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING LARYNGECTOMY}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse assesses the patient for the following symptoms: hoarseness, sore throat, dyspnea, dysphagia, or pain and burning in the throat. The neck is palpated for swelling.

If treatment includes surgery, the nurse must know the nature of the surgery to plan appropriate care. If the patient is expected to have no voice, a preoperative evaluation by the speech therapist is indicated. The patient's ability to hear, see, read, and write is assessed. Visual impairment and functional illiteracy may create additional problems with communication and require creative approaches to ensure that the patient is able to communicate any needs.

In addition, the nurse determines the psychological readiness of the patient and family. The idea of cancer is terrifying to most people. Fear is compounded by the possibility of permanently losing one's voice and, in some cases, of having some degree of disfigurement. The nurse evaluates the patient's and family's coping methods to support them effectively both preoperatively and postoperatively.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge about the surgical procedure and postoperative course
- Anxiety and depression related to the diagnosis of cancer and impending surgery
- Ineffective airway clearance related to excess mucus production secondary to surgical alterations in the airway
- Impaired verbal communication related to anatomic deficit secondary to removal of the larynx and to edema
- Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements, related to inability to ingest food secondary to swallowing difficulties
- Disturbed body image and low self-esteem secondary to major neck surgery, change in the structure and function of the larynx
- Self-care deficit related to pain, weakness, fatigue, musculoskeletal impairment related to surgical procedure and postoperative course

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Respiratory distress (hypoxia, airway obstruction, tracheal edema)
- Hemorrhage
- Infection
- Wound breakdown

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include attainment of an adequate level of knowledge, reduction in anxiety, maintenance of a patent airway (patient is able to handle own secretions), effec-
tive use of alternative means of communication, attainment of optimal levels of nutrition and hydration, improvement in body image and self-esteem, improved self-care management, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{TEACHING THE PATIENT PREOPERATIVELY}

The diagnosis of laryngeal cancer is associated with misconceptions and fears. Many people assume that loss of speech and disfigurement are inevitable with this condition. Once the physician explains the diagnosis to the patient, the nurse clarifies any misconceptions by identifying the location of the larynx, its function, the nature of the surgical procedure, and its effect on speech. Informational materials (written and audiovisual) about the surgery are given to the patient and family for review and reinforcement.

If a complete laryngectomy is planned, the patient should know that the natural voice will be lost, but that special training can provide a means for communicating. However, the ability to sing, laugh, or whistle will be lost. Until this training is initiated, the patient needs to know that communication will be possible by using the call light or special communication board and by writing. The nurse answers questions about the nature of the surgery and reinforces the physician's explanation that the patient will lose the ability to vocalize, but that a rehabilitation program is available. The multidisciplinary team conducts an initial assessment of the patient and family. The team might include the nurse, physician, respiratory therapist, speech therapist, clinical nurse specialist, social worker, dietitian, and home care nurse.

Next, the nurse reviews equipment and treatments for postoperative care with the patient and family, teaches important coughing and deep-breathing exercises, and assists the patient to perform a return demonstration. The nurse clarifies the patient's role in the postoperative and rehabilitation periods.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION}

Because surgery of the larynx is performed most commonly for a malignant tumor, the patient may have many questions: Will the surgeon be able to remove all of the tumor? Is it cancer? Will I die? Will I choke? Will I suffocate? Will I ever speak again? What will I look like? The psychological preparation of the patient is as important as the physical preparation.

Any patient undergoing surgery may have many fears. In laryngeal surgery, these fears may relate to the diagnosis of cancer and may be compounded by the possibility of permanent loss of the voice and disfigurement. The nurse provides the patient and family with opportunities to ask questions, verbalize feelings, and discuss perceptions. It is important to address any questions and misconceptions the patient and family have. During the preoperative or postoperative period, a visit from someone who has had a laryngectomy may reassure the patient that people are available to help and that rehabilitation is possible.

\section*{MAINTAINING A PATENT AIRWAY}

The nurse promotes a patent airway by positioning the patient in the semi-Fowler's or Fowler's position after recovery from anesthesia. Observing the patient for restlessness, labored breathing, apprehension, and increased pulse rate helps the nurse identify possible respiratory or circulatory problems. Medications that depress respiration, particularly opioids, should be used cautiously. As with other surgical patients, the nurse encourages the laryngectomy patient to turn, cough, and take deep breaths. If necessary, suctioning may be performed to remove secretions. The
nurse also encourages and assists the patient with early ambulation to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia.

If a total laryngectomy was performed, a laryngectomy tube will most likely be in place. (In some instances a laryngectomy tube is not used; in others it is used temporarily, and in many it is used permanently.) The laryngectomy tube, which is shorter than a tracheostomy tube but has a larger diameter, is the patient's only airway. The care of this tube is the same as for a tracheostomy tube (see Chap. 25). The nurse cleans the stoma daily with saline solution or another prescribed solution. If a non-oilbased antibiotic ointment is prescribed, the nurse applies it around the stoma and suture line. If crusting appears around the stoma, the nurse removes the crusts with sterile tweezers and applies additional ointment.

Wound drains may be in place to assist in removal of fluid and air from the surgical site. Suction also may be used, but cautiously, to avoid trauma to the surgical site and incision. The nurse observes, measures, and records drainage. When drainage is less than 50 to $60 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day, the physician usually removes the drains.

Frequently, the patient coughs up large amounts of mucus through this opening. Because air passes directly into the trachea without being warmed and moistened by the upper respiratory mucosa, the tracheobronchial tree compensates by secreting excessive amounts of mucus. Therefore, the patient will have frequent coughing episodes and may develop a brassy-sounding, mucus-producing cough. The nurse should reassure the patient that these problems will diminish in time as the tracheobronchial mucosa adapts to the altered physiology.

After the patient coughs, the tracheostomy opening must be wiped clean and clear of mucus. A simple gauze dressing, washcloth, or even paper towel (because of its size and absorbency) worn below the tracheostomy may serve as a barrier to protect the clothing from the copious mucus that the patient may expel initially.

One of the most important factors in decreasing cough, mucus production, and crusting around the stoma is adequate humidification of the environment. Mechanical humidifiers and aerosol generators (nebulizers) increase the humidity and are important for the patient's comfort.

The laryngectomy tube may be removed when the stoma is well healed, within 3 to 6 weeks after surgery. The nurse can teach the patient how to clean and change the tube (see Chap. 25) and remove secretions.

\section*{PROMOTING ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION METHODS}

Understanding the patient's postoperative needs is critical. Alternative means of communication are established and used consistently by all personnel who come in contact with the patient-for example, a call bell or hand bell may be placed within easy reach of the patient. Because a Magic Slate often is used for communication, the nurse should document which hand the patient uses for writing so that the opposite arm can be used for intravenous infusions. (The nurse should discard any old notes used for communication to ensure the patient's privacy.) If the patient cannot write, a picture-word-phrase board or hand signals can be used. Preoperatively, the nurse reviews the system of communication to be used postoperatively with the patient.

Because it is very time-consuming to have to write everything or communicate through gestures, the inability to speak can be very frustrating. The patient may become impatient and angry when not understood. In such cases, other staff members need to be alert to the problem and also recognize that the patient will be unable to use the intercom system.

The return of communication is generally the ultimate goal in the rehabilitation of the laryngectomy patient. The nurse works with the patient, speech therapist, and family to encourage use of alternative communication methods.

\section*{PROMOTING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Postoperatively, the patient may not be permitted to eat or drink for 10 to 14 days. Alternative sources of nutrition and hydration include intravenous fluids, enteral feedings through a nasogastric tube, and parenteral nutrition.

Once the patient is ready to start oral feedings, the nurse explains that thick liquids will be used first because they are easy to swallow. The nurse instructs the patient to avoid sweet foods, which increase salivation and suppress the appetite. Solid foods are introduced as tolerated. The nurse instructs the patient to rinse the mouth with warm water or mouthwash and to brush the teeth frequently.

The patient can expect to have a diminished sense of taste and smell for a period of time after surgery. Inhaled air passes directly into the trachea, bypassing the nose and the olfactory end organs. Because taste and smell are so closely connected, taste sensations are altered. In time, however, the patient usually accommodates to this problem and olfactory sensation adapts, often with return of interest in eating. The nurse observes the patient for any difficulty swallowing, particularly when eating resumes, and reports its occurrence to the physician.

\section*{PROMOTING POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND SELF-ESTEEM}

Disfiguring surgery and an altered communication pattern are a threat to a patient's body image and self-esteem. The reaction of family members and friends is a major concern for the patient. The nurse encourages the patient to express any feelings about the changes brought about by surgery, particularly those related to fear, anger, depression, and isolation.

A positive approach is important when caring for the patient. Promoting self-care activities is part of this approach. It is important for the patient and family to begin participating in selfcare activities as soon as possible. The nurse needs to be a good listener and a support to the family, especially when explaining the tubes, dressings, and drains that are in place postoperatively. Referral to a support group, such as Lost Chord or New Voice clubs (through the International Association of Laryngectomees) and I Can Cope (through the American Cancer Society), may help the patient and family deal with the changes in their lives. Groups such as Lost Chord and New Voice promote and support the rehabilitation of people who have had a laryngectomy by providing an opportunity for exchanging ideas and sharing information.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The immediate potential complications after laryngectomy include respiratory distress and hypoxia, hemorrhage, infection, and wound breakdown.

\section*{Respiratory Distress and Hypoxia}

The nurse monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory distress and hypoxia, particularly restlessness, irritation, agitation, confusion, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and decreased oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry ( $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ ). Any change in the respiratory status requires immediate intervention. Obstruction needs to be ruled out immediately by suctioning and having the patient cough and breathe deeply. Hypoxia and airway obstruction, if not immediately treated, are life-threatening.

The nurse contacts the physician immediately if nursing measures do not improve the patient's respiratory status.

\section*{Hemorrhage}

Bleeding at the surgical site from the drains or with tracheal suctioning may signal the occurrence of hemorrhage. The nurse should notify the surgeon of any active bleeding immediately. Bleeding may occur at a variety of sites, including the surgical site, drains, or trachea. Rupture of the carotid artery is especially dangerous. Should this occur, the nurse should apply direct pressure over the artery, summon assistance, and provide emotional support to the patient until the vessel can be ligated. It is important to monitor vital signs for changes, particularly increased pulse rate, decreased blood pressure, and rapid deep respirations. Cold, clammy, pale skin may indicate active bleeding.

\section*{Infection}

The nurse observes for postoperative infection. Early signs of infection include an increase in temperature and pulse, a change in the type of wound drainage, or increased areas of redness or tenderness at the surgical site. Other signs include purulent drainage, odor, and increased wound drainage. The nurse reports any significant change to the surgeon.

\section*{Wound Breakdown}

Wound breakdown due to infection, poor wound healing, or development of a fistula or as a result of radiation therapy or tumor growth can create a life-threatening emergency. The carotid artery, which is close to the stoma, may rupture from erosion if the wound does not heal properly. The nurse observes the stoma area for wound breakdown, hematoma, and bleeding and reports any significant changes to the surgeon. If wound breakdown occurs, the patient must be monitored carefully and identified as being at high risk for carotid hemorrhage.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse has an important role in the recovery and rehabilitation of the laryngectomy patient. In an effort to facilitate the patient's ability to manage self-care, discharge instruction begins as soon as the patient is able to participate. Nursing care and patient teaching in the hospital, outpatient setting, and rehabilitation or long-term care facility must take into consideration the many emotions, physical changes, and lifestyle changes experienced by the patient. In preparing the patient to go home, the nurse assesses the patient's readiness to learn and the level of knowledge about self-care management. The nurse also reassures the patient and family that most self-care management strategies can be mastered. The patient will need to learn a variety of self-care behaviors, including tracheostomy and stoma care, wound care, and oral hygiene. In addition, the nurse instructs the patient about the need for safe hygiene and recreational activities.

Tracheostomy and Stoma Care. The nurse provides specific instructions to the patient and family about what to expect from the tracheostomy and its management. The nurse teaches the patient and family caregiver to perform suctioning and emergency measures and tracheostomy and stoma care. The nurse stresses the importance of humidification at home and instructs the family to set up a humidification system before the patient returns home. In addition, the nurse cautions the patient and family that air-conditioned air may be too cool or too dry, and thus too irritating, for the patient with a new laryngectomy. (See Chap. 25 for details about tracheostomy care.)

Hygiene and Safety Measures. The nurse instructs the patient and family about safety precautions needed because of the structural changes resulting from the surgery. Special precautions are needed in the shower to prevent water from entering the stoma. Wearing a loose-fitting plastic bib over the tracheostomy or simply holding the hand over the opening is effective. Swimming is not recommended, however, because people with a laryngectomy can drown without getting their face wet. Barbers and beauticians need to be alerted so that hair sprays, loose hair, and powder do not get near the stoma, because they can block or irritate the trachea and possibly cause infection. These self-care points are summarized in Chart 22-8.

Recreation and exercise are important, and all but very strenuous exercise can be enjoyed safely. Avoidance of strenuous exercise and fatigue is important because, when tired, the patient has more difficulty speaking, which can be discouraging. Additional safety points to address include the need for the patient to wear or carry medical identification, such as a bracelet or card, to alert medical personnel to the special requirements for resuscitation should this need arise. When resuscitation is needed, direct mouth-to-stoma ventilation should be performed. For home emergency situations, prerecorded emergency messages for police, the fire department, or other rescue services can be kept near the phone to be used quickly.

The nurse instructs and encourages the patient to perform oral care on a regular basis to prevent halitosis and infection. If the patient is receiving radiation therapy, there will be a decrease in saliva, and synthetic saliva may be required. The nurse instructs the patient to drink water or sugar-free liquids throughout the day and to use a humidifier at home. Brushing the teeth or dentures and rinsing the mouth several times a day will assist in maintaining proper oral hygiene.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care is an important aspect of postoperative care for the patient who has had a laryngectomy and will assist the patient and family in the transition to the home. The home care nurse assesses the patient's general health status and the ability of the patient and family to care for the stoma and tracheostomy.

The nurse assesses the surgical incisions, nutritional and respiratory status, and adequacy of pain management. The nurse assesses not only for signs and symptoms of complications but also for the patient's and family's knowledge of which signs and symptoms to report to the physician. During the home visit, the nurse identifies and addresses other learning needs of the patient and family, such as adaptation to physical, lifestyle, and functional changes. It is important to assess the patient's psychological status as well. The home care nurse reinforces previous teaching and provides reassurance and support to the patient and family as needed.

The nurse encourages the person who has had a laryngectomy to have regular physical examinations and to seek advice concerning any problems related to recovery and rehabilitation. The patient is also reminded to participate in health promotion activities and health screening and about the importance of keeping scheduled appointments with the physician, speech therapist, and other health care providers.

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 36 -year-old teacher is diagnosed with acute sinusitis. She has been self-medicating with over-the-counter medications for the past 2 weeks with no relief. What assessment and treatment should the nurse anticipate? What teaching and management strategies would you discuss with the patient? What is the rationale for your approach?
2. Your 68 -year-old patient is scheduled for total laryngectomy for treatment of laryngeal cancer. What information would you provide to the patient about managing changes in breathing and speech that are expected in the immediate postoperative period and in the long term? What information would you provide to the patient's family?
3. You are making the first home visit to a patient who has just been discharged from the hospital following treatment for pneumonia and a $60-\mathrm{lb}$ weight loss. He had a laryngectomy 8 months ago to treat laryngeal cancer. What will be the focus of your initial home visit? What aspects of assessment and nursing management are key at this point in caring for this patient? How would you assist this patient and his family to plan his care for the next month? Next 6 months?
4. Your patient, age 36 , has been admitted to the emergency department with profuse epistaxis following a car crash. He tells you that he has hemophilia and is HIV-positive as a result of repeated use of clotting factors. What are the initial measures you would use to stop the bleeding? What other options are available if the bleeding does not stop within a reasonable period? How will his HIV status and the diagnosis of hemophilia affect your plan of care for him?

Conditions affecting the lower respiratory tract range from acute problems to long-term chronic disorders. Many of these disorders are serious and often life-threatening. The patient with a lower respiratory tract disorder requires care from nurses with astute assessment and clinical management skills as well as an understanding of the impact of the disorder on the patient's quality of life and ability to carry out usual activities of daily living. Patient and family teaching is an important nursing intervention in the management of all lower respiratory tract disorders.

\section*{Atelectasis}

Atelectasis refers to closure or collapse of alveoli and often is described in relation to x-ray findings and clinical signs and symptoms. Atelectasis may be acute or chronic and may cover a broad range of pathophysiologic changes, from microatelectasis (which is not detectable on chest x-ray) to macroatelectasis with loss of segmental, lobar, or overall lung volume. The most commonly described atelectasis is acute atelectasis, which occurs frequently in the postoperative setting or in people who are immobilized and have a shallow, monotonous breathing pattern. Excess secretions or mucus plugs may also cause obstruction of airflow and result in atelectasis in an area of the lung. Atelectasis also is observed in patients with a chronic airway obstruction that impedes or blocks air flow to an area of the lung (eg, obstructive atelectasis in the patient with lung cancer that is invading or compressing the airways). This type of atelectasis is more insidious and slower in onset.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Atelectasis may occur in the adult as a result of reduced alveolar ventilation or any type of blockage that impedes the passage of air to and from the alveoli that normally receive air through the
bronchi and network of airways. The trapped alveolar air becomes absorbed into the bloodstream, but outside air cannot replace the absorbed air because of the blockage. As a result, the isolated portion of the lung becomes airless and the alveoli collapse. This may occur with altered breathing patterns, retained secretions, pain, alterations in small airway function, prolonged supine positioning, increased abdominal pressure, reduced lung volumes due to musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders, restrictive defects, and specific surgical procedures (eg, upper abdominal, thoracic, or open heart surgery). Persistent low lung volumes, secretions or a mass obstructing or impeding airflow, and compression of lung tissue may all cause collapse or obstruction of the airways, which leads to atelectasis.

The postoperative patient is at high risk for atelectasis because of the numerous respiratory changes that may occur. A monotonous low tidal breathing pattern may cause airway closure and alveolar collapse. This results from the effects of anesthesia or analgesic agents, supine positioning, splinting of the chest wall because of pain, and abdominal distention. The postoperative patient may also have secretion retention, airway obstruction, and an impaired cough reflex or may be reluctant to cough because of pain. Figure 23-1 shows the pathogenic mechanisms and consequences of acute atelectasis in the postoperative patient.

Atelectasis resulting from bronchial obstruction by secretions may occur in patients with impaired cough mechanisms (eg, postoperative, musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders) or in debilitated, bedridden patients. Atelectasis may also result from excessive pressure on the lung tissue, which restricts normal lung expansion on inspiration. Such pressure may be produced by fluid accumulating within the pleural space (pleural effusion), air in the pleural space (pneumothorax), or blood in the pleural space (hemothorax). The pleural space is the area between the parietal and the visceral pleurae. Pressure may also be produced

\section*{acute respiratory distress syndrome}
(ARDS): nonspecific pulmonary response to a variety of pulmonary and nonpulmonary insults to the lung; characterized by interstitial infiltrates, alveolar hemorrhage, atelectasis, decreased compliance, and refractory hypoxemia
asbestosis: diffuse lung fibrosis resulting from exposure to asbestos fibers atelectasis: collapse or airless condition of the alveoli caused by hypoventilation, obstruction to the airways, or compression
central cyanosis: bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membranes due to hemoglobin carrying reduced amounts of oxygen
consolidation: lung tissue that has become more solid in nature due to collapse of alveoli or infectious process (pneumonia)
cor pulmonale: "heart of the lungs"; enlargement of the right ventricle from hypertrophy or dilation or as a secondary response to disorders that affect the lungs
empyema: accumulation of purulent material in the pleural space
fine-needle aspiration: insertion of a needle through the chest wall to obtain cells of a mass or tumor; usually performed under fluoroscopy or chest CT guidance
hemoptysis: the coughing up of blood from the lower respiratory tract
hemothorax: partial or complete collapse of the lung due to blood accumulating in the pleural space; may occur after surgery or trauma
induration: an abnormally hard lesion or reaction, as in a positive tuberculin skin test
nosocomial: pertaining to or originating from a hospitalization; not present at the time of hospital admission
open lung biopsy: biopsy of lung tissue performed through a limited thoracotomy incision
orthopnea: shortness of breath when reclining or in the supine position
pleural effusion: abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space
pleural friction rub: localized grating or creaking sound caused by the rubbing together of inflamed parietal and visceral pleurae
pleural space: the area between the parietal and visceral pleurae; a potential space
pneumothorax: partial or complete collapse of the lung due to positive pressure in the pleural space
pulmonary edema: increase in the amount of extravascular fluid in the lung
pulmonary embolism: obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature with an embolus; embolus may be due to blood clot, air bubbles, or fat droplets
purulent: consisting of, containing, or discharging pus
restrictive lung disease: disease of the lung that causes a decrease in lung volumes
tension pneumothorax: pneumothorax characterized by increasing positive pressure in the pleural space with each breath; this is an emergency situation and the positive pressure needs to be decompressed or released immediately
thoracentesis: insertion of a needle into the pleural space to remove fluid that has accumulated and decrease pressure on the lung tissue; may also be used diagnostically to identify potential causes of a pleural effusion
transbronchial: through the bronchial wall, as in a transbronchial lung biopsy
ventilation-perfusion ratio: the ratio between ventilation and perfusion in the lung; matching of ventilation to perfusion optimizes gas exchange

by a pericardium distended with fluid (pericardial effusion), tumor growth within the thorax, or an elevated diaphragm.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The development of atelectasis usually is insidious. Signs and symptoms include cough, sputum production, and low-grade fever. Fever is universally cited as a clinical sign of atelectasis, but there are few data to support this. Most likely the fever that accompanies atelectasis is due to infection or inflammation distal to the obstructed airway.

In acute atelectasis involving a large amount of lung tissue (lobar atelectasis), marked respiratory distress may be observed. In addition to the above signs and symptoms, dyspnea, tachycar-
dia, tachypnea, pleural pain, and central cyanosis (a bluish skin hue that is a late sign of hypoxemia) may be anticipated. The patient characteristically has difficulty breathing in the supine position and is anxious. Signs and symptoms of chronic atelectasis are similar to those of acute atelectasis. Because the alveolar collapse is chronic, infection may occur distal to the obstruction. Thus, the signs and symptoms of a pulmonary infection also may be present.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Decreased breath sounds and crackles are heard over the affected area. In addition, chest x-ray findings may reveal patchy infiltrates or consolidated areas. In the patient who is confined to bed,
atelectasis is usually diagnosed by chest x-ray or identified by physical assessment in the dependent, posterior, basilar areas of the lungs. Depending on the degree of hypoxemia, pulse oximetry ( $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ ) may demonstrate a low saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (less than $90 \%$ ) or a lower-than-normal partial pressure of arterial oxygen ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ).

\section*{Prevention}

Nursing measures to prevent atelectasis include frequent turning, early mobilization, and strategies to expand the lungs and to manage secretions. Deep-breathing maneuvers (at least every 2 hours) assist in preventing and treating atelectasis. The performance of these maneuvers requires a patient who is alert and cooperative. Patient education and reinforcement are key to the success of these interventions. The use of incentive spirometry or voluntary deep breathing enhances lung expansion, decreases the potential for airway closure, and may generate a cough. Secretion management techniques may include directed cough, suctioning, aerosol nebulizer treatments followed by chest physical therapy (postural drainage and chest percussion), or bronchoscopy. In some settings, a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is used to dispense a bronchodilator rather than an aerosol nebulizer treatment. Chart 23-1 summarizes measures to prevent atelectasis.

\section*{Management}

The goal in treating the patient with atelectasis is to improve ventilation and remove secretions. The strategies to prevent atelectasis, which include frequent turning, early ambulation, lung volume expansion maneuvers (eg, deep-breathing exercises, incentive spirometry), and coughing also serve as the first-line measures to minimize or treat atelectasis by improving ventilation. In patients who do not respond to first-line measures or who cannot perform deep-breathing exercises, other treatments such as positive expiratory pressure or PEP therapy (a simple mask and oneway valve system that provides varying amounts of expiratory resistance [usually 5 to $15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ]), continuous or intermittent positive pressure-breathing (IPPB), or bronchoscopy may be used. Although IPPB may be used in some settings, few data support its use in the postoperative setting (Duffy \& Farley, 1993). Before initiating more complex, costly, and labor-intensive therapies, the nurse should ask several questions:
- Has the patient been given an adequate trial of deepbreathing exercises?

\section*{Cheert \\ 23-1 \\ \section*{Preventing Atelectasis}}
- Change patient's position frequently, especially from supine to upright position, to promote ventilation and prevent secretions from accumulating.
- Encourage early mobilization from bed to chair followed by early ambulation.
- Encourage appropriate deep breathing and coughing to mobilize secretions and prevent them from accumulating.
- Teach/reinforce appropriate technique for incentive spirometry.
- Administer prescribed opioids and sedatives judiciously to prevent respiratory depression.
- Perform postural drainage and chest percussion, if indicated.
- Institute suctioning to remove tracheobronchial secretions, if indicated.
- Has the patient received adequate education, supervision, and coaching to carry out the deep-breathing exercises?
- Have other factors been evaluated that may impair ventilation or prohibit a good patient effort (eg, lack of turning, mobilization; excessive pain; excessive sedation)?
If the cause of atelectasis is bronchial obstruction from secretions, the secretions must be removed by coughing or suctioning to permit air to re-enter that portion of the lung. Chest physical therapy (chest percussion and postural drainage) may also be used to mobilize secretions. Nebulizer treatments with a bronchodilator medication or sodium bicarbonate may be used to assist the patient in the expectoration of secretions. If respiratory care measures fail to remove the obstruction, a bronchoscopy is performed. Severe or massive atelectasis may lead to acute respiratory failure, especially in a patient with underlying lung disease. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Prompt treatment reduces the risk for acute respiratory failure or pneumonia.

If atelectasis has resulted from compression of lung tissue, the goal is to decrease the compression. With a large pleural effusion that is compressing lung tissue and causing alveolar collapse, treatment may include thoracentesis, removal of the fluid by needle aspiration, or insertion of a chest tube. The measures to increase lung expansion described above also are used.

Management of chronic atelectasis focuses on removing the cause of the obstruction of the airways or the compression of the lung tissue. For example, bronchoscopy may be used to open an airway obstructed by lung cancer or a nonmalignant lesion, and the procedure may involve cryotherapy or laser therapy. The goal is to reopen the airways and provide ventilation to the collapsed area. In some cases, surgical management may be indicated.

\section*{Respiratory Infections}

\section*{ACUTE TRACHEOBRONCHITIS}

Acute tracheobronchitis, an acute inflammation of the mucous membranes of the trachea and the bronchial tree, often follows infection of the upper respiratory tract. A patient with a viral infection has decreased resistance and can readily develop a secondary bacterial infection. Thus, adequate treatment of upper respiratory tract infection is one of the major factors in the prevention of acute bronchitis. Aside from infection, inhalation of physical and chemical irritants, gases, and other air contaminants can also cause acute bronchial irritation.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In acute tracheobronchitis, the inflamed mucosa of the bronchi produces mucopurulent sputum, often in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In addition, a fungal infection (eg, Aspergillus tracheobronchitis) may also cause tracheobronchitis. A sputum culture is essential to identify the specific causative organism.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Initially, the patient has a dry, irritating cough and expectorates a scanty amount of mucoid sputum. The patient complains of sternal soreness from coughing and has fever or chills and night sweats, headache, and general malaise. As the infection progresses, the patient may be short of breath, have noisy inspiration and expiration (inspiratory stridor and expiratory wheeze), and
produce purulent (pus-filled) sputum. With severe tracheobronchitis, blood-streaked secretions may be expectorated as a result of the irritation of the mucosa of the airways.

\section*{Medical Management}

Antibiotic treatment may be indicated depending on the symptoms, sputum purulence, and results of the sputum culture. Antihistamines are usually not prescribed because they may cause excessive drying and make secretions more difficult to expectorate. Expectorants may be prescribed, although their efficacy is questionable. Fluid intake is increased to thin the viscous and tenacious secretions. Copious, purulent secretions that cannot be cleared by coughing place the patient at risk for increasing airway obstruction and the development of a more severe lower respiratory tract infection, such as pneumonia. Suctioning and bronchoscopy may be needed to remove secretions. Rarely, endotracheal intubation may be required in cases of acute tracheobronchitis leading to acute respiratory failure. This may be necessary for patients who are severely debilitated or who have coexisting diseases that also impair the respiratory system.

In most cases, treatment of tracheobronchitis is largely symptomatic. The patient is advised to rest. Increasing the vapor pressure (moisture content) in the air will reduce irritation. Cool vapor therapy or steam inhalations may help relieve laryngeal and tracheal irritation. Moist heat to the chest may relieve the soreness and pain. Mild analgesics or antipyretics may be indicated.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Acute tracheobronchitis is frequently treated in the home setting. A primary nursing function is to encourage bronchial hygiene, such as increasing fluid intake and directed coughing to remove secretions. The nurse should encourage and assist the patient to sit up frequently to cough effectively and to prevent retention of mucopurulent sputum. If the patient is treated with antibiotics for an underlying infection, it is important to emphasize the need to complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed. Fatigue is a consequence of tracheobronchitis; therefore, the nurse must caution the patient against overexertion, which can induce a relapse or exacerbation of the infection.

\section*{PNEUMONIA}

Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma that is caused by a microbial agent. "Pneumonitis" is a more general term that describes an inflammatory process in the lung tissue that may predispose a patient to or place a patient at risk for microbial invasion. Pneumonia is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. It is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States for all ages and both genders, resulting in almost 70,000 deaths per year. In persons 65 years of age and older, it is the fifth leading cause of death (National Center for Health Statistics, 2000; Minino \& Smith, 2001). It is treated extensively on both an inpatient and outpatient basis.

Bacteria commonly enter the lower airway but do not cause pneumonia in the presence of an intact host defense mechanism. When pneumonia does occur, it is caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, chlamydiae, mycoplasma, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Several systems are used to classify pneumonias. Classically, pneumonia has been categorized into one of four categories: bacterial or typical, atypical, anaerobic/ cavitary, and opportunistic. However, there is overlap in the microorganisms thought to be responsible for typical and atypical pneu-
monias. A more widely used classification scheme categorizes the major pneumonias as community-acquired pneumonia, hospitalacquired pneumonia, pneumonia in the immunocompromised host, and aspiration pneumonia (Table 23-1). There is overlap in how specific pneumonias are classified because they may occur in differing settings.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs either in the community setting or within the first 48 hours of hospitalization or institutionalization. The need for hospitalization for CAP depends on the severity of the pneumonia. The agents that most frequently cause CAP requiring hospitalization are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Legionella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gramnegative rods. The specific etiologic agent of CAP is identified in about $50 \%$ of the cases. The absence of a responsible caregiver in the home may be another indication for hospitalization. More than 5.5 million people develop CAP and as many as 1.1 million require hospitalization each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1997; Marston, Plouffe, File et al., 1997).

Pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most common CAP in people younger than 60 without comorbidity and in those older than 60 with comorbidity. It is most prevalent during the winter and spring, when upper respiratory tract infections are most frequent. S. pneumoniae is a gram-positive, capsulated, nonmotile coccus that resides naturally in the upper respiratory tract. The organism colonizes the upper respiratory tract and can cause the following types of illnesses: disseminated invasive infections, pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections, and upper respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and sinusitis (CDC, 1998). It may occur as a lobar or bronchopneumonic form in patients of any age and may follow a recent respiratory illness.

Mycoplasma pneumonia, another type of CAP, occurs most often in older children and young adults and is spread by infected respiratory droplets through person-to-person contact. Patients can be tested for mycoplasma antibodies. The inflammatory infiltrate is primarily interstitial rather than alveolar. It spreads throughout the entire respiratory tract, including the bronchioles, and has the characteristics of a bronchopneumonia. Earache and bullous myringitis are common. Impaired ventilation and diffusion may occur.
H. influenzae is another cause of CAP. It frequently affects elderly people or those with comorbid illnesses (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], alcoholism, diabetes mellitus). The presentation of this pneumonia is indistinguishable from that of other forms of bacterial CAP. The presentation may be subacute, with cough or low-grade fever for weeks before diagnosis. Chest x-rays may reveal multilobar, patchy bronchopneumonia or areas of consolidation (tissue that solidifies as a result of collapsed alveoli or pneumonia).

Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and children but are relatively uncommon causes of CAP in adults. The chief causes of viral pneumonia in the immunocompetent adult are influenza viruses types A and B , adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and varicella-zoster virus. In immunocompromised adults, cytomegalovirus is the most common viral pathogen, followed by herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The acute stage of a viral respiratory infection occurs within the ciliated cells of the airways. This is followed by infiltration of the tracheobronchial tree. With pneumonia, the inflammatory process extends into the alveolar area, resulting in edema and exudation. The clinical signs and symptoms of a viral pneumonia are often difficult to distinguish from those of a bacterial pneumonia.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), also known as nosocomial pneumonia, is defined as the onset of pneumonia symptoms more than 48 hours after admission to the hospital. HAP accounts for approximately $15 \%$ of hospital-acquired infections but is the most lethal nosocomial infection. It is estimated to occur in $0.5 \%$ to $1 \%$ of all hospitalized patients and in $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of intensive care patients. Ventilator-associated pneumonia can be considered a type of nosocomial pneumonia that is associated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The common organisms responsible for HAP include the pathogens Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. These respiratory infections occur when at least one of three conditions exists: host defenses are impaired, an inoculum of organisms reaches the patient's lower respiratory tract and overwhelms the host's defenses, or a highly virulent organism is present. Certain illnesses may predispose a patient to HAP because of impaired host defenses. Examples include severe acute or chronic illness, a variety of comorbid conditions, coma, malnutrition, prolonged hospitalization, hypotension, and metabolic disorders. The hospitalized patient is also exposed to potential bacteria from other sources (eg, respira-
tory therapy devices and equipment, transmission of pathogens by the hands of health care personnel). Numerous interventionrelated factors also may play a role in the development of HAP (eg, therapeutic agents leading to central nervous system depression with decreased ventilation, impaired removal of secretions, or potential aspiration; prolonged or complicated thoracoabdominal procedures, which may impair mucociliary function and cellular host defenses; endotracheal intubation; prolonged or inappropriate use of antibiotics; use of nasogastric tubes). In addition, immunocompromised patients are at particular risk. HAP is associated with a high mortality rate, in part because of the virulence of the organisms, their resistance to antibiotics, and the patient's underlying disorder.

Dominant pathogens for HAP are gram-negative bacilli (P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae/Klebsiella species, Enterobacter, Proteus, Serratia) and S. aureus. Pseudomonal pneumonia occurs in patients who are debilitated, those with altered mental status, and those with prolonged intubation or with tracheostomies. Staphylococcal pneumonia can occur through inhalation of the organism or spread through the hematogenous route. It is often accompanied by bacteremia and positive blood cultures. Although responsible for less than $10 \%$ of cases of CAP,
staphylococcal pneumonia may be responsible for more than $30 \%$ of cases of HAP. Its mortality rate is high. Specific strains of staphylococci are resistant to all available antimicrobials except vancomycin. These strains of S. aureus are referred to as methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA). Overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents are major risk factors for the emergence of these resistant pathogens. Because MRSA is highly virulent, steps must be taken to prevent the spread of this organism. The patient with MRSA should be isolated in a private room, and contact precautions (gown, mask, glove, and antibacterial soap) are used. The number of people in contact with the patient should be minimized, and appropriate precautions must be taken when transporting the patient within or between facilities.

The usual presentation of an HAP is a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray combined with evidence of infection such as fever, respiratory symptoms, purulent sputum, and/or leukocytosis. Pneumonias from Klebsiella or other gram-negative organisms (E. coli, Proteus, Serratia) are characterized by destruction of lung structure and alveolar walls, consolidation, and bacteremia. Elderly patients and those with alcoholism, chronic lung disease, or diabetes are at particular risk. A sudden onset of cough is a common presentation, and blood-tinged sputum may be present. In the debilitated or dehydrated patient, sputum production may be minimal or absent. Pleural effusions, high fevers, and tachycardia are often observed. Even with treatment, the mortality rate remains high.

Pneumonia in the immunocompromised host is seen with greater frequency because immunocompromised hosts represent a growing portion of the patient population. Examples of pneumonia in the immunocompromised host are Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), fungal pneumonias, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. These types of pneumonia may also occur in the immunocompetent person and in different settings, but these are less common. Immunocompromised states occur with the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy, nutritional depletion, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, AIDS, genetic immune disorders, and long-term advanced life-support technology (mechanical ventilation). Patients with compromised immune systems commonly acquire pneumonia from organisms of low virulence. In addition, increasing numbers of patients with impaired defenses develop HAP from gramnegative bacilli (Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus, Serratia).

Pneumonia in the compromised host may be caused by the organisms also observed in CAP or HAP (S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, M. tuberculosis). PCP is rarely observed in the immunocompetent host and is often an initial AIDS-defining complication. Whether the patient is immunocompromised or immunocompetent, the clinical presentation of pneumonia is similar. PCP has a subtle onset with progressive dyspnea, fever, and a nonproductive cough.

Aspiration pneumonia refers to the pulmonary consequences resulting from the entry of endogenous or exogenous substances into the lower airway. The most common form of aspiration pneumonia is bacterial infection from aspiration of bacteria that normally reside in the upper airways. Aspiration pneumonia may occur in the community or hospital setting; common pathogens are $S$. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. Other substances may be aspirated into the lung, such as gastric contents, exogenous chemical contents, or irritating gases. This type of aspiration or ingestion may impair the lung defenses, cause inflammatory changes, and lead to bacterial growth and a resulting pneumonia. (Aspiration is described in more detail at the end of this chapter.)

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Upper airway characteristics normally prevent potentially infectious particles from reaching the normally sterile lower respiratory tract. Thus, patients with pneumonia caused by infectious agents often have an acute or chronic underlying disease that impairs host defenses. Pneumonia arises from normally present flora in a patient whose resistance has been altered, or it results from aspiration of flora present in the oropharynx. It may also result from bloodborne organisms that enter the pulmonary circulation and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed, becoming a potential source of pneumonia.

Pneumonia often affects both ventilation and diffusion. An inflammatory reaction can occur in the alveoli, producing an exudate that interferes with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. White blood cells, mostly neutrophils, also migrate into the alveoli and fill the normally air-containing spaces. Areas of the lung are not adequately ventilated because of secretions and mucosal edema that cause partial occlusion of the bronchi or alveoli, with a resultant decrease in alveolar oxygen tension. Bronchospasm may also occur in patients with reactive airway disease. Because of hypoventilation, a ventilation-perfusion mismatch occurs in the affected area of the lung. Venous blood entering the pulmonary circulation passes through the underventilated area and exits to the left side of the heart poorly oxygenated. The mixing of oxygenated and unoxygenated or poorly oxygenated blood eventually results in arterial hypoxemia.

If a substantial portion of one or more lobes is involved, the disease is referred to as "lobar pneumonia." The term "bronchopneumonia" is used to describe pneumonia that is distributed in a patchy fashion, having originated in one or more localized areas within the bronchi and extending to the adjacent surrounding lung parenchyma. Bronchopneumonia is more common than lobar pneumonia (Fig. 23-2).

\section*{Risk Factors}

Being knowledgeable about the factors and circumstances that commonly predispose a person to pneumonia will aid in identifying patients at high risk for this disorder (Chart 23-2).

\section*{Risk Factors for Pneumonia}

\section*{Risk Factor}

Conditions that produce mucus or bronchial obstruction and interfere with normal lung drainage (eg, cancer, cigarette smoking, COPD)
Immunosuppressed patients and those with a low neutrophil count (neutropenic)
Smoking; cigarette smoke disrupts both mucociliary and macrophage activity
Prolonged immobility and shallow breathing pattern

Depressed cough reflex (due to medications, a debilitated state, or weak respiratory muscles); aspiration of foreign material into the lungs during a period of unconsciousness (head injury, anesthesia, depressed level of consciousness), or abnormal swallowing mechanism
Nothing-by-mouth (NPO) status; placement of nasogastric, orogastric, or endotracheal tube
Antibiotic therapy (in very ill people, the oropharynx is likely to be colonized by gram-negative bacteria)
Alcohol intoxication (because alcohol suppresses the body's reflexes, may be associated with aspiration, and decreases white cell mobilization and tracheobronchial ciliary motion)
General anesthetic, sedative, or opioid preparations that promote respiratory depression, which causes a shallow breathing pattern and predisposes to the pooling of bronchial secretions and potential development of pneumonia
Advanced age, because of possible depressed cough and glottic reflexes and nutritional depletion
Respiratory therapy with improperly cleaned equipment

\section*{Preventive Measure}

Promote coughing and expectoration of secretions. Encourage smoking cessation.

Initiate special precautions against infection.
Encourage smoking cessation.
Reposition frequently and promote lung expansion exercises and coughing. Initiate suctioning and chest physical therapy if indicated.
Reposition frequently to prevent aspiration and administer medications judiciously, particularly those that increase risk for aspiration.
Perform suctioning and chest physical therapy if indicated.

Promote frequent oral hygiene. Minimize risk for aspiration by checking placement of tube and proper positioning of patient.

Encourage reduced or moderate alcohol intake (in case of alcohol stupor, position patient to prevent aspiration).

Observe the respiratory rate and depth during recovery from general anesthesia and before giving medications. If respiratory depression is apparent, withhold the medication and contact the physician.

Promote frequent turning, early ambulation and mobilization, effective coughing, breathing exercises, and nutritious diet.
Make sure that respiratory equipment is cleaned properly; participate in continuous quality improvement monitoring with the respiratory care department.

Increasing numbers of patients who have compromised defenses against infections are susceptible to pneumonia. Some types of pneumonia, such as those caused by viral infections, occur in previously healthy people and often follow a viral illness.

Pneumonia is common with certain underlying disorders such as heart failure, diabetes, alcoholism, COPD, and AIDS. Certain diseases also have been associated with specific pathogens. For example, staphylococcal pneumonia has been noted after epidemics of influenza, and patients with COPD are at increased risk for developing pneumonia caused by pneumococci or H. influenzae. In addition, cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory infection caused by pseudomonal and staphylococcal organisms, and PCP has been associated with AIDS. Pneumonias occurring in hospitalized patients often involve organisms not usually found in CAP, including enteric gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus.

The CDC has identified three specific strategies for preventing HAP: (1) staff education and infection surveillance, (2) interruption of transmission of microorganisms through person-to-person transmission and equipment transmission, and (3) modification of host risk of infection (CDC, 1997). Providing anticipatory and preventive care is an important nursing measure.

To reduce or prevent serious complications of CAP in highrisk groups, vaccination against pneumococcal infection is advised for the following:
- People 65 years of age or older
- Immunocompetent people who are at increased risk for illness and death associated with pneumococcal disease be-
cause of chronic illness (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease)
- People with functional or anatomic asplenia
- People living in environments or social settings in which the risk of disease is high
- Immunocompromised people at high risk for infection (CDC, 1998)

The vaccine provides specific prevention against pneumococcal pneumonia and other infections caused by this organism (otitis media, other upper respiratory tract infections). Vaccines should be avoided in the first trimester of pregnancy.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Pneumonia varies in its signs and symptoms depending on the organism and the patient's underlying disease. However, regardless of the type of pneumonia (CAP, HAP, immunocompromised host, aspiration), a specific type of pneumonia cannot be diagnosed by clinical manifestations alone. For example, the patient with streptococcal (pneumococcal) pneumonia usually has a sudden onset of shaking chills, rapidly rising fever ( $38.5^{\circ}$ to $40.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ [ $101^{\circ}$ to $105^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ]), and pleuritic chest pain that is aggravated by deep breathing and coughing. The patient is severely ill, with marked tachypnea ( 25 to 45 breaths $/ \mathrm{min}$ ), accompanied by other signs of respiratory distress (eg, shortness of breath, use of accessory muscles in respiration). The pulse is rapid and bounding, and it usually increases about 10 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ for every degree
of temperature (Celsius) elevation. A relative bradycardia for the amount of fever may suggest viral infection, mycoplasma infection, or infection with a Legionella organism.

Some patients exhibit an upper respiratory tract infection (nasal congestion, sore throat), and the onset of symptoms of pneumonia is gradual and nonspecific. The predominant symptoms may be headache, low-grade fever, pleuritic pain, myalgia, rash, and pharyngitis. After a few days, mucoid or mucopurulent sputum is expectorated. In severe pneumonia, the cheeks are flushed and the lips and nailbeds demonstrate central cyanosis (a late sign of poor oxygenation [hypoxemia]).

Typically, the patient has orthopnea (shortness of breath when reclining); he or she prefers to be propped up in bed leaning forward (orthopneic position), trying to achieve adequate gas exchange without coughing or breathing deeply. Appetite is poor, and the patient is diaphoretic and tires easily. Sputum is often purulent; this is not a reliable indicator of the etiologic agent. Rusty, blood-tinged sputum may be expectorated with streptococcal (pneumococcal), staphylococcal, and Klebsiella pneumonia.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may also depend on underlying conditions. Differing signs occur in patients with other conditions, such as cancer, or in those who are undergoing treatment with immunosuppressants, which lower the resistance to infection. Such patients have fever, crackles, and physical findings that indicate consolidation of lung tissue, including increased tactile fremitus (vocal vibration detected on palpation), percussion dullness, bronchial breath sounds, egophony (when auscultated, the spoken "E" becomes a loud, nasal-sounding "A"), and whispered pectoriloquy (whispered sounds are easily auscultated through the chest wall). These changes occur because sound is transmitted better through solid or dense tissue (consolidation) than through normal air-filled tissue; these sounds are described in Chapter 21.

Purulent sputum or slight changes in respiratory symptoms may be the only sign of pneumonia in patients with COPD. It may be difficult to determine whether an increase in symptoms is an exacerbation of the underlying disease process or an additional infectious process.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of pneumonia is made by history (particularly of a recent respiratory tract infection), physical examination, chest x-ray studies, blood culture (bloodstream invasion, called bacteremia, occurs frequently), and sputum examination. The sputum sample is obtained by having the patient: (1) rinse the mouth with water to minimize contamination by normal oral flora, (2) breathe deeply several times, (3) cough deeply, and (4) expectorate the raised sputum into a sterile container.

More invasive procedures may be used to collect specimens. Sputum may be obtained by nasotracheal or orotracheal suctioning with a sputum trap or by fiberoptic bronchoscopy (see Chap. 21). Bronchoscopy is often used in patients with acute severe infection, patients with chronic or refractory infection, or immunocompromised patients when a diagnosis cannot be made from an expectorated or induced specimen.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment of pneumonia includes administration of the appropriate antibiotic as determined by the results of the Gram stain. However, an etiologic agent is not identified in $50 \%$ of CAP cases and empiric therapy must be initiated. Therapy for CAP is continuing to evolve. Guidelines exist to guide antibiotic choice; however, the resistance patterns, prevalence of etiologic
agents, patient risk factors, and costs and availability of newer antibiotic agents must all be taken into consideration.

Several organizations have published guidelines for the medical management of CAP (Bartlett et al., 2000; American Thoracic Society, 2001). Recommendations are classified by existing risk factors, setting (inpatient vs. outpatient treatment), or specific pathogens. Examples of risk factors that may increase the risk of infection with certain types of pathogens appear in Chart 23-3.

Recommendations for treatment of outpatients with CAP who have no cardiopulmonary disease or other modifying factors include a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin [Zithromax], or clarithromycin [Biaxin]), doxycycline (Vibramycin), or a fluoroquinolone (eg, gatifloxacin [Tequin], levofloxacin [Levaquin]) with enhanced activity against S. pneumoniae (Bartlett et al., 2000; American Thoracic Society, 2001). Erythromycin should be avoided in areas where $H$. influenzae and $S$. aureus are more prevalent (Kenreigh \& Wagner, 2000; Lynch, 2000). For those outpatients who have cardiopulmonary disease or other modifying factors, treatment should include a beta-lactam (oral cefpodoxime [Vantin], cefuroxime [Zinacef, Ceftin], high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate [Augmentin, Clavulin]) plus a macrolide or doxycycline. Also, a beta-lactam plus an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone can be used (American Thoracic Society, 2001). These are guidelines; treatment for individual patients may be modified.

For patients with CAP who are hospitalized and do not have cardiopulmonary disease or modifying factors, management consists of intravenous azithromycin (Zithromax) or monotherapy with an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone. For inpatients with cardiopulmonary disease or modifying factors, the treatment involves an intravenous beta-lactam plus an intravenous or oral macrolide or doxycycline. An intravenous antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone may also be used alone (American Thoracic Society, 2001). For acutely ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit, management includes an intravenous beta-lactam plus either an intravenous macrolide or fluoroquinolone. For patients

\section*{Risk Factors for Pathogenic Lung Infections}

Risk Factors for Infection with Penicillin-Resistant and Drug-Resistant Pneumococci
- Age over 65 years
- Alcoholism
- Beta-lactam therapy (eg, cephalosporins) in past 3 months
- Immunosuppressive disorders
- Multiple medical comorbidities
- Exposure to a child in a day care facility

Risk Factors for Infection with Enteric Gram-Negative Bacteria
- Nursing home residency
- Underlying cardiopulmonary disease
- Multiple medical comorbidities
- Recent antibiotic therapy

Risk Factors for Infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- Structural lung disease (eg, bronchiectasis)
- Corticosteroid therapy
- Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (more than 7 days in the past month)
- Malnutrition
(American Thoracic Society, 2001)
at high risk for $P$. aeruginosa, more select antipseudomonal antibiotics are administered intravenously.

If specific pathogens have been identified for the CAP, more specific agents may be utilized. Mycoplasma pneumonia is treated with doxycycline or a macrolide. PCP responds best to pentamidine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ). Amantadine and rimantadine are effective with influenza A and have been shown to reduce the duration of fever and other systemic complications when administered within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of an uncomplicated influenza infection. These medications also reduce the duration and quantity of virus shedding in the respiratory secretions. They are most effective when used in combination with influenza vaccine. Ganciclovir is used to treat cytomegalovirus in the non-AIDS patient; cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin may also be used.

HAP has a different etiology from CAP. In suspected HAP or nosocomial pneumonia, empirical treatment is usually initiated with a broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic and may be monotherapy or combination therapy. In patients who are mildly to moderately ill with a low risk of Pseudomonas, the following antibiotics may be used: second-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefuroxime [Ceftin, Zinacef] or cefamandole [Mandol]), nonpseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone [Rocephin], cefotaxime [Claforan], ampicillin-sulbactam [Unasyn]), or fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin [Cipro], levofloxacin [Levaquin]). For combination therapy, any of the above may be used with an aminoglycoside.

For patients at high risk for Pseudomonas infection, an antipseudomonal penicillin plus an aminoglycoside (amikacin [Amikin], gentamicin) or beta-lactamase inhibitor (ampicillin/ sulbactam [Unasyn], ticarcillin/clavulanate [Timentin]) may be used. Other types of combination therapy may also be used depending upon the individual characteristics of the patient.

Of concern is the rampant rise in respiratory pathogens that are resistant to available antibiotics. Examples include vancomycinresistant enterococcus (VRE) and drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (McGeer \& Low, 2000). There is a tendency for clinicians to aggressively use antibiotics inappropriately or to use broad-spectrum agents when narrow-spectrum agents are more appropriate. Mechanisms to monitor and minimize the inappropriate use of antibiotics are in place. Education of clinicians to use evidencebased guidelines in the treatment of respiratory infection is important. Monitoring and surveillance of susceptibility patterns for pathogens are also important.

Therapy with parenteral agents usually is changed to oral antimicrobial agents when there is evidence of a clinical response and the patient is able to tolerate oral medications. The recommended duration of treatment for pneumococcal pneumonia is 72 hours after the patient becomes afebrile. Most other forms of pneumonia caused by bacterial pathogens are treated for 1 to 2 weeks after the patient becomes afebrile. Atypical pneumonia is usually treated for 10 to 21 days (Bartlett, Dowell, Mandell et al., 2000).

Treatment of viral pneumonia is primarily supportive. Antibiotics are ineffective in viral upper respiratory infections and pneumonia and may be associated with adverse effects. Treatment of viral infections with antibiotics is a major reason for the overuse of these medications in the United States. Antibiotics are indicated with a viral respiratory infection only when a secondary bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, or sinusitis is present. Hydration is a necessary part of therapy because fever and tachypnea may result in insensible fluid losses. Antipyretics may be used to treat headache and fever; antitussive medications may be used for the associated cough. Warm, moist inhalations are helpful in relieving bronchial
irritation. Antihistamines may provide benefit with reduced sneezing and rhinorrhea. Nasal decongestants may also be used to treat symptoms and improve sleep; however, excessive use may cause rebound nasal congestion. Treatment of viral pneumonia (with the exception of antimicrobial therapy) is the same as that for bacterial pneumonia. The patient is placed on bed rest until the infection shows signs of clearing. If hospitalized, the patient is observed carefully until the clinical condition improves.

If hypoxemia develops, oxygen is administered. Pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis is performed to determine the need for oxygen and to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy. A high concentration of oxygen is contraindicated in patients with COPD because it may worsen alveolar ventilation by decreasing the patient's ventilatory drive, leading to further respiratory decompensation. Respiratory support measures include high oxygen concentrations (fraction of inspired oxygen $\left[\mathrm{FiO}_{2}\right]$ ), endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Different modes of mechanical ventilation may be required; see Chapter 25.

Figure 23-3 provides an algorithm for patients with suspected CAP.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Pneumonia in the elderly patient may occur as a primary problem or as a complication of a chronic disease process. Pulmonary infections in the elderly frequently are difficult to treat and have a higher mortality rate than in younger patients. General deterioration, weakness, abdominal symptoms, anorexia, confusion, tachycardia, and tachypnea may signal the onset of pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia may be missed because the classic symptoms of cough, chest pain, sputum production, and fever may be absent or masked in the elderly patient. Also, the presence of some signs may be misleading. Abnormal breath sounds, for example, may be due to microatelectasis that occurs in the aged as a result of decreased mobility, decreased lung volumes, and other respiratory function changes. Because chronic heart failure is often seen in the elderly, chest x-rays may be obtained to assist in differentiating it from pneumonia as the cause of clinical signs and symptoms.

Supportive treatment includes hydration (with caution and frequent assessment because of the risk of fluid overload in the elderly), supplemental oxygen therapy, assistance with deep breathing, coughing, frequent position changes, and early ambulation. All of these are particularly important in the care of the elderly patient with pneumonia. To reduce or prevent serious complications of pneumonia in the elderly, vaccination against pneumococcal and influenza infections is recommended.

\section*{Complications}

\section*{SHOCK AND RESPIRATORY FAILURE}

Severe complications of pneumonia include hypotension and shock and respiratory failure (especially with gram-negative bacterial disease in elderly patients). These complications are encountered chiefly in patients who have received no specific treatment or inadequate or delayed treatment. These complications are also encountered when the infecting organism is resistant to therapy and when a comorbid disease complicates the pneumonia.

If the patient is seriously ill, aggressive therapy may include hemodynamic and ventilatory support to combat peripheral collapse, maintain arterial blood pressure, and provide adequate oxygenation. A vasopressor agent may be administered intravenously by continuous infusion and at a rate adjusted in accordance with

FIGURE 23-3 Treatment algorithm for patient with suspected CAP. From Bartlett, J. G. et al. (2000). Practice guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Clinical Infectious Diseases, 31 (2), 347-382.
the pressure response. Corticosteroids may be administered parenterally to combat shock and toxicity in patients who are extremely ill with pneumonia and in apparent danger of dying of the infection. Patients may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmias, pericarditis, and myocarditis also are complications of pneumonia that may lead to shock.

\section*{ATELECTASIS AND PLEURAL EFFUSION}

Atelectasis (from obstruction of a bronchus by accumulated secretions) may occur at any stage of acute pneumonia. Parapneumonic pleural effusions occur in at least $40 \%$ of bacterial pneumonias. A parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion associated with bacterial pneumonia, lung abscess, or bronchiectasis. After the pleural effusion is detected on a chest x-ray, a thoracentesis may be performed to remove the fluid. The fluid is sent to the laboratory for analysis. There are three stages of parapneumonic pleural effusions based on pathogenesis: uncomplicated, complicated, and thoracic empyema. An empyema occurs when thick, purulent fluid accumulates within the pleural space, often with fibrin development and a loculated (walled-off) area where the infection is located. (Empyema is discussed in greater detail in the section Pleural Conditions, below.) A chest tube may be inserted to treat pleural infection by establishing proper drainage of the empyema. Sterilization of the empyema cavity requires 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics. Sometimes surgical management is required.

\section*{SUPERINFECTION}

Superinfection may occur with the administration of very large doses of antibiotics, such as penicillin, or with combinations of antibiotics. Superinfection may also occur in the patient who has been receiving numerous courses and types of antibiotics. In such cases, bacteria may become resistant to the antibiotic therapy. If the patient improves and the fever diminishes after initial antibiotic therapy, but subsequently there is a rise in temperature with increasing cough and evidence that the pneumonia has spread, a superinfection is likely. Antibiotics are changed appropriately or discontinued entirely in some cases.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH PNEUMONIA}

\section*{Assessment}

Nursing assessment is critical in detecting pneumonia. A fever, chills, or night sweats in a patient who also has respiratory symptoms should alert the nurse to the possibility of bacterial pneumonia. A respiratory assessment will further identify the clinical manifestations of pneumonia: pleuritic-type pain, fatigue, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles for breathing, bradycardia or relative bradycardia, coughing, and purulent sputum. It is important to identify the severity, location, and cause of the chest pain, along
with any medications or procedures that provide relief. The nurse should monitor the following:
- Changes in temperature and pulse
- Amount, odor, and color of secretions
- Frequency and severity of cough
- Degree of tachypnea or shortness of breath
- Changes in physical assessment findings (primarily assessed by inspecting and auscultating the chest)
- Changes in the chest x-ray findings

In addition, it is important to assess the elderly patient for unusual behavior, altered mental status, dehydration, excessive fatigue, and concomitant heart failure.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include:
- Ineffective airway clearance related to copious tracheobronchial secretions
- Activity intolerance related to impaired respiratory function
- Risk for deficient fluid volume related to fever and dyspnea
- Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements
- Deficient knowledge about the treatment regimen and preventive health measures

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, collaborative problems or potential complications that may occur include:
- Continuing symptoms after initiation of therapy
- Shock
- Respiratory failure
- Atelectasis
- Pleural effusion
- Confusion
- Superinfection

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include improved airway patency, rest to conserve energy, maintenance of proper fluid volume, maintenance of adequate nutrition, an understanding of the treatment protocol and preventive measures, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING AIRWAY PATENCY}

Removing secretions is important because retained secretions interfere with gas exchange and may slow recovery. The nurse encourages hydration (2 to $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) because adequate hydration thins and loosens pulmonary secretions. Humidification may be used to loosen secretions and improve ventilation. A highhumidity facemask (using either compressed air or oxygen) delivers warm, humidified air to the tracheobronchial tree, helps to liquefy secretions, and relieves tracheobronchial irritation. Coughing can be initiated either voluntarily or by reflex. Lung expansion maneuvers, such as deep breathing with an incentive spirometer, may induce a cough. A directed cough may be necessary to improve airway patency. The nurse encourages the patient to per-
form an effective, directed cough, which includes correct positioning, a deep inspiratory maneuver, glottic closure, contraction of the expiratory muscles against the closed glottis, sudden glottic opening, and an explosive expiration. In some cases, the nurse may assist the patient by placing both hands on the patient's lower rib cage (anteriorly or posteriorly) to focus the patient on a slow deep breath, and then manually assisting the patient by applying external pressure during the expiratory phase.

Chest physiotherapy (percussion and postural drainage) is important in loosening and mobilizing secretions (see Chap. 25). Indications for chest physiotherapy include sputum retention not responsive to spontaneous or directed cough, a history of pulmonary problems previously treated with chest physiotherapy, continued evidence of retained secretions (decreased or abnormal breath sounds, change in vital signs), abnormal chest x-ray findings consistent with atelectasis or infiltrates, or deterioration in oxygenation. The patient is placed in the proper position to drain the involved lung segments, and then the chest is percussed and vibrated either manually or with a mechanical percussor.

After each position change, the nurse encourages the patient to breathe deeply and cough. If the patient is too weak to cough effectively, the nurse may need to remove the mucus by nasotracheal suctioning (see Chap. 25). It may take time for secretions to mobilize and move into the central airways for expectoration. Thus, it is important for the nurse to monitor the patient for cough and sputum production after the completion of chest physiotherapy.

The nurse administers and titrates oxygen therapy as prescribed. The effectiveness of oxygen therapy is monitored by improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, and adequate oxygenation values measured by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis.

\section*{PROMOTING REST AND CONSERVING ENERGY}

The nurse encourages the debilitated patient to rest and avoid overexertion and possible exacerbation of symptoms. The patient should assume a comfortable position to promote rest and breathing (eg, semi-Fowler's) and should change positions frequently to enhance secretion clearance and ventilation/perfusion in the lungs. It is important to instruct outpatients not to overexert themselves and to engage in only moderate activity during the initial phases of treatment.

\section*{PROMOTING FLUID INTAKE}

The respiratory rate of a patient with pneumonia increases because of the increased workload imposed by labored breathing and fever. An increased respiratory rate leads to an increase in insensible fluid loss during exhalation and can lead to dehydration. Therefore, it is important to encourage increased fluid intake (at least $2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day), unless contraindicated.

\section*{MAINTAINING NUTRITION}

Patients with shortness of breath and fatigue often have a decreased appetite and will take only fluids. Fluids with electrolytes (commercially available drinks, such as Gatorade) may help provide fluid, calories, and electrolytes. Other nutritionally enriched drinks or shakes may be helpful. In addition, fluids and nutrients may be administered intravenously if necessary.

\section*{PROMOTING THE PATIENT'S KNOWLEDGE}

The patient and family are instructed about the cause of pneumonia, management of symptoms of pneumonia, and the need for follow-up (discussed later). The patient also needs informa-
tion about factors (both patient risk factors and external factors) that may have contributed to developing pneumonia and strategies to promote recovery and to prevent recurrence. If hospitalized for treatment, the patient is instructed about the purpose and importance of management strategies that have been implemented and about the importance of adhering to them during and after the hospital stay. Explanations need to be given simply and in language that the patient can understand. If possible, written instructions and information should be provided. Because of the severity of symptoms, the patient may require that instructions and explanations be repeated several times.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Continuing Symptoms After Initiation of Therapy}

Patients usually begin to respond to treatment within 24 to 48 hours after antibiotic therapy is initiated. The patient is observed for response to antibiotic therapy. The patient is monitored for changes in physical status (deterioration of condition or resolution of symptoms) and for persistent recurrent fever, which may be due to medication allergy (signaled possibly by a rash); medication resistance or slow response (greater than 48 hours) of the susceptible organism to therapy; superinfection; pleural effusion; or pneumonia caused by an unusual organism, such as P. carinii or Aspergillus fumigatus. Failure of the pneumonia to resolve or persistence of symptoms despite changes on the chest x-ray raises the suspicion of other underlying disorders, such as lung cancer. As described earlier, lung cancers may invade or compress airways, causing an obstructive atelectasis that may lead to a pneumonia.

In addition to monitoring for continuing symptoms of pneumonia, the nurse also monitors for other complications, such as shock and multisystem failure, atelectasis, pleural effusion, and superinfection, which may develop during the first few days of antibiotic treatment.

\section*{Shock and Respiratory Failure}

The nurse assesses for signs and symptoms of shock and respiratory failure by evaluating the patient's vital signs, pulse oximetry values, and hemodynamic monitoring parameters. The nurse reports signs of deteriorating patient status and assists in administering intravenous fluids and medications prescribed to combat shock. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required if respiratory failure occurs. Shock is described in detail in Chapter 15, and care of the patient receiving mechanical ventilation is described in Chapter 25.

\section*{Atelectasis and Pleural Effusion}

The patient is assessed for atelectasis, and preventive measures are initiated to prevent its development. If pleural effusion develops and thoracentesis is performed to remove fluid, the nurse assists in the procedure and explains it to the patient. After thoracentesis, the nurse monitors the patient for pneumothorax or recurrence of pleural effusion. If a chest tube needs to be inserted, the nurse monitors the patient's respiratory status (see Chap. 25 for more information on care of the patient with a chest tube).

\section*{Superinfection}

The patient is monitored for manifestations of superinfection (ie, minimal improvement in signs and symptoms, rise in temperature with increasing cough, increasing fremitus and adventitious breath sounds on auscultation of the lungs). These signs are re-
ported, and the nurse assists in implementing therapy to treat superinfection.

\section*{Confusion}

The patient with pneumonia is assessed for confusion and other more subtle changes in cognitive status. Confusion and changes in cognitive status resulting from pneumonia are poor prognostic signs. Confusion may be related to hypoxemia, fever, dehydration, sleep deprivation, or developing sepsis. The patient's underlying comorbid conditions may also play a part in the development of confusion. Addressing the underlying factors and ensuring the patient's safety are important nursing interventions.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Depending on the severity of the pneumonia, treatment may occur in the hospital or in the outpatient setting. Patient education is crucial regardless of the setting, and the proper administration of antibiotics is important. In some instances, the patient may be initially treated with intravenous antibiotics as an inpatient and then be discharged to continue the intravenous antibiotics in the home setting. It is important that a seamless system of care be maintained for the patient from hospital to home; this includes communication between the nurses caring for this patient in both settings. In addition, if oral antibiotics are prescribed, it is important to teach the patient about their proper administration and potential side effects.

After the fever subsides, the patient may gradually increase activities. Fatigue and weakness may be prolonged after pneumonia, especially in the elderly. The nurse encourages breathing exercises to promote secretion clearance and volume expansion. It is important to instruct the patient to return to the clinic or caregiver's office for a follow-up chest x-ray and physical examination. Often improvement in chest x-ray findings lags behind improvement in clinical signs and symptoms.

The nurse encourages the patient to stop smoking. Smoking inhibits tracheobronchial ciliary action, which is the first line of defense of the lower respiratory tract. Smoking also irritates the mucous cells of the bronchi and inhibits the function of alveolar macrophage (scavenger) cells. The patient is instructed to avoid stress, fatigue, sudden changes in temperature, and excessive alcohol intake, all of which lower resistance to pneumonia. The nurse reviews with the patient the principles of adequate nutrition and rest, because one episode of pneumonia may make the patient susceptible to recurring respiratory tract infections.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Patients who are severely debilitated or who cannot care for themselves may require referral for home care. During home visits, the nurse assesses the patient's physical status, monitors for complications, assesses the home environment, and reinforces previous teaching. The nurse evaluates the patient's adherence to the therapeutic regimen (ie, taking medications as prescribed, performing breathing exercises, consuming adequate fluid and dietary intake, and avoiding smoking, alcohol, and excessive activity). The nurse stresses to the patient and family the importance of monitoring for complications. The nurse encourages the patient to obtain an influenza vaccine at the prescribed times, because influenza increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia, especially that caused by staphylococci, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae. The nurse also encourages the patient to seek medical advice about receiving the vaccine (Pneumovax) against S. pneumoniae.

\section*{Purpose}

Smoking remains a major cause of death in all populations in the U.S. The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency of interventions related to the use of tobacco used by oncology nurses, using the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guidelines as a framework.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This was a descriptive study; a self-report questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 4,000 members of the Oncology Nursing Society. The response rate was $38 \%$, with 1,508 completed questionnaires available for analysis. Subjects were asked to identify those interventions related to tobacco use that they used in their clinical practice.

\section*{Findings}

The majority of respondents were female ( $98 \%$ ), with an average age of 44 years. The educational background of respondents was varied, with $39 \%$ with baccalaureate preparation, $41 \%$ with associate or diploma education, and $20 \%$ with master's or doctoral level education. Sixty-two percent of the respondents reported their position as staff nurse. Overall, the sample was characterized as experienced nurses, with average number of years in nursing at $18 \pm 9.4$ years
and as an oncology nurse for $11.5 \pm 5.5$ years. Thirty percent of the sample were ex-smokers, while $7 \%$ were active smokers. The results demonstrated that most respondents ( $86 \%$ ) encountered smokers in their clinical practice on a weekly basis, but only $10 \%$ had any knowledge of the AHCPR guidelines for smoking cessation. Sixtyfour percent of the respondents assessed and documented smoking status in their clinical patients and $38 \%$ assessed readiness to quit. However, fewer nurses reported providing interventions for smoking cessation. The most frequent barriers cited included perceived lack of patient motivation ( $74 \%$ ), time ( $52 \%$ ), and skills to provide a cessation intervention (53\%).

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses have frequent contacts with active smokers in the inpatient and outpatient setting and could have a tremendous impact on smoking prevention and cessation. Even in this sample of oncology nurses, few provided smoking cessation interventions on a regular basis. Nurses need a heightened awareness of the importance of smoking cessation and the potential impact they may have on this growing problem. It is imperative that students and practicing nurses receive improved education regarding smoking cessation techniques and use of evidence-based guidelines like those of the AHCPR.

\section*{PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS}

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that primarily affects the lung parenchyma. It also may be transmitted to other parts of the body, including the meninges, kidneys, bones, and lymph nodes. The primary infectious agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
is an acid-fast aerobic rod that grows slowly and is sensitive to heat and ultraviolet light. Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium avium have rarely been associated with the development of a TB infection.

TB is a worldwide public health problem, and the mortality and morbidity rates continue to rise. M. tuberculosis infects an estimated one third of the world's population and remains the leading cause of death from infectious disease in the world. It is the leading cause of death among HIV-positive people (World Health Organization, 2000). TB is closely associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, substandard housing, and inadequate health care.

In 1952, anti-TB medications were introduced, and the rate of reported cases of TB in the United States declined an average of $6 \%$ each year between 1953 and 1985. It was thought that by the early part of the 21st century, TB might be eliminated in the United States. However, since 1985 the trend has reversed and the number of cases has increased. This change has been attributed to several factors, including increased immigration, the HIV epidemic, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of TB, increased homelessness, decreased interest and detection by health care providers, and inadequate funding of the U.S. public health system (Small \& Fujiwara, 2001).

\section*{Transmission and Risk Factors}

TB spreads from person to person by airborne transmission. An infected person releases droplet nuclei (generally particles 1 to 5 micrometers in diameter) through talking, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or singing. Larger droplets settle; smaller droplets remain suspended in the air and are inhaled by the susceptible person. Risk factors for TB are listed in Chart 23-4. Chart 23-5 summarizes the CDC's recommendations for prevention of TB transmission in health care settings.

\section*{Risk Factors for Tuberculosis}
- Close contact with someone who has active TB. Inhalation of airborne nuclei from an infected person is proportional to the amount of time spent in the same air space, the proximity of the person, and the degree of ventilation.
- Immunocompromised status (eg, those with HIV infection, cancer, transplanted organs, and prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy)
- Substance abuse (IV or injection drug users and alcoholics)
- Any person without adequate health care (the homeless; impoverished; minorities, particularly children under age 15 years and young adults between ages 15 and 44 yrs)
- Preexisting medical conditions or special treatment (eg, diabetes, chronic renal failure, malnourishment, selected malignancies, he-
modialysis, transplanted organ, gastrectomy, or jejunoileal bypass)
- Immigration from countries with a high prevalence of TB (southeastern Asia, Africa, Latin America, Caribbean)
- Institutionalization (eg, long-term care facilities, psychiatric institutions, prisons)
- Living in overcrowded, substandard housing
- Being a health care worker performing high-risk activities: administration of aerosolized pentamidine and other medications, sputum induction procedures, bronchoscopy, suctioning, coughing procedures, caring for the immunosuppressed patient, home care with the high-risk population, and administering anesthesia and related procedures (eg, intubation, suctioning)

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A susceptible person inhales mycobacterium bacilli and becomes infected. The bacteria are transmitted through the airways to the alveoli, where they are deposited and begin to multiply. The bacilli also are transported via the lymph system and bloodstream to other parts of the body (kidneys, bones, cerebral cortex) and other areas of the lungs (upper lobes). The body's immune system responds by initiating an inflammatory reaction. Phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages) engulf many of the bacteria, and TB-specific lymphocytes lyse (destroy) the bacilli and normal tissue. This tissue reaction results in the accumulation of exudate in the alveoli, causing bronchopneumonia. The initial infection usually occurs 2 to 10 weeks after exposure.

Granulomas, new tissue masses of live and dead bacilli, are surrounded by macrophages, which form a protective wall around the granulomas. Granulomas are then transformed to a fibrous tissue mass, the central portion of which is called a Ghon tubercle. The material (bacteria and macrophages) becomes necrotic, forming a cheesy mass. This mass may become calcified and form a col-
lagenous scar. At this point, the bacteria become dormant, and there is no further progression of active disease.

After initial exposure and infection, the person may develop active disease because of a compromised or inadequate immune system response. Active disease also may occur with reinfection and activation of dormant bacteria. In this case, the Ghon tubercle ulcerates, releasing the cheesy material into the bronchi. The bacteria then become airborne, resulting in further spread of the disease. Then the ulcerated tubercle heals and forms scar tissue. This causes the infected lung to become more inflamed, resulting in further development of bronchopneumonia and tubercle formation.

Unless the process is arrested, it spreads slowly downward to the hilum of the lungs and later extends to adjacent lobes. The process may be prolonged and characterized by long remissions when the disease is arrested, only to be followed by periods of renewed activity. Approximately $10 \%$ of people who are initially infected develop active disease. Some people develop reactivation TB (also called adult-type TB). This type of TB results from a breakdown of the host defenses. It most commonly occurs within

\section*{Cherge \\ 23-5 \\ \section*{CDC Recommendations for Preventing Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health Care Settings}}
1. Early identification and treatment of persons with active TB
a. Maintain a high index of suspicion for TB to identify cases rapidly.
b. Promptly initiate effective multidrug anti-TB therapy based on clinical and drug-resistance surveillance data.
2. Prevention of spread of infectious droplet nuclei by source control methods and by reduction of microbial contamination of indoor air
a. Initiate acid-fast bacilli (AFB) isolation precautions immediately for all patients who are suspected or confirmed to have active TB and who may be infectious. AFB isolation precautions include use of a private room with negative pressure in relation to surrounding areas and a minimum of six air exchanges per hour. Air from the room should be exhausted directly to the outside. Use of ultraviolet lamps and/or high-efficiency particulate air filters to supplement ventilation may be considered.
b. Persons entering the AFB isolation room should use disposable particulate respirators that fit snugly around the face.
c. Continue AFB isolation precautions until there is clinical evidence of reduced infectiousness (ie, cough has substantially de-
creased, and the number of organisms on sequential sputum smears is decreasing). If drug resistance is suspected or confirmed, continue AFB precautions until the sputum smear is negative for AFB .
d. Use special precautions during cough-inducing procedures.
3. Surveillance for TB transmission
a. Maintain surveillance for TB infection among health care workers (HCWs) by routine, periodic tuberculin skin testing. Recommend appropriate preventive therapy for HCWs when indicated.
b. Maintain surveillance for TB cases among patients and HCWs.
c. Promptly initiate contact investigation procedures among HCWs, patients, and visitors exposed to an untreated, or ineffectively treated, infectious TB patient for whom appropriate AFB procedures are not in place. Recommend appropriate therapy or preventive therapy for contacts with disease or TB infection without current disease. Therapeutic regimens should be chosen based on the clinical history and local drug-resistance surveillance data.
the lungs, usually in the apical or posterior segments of the upper lobes, or the superior segments of the lower lobes.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB are insidious. Most patients have a low-grade fever, cough, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. The cough may be nonproductive, or mucopurulent sputum may be expectorated. Hemoptysis also may occur. Both the systemic and pulmonary symptoms are usually chronic and may have been present for weeks to months. The elderly usually present with less pronounced symptoms than do younger patients. Extrapulmonary disease occurs in up to $16 \%$ of cases in the United States. In patients with AIDS, extrapulmonary disease is more prevalent and may occur in up to $70 \%$ of cases (Niederman \& Sarosi, 2000; Small \& Fujiwara, 2001).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A complete history, physical examination, tuberculin skin test, chest x-ray, acid-fast bacillus smear, and sputum culture are used to diagnose TB. If the person is infected with TB, the chest x-ray usually reveals lesions in the upper lobes and the acid-fast bacillus smear contains mycobacterium.

\section*{TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST}

The Mantoux test is used to determine if a person has been infected with the TB bacillus. The Mantoux test is a standardized procedure and should be performed only by those trained in its administration and reading. Tubercle bacillus extract (tuberculin), purified protein derivative (PPD), is injected into the intradermal layer of the inner aspect of the forearm, approximately 4 inches below the elbow (Fig. 23-4). Intermediate-strength (5 TU) PPD in a tuberculin syringe with a half-inch 26- or 27-gauge nee-
dle is used. The needle, with the bevel facing up, is inserted beneath the skin. Then 0.1 mL of PPD is injected, creating an elevation in the skin, a wheal or bleb. The site, antigen name, strength, lot number, date, and time of the test are recorded. The test result is read 48 to 72 hours after injection. Tests read after 72 hours tend to underestimate the true size of induration (hardening). A delayed localized reaction indicates that the person is sensitive to tuberculin.

A reaction occurs when both induration and erythema (redness) are noted. After the area is inspected for induration, it is lightly palpated across the injection site, from the area of normal skin to the margins of the induration. The diameter of the induration (not erythema) is measured in millimeters at its widest part (see Fig. 23-4), and the size of the induration is documented. Erythema without induration is not considered significant.

Interpretation of Results. The size of the induration determines the significance of the reaction. A reaction of 0 to 4 mm is considered not significant; a reaction of 5 mm or greater may be significant in individuals who are considered at risk. An induration of 10 mm or greater is usually considered significant in individuals who have normal or mildly impaired immunity. A significant reaction indicates that a patient has been exposed to M. tuberculosis recently or in the past or has been vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. The BCG vaccine is given to produce a greater resistance to developing TB. It is effective in up to $76 \%$ of those who receive it. The vaccine is used in Europe and Latin America but not routinely in the United States.

A reaction of 5 mm or greater is defined as positive for patients who are HIV-positive or have HIV risk factors and are of unknown HIV status, those who are close contacts with an active case, and those who have chest x-ray results consistent with tuberculosis.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 23-4 The Mantoux test for tuberculosis. (A) Correct technique for inserting the needle involves depositing the PPD subcutaneously with the needle bevel facing upward. (B) The reaction to the Mantoux test usually consists of a wheal, a hivelike, firm welt. (C) To determine the extent of the reaction, the wheal is measured using a commercially prepared gauge. A wheal measuring 5 mm or more is considered significant.}
\end{figure}

A significant (positive) reaction does not necessarily mean that active disease is present in the body. Most (more than $90 \%$ ) people who are tuberculin-significant reactors do not develop clinical TB. However, all significant reactors are candidates for active TB. In general, the more intense the reaction, the greater the likelihood of an active infection.

A nonsignificant (negative) skin test does not exclude TB infection or disease because patients who are immunosuppressed cannot develop an immune response adequate to produce a positive skin test. This is referred to as anergy.

The accuracy of the skin test depends on the skill of the person interpreting the test reaction. One study (Kendig, Kirkpatrick, Carter et al., 1998) revealed that health care professionals tend to underestimate the size of induration: only $7 \%$ of a sample of 107 health care providers charted the correct size of induration.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF TB}

Data from the history, physical examination, skin test, chest x-ray, and microbiologic studies are used to classify TB into one of five classes. A classification scheme provides public health officials with a systematic way to monitor epidemiology and treatment of the disease (American Thoracic Society, 2000).
- Class 0: no exposure; no infection
- Class 1: exposure; no evidence of infection
- Class 2: latent infection; no disease (eg, positive PPD reaction but no clinical evidence of active TB)
- Class 3: disease; clinically active
- Class 4: disease; not clinically active
- Class 5: suspected disease; diagnosis pending

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

TB may have atypical manifestations in elderly patients, whose symptoms may include unusual behavior and altered mental status, fever, anorexia, and weight loss. Many elderly patients may have no reaction (loss of immunologic memory) or delayed reactivity for up to a week (recall phenomenon). A second skin test is performed in 1 to 2 weeks.

\section*{Medical Management}

Pulmonary TB is treated primarily with chemotherapeutic agents (antituberculosis agents) for 6 to 12 months. A prolonged treatment duration is necessary to ensure eradication of the organisms and to prevent relapse. A worldwide concern and challenge in TB therapy is the continuing (since the 1950s) and increasing resistance of $M$. tuberculosis to TB medications. Several types of drug resistance must be considered when planning effective therapy:
- Primary drug resistance: resistance to one of the first-line antituberculosis agents in a person who has not had previous treatment
- Secondary or acquired drug resistance: resistance to one or more antituberculosis agents in a patient undergoing therapy
- Multidrug resistance: resistance to two agents, isoniazid (INH) and rifampin. The populations at highest risk for multidrug resistance are those who are HIV-positive, institutionalized, or homeless.

The increasing prevalence of drug resistance points out the need to begin TB treatment with four or more medications, to
ensure completion of therapy, and to develop and evaluate new anti-TB medications.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

In current TB therapy, five first-line medications are used (Table 23-2): INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and either streptomycin or ethambutol.

Combination medications, such as INH and rifampin (Rifamate) or INH, pyrazinamide and rifampin and medications administered twice a week (eg, rifapentine) are available to help improve patient adherence. Capreomycin, ethionamide, paraaminosalicylate sodium, and cycloserine are second-line medications. Additional potentially effective medications include other aminoglycosides, quinolones, rifabutin, clofazimine, and combinations of medications.

Recommended treatment guidelines for newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary TB (CDC, 2000) consist of a multiple-medication regimen of INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. This initial intensive-treatment regimen is usually administered daily for 8 weeks. If cultures demonstrate that the organism is sensitive to the medications before the 8 weeks of therapy have been completed, either ethambutol or streptomycin can be discontinued. After 8 weeks of this medication regimen, pyrazinamide can be discontinued and INH and rifampin are administered for an additional 4 months. The medication regimen, however, may continue for 12 months. A person is considered noninfectious after 2 to 3 weeks of continuous medication therapy. Vitamin B (pyridoxine) is usually administered with INH to prevent INH-associated peripheral neuropathy (see Table 23-2).

INH also may be used as a prophylactic (preventive) measure for those at risk for significant disease, including:
- Household family members of patients with active disease
- HIV-infected patients with a PPD test reaction of 5 mm of induration or more
- Patients with fibrotic lesions detected on a chest x-ray, suggestive of old TB, and a PPD reaction of 5 mm of induration or more
- Patients whose current PPD test results show a change from former test results, suggesting recent exposure to TB and possible infection (also called skin test converters)
- Drug (intravenous or injectable) users with PPD test results of 10 mm of induration or more
- Patients with high-risk comorbid conditions with a PPD result of 10 mm of induration or more

Other candidates for preventive INH therapy are those age 35 years or younger with PPD test results of 10 mm of induration or more and one of the following criteria:
- Foreign-born individuals from countries with a high prevalence of TB
- High-risk, medically underserved populations
- Institutionalized patients

Prophylactic INH treatment involves taking daily doses for 6 to 12 months. Liver enzyme, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels are monitored monthly. Sputum culture results are monitored for acid-fast bacillus to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and the patient's compliance with therapy.

In 1998, the federal Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis published recommendations for the development of TB vaccines. The recommendations include a focus on a "postinfection vaccine" to prevent people infected with TB from developing active disease (CDC, 1998). To date, this vaccine has

not become clinically available. In 2000, recommendations were released regarding the treatment of latent TB infection (American Thoracic Society and CDC, 2000). Isoniazid (INH) for 6 to 12 months has been the mainstay of treatment for latent TB infection. However, this long duration of treatment has been limited due to poor adherence and concerns of toxicity. The American Thoracic Society and CDC released newer guidelines in the 2000 document, which focused on treating a latent infection over a shorter period of time. The CDC released case reports of liver injury associated with the 2 -month rifampin-pyrazinamide (RIF-PZA) dosing regimen in August 2001 (MMWR, 2001). This prompted a review and changes to the 2000 guidelines. In summary, a 2-month RIF-PZA treatment regimen for latent TB infection should be used with caution, especially in patients who are concurrently taking medications for liver disease or those with a history of alcoholism. For patients not infected with HIV, 9 months of daily INH remains the preferred treatment, and 4 months of daily RIF is an acceptable alternative. No more than
a 2-week supply of RIF-PZA should be dispensed at any one time to facilitate periodic clinical assessments. Lastly, serum aminotransferase and bilirubin should be measured at baseline and at 2,4 , and 6 weeks of treatment in patients taking RIF-PZA (MMWR, 2001).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH TUBERCULOSIS}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse performs a complete history and physical examination. Clinical manifestations of fever, anorexia, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, cough, and sputum production prompt a more thorough assessment of respiratory function-for example, assessing the lungs for consolidation by evaluating breath sounds (diminished, bronchial sounds, crackles), fremitus, egophony, and dullness on percussion. Enlarged, painful lymph nodes may be palpated as well. The nurse also assesses the patient's living
arrangements, perceptions and understanding of TB and its treatment, and readiness to learn.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses may include:
- Ineffective airway clearance related to copious tracheobronchial secretions
- Deficient knowledge about treatment regimen and preventive health measures and related ineffective individual management of the therapeutic regimen (noncompliance)
- Activity intolerance related to fatigue, altered nutritional status, and fever

\section*{Collaborative Problems/ Potential Complications}

Based on the assessment data, collaborative problems or potential complications that may occur include:
- Malnutrition
- Adverse side effects of medication therapy: hepatitis, neurologic changes (deafness or neuritis), skin rash, gastrointestinal upset
- Multidrug resistance
- Spread of TB infection (miliary TB)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include maintenance of a patent airway, increased knowledge about the disease and treatment regimen and adherence to the medication regimen, increased activity tolerance, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING AIRWAY CLEARANCE}

Copious secretions obstruct the airways in many patients with TB and interfere with adequate gas exchange. Increasing fluid intake promotes systemic hydration and serves as an effective expectorant. The nurse instructs the patient about correct positioning to facilitate airway drainage (postural drainage); this is described in Chapter 25.

\section*{ADVOCATING ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT REGIMEN}

The multiple-medication regimen that a patient must follow can be quite complex. Understanding the medications, schedule, and side effects is important. The patient must understand that TB is a communicable disease and that taking medications is the most effective means of preventing transmission. The major reason treatment fails is that patients do not take their medications regularly and for the prescribed duration. The nurse carefully instructs the patient about important hygiene measures, including mouth care, covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, proper disposal of tissues, and hand hygiene.

\section*{PROMOTING ACTIVITY AND ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Patients with TB are often debilitated from a prolonged chronic illness and impaired nutritional status. The nurse plans a progressive activity schedule that focuses on increasing activity tolerance and muscle strength. Anorexia, weight loss, and malnutrition are common in patients with TB. The patient's willingness to eat may
be altered by fatigue from excessive coughing, sputum production, chest pain, generalized debilitated state, or cost, if the person has few resources. A nutritional plan that allows for small, frequent meals may be required. Liquid nutritional supplements may assist in meeting basic caloric requirements.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Malnutrition}

This may be a consequence of the patient's lifestyle, lack of knowledge about adequate nutrition and its role in health maintenance, lack of resources, fatigue, or lack of appetite because of coughing and mucus production. To counter the effects of these factors, the nurse collaborates with the dietitian, physician, social worker, family, and patient to identify strategies to ensure an adequate nutritional intake and availability of nutritious food. Identifying facilities (eg, shelters, soup kitchens, Meals on Wheels, and other community resources) that provide meals in the patient's neighborhood may increase the likelihood that the patient with limited resources and energy will have access to a more nutritious intake. High-calorie nutritional supplements may be suggested as a strategy for increasing dietary intake using food products normally found in the home. Purchasing food supplements may be beyond the patient's budget, but a dietitian can help develop recipes to increase caloric intake despite minimal resources.

\section*{Side Effects of Medication Therapy}

It is important to assess medication side effects because they are often a reason the patient fails to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen. Efforts are made to reduce the side effects to increase the patient's willingness to take the medications as prescribed.

The nurse instructs the patient to take the medication either on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before meals, because food interferes with medication absorption (although taking medications on an empty stomach frequently results in gastrointestinal upset). Patients taking INH should avoid foods containing tyramine and histamine (tuna, aged cheese, red wine, soy sauce, yeast extracts). Eating these types of foods while taking INH may result in headache, flushing, hypotension, light-headedness, palpitations, and diaphoresis.

In addition, rifampin can increase the metabolism of other medications, making them less effective. These medications include beta-blockers, oral anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin), digoxin, quinidine, corticosteroids, oral hypoglycemic agents, oral contraceptives, theophylline, and verapamil. This issue should be discussed with the physician and pharmacist so that medication dosages can be adjusted accordingly. The nurse informs the patient that rifampin may discolor contact lenses, so the patient may want to wear eyeglasses during treatment. The nurse monitors for other side effects of anti-TB medications, including hepatitis, neurologic changes (hearing loss, neuritis), and rash. Liver enzyme, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine levels are monitored to detect medication-related changes in liver and kidney function. Sputum culture results are monitored for acid-fast bacillus to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment regimen and adherence to therapy.

\section*{Multidrug Resistance}

The nurse carefully monitors vital signs and observes for spikes in temperature or changes in the clinical status. The nurse reports any change in the patient's respiratory status to the primary
health care provider. The nurse instructs the patient about the risk of drug resistance if the medication regimen is not strictly and continuously followed.

\section*{Spread of TB Infection}

Spread of TB infection to nonpulmonary sites of the body is known as miliary TB. It is the result of invasion of the bloodstream by the tubercle bacillus (Ghon tubercle). Usually it results from late reactivation of a dormant infection in the lung or elsewhere. The origin of the bacilli that enter the bloodstream is either a chronic focus that has ulcerated into a blood vessel or multitudes of miliary tubercles lining the inner surface of the thoracic duct. The organisms migrate from these foci into the bloodstream, are carried throughout the body, and disseminate throughout all tissues, with tiny miliary tubercles developing in the lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, meninges, and other organs.

The clinical course of miliary TB may vary from an acute, rapidly progressive infection with high fever to an indolent process with low-grade fever, anemia, and debilitation. At first, there may be no localizing signs except an enlarged spleen and a reduced number of leukocytes. Within a few weeks, however, the chest x-ray reveals small densities scattered diffusely throughout both lung fields; these are the miliary tubercles, which gradually grow.

The possibility of TB in nonpulmonary sites in the body requires careful monitoring for this very serious form of the infection. The nurse monitors vital signs and observes for spikes in temperature as well as changes in renal and cognitive function. Few physical signs may be elicited on physical examination of the chest, but at this stage the patient has a severe cough and dyspnea. Treatment of miliary TB is the same as for pulmonary TB.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse plays a vital role in caring for the patient with TB and the family, which includes assessing the patient's ability to continue therapy at home. The nurse instructs the patient and family about infection control procedures, such as proper disposal of tissues, covering the mouth during coughing, and hand hygiene. Assessment of the patient's adherence to the medication regimen is imperative because of the risk of developing resistant strains of TB if the regimen is not followed faithfully. In some cases, when the patient's ability to comply with the medication regimen is in question, referral to an outpatient clinic for daily medication administration may be required. This is referred to as directly observed therapy (DOT).

\section*{Continuing Care}

The nurse evaluates the patient's environment, including home or workplace and social setting, to identify other people who may have been in contact with the patient during the infectious stage. It is important to arrange follow-up screening for any contacts of the infected person. Nurses who have contact with the patient in home, shelter, hospital, clinic, or work settings assess the patient's physical and psychological status and ability to adhere to the prescribed treatment. The nurse assesses the patient for adverse effects of medications and adherence to the therapeutic regimen (eg, taking medications as prescribed, practicing safe hygiene, consuming a nutritious and adequate diet, and participating in an appropriate level of activity). The nurse reinforces previous teaching and emphasizes the importance of
keeping scheduled appointments with the primary health care provider. In addition, the patient is reminded of the importance of other health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

\section*{LUNG ABSCESS}

A lung abscess is a localized necrotic lesion of the lung parenchyma containing purulent material that collapses and forms a cavity. It is generally caused by aspiration of anaerobic bacteria. By definition, the chest x-ray will demonstrate a cavity of at least 2 cm . Patients who have impaired cough reflexes and cannot close the glottis, or those with swallowing difficulties, are at risk for aspirating foreign material and developing a lung abscess. Other atrisk patients include those with central nervous system disorders (seizure, stroke), drug addiction, alcoholism, esophageal disease, or compromised immune function, those without teeth, as well as patients receiving nasogastric tube feedings and those with an altered state of consciousness from anesthesia.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Most lung abscesses are a complication of bacterial pneumonia or are caused by aspiration of oral anaerobes into the lung. Abscesses also may occur secondary to mechanical or functional obstruction of the bronchi by a tumor, foreign body, or bronchial stenosis, or from necrotizing pneumonias, TB, pulmonary embolism, or chest trauma.

Most abscesses are found in areas of the lung that may be affected by aspiration. The site of the lung abscess is related to gravity and is determined by the patient's position. For patients who
are confined to bed, the posterior segment of an upper lobe and the superior segment of the lower lobe are the most common areas in which lung abscess occurs. However, atypical presentations may occur, depending on the position of the patient when the aspiration occurred.

Initially, the cavity in the lung may or may not extend directly into a bronchus. Eventually the abscess becomes surrounded, or encapsulated, by a wall of fibrous tissue. The necrotic process may extend until it reaches the lumen of a bronchus or the pleural space and establishes communication with the respiratory tract, the pleural cavity, or both. If the bronchus is involved, the purulent contents are expectorated continuously in the form of sputum. If the pleura is involved, an empyema results. A communication or connection between the bronchus and pleura is known as a bronchopleural fistula.

The organisms frequently associated with lung abscesses are S. aureus, Klebsiella, and other gram-negative species. Anaerobic organisms, however, may also be present. The organism varies depending on the underlying predisposing factors.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical manifestations of a lung abscess may vary from a mild productive cough to acute illness. Most patients have a fever and a productive cough with moderate to copious amounts of foulsmelling, often bloody, sputum. Leukocytosis may be present. Pleurisy or dull chest pain, dyspnea, weakness, anorexia, and weight loss are common. Fever and cough may develop insidiously and may have been present for several weeks before diagnosis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Physical examination of the chest may reveal dullness on percussion and decreased or absent breath sounds with an intermittent pleural friction rub (grating or rubbing sound) on auscultation. Crackles may be present. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by chest x-ray, sputum culture, and in some cases fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The chest x-ray reveals an infiltrate with an air-fluid level. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest may be required to provide more detailed pictures of different cross-sectional areas of the lung.

\section*{Prevention}

The following measures will reduce the risk of lung abscess:
- Appropriate antibiotic therapy before any dental procedures in patients who must have teeth extracted while their gums and teeth are infected
- Adequate dental and oral hygiene, because anaerobic bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of lung abscess
- Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for patients with pneumonia

\section*{Medical Management}

The findings of the history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and sputum culture indicate the type of organism and the treatment required. Adequate drainage of the lung abscess may be achieved through postural drainage and chest physiotherapy. The patient should be assessed for an adequate cough. A few patients need a percutaneous chest catheter placed for long-term drainage of the abscess. Therapeutic use of bronchoscopy to drain an abscess is uncommon. A diet high in protein and calories is necessary because
chronic infection is associated with a catabolic state, necessitating increased intake of calories and protein to facilitate healing. Surgical intervention is rare, but pulmonary resection (lobectomy) is performed when there is massive hemoptysis (coughing up of blood) or little or no response to medical management.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Intravenous antimicrobial therapy depends on the results of the sputum culture and sensitivity and is administered for an extended period. Penicillin G or clindamycin (Cleocin) is the medication of choice, followed by penicillin with metronidazole. Large intravenous doses are generally required because the antibiotic must penetrate the necrotic tissue and the fluid in the abscess. The intravenous dose is continued until there is evidence of symptom improvement.

Long-term therapy with oral antibiotics replaces intravenous therapy after the patient shows signs of improvement (usually 3 to 5 days). Improvement is demonstrated by normal temperature, decreased white blood cell count, and improvement on the chest x-ray (resolution of surrounding infiltrate, reduction in cavity size, absence of fluid). Oral administration of antibiotic therapy is continued for an additional 4 to 8 weeks. If treatment stops too soon, a relapse may occur.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse administers antibiotics and intravenous therapies as prescribed and monitors for adverse effects. Chest physiotherapy is initiated as prescribed to facilitate drainage of the abscess. The nurse teaches the patient to perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises to help expand the lungs. To ensure proper nutritional intake, the nurse encourages a diet high in protein and calories. The nurse also offers emotional support because the abscess may take a long time to resolve.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient who has had surgery may return home before the wound closes entirely or with a drain or tube in place. Thus, the patient or a caregiver needs instruction on how to change the dressings to prevent skin excoriation and odor, how to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, and how to care for and maintain the drain or tube. The nurse instructs the patient to perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises every 2 hours during the day and shows a caregiver how to perform chest percussion and postural drainage to facilitate expectoration of lung secretions.

Continuing Care. Referral for home care may be required by some patients whose condition requires therapy at home. During visits to the patient at home, the nurse assesses the patient's physical condition, nutritional status, and home environment as well as the patient's and family's ability to carry out the therapeutic regimen. Patient teaching is reinforced during home visits, and nutrition counseling is provided with the goal of attaining and maintaining an optimal state of nutrition. To prevent a relapse, the nurse emphasizes the importance of completing the antibiotic regimen and of following the suggestions for rest and appropriate activity. If intravenous antibiotic therapy is to continue at home, the services of a home care nurse may be arranged to initiate intravenous therapy and to evaluate its administration by the patient or family. Although most outpatient intravenous therapy
is administered in the home setting, a patient may visit a nearby clinic or physician's office for this treatment. In some cases the patient with lung abscess may have ignored his or her health. Therefore, it is important to use this opportunity to address health promotion strategies and health screening with the patient.

\section*{Pleural Conditions}

Pleural conditions are disorders that involve the membranes covering the lungs (visceral pleura) and the surface of the chest wall (parietal pleura) or disorders affecting the pleural space.

\section*{PLEURISY}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Pleurisy (pleuritis) refers to inflammation of both layers of the pleurae (parietal and visceral). Pleurisy may develop in conjunction with pneumonia or an upper respiratory tract infection, TB, or collagen disease; after trauma to the chest, pulmonary infarction, or pulmonary embolism; in patients with primary and metastatic cancer; and after thoracotomy. The parietal pleura has nerve endings; the visceral pleura does not. When the inflamed pleural membranes rub together during respiration (intensified on inspiration), the result is severe, sharp, knifelike pain.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The key characteristic of pleuritic pain is its relationship to respiratory movement. Taking a deep breath, coughing, or sneezing worsens the pain. Pleuritic pain is restricted in distribution rather than diffuse; it usually occurs only on one side. The pain may become minimal or absent when the breath is held, or it may be localized or radiate to the shoulder or abdomen. Later, as pleural fluid develops, the pain decreases.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In the early period, when little fluid has accumulated, a pleural friction rub can be heard with the stethoscope, only to disappear later as more fluid accumulates and separates the inflamed pleural surfaces. Diagnostic tests may include chest x-rays, sputum examinations, thoracentesis to obtain a specimen of pleural fluid for examination, and less commonly a pleural biopsy.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying condition causing the pleurisy and to relieve the pain. As the underlying disease (pneumonia, infection) is treated, the pleuritic inflammation usually resolves. At the same time, it is necessary to monitor for signs and symptoms of pleural effusion, such as shortness of breath, pain, assumption of a position that decreases pain, and decreased chest wall excursion.

Prescribed analgesics and topical applications of heat or cold provide symptomatic relief. Indomethacin (Indocin), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), may provide pain relief while allowing the patient to take deep breaths and cough more effectively. If the pain is severe, an intercostal nerve block may be required.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Because the patient has considerable pain on inspiration, the nurse can offer suggestions to enhance comfort, such as turning frequently onto the affected side to splint the chest wall and reduce the stretching of the pleurae. The nurse also can teach the patient to use the hands or a pillow to splint the rib cage while coughing.

\section*{PLEURAL EFFUSION}

Pleural effusion, a collection of fluid in the pleural space, is rarely a primary disease process but is usually secondary to other diseases. Normally, the pleural space contains a small amount of fluid ( 5 to 15 mL ), which acts as a lubricant that allows the pleural surfaces to move without friction (Fig. 23-5). Pleural effusion may be a complication of heart failure, TB, pneumonia, pulmonary infections (particularly viral infections), nephrotic syndrome, connective tissue disease, pulmonary embolism, and neoplastic tumors. Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common malignancy associated with a pleural effusion.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In certain disorders, fluid may accumulate in the pleural space to a point where it becomes clinically evident. This almost always has pathologic significance. The effusion can be composed of a relatively clear fluid, or it can be bloody or purulent. An effusion

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

\caption{EIGURE 23-5 In pleural effusion, an abnormal volume of fluid collects in the pleural space, causing pain and shortness of breath. Pleural effusion is usually secondary to other disease processes.}
\end{figure}
of clear fluid may be a transudate or an exudate. A transudate (filtrates of plasma that move across intact capillary walls) occurs when factors influencing the formation and reabsorption of pleural fluid are altered, usually by imbalances in hydrostatic or oncotic pressures. The finding of a transudative effusion generally implies that the pleural membranes are not diseased. The most common cause of a transudative effusion is heart failure. An exudate (extravasation of fluid into tissues or a cavity) usually results from inflammation by bacterial products or tumors involving the pleural surfaces.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Usually the clinical manifestations are those caused by the underlying disease. Pneumonia causes fever, chills, and pleuritic chest pain, whereas a malignant effusion may result in dyspnea and coughing. The size of the effusion and the patient's underlying lung disease determine the severity of symptoms. A large pleural effusion causes shortness of breath. When a small to moderate pleural effusion is present, dyspnea may be absent or only minimal. The severity of the symptoms assessed depends on the time course of the development of the pleural effusion and the patient's underlying disease.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment of the area of the pleural effusion reveals decreased or absent breath sounds, decreased fremitus, and a dull, flat sound when percussed. In an extremely large pleural effusion, the assessment reveals a patient in acute respiratory distress. Tracheal deviation away from the affected side may also be noted.

Physical examination, chest x-ray, chest CT scan, and thoracentesis confirm the presence of fluid. In some instances, a lateral decubitus x-ray is obtained. For this x-ray, the patient lies on the affected side in a side-lying position. A pleural effusion can be diagnosed because this position allows for the "layering out" of the fluid, and an air-fluid line is visible.

Pleural fluid is analyzed by bacterial culture, Gram stain, acidfast bacillus stain (for TB), red and white blood cell counts, chemistry studies (glucose, amylase, lactic dehydrogenase, protein), cytologic analysis for malignant cells, and pH . A pleural biopsy also may be performed.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying cause, to prevent reaccumulation of fluid, and to relieve discomfort, dyspnea, and respiratory compromise. Specific treatment is directed at the underlying cause (eg, heart failure, pneumonia, lung cancer, cirrhosis). If the pleural fluid is an exudate, more extensive diagnostic procedures are performed to determine the cause. Treatment for the primary cause is then instituted.

Thoracentesis is performed to remove fluid, to obtain a specimen for analysis, and to relieve dyspnea and respiratory compromise (see Chap. 21). Thoracentesis may be performed under ultrasound guidance. Depending on the size of the pleural effusion, the patient may be treated by removing the fluid during the thoracentesis procedure or by inserting a chest tube connected to a water-seal drainage system or suction to evacuate the pleural space and re-expand the lung.

If the underlying cause is a malignancy, however, the effusion tends to recur within a few days or weeks. Repeated thoracente-
ses result in pain, depletion of protein and electrolytes, and sometimes pneumothorax. Once the pleural space is adequately drained, a chemical pleurodesis may be performed to obliterate the pleural space and prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Pleurodesis may be performed using a thoracoscopic approach or via a chest tube. Chemically irritating agents (eg., bleomycin or talc) are instilled in the pleural space. With the chest tube insertion approach, after the agent is instilled, the chest tube is clamped for 60 to 90 minutes and the patient is assisted to assume various positions to promote uniform distribution of the agent and to maximize its contact with the pleural surfaces. The tube is unclamped as prescribed, and chest drainage may be continued several days longer to prevent reaccumulation of fluid and to promote the formation of adhesions between the visceral and parietal pleurae.

Other treatments for malignant pleural effusions include surgical pleurectomy, insertion of a small catheter attached to a drainage bottle for outpatient management, or implantation of a pleuroperitoneal shunt. A pleuroperitoneal shunt consists of two catheters connected by a pump chamber containing two one-way valves. Fluid moves from the pleural space to the pump chamber and then to the peritoneal cavity. The patient manually pumps on the reservoir daily to move fluid from the pleural space to the peritoneal space (Taubert \& Wright, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse's role in the care of the patient with a pleural effusion includes implementing the medical regimen. The nurse prepares and positions the patient for thoracentesis and offers support throughout the procedure. Pain management is a priority, and the nurse assists the patient to assume positions that are the least painful. However, frequent turning and ambulation are important to facilitate drainage. The nurse administers analgesics as prescribed and as needed.

If a chest tube drainage and water-seal system is used, the nurse is responsible for monitoring the system's function and recording the amount of drainage at prescribed intervals. Nursing care related to the underlying cause of the pleural effusion is specific to the underlying condition. Care of the patient with a chest tube is discussed in Chapter 25.

If the patient is to be managed as an outpatient with a pleural catheter for drainage, the nurse is responsible for educating the patient and family regarding management and care of the catheter and drainage system.

\section*{EMPYEMA}

An empyema is an accumulation of thick, purulent fluid within the pleural space, often with fibrin development and a loculated (walled-off) area where infection is located. Most empyemas occur as complications of bacterial pneumonia or lung abscess. Other causes include penetrating chest trauma, hematogenous infection of the pleural space, nonbacterial infections, or iatrogenic causes (after thoracic surgery or thoracentesis).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

At first the pleural fluid is thin, with a low leukocyte count, but it frequently progresses to a fibropurulent stage and, finally, to a stage where it encloses the lung within a thick exudative membrane (loculated empyema).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

With an empyema, the patient is acutely ill and has signs and symptoms similar to those of an acute respiratory infection or pneumonia (fever, night sweats, pleural pain, cough, dyspnea, anorexia, weight loss). If the patient is immunocompromised, the symptoms may be more vague. If the patient has received antimicrobial therapy, the clinical manifestations may be less obvious.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Chest auscultation demonstrates decreased or absent breath sounds over the affected area, and there is dullness on chest percussion as well as decreased fremitus. The diagnosis is established by a chest x-ray or chest CT scan. Usually a diagnostic thoracentesis is performed, often under ultrasound guidance.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to drain the pleural cavity and to achieve full expansion of the lung. The fluid is drained and appropriate antibiotics, in large doses, are prescribed based on the causative organism. Sterilization of the empyema cavity requires 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics. Drainage of the pleural fluid depends on the stage of the disease and is accomplished by one of the following methods:
- Needle aspiration (thoracentesis) with a thin percutaneous catheter, if the volume is small and the fluid not too purulent or thick
- Tube thoracostomy (chest drainage using a large-diameter intercostal tube attached to water-seal drainage [see Chap. 25]) with fibrinolytic agents instilled through the chest tube in patients with loculated or complicated pleural effusions
- Open chest drainage via thoracotomy, including potential rib resection, to remove the thickened pleura, pus, and debris and to remove the underlying diseased pulmonary tissue

With long-standing inflammation, an exudate can form over the lung, trapping it and interfering with its normal expansion. This exudate must be removed surgically (decortication). The drainage tube is left in place until the pus-filled space is obliterated completely. The complete obliteration of the pleural space is monitored by serial chest x-rays, and the patient should be informed that treatment may be long term. Patients are frequently discharged from the hospital with a chest tube in place, with instructions to monitor fluid drainage at home.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Resolution of empyema is a prolonged process. The nurse helps the patient cope with the condition and instructs the patient in lung-expanding breathing exercises to restore normal respiratory function. The nurse also provides care specific to the method of drainage of the pleural fluid (eg, needle aspiration, closed chest drainage, or rib resection and drainage). When a patient is discharged to home with a drainage tube or system in place, the nurse instructs the patient and family on care of the drainage system and drain site, measurement and observation of drainage, signs and symptoms of infection, and how and when to contact the health care provider. (See Nursing Process: The Patient Undergoing Thoracic Surgery in Chapter 25.)

\section*{Pulmonary Edema}

Pulmonary edema is defined as abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lung tissue and/or alveolar space. It is a severe, lifethreatening condition.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Pulmonary edema most commonly occurs as a result of increased microvascular pressure from abnormal cardiac function. The backup of blood into the pulmonary vasculature resulting from inadequate left ventricular function causes an increased microvascular pressure, and fluid begins to leak into the interstitial space and the alveoli. Other causes of pulmonary edema are hypervolemia or a sudden increase in the intravascular pressure in the lung. One example of this is in the patient who has undergone pneumonectomy. When one lung has been removed, all the cardiac output then goes to the remaining lung. If the patient's fluid status is not monitored closely, pulmonary edema can quickly develop in the postoperative period as the patient's pulmonary vasculature attempts to adapt. This type of pulmonary edema is sometimes termed "flash" pulmonary edema. A second example is called re-expansion pulmonary edema. This may be due to a rapid reinflation of the lung after removal of air from a pneumothorax or evacuation of fluid from a large pleural effusion.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient has increasing respiratory distress, characterized by dyspnea, air hunger, and central cyanosis. The patient is usually very anxious and often agitated. As the fluid leaks into the alveoli and mixes with air, a foam or froth is formed. The patient coughs up or the nurse suctions out these foamy, frothy, and often blood-tinged secretions. The patient has acute respiratory distress and may become confused or stuporous.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Auscultation reveals crackles in the lung bases (especially in the posterior bases) that rapidly progress toward the apices of the lungs. These crackles are due to the movement of air through the alveolar fluid. The chest x-ray reveals increased interstitial markings. The patient may be tachycardic, the pulse oximetry values begin to fall, and arterial blood gas analysis demonstrates increasing hypoxemia.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management focuses on correcting the underlying disorder. If the pulmonary edema is cardiac in origin, then improvement in left ventricular function is the goal. Vasodilators, inotropic medications, afterload or preload agents, or contractility medications may be given. Additional cardiac measures (eg, intra-aortic balloon pump) may be indicated if the patient does not respond. If the problem is fluid overload, diuretics are given and the patient is placed on fluid restrictions. Oxygen is administered to correct the hypoxemia; in some circumstances, intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary. The patient is extremely anxious, and morphine is administered to reduce anxiety and control pain.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient with pulmonary edema includes assisting with administration of oxygen and intubation and mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs. The nurse also administers medications (ie, morphine, vasodilators, inotropic medications, preload and afterload agents) as prescribed and monitors the patient's response. Nursing management in pulmonary edema is described in more detail in Chapter 30.

\section*{Acute Respiratory Failure}

Respiratory failure is a sudden and life-threatening deterioration of the gas exchange function of the lung. It exists when the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide in the lungs cannot keep up with the rate of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production by the cells of the body.

Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is defined as a fall in arterial oxygen tension $\left(\mathrm{PaO}_{2}\right)$ to less than 50 mm Hg (hypoxemia) and a rise in arterial carbon dioxide tension ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ) to greater than 50 mm Hg (hypercapnia), with an arterial pH of less than 7.35. In ARF, the ventilation or perfusion mechanisms in the lung are impaired. Respiratory system mechanisms leading to ARF include:
- Alveolar hypoventilation
- Diffusion abnormalities
- Ventilation-perfusion mismatching
- Shunting

It is important to distinguish between ARF and chronic respiratory failure. Chronic respiratory failure is defined as a deterioration in the gas exchange function of the lung that has developed insidiously or has persisted for a long period after an episode of ARF. The absence of acute symptoms and the presence of a chronic respiratory acidosis suggest the chronicity of the respiratory failure. Two causes of chronic respiratory failure are COPD (discussed in Chap. 24) and neuromuscular diseases (discussed in Chap. 65). Patients with these disorders develop a tolerance to the gradually worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia. However, a patient with chronic respiratory failure may develop ARF. This is seen in the COPD patient who develops an exacerbation or infection that causes additional deterioration of the gas exchange mechanism. The principles of management of acute versus chronic respiratory failure are different; the following discussion will be limited to ARF.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Common causes of ARF can be classified into four categories: decreased respiratory drive, dysfunction of the chest wall, dysfunction of the lung parenchyma, and other causes.

\section*{DECREASED RESPIRATORY DRIVE}

Decreased respiratory drive may occur with severe brain injury, large lesions of the brain stem (multiple sclerosis), use of sedative medications, and metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism. These disorders impair the normal response of chemoreceptors in the brain to normal respiratory stimulation.

\section*{DYSFUNCTION OF THE CHEST WALL}

The impulses arising in the respiratory center travel through nerves that extend from the brain stem down the spinal cord to receptors in the muscles of respiration. Thus, any disease or disorder of the nerves, spinal cord, muscles, or neuromuscular junc-
tion involved in respiration seriously affects ventilation and may ultimately lead to ARF. These include musculoskeletal disorders (muscular dystrophy, polymyositis), neuromuscular junction disorders (myasthenia gravis, poliomyelitis), some peripheral nerve disorders, and spinal cord disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and cervical spinal cord injuries).

\section*{DYSFUNCTION OF LUNG PARENCHYMA}

Pleural effusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax, and upper airway obstruction are conditions that interfere with ventilation by preventing expansion of the lung. These conditions, which may cause respiratory failure, usually are produced by an underlying lung disease, pleural disease, or trauma and injury. Other diseases and conditions of the lung that lead to ARF include pneumonia, status asthmaticus, lobar atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary edema.

\section*{OTHER CAUSES}

In the postoperative period, especially after major thoracic or abdominal surgery, inadequate ventilation and respiratory failure may occur because of several factors. During this period, for example, ARF may be caused by the effects of anesthetic agents, analgesics, and sedatives, which may depress respiration as described earlier or enhance the effects of opioids and lead to hypoventilation. Pain may interfere with deep breathing and coughing. A mismatch of ventilation to perfusion is the usual cause of respiratory failure after major abdominal, cardiac, or thoracic surgery.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Early signs are those associated with impaired oxygenation and may include restlessness, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, air hunger, tachycardia, and increased blood pressure. As the hypoxemia progresses, more obvious signs may be present, including confusion, lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, central cyanosis, diaphoresis, and finally respiratory arrest. Physical findings are those of acute respiratory distress, including use of accessory muscles, decreased breath sounds if the patient cannot adequately ventilate, and other findings related specifically to the underlying disease process and cause of ARF.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to correct the underlying cause and to restore adequate gas exchange in the lung. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation while the underlying cause is corrected.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient with ARF includes assisting with intubation and maintaining mechanical ventilation (described in Chap. 25). The nurse assesses the patient's respiratory status by monitoring the patient's level of response, arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, and vital signs and assessing the respiratory system. The nurse implements strategies (eg, turning schedule, mouth care, skin care, range of motion of extremities) to prevent complications. The nurse also assesses the patient's understanding of the management strategies that are used and initiates some form of communication to enable the patient to express his or her needs to the health care team. Nursing care also addresses the problems
that led to ARF. As the patient's status improves, the nurse assesses the patient's knowledge of the underlying disorder and provides teaching as appropriate to address the underlying disorder.

\section*{Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; previously called adult respiratory distress syndrome) is a clinical syndrome characterized by a sudden and progressive pulmonary edema, increasing bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, hypoxemia refractory to oxygen supplementation, and reduced lung compliance. These signs occur in the absence of left-sided heart failure. Patients with ARDS usually require mechanical ventilation with a higher-thannormal airway pressure. A wide range of factors are associated with the development of ARDS (Chart 23-6), including direct injury to the lungs (eg, smoke inhalation) or indirect insult to the lungs (eg, shock). ARDS has been associated with a mortality rate as high as $50 \%$ to $60 \%$. The major cause of death in ARDS is nonpulmonary multiple-system organ failure, often with sepsis.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

ARDS occurs as a result of an inflammatory trigger that initiates the release of cellular and chemical mediators, causing injury to the alveolar capillary membrane. This results in leakage of fluid into the alveolar interstitial spaces and alterations in the capillary bed.

Severe ventilation-perfusion mismatching occurs in ARDS. Alveoli collapse because of the inflammatory infiltrate, blood, fluid, and surfactant dysfunction. Small airways are narrowed because of interstitial fluid and bronchial obstruction. The lung compliance becomes markedly decreased (stiff lungs), and the result is a characteristic decrease in functional residual capacity and severe hypoxemia. The blood returning to the lung for gas exchange is pumped through the nonventilated, nonfunctioning areas of the lung, causing a shunt to develop. This means that blood is interfacing with nonfunctioning alveoli and gas exchange is markedly impaired, resulting in severe, refractory hypoxemia. Figure 23-6 shows the sequence of pathophysiologic events leading to ARDS.

\section*{23-6 Etiologic Factors Related to ARDS}

Aspiration (gastric secretions, drowning, hydrocarbons)
Drug ingestion and overdose
Hematologic disorders (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy [DIC], massive transfusions, cardiopulmonary bypass)
Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations of oxygen, smoke, or corrosive substances
Localized infection (bacterial, fungal, viral pneumonia)
Metabolic disorders (pancreatitis, uremia)
Shock (any cause)
Trauma (pulmonary contusion, multiple fractures, head injury)
Major surgery
Fat or air embolism
Systemic sepsis

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinically, the acute phase of ARDS is marked by a rapid onset of severe dyspnea that usually occurs 12 to 48 hours after the initiating event. A characteristic feature is arterial hypoxemia that does not respond to supplemental oxygen. On chest x-ray, the findings are similar to those seen with cardiogenic pulmonary edema and present as bilateral infiltrates that quickly worsen. The acute lung injury then progresses to fibrosing alveolitis with persistent, severe hypoxemia. The patient also has increased alveolar dead space (ventilation to alveoli, but poor perfusion) and decreased pulmonary compliance ("stiff lungs," which are difficult to ventilate). Clinically, a patient is thought to be in the recovery phase if the hypoxemia gradually resolves, the chest x-ray improves, and the lungs become more compliant (Ware \& Matthay, 2000).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Intercostal retractions and crackles, as the fluid begins to leak into the alveolar interstitial space, are evident on physical examination. A diagnosis of ARDS may be made based on the following crite-

EIGURE 23-6 Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Adapted from Farzan, S. (1997). A concise handbook of respiratory diseases (4th ed.). Stamford, CT: Appleton \& Lange.
ria: a history of systemic or pulmonary risk factors, acute onset of respiratory distress, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, clinical absence of left-sided heart failure, and a ratio of partial pressure of oxygen of arterial blood to fraction of inspired oxygen ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2} / \mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ ) less than 200 mm Hg (severe refractory hypoxemia).

\section*{Medical Management}

The primary focus in the management of ARDS includes identification and treatment of the underlying condition. Aggressive, supportive care must be provided to compensate for the severe respiratory dysfunction. This supportive therapy almost always includes intubation and mechanical ventilation. In addition, circulatory support, adequate fluid volume, and nutritional support are important. Supplemental oxygen is used as the patient begins the initial spiral of hypoxemia. As the hypoxemia progresses, intubation and mechanical ventilation are instituted. The concentration of oxygen and ventilator settings and modes are determined by the patient's status. This is monitored by arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and bedside pulmonary function testing.

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a critical part of the treatment of ARDS. PEEP usually improves oxygenation, but it does not influence the natural history of the syndrome. Use of PEEP helps to increase functional residual capacity and reverse alveolar collapse by keeping the alveoli open, resulting in improved arterial oxygenation and a reduction in the severity of the ventilation-perfusion imbalance. By using PEEP, a lower $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ may be required. The goal is a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ greater than 60 mm Hg or an oxygen saturation level of greater than $90 \%$ at the lowest possible $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$. PEEP and modes of mechanical ventilation are discussed in Chapter 25.

Systemic hypotension may occur in ARDS as a result of hypovolemia secondary to leakage of fluid into the interstitial spaces and depressed cardiac output from high levels of PEEP therapy. Hypovolemia must be carefully treated without causing further overload. Intravenous crystalloid solutions are administered, with careful monitoring of pulmonary status. Inotropic or vasopressor agents may be required. Pulmonary artery pressure catheters are used to monitor the patient's fluid status and the severe and progressive pulmonary hypertension sometimes observed in ARDS.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Numerous pharmacologic treatments are under investigation to stop the cascade of events leading to ARDS. These include human recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, neutrophil inhibitors, pulmonary-specific vasodilators, surfactant replacement therapy, antisepsis agents, antioxidant therapy, and corticosteroids late in the course of ARDS (Ware \& Matthay, 2000).

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

Adequate nutritional support is vital in the treatment of ARDS. Patients with ARDS require 35 to $45 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day to meet caloric requirements. Enteral feeding is the first consideration; however, parenteral nutrition also may be required.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{GENERAL MEASURES}

The patient with ARDS is critically ill and requires close monitoring because the condition could quickly change to a life-
threatening situation. Most of the respiratory modalities discussed in Chapter 25 are used in this situation (oxygen administration, nebulizer therapy, chest physiotherapy, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, suctioning, bronchoscopy). Frequent assessment of the patient's status is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.

In addition to implementing the medical plan of care, the nurse considers other needs of the patient. Positioning is important. The nurse should turn the patient frequently to improve ventilation and perfusion in the lungs and enhance secretion drainage. However, the nurse must closely monitor the patient for deterioration in oxygenation with changes in position. Oxygenation in the ARDS patient is sometimes improved in the prone position and may be used in special circumstances; studies to assess the benefits and problems of such positioning are ongoing (Curley, 2000; Marion, 2001).

The patient is extremely anxious and agitated because of the increasing hypoxemia and dyspnea. The nurse should explain all procedures and provide care in a calm, reassuring manner. It is important to reduce the patient's anxiety because anxiety prevents rest and increases oxygen expenditure. Rest is essential to reduce oxygen consumption, thereby reducing oxygen needs.

\section*{VENTILATOR CONSIDERATIONS}

If the patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with PEEP, several considerations must be addressed. PEEP, which causes increased end-expiratory pressure, is an unnatural pattern of breathing and feels strange to the patient. The patient may be anxious and "fight" the ventilator. Nursing assessment is important to assess for problems with ventilation that may be causing the anxiety reaction: tube blockage by kinking or retained secretions; other acute respiratory problems (eg, pneumothorax, pain); a sudden drop in the oxygen level; the patient's level of dyspnea; or ventilator malfunction. In some cases, sedation may be required to decrease the patient's oxygen consumption, allow the ventilator to provide full support of ventilation, and decrease the patient's anxiety. Possible sedatives are lorazepam (Ativan), midazolam (Versed), haloperidol (Haldol), propofol (Diprivan), and short-acting barbiturates.

If the PEEP level cannot be maintained despite the use of sedatives, neuromuscular blocking agents, such as pancuronium (Pavulon), vecuronium (Norcuron), atracurium (Tracrium), and rocuronium (Zemuron), may be given to paralyze the patient. This allows the patient to be ventilated more easily. With paralysis, the patient appears unconscious, loses motor function, and cannot breathe, talk, or blink independently. However, the patient retains sensation and is awake and able to hear. The nurse must reassure the patient that the paralysis is a result of the medication and is temporary. Paralysis should be used for the shortest possible time and never without adequate sedation.

Use of paralytic agents has many dangers and side effects. The nurse must be sure the patient does not become disconnected from the ventilator, because respiratory muscles are paralyzed and the patient will be apneic. Consequently, the nurse ensures that the patient is closely monitored at all times. All ventilator and patient alarms should be on at all times. Eye care is important as well because the patient cannot blink, increasing the risk of corneal abrasions. Neuromuscular blockers predispose patients to the development of deep venous thrombi, muscle atrophy, and skin breakdown. Nursing assessment is essential to minimize the complications related to neuromuscular blockade. The patient may have discomfort or pain but cannot communicate these sensations.

Analgesia is usually administered concurrently with neuromuscular blocking agents. The nurse must anticipate the patient's needs regarding pain and comfort. The nurse checks the patient's position to ensure it is comfortable and in normal alignment and talks to, and not about, the patient while in the patient's presence.

In addition, it is important for the nurse to describe the purpose and effects of the paralytic agents to the family. This experience can be very frightening to family members if they are unaware that these agents have been administered.

\section*{Pulmonary Hypertension}

Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that is not clinically evident until late in its progression. Pulmonary hypertension exists when the systolic pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 30 mm Hg or the mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 25 mm Hg . These pressures cannot be measured indirectly as can systemic blood pressure; instead, they must be measured during right-sided heart catheterization. In the absence of these measurements, clinical recognition becomes the only indicator for the presence of pulmonary hypertension.

There are two forms of pulmonary hypertension: primary (or idiopathic) and secondary. Primary pulmonary hypertension is an uncommon disease in which the diagnosis is made by excluding all other possible causes. The exact cause is unknown, but there are several possible causes (Chart 23-7). The clinical presentation of primary pulmonary hypertension exists with no evidence of pulmonary and cardiac disease or pulmonary embolism. It occurs most often in women 20 to 40 years of age and is usually fatal within 5 years of diagnosis.

\end{tabular}

Secondary pulmonary hypertension is more common and results from existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The prognosis depends on the severity of the underlying disorder and the changes in the pulmonary vascular bed. A common cause of secondary pulmonary hypertension is pulmonary artery constriction due to hypoxemia from COPD.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The underlying process of pulmonary hypertension varies, and multiple factors are often responsible. Normally, the pulmonary vascular bed can handle the blood volume delivered by the right ventricle. It has a low resistance to blood flow and compensates for increased blood volume by dilation of the vessels in the pulmonary circulation. However, if the pulmonary vascular bed is destroyed or obstructed, as in pulmonary hypertension, the ability to handle whatever flow or volume of blood it receives is impaired, and the increased blood flow then increases the pulmonary artery pressure. As the pulmonary arterial pressure increases, the pulmonary vascular resistance also increases. Both pulmonary artery constriction (as in hypoxemia or hypercapnia) and a reduction of the pulmonary vascular bed (which occurs with pulmonary emboli) result in an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure. This increased workload affects right ventricular function. The myocardium ultimately cannot meet the increasing demands imposed on it, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement and dilation) and failure.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Dyspnea is the main symptom of pulmonary hypertension, occurring at first with exertion and eventually at rest. Substernal chest pain also is common, affecting $25 \%$ to $50 \%$ of patients. Other signs and symptoms include weakness, fatigue, syncope, occasional hemoptysis, and signs of right-sided heart failure (peripheral edema, ascites, distended neck veins, liver engorgement, crackles, heart murmur).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A complete diagnostic evaluation includes a history, physical examination, chest x-ray, pulmonary function studies, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, ventilation-perfusion scan, and cardiac catheterization. In some cases, a lung biopsy, performed by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy, may be needed to make a definite diagnosis. Cardiac catheterization of the right side of the heart reveals elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. An echocardiogram can assess the progression of the disease and rule out other conditions with similar signs and symptoms. The ECG reveals right ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation, and tall peaked P waves in inferior leads, tall anterior R waves, and ST-segment depression and/or T-wave inversion anteriorly. The $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ also is decreased (hypoxemia). A ventilation-perfusion scan or pulmonary angiography detects defects in pulmonary vasculature, such as pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary function studies may be normal or show a slight decrease in vital capacity (VC) and lung compliance, with a mild decrease in the diffusing capacity.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of treatment is to manage the underlying cardiac or pulmonary condition. Most patients with primary pulmonary hypertension do not have hypoxemia at rest but require supplemental
oxygen with exercise. However, patients with severe right ventricular failure, decreased cardiac output, and progressive disease may have resting hypoxemia and require continuous oxygen supplementation. Appropriate oxygen therapy (see Chap. 25) reverses the vasoconstriction and reduces the pulmonary hypertension in a relatively short time.

In the presence of cor pulmonale, which is discussed in the section that follows, treatment should include fluid restriction, diuretics to decrease fluid accumulation, cardiac glycosides (eg, digitalis) in an attempt to improve cardiac function, calcium channel blockers for vasodilation, and rest. In primary pulmonary hypertension, vasodilators have been administered with variable success (eg, calcium channel blockers, intravenous prostacyclin). Prostacyclin (PGX [Flolan]) is one of the prostaglandins produced by the pulmonary endothelium. Intravenous prostacyclin (epoprostenol) helps to decrease pulmonary hypertension by reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and pressures and increasing cardiac output. Anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin) have been given to patients because of chronic pulmonary emboli. Heart-lung transplantation has been successful in select patients with primary hypertension who have not been responsive to other therapies.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The major nursing goal is to identify patients at high risk for pulmonary hypertension, such as those with COPD, pulmonary emboli, congenital heart disease, and mitral valve disease. The nurse also must be alert for signs and symptoms, administer oxygen therapy appropriately, and instruct patients and their families about the use of home oxygen supplementation.

\section*{Pulmonary Heart Disease (Cor Pulmonale)}

Cor pulmonale is a condition in which the right ventricle of the heart enlarges (with or without right-sided heart failure) as a result of diseases that affect the structure or function of the lung or its vasculature. Any disease affecting the lungs and accompanied by hypoxemia may result in cor pulmonale. The most frequent cause is severe COPD (see Chap. 24), in which changes in the airway and retained secretions reduce alveolar ventilation. Other causes are conditions that restrict or compromise ventilatory function, leading to hypoxemia or acidosis (deformities of the thoracic cage, massive obesity), or conditions that reduce the pulmonary vascular bed (primary idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary embolus). Certain disorders of the nervous system, respiratory muscles, chest wall, and pulmonary arterial tree also may be responsible for cor pulmonale.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Pulmonary disease can produce physiologic changes that in time affect the heart and cause the right ventricle to enlarge and eventually fail. Any condition that deprives the lungs of oxygen can cause hypoxemia and hypercapnia, resulting in ventilatory insufficiency. Hypoxemia and hypercapnia cause pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and possibly reduction of the pulmonary vascular bed, as in emphysema or pulmonary emboli. The result is increased resistance in the pulmonary circulatory system, with a subsequent rise in pulmonary blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension). A mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 45 mm Hg or more may occur in cor pulmonale. Right ventricular hypertrophy
may result, followed by right ventricular failure. In short, cor pulmonale results from pulmonary hypertension, which causes the right side of the heart to enlarge because of the increased work required to pump blood against high resistance through the pulmonary vascular system.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of cor pulmonale are usually related to the underlying lung disease, such as COPD. With right ventricular failure, the patient may develop increasing edema of the feet and legs, distended neck veins, an enlarged palpable liver, pleural effusion, ascites, and a heart murmur. Headache, confusion, and somnolence may occur as a result of increased levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Patients often complain of increasing shortness of breath, wheezing, cough, and fatigue.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to improve the patient's ventilation and to treat both the underlying lung disease and the manifestations of heart disease. Supplemental oxygen is administered to improve gas exchange and to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Improved oxygen transport relieves the pulmonary hypertension that is causing the cor pulmonale.

Better survival rates and greater reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance have been reported with continuous, 24 -hour oxygen therapy for patients with severe hypoxemia. Substantial improvement may require 4 to 6 weeks of oxygen therapy, usually in the home. Periodic assessment of pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases is necessary to determine the adequacy of alveolar ventilation and to monitor the effectiveness of oxygen therapy.

Ventilation is further improved with chest physical therapy and bronchial hygiene maneuvers as indicated to remove accumulated secretions, and the administration of bronchodilators. Further measures depend on the patient's condition. If the patient is in respiratory failure, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. If the patient is in heart failure, hypoxemia and hypercapnia must be relieved to improve cardiac function and output. Bed rest, sodium restriction, and diuretic therapy also are instituted judiciously to reduce peripheral edema (to lower pulmonary arterial pressure through a decrease in total blood volume) and the circulatory load on the right side of the heart. Digitalis may be prescribed to relieve pulmonary hypertension if the patient also has left ventricular failure, a supraventricular dysrhythmia, or right ventricular failure that does not respond to other therapy.

ECG monitoring may be indicated because of the high incidence of dysrhythmias in patients with cor pulmonale. Any pulmonary infection must be treated promptly to avoid further impaired gas exchange and exacerbations of hypoxemia and pulmonary heart disease. The prognosis depends on whether the pulmonary hypertension is reversible. (Management of acute respiratory failure was presented earlier in this chapter.)

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the patient with cor pulmonale addresses the underlying disorder leading to cor pulmonale as well as the problems related to pulmonary hyperventilation and right-sided cardiac failure. If intubation and mechanical ventilation are required to manage ARF, the nurse assists with the intubation procedure
and maintains mechanical ventilation. The nurse assesses the patient's respiratory and cardiac status and administers medications as prescribed.

During the patient's hospital stay, the nurse instructs the patient about the importance of close monitoring (fluid retention, weight gain, edema) and adherence to the therapeutic regimen, especially the 24 -hour use of oxygen. Factors that affect the patient's adherence to the treatment regimen are explored and addressed.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Most of the care and monitoring of the patient with cor pulmonale is performed by the patient and family in the home because it is a chronic disorder. If supplemental oxygen is administered, the nurse instructs the patient and the family in its use. Nutrition counseling is warranted if the patient is on a sodium-restricted diet or is taking diuretics. The nurse teaches the family to monitor for signs and symptoms of right ventricular failure and about emergency interventions and when to call for assistance. Most importantly, the nurse urges the patient to stop smoking.

Continuing Care. A referral for home care may be warranted for the patient who cannot manage self-care or for the patient whose physical condition warrants close assessment. During the home visit, the home care nurse evaluates the patient's status and the patient's and family members' understanding of the therapeutic regimen and their adherence to it. If oxygen is used in the home, the nurse determines if it is being administered safely and as prescribed. It is important to assess the patient's progress in stopping smoking and to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation with the patient and family. The nurse identifies strategies to assist with smoking cessation and refers the patient and family to community support groups. In addition, the patient is reminded about the importance of other health promotion and screening practices.

\section*{Pulmonary Embolism}

Pulmonary embolism (PE) refers to the obstruction of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches by a thrombus (or thrombi) that originates somewhere in the venous system or in the right side of the heart. Most commonly, PE is due to a blood clot or thrombus. However, there are other types of emboli: air, fat, amniotic fluid, and septic (from bacterial invasion of the thrombus). It is estimated that more than half a million people develop PE yearly, resulting in more than 50,000 deaths. PE is a common disorder and often is associated with trauma, surgery (orthopedic, major abdominal, pelvic, gynecologic), pregnancy, heart failure, age older than 50 years, hypercoagulable states, and prolonged immobility. It also may occur in an apparently healthy person. Risk factors for developing PE are identified in Chart 23-8.

Although most thrombi originate in the deep veins of the legs, other sites include the pelvic veins and the right atrium of the heart. A venous thrombosis can result from slowing of blood flow (stasis), secondary to damage to the blood vessel wall (particularly the endothelial lining) or changes in the blood coagulation mechanism. Atrial fibrillation is also a cause of pulmonary embolism. An enlarged right atrium in fibrillation causes blood to stagnate and form clots in this area. These clots are prone to travel into the pulmonary circulation.

\section*{Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolus}

Venous Stasis (slowing of blood flow in veins) Prolonged immobilization (especially postoperative) Prolonged periods of sitting/traveling Varicose veins Spinal cord injury
Hypercoagulability (due to release of tissue thromboplastin after injury/surgery) Injury Tumor (pancreatic, GI, GU, breast, lung) Increased platelet count (polycythemia, splenectomy) Venous Endothelial Disease Thrombophlebitis Vascular disease Foreign bodies (IV/central venous catheters)
Certain Disease States (combination of stasis, coagulation alterations, and venous injury) Heart disease (especially heart failure)
Trauma (especially fracture of hip, pelvis, vertebra, lower extremities)
Postoperative state/postpartum period Diabetes mellitus Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Other Predisposing Conditions Advanced age Obesity Pregnancy Oral contraceptive use History of previous thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism Constrictive clothing

\section*{Pathophysiology}

When a thrombus completely or partially obstructs a pulmonary artery or its branches, the alveolar dead space is increased. The area, although continuing to be ventilated, receives little or no blood flow. Thus, gas exchange is impaired or absent in this area. In addition, various substances are released from the clot and surrounding area, causing regional blood vessels and bronchioles to constrict. This causes an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. This reaction compounds the ventilation-perfusion imbalance.

The hemodynamic consequences are increased pulmonary vascular resistance from the regional vasoconstriction and reduced size of the pulmonary vascular bed. This results in an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and, in turn, an increase in right ventricular work to maintain pulmonary blood flow. When the work requirements of the right ventricle exceed its capacity, right ventricular failure occurs, leading to a decrease in cardiac output followed by a decrease in systemic blood pressure and the development of shock.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms of PE depend on the size of the thrombus and the area of the pulmonary artery occluded by the thrombus; they may be nonspecific. Dyspnea is the most frequent symptom; tachypnea (very rapid respiratory rate) is the most frequent sign (Goldhaber, 1998). The duration and intensity of the dyspnea depend on the extent of embolization. Chest pain is common and is usually sud-
den and pleuritic. It may be substernal and mimic angina pectoris or a myocardial infarction. Other symptoms include anxiety, fever, tachycardia, apprehension, cough, diaphoresis, hemoptysis, and syncope.

A massive embolism is best defined by the degree of hemodynamic instability rather than the percentage of pulmonary vasculature occlusion. It is described as an occlusion of the outflow tract of the main pulmonary artery or the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries that produces pronounced dyspnea, sudden substernal pain, rapid and weak pulse, shock, syncope, and sudden death. Multiple small emboli can lodge in the terminal pulmonary arterioles, producing multiple small infarctions of the lungs. A pulmonary infarction causes ischemic necrosis of an area of the lung and occurs in less than $10 \%$ of cases of PE (Arroliga, Matthay \& Matthay, 2000). The clinical picture may mimic that of bronchopneumonia or heart failure. In atypical instances, the disease causes few signs and symptoms, whereas in other instances it mimics various other cardiopulmonary disorders.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Death from PE commonly occurs within 1 hour of symptoms; thus, early recognition and diagnosis are priorities. Because the symptoms of PE can vary from few to severe, a diagnostic workup is performed to rule out other diseases. Deep venous thrombosis is closely associated with the development of PE. Typically, patients report sudden onset of pain and/or swelling and warmth of the proximal or distal extremity, skin discoloration, and superficial vein distention. The pain is usually relieved with elevation. The diagnostic workup includes a ventilation-perfusion scan, pulmonary angiography, chest x-ray, ECG, peripheral vascular studies, impedance plethysmography, and arterial blood gas analysis.

The chest x-ray is usually normal but may show infiltrates, atelectasis, elevation of the diaphragm on the affected side, or a pleural effusion. The chest x-ray is most helpful in excluding other possible causes. The ECG usually shows sinus tachycardia, PRinterval depression, and nonspecific T-wave changes. Peripheral vascular studies may include impedance plethysmography, Doppler ultrasonography, or venography (see Chap. 31). Test results confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE. Arterial blood gas analysis may show hypoxemia and hypocapnia (from tachypnea); however, arterial blood gas measurements are normal in up to $20 \%$ of patients with PE.

A ventilation-perfusion scan is the test of choice in patients with suspected PE. The perfusion portion of the scan may indicate areas of diminished or absent blood flow and is the most useful test to rule out clinically important PE. A ventilation scan may show whether there is also a ventilation abnormality present. A normal perfusion scan rules out the diagnosis of PE. If there is a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, the probability of PE is high. Spiral CT of the chest may also assist in the diagnosis.

If lung scan results are not definitive, pulmonary angiography, considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of PE, can be used. This test is invasive and is performed in the interventional radiology department. A contrast agent is injected into the pulmonary arterial system, allowing visualization of obstructions to blood flow and abnormalities.

\section*{Prevention}

For those at risk, the most effective approach to preventing PE is to prevent deep venous thrombosis. Active leg exercises to avoid venous stasis, early ambulation, and use of elastic compression stockings are general preventive measures. Additional strategies for prevention are listed in the checklist in Chart 23-9.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-067.jpg?height=1016&width=1780&top_left_y=1589&top_left_x=202)

Patients who are older than 40 , whose hemostasis is adequate, and who are undergoing major elective abdominal or thoracic surgery may receive anticoagulant therapy. Low doses of heparin may be given before surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative deep venous thrombus and PE. Heparin should be administered subcutaneously 2 hours before surgery and continued every 8 to 12 hours until the patient is discharged. Low-dose heparin is thought to enhance the activity of antithrombin III, a major plasma inhibitor of clotting factor X . This regimen is not recommended for patients with an active thrombotic process or for those undergoing major orthopedic surgery, open prostatectomy, or surgery on the eye or brain. Low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin [Lovenox]) is an alternative therapy. It has a longer half-life, enhanced subcutaneous absorption, a reduced incidence of thrombocytopenia, and reduced interaction with platelets as compared to unfractionated heparin (Ansell, Hickey, Kleinschmidt et al., 2000).

The intermittent pneumatic leg compression device is useful in preventing thromboembolism. The device inflates a bag that intermittently compresses the leg from the calf to the thigh, thereby improving venous return. It may be applied before surgery and continued until the patient is ambulatory. The device is particularly useful for patients who are not candidates for anticoagulant therapy (Clagett, Anderson, Geerts et al., 1998).

\section*{Medical Management}

Because PE is often a medical emergency, emergency management is of primary concern. After emergency measures have been taken and the patient's condition stabilizes, the treatment goal is to dissolve (lyse) the existing emboli and prevent new ones from forming. The treatment of PE may include a variety of modalities:
- General measures to improve respiratory and vascular status
- Anticoagulation therapy
- Thrombolytic therapy
- Surgical intervention

\section*{EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT}

Massive PE is a life-threatening emergency. The immediate objective is to stabilize the cardiopulmonary system. A sudden rise in pulmonary resistance increases the work of the right ventricle, which can cause acute right-sided heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Most patients who die of massive PE do so in the first 1 to 2 hours after the embolic event. Emergency management consists of the following:
- Nasal oxygen is administered immediately to relieve hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and central cyanosis.
- Intravenous infusion lines are started to establish routes for medications or fluids that will be needed.
- A perfusion scan, hemodynamic measurements, and arterial blood gas determinations are performed. Spiral (helical) CT or pulmonary angiography may be performed. Spiral CT is more advanced and quicker than routine tomography. With spiral CT, the patient continuously moves as the x-ray tube rotates. With this type of CT, images can be reconstructed at select levels and locations for diagnostic purposes.
- Hypotension is treated by a slow infusion of dobutamine (Dobutrex) (which has a dilating effect on the pulmonary vessels and bronchi) or dopamine (Intropin).
- The ECG is monitored continuously for dysrhythmias and right ventricular failure, which may occur suddenly.
- Digitalis glycosides, intravenous diuretics, and antiarrhythmic agents are administered when appropriate.
- Blood is drawn for serum electrolytes, complete blood count, and hematocrit.
- If clinical assessment and arterial blood gas analysis indicate the need, the patient is intubated and placed on a mechanical ventilator.
- If the patient has suffered massive embolism and is hypotensive, an indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to monitor urinary output.
- Small doses of intravenous morphine or sedatives are administered to relieve the patient's anxiety, to alleviate chest discomfort, to improve tolerance of the endotracheal tube, and to ease adaptation to the mechanical ventilator.

\section*{GENERAL MANAGEMENT}

Measures are initiated to improve the patient's respiratory and vascular status. Oxygen therapy is administered to correct the hypoxemia, relieve the pulmonary vascular vasoconstriction, and reduce the pulmonary hypertension. Using elastic compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic leg compression devices reduces venous stasis. These measures compress the superficial veins and increase the velocity of blood in the deep veins by redirecting the blood through the deep veins. Elevating the leg (above the level of the heart) also increases venous flow.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Anticoagulation Therapy. Anticoagulant therapy (heparin, warfarin sodium) has traditionally been the primary method for managing acute deep vein thrombosis and PE (Goldhaber, 1998). Heparin is used to prevent recurrence of emboli but has no effect on emboli that are already present. It is administered as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 to 10,000 units, followed by a continuous infusion initiated at a dose of $18 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{kg}$ per hour, not to exceed $1,600 \mathrm{U}$ /hour in otherwise healthy patients (Goldhaber, 1998). The rate is reduced in patients with a high risk of bleeding. The goal is to keep the partial thromboplastin time 1.5 to 2.5 times normal (or 46 to 70 seconds). Heparin is usually administered for 5 to 7 days. Low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin [Lovenox]) may also be used.

Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) administration is begun within 24 hours after the start of heparin therapy because its onset of action is 4 to 5 days. Warfarin is usually continued for 3 to 6 months. The prothrombin time is maintained at 1.5 to 2.5 times normal (or an INR [international normalized ratio] of 2.0 to 3.0 ). Anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated in patients who are at risk for bleeding (eg, those with gastrointestinal conditions or with postoperative or postpartum bleeding).

Thrombolytic Therapy. Thrombolytic therapy (urokinase, streptokinase, alteplase, anistreplase, reteplase) also may be used in treating PE, particularly in patients who are severely compromised (eg, those who are hypotensive and have significant hypoxemia despite oxygen supplementation). Thrombolytic therapy resolves the thrombi or emboli more quickly and restores more normal hemodynamic functioning of the pulmonary circulation, thereby reducing pulmonary hypertension
and improving perfusion, oxygenation, and cardiac output. Bleeding, however, is a significant side effect. Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy include a cerebrovascular accident within the past 2 months, other active intracranial processes, active bleeding, surgery within the past 10 days of the thrombotic event, recent labor and delivery, trauma, or severe hypertension. Consequently, thrombolytic agents are advocated only for PE affecting a significant area of blood flow to the lung and causing hemodynamic instability.

Before thrombolytic therapy is started, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, hematocrit values, and platelet counts are obtained. Heparin is stopped prior to administration of a thrombolytic agent. During therapy, all but essential invasive procedures are avoided because of potential bleeding. If necessary, fresh whole blood, packed red cells, cryoprecipitate, or frozen plasma is administered to replace blood loss and reverse the bleeding tendency. After the thrombolytic infusion is completed (which varies in duration according to the agent used and the condition being treated), the patient is given anticoagulants.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

A surgical embolectomy is rarely performed but may be indicated if the patient has a massive PE or hemodynamic instability or if there are contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Pulmonary embolectomy requires a thoracotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass technique. Transvenous catheter embolectomy is a technique in which a vacuum-cupped catheter is introduced transvenously into the affected pulmonary artery. Suction is applied to the end of the embolus and the embolus is aspirated into the cup. The surgeon maintains suction to hold the embolus within the cup, and the entire catheter is withdrawn through the right side of the heart and out the femoral vein. Catheters are available that pulverize the clot with high-velocity jets of normal saline solution (Goldhaber, 1998). An inferior caval filter is usually inserted at the time of surgery to protect against a recurrence.

Interrupting the inferior vena cava is another surgical technique used when PE recurs or when the patient is intolerant of anticoagulant therapy. This approach prevents dislodged thrombi from being swept into the lungs while allowing adequate blood flow. The preferred approach is the application of Teflon clips to the inferior vena cava to divide the lumen into small channels without occluding caval blood flow. Also, the use of transvenous devices that occlude or filter the blood through the inferior vena cava is a fairly safe way to prevent recurrent PE. One such technique involves inserting a filter (eg, Greenfield filter) through the internal jugular vein or common femoral vein (Fig. 23-7). This filter is advanced into the inferior vena cava, where it is opened. The perforated umbrella permits the passage of blood but prevents the passage of large thrombi. It is recommended that anticoagulation be continued in patients with a caval filter, if there are no contraindications to its use.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{MINIMIZING THE RISK OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM}

A key role of the nurse is to identify patients at high risk for PE and to minimize the risk of PE in all patients. The nurse must have a high degree of suspicion for PE in any patient, but particularly in those with conditions predisposing to a slowing of venous return (see Chart 23-8).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{PREVENTING THROMBUS FORMATION}

Preventing thrombus formation is a major nursing responsibility. The nurse encourages ambulation and active and passive leg exercises to prevent venous stasis in patients on bed rest. The nurse instructs the patient to move the legs in a "pumping" exercise so that the leg muscles can help increase venous flow. The nurse also advises the patient not to sit or lie in bed for prolonged periods, not to cross the legs, and not to wear constricting clothing. Legs should not be dangled or feet placed in a dependent position while the patient sits on the edge of the bed; instead, the patient's feet should rest on the floor or on a chair. In addition, intravenous catheters (for parenteral therapy or measurements of central venous pressure) should not be left in place for prolonged periods.

\section*{ASSESSING POTENTIAL FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM}

The nurse examines patients who are at risk for developing PE for a positive Homans' sign, which may or may not indicate impending thrombosis of the leg veins (see Chap. 31). To test for Homans' sign, the patient assumes a supine position, lifts the leg, and dorsiflexes the foot. The nurse asks the patient to report whether calf pain occurs during this maneuver. The occurrence of pain-a positive Homans' sign-may indicate deep venous thrombosis.

\section*{MONITORING THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY}

The nurse is responsible for monitoring thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy. Thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator) causes lysis of deep vein thrombi and pulmonary emboli, which helps dissolve the clots. During thrombolytic infusion, the patient remains on bed rest, vital signs are assessed every 2 hours, and invasive procedures are limited. Tests to determine prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time are performed 3 to 4 hours after the thrombolytic infusion is started to confirm that the fibrinolytic systems have been activated. Because of the prolonged clotting time, only essential arterial punctures or venipunctures are performed, and manual pressure is applied to any puncture site for at least 30 minutes. Pulse oximetry is used to monitor changes in oxygenation. The nurse immediately discontinues the infusion if uncontrolled bleeding occurs.

See Chapter 31 for nursing management for the patient receiving anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy.

\section*{MANAGING PAIN}

Chest pain, if present, is usually pleuritic rather than cardiac in origin. A semi-Fowler's position provides a more comfortable position for breathing. However, it is important to continue to turn the patient frequently and reposition the patient to improve the ventilation-perfusion ratio in the lung. The nurse administers opioid analgesics as prescribed for severe pain.

\section*{MANAGING OXYGEN THERAPY}

Careful attention is given to the proper use of oxygen. It is important to ensure that the patient understands the need for continuous oxygen therapy. The nurse assesses the patient frequently for signs of hypoxemia and monitors the pulse oximetry values to evaluate the effectiveness of the oxygen therapy. Deep breathing and incentive spirometry are indicated for all patients to minimize or prevent atelectasis and improve ventilation. Nebulizer therapy or percussion and postural drainage may be used for management of secretions.

\section*{RELIEVING ANXIETY}

The nurse encourages the stabilized patient to talk about any fears or concerns related to this frightening episode, answers the patient's and family's questions concisely and accurately, explains the therapy, and describes how to recognize untoward effects early.

\section*{MONITORING FOR COMPLICATIONS}

When caring for a patient who has had PE, the nurse must be alert for the potential complication of cardiogenic shock or right ventricular failure subsequent to the effect of PE on the cardiovascular system. Nursing activities for managing shock are found in Chapter 15.

\section*{PROVIDING POSTOPERATIVE NURSING CARE}

After surgery, the nurse measures the patient's pulmonary arterial pressure and urinary output. The nurse assesses the insertion site of the arterial catheter for hematoma formation and infection. It is important to maintain the blood pressure at a level that supports perfusion of vital organs. To prevent peripheral venous stasis and edema of the lower extremities, the nurse elevates the foot of the bed and encourages isometric exercises, use of elastic compression stockings, and walking when the patient is permitted out of bed. Sitting is discouraged because hip flexion compresses the large veins in the legs.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Before hospital discharge and at follow-up visits to the clinic or during home visits, the nurse instructs the patient about how to prevent recurrence and what signs and symptoms to report immediately. Patient instructions, as presented in Chart 23-9, are intended to help prevent recurrences and side effects of treatment.

\section*{Sarcoidosis}

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. It may involve almost any organ or tissue but most commonly involves the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system, skin, eyes, fingers, and parotid glands. The disease is not gender-specific, but some manifestations are more
common in women. In the United States, the disease is 10 times more common in African Americans (40 cases per 100,000) than in Caucasians ( 5 cases per 100,000), and the disease usually begins in the third or fourth decade of life (American Thoracic Society, 1999).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Sarcoidosis is thought to be a hypersensitivity response to one or more agents (bacteria, fungi, virus, chemicals) in people with an inherited or acquired predisposition to the disorder. The hypersensitivity response results in granuloma formation due to the release of cytokines and other substances that promote replication of fibroblasts. In the lung, granuloma infiltration and fibrosis may occur, resulting in low lung compliance, impaired diffusing capacity, and reduced lung volumes (American Thoracic Society, 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

A hallmark of this disease is its insidious onset and lack of prominent clinical signs or symptoms. The clinical picture depends on the systems involved. With pulmonary involvement, signs and symptoms may include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and congestion. Generalized symptoms include anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss. Other signs include uveitis, joint pain, fever, and granulomatous lesions of the skin, liver, spleen, kidney, and central nervous system. The granulomas may disappear or gradually convert to fibrous tissue. With multisystem involvement, the patient has fatigue, fever, anorexia, weight loss, and joint pain.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Chest x-rays and CT scans are used to assess pulmonary adenopathy. The chest x-ray may show hilar adenopathy and disseminated miliary and nodular lesions in the lungs. A mediastinoscopy or transbronchial biopsy (in which a tissue specimen is obtained through the bronchial wall) may be used to confirm the diagnosis. In rare cases, an open lung biopsy is performed. Diagnosis is confirmed by a biopsy that shows noncaseating granulomas. Pulmonary function test results are abnormal if there is restriction of lung function (reduction in total lung capacity). Arterial blood gas measurements may be normal or may show reduced oxygen levels (hypoxemia) and increased carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia).

\section*{Medical Management}

Many patients undergo remission without specific treatment. Corticosteroid therapy may benefit some patients because of its anti-inflammatory effect, which relieves symptoms and improves organ function. It is useful for patients with ocular and myocardial involvement, skin involvement, extensive pulmonary disease that compromises pulmonary function, hepatic involvement, and hypercalcemia. Other cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents have been used, but without the benefit of controlled clinical trials. There is no single test that monitors the progression or recurrence of sarcoidosis. Multiple tests are used to monitor the involved systems.

\section*{Occupational Lung Diseases: Pneumoconioses}

Diseases of the lungs occur in numerous occupations as a result of exposure to organic and inorganic (mineral) dusts and noxious gases (fumes and aerosols). The effects of inhaling these materi-
als depend on the composition of the substance, its concentration, its ability to initiate an immune response, its irritating properties, the duration of exposure, and the individual's response or susceptibility to the irritant. Smoking may compound the problem and may increase the risk of lung cancers in people exposed to the mineral asbestos. Key aspects of any assessment of patients with a potential occupational respiratory history include job and job activities, exposure levels, general hygiene, time frame of exposure, amount of respiratory protection used, and direct versus indirect exposures.

Pneumoconiosis refers to a nonneoplastic alteration of the lung resulting from inhalation of mineral or inorganic dust (eg, "dusty lung"). The most common pneumoconioses are silicosis, asbestosis, and coal workers' pneumoconiosis.

\section*{SILICOSIS}

Silicosis is a chronic fibrotic pulmonary disease caused by inhalation of silica dust (crystalline silicon dioxide particles). Exposure to silica and silicates occurs in almost all mining, quarrying, and tunneling operations. Glass manufacturing, stone-cutting, the manufacture of abrasives and pottery, and foundry work are other occupations with exposure hazards. Finely ground silica, such as that found in soaps, polishes and filters, is extremely dangerous.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

When the silica particles, which have fibrogenic properties, are inhaled, nodular lesions are produced throughout the lungs. With the passage of time and further exposure, the nodules enlarge and coalesce. Dense masses form in the upper portion of the lungs, resulting in the loss of pulmonary volume. Restrictive lung disease (inability of the lungs to expand fully) and obstructive lung disease from secondary emphysema result. Cavities can form as a result of superimposed TB. Exposure of 15 to 20 years is usually required before the onset of the disease and shortness of breath are manifested. Fibrotic destruction of pulmonary tissue can lead to emphysema, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients with acute silicosis present with dyspnea, fever, cough, and weight loss and have a rapid progression of the disease. Symptoms are more severe in patients whose disease is complicated by progressive massive fibrosis. More commonly, this disease is a chronic problem with a long latency period. The patient may have slowly progressive symptoms indicative of hypoxemia, severe air-flow obstruction, and right-sided heart failure. Edema may occur because of the cardiac failure.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is no specific treatment for silicosis, because the fibrotic process in the lung is irreversible. Supportive therapy is directed at managing complications and preventing infection. Testing is performed to rule out other lung diseases, such as TB, lung cancer, and sarcoidosis. If TB is present, it is aggressively treated. Additional therapy might include oxygen, diuretics, inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics, and bronchodilator therapy.

\section*{ASBESTOSIS}

Asbestosis is a disease characterized by diffuse pulmonary fibrosis from the inhalation of asbestos dust. Current laws restrict the use of asbestos, but many industries used it in the past. Therefore, exposure occurred, and may still occur, in numerous occupations, including asbestos mining and manufacturing, shipbuilding, demolition of structures containing asbestos, and roofing. Materials such as shingles, cement, vinyl asbestos tile, fireproof paint and clothing, brake linings, and filters all contained asbestos at one time, and many of these materials are still in existence. Additional diseases related to asbestos exposure include lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestos pleural effusion.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Inhaled asbestos fibers enter the alveoli, where they are surrounded by fibrous tissue. The fibrous tissue eventually obliterates the alveoli. Fibrous changes also affect the pleura, which thickens and develops plaque. The result of these physiologic changes is a restrictive lung disease, with a decrease in lung volume, diminished exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hypoxemia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The onset of the disease is insidious, and the patient has progressive dyspnea, persistent, dry cough, mild to moderate chest pain, anorexia, weight loss, and malaise. Early physical findings include bibasilar fine, end-inspiratory crackles and in more advanced cases clubbing of the fingers. Cor pulmonale and respiratory failure occur as the disease progresses. A high proportion of workers who have been exposed to asbestos dust die of lung cancer, especially those who smoke or have a history of smoking. Malignant mesotheliomas may also occur. These are rare cancers of the pleura or peritoneum that are strongly associated with asbestos exposure.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is no effective treatment for asbestosis as the lung damage is permanent and often progressive. Management is directed at controlling infection and treating the lung disease. When oxygencarbon dioxide exchange becomes severely impaired, continuous oxygen therapy may help improve activity tolerance. The patient must be instructed to avoid additional exposure to asbestos and to stop smoking. A significant contributing cause to mortality in this population is the high incidence of lung carcinoma.

\section*{COAL WORKERS' PNEUMOCONIOSIS}

Coal workers' pneumoconiosis ("black lung disease") includes a variety of respiratory diseases found in coal workers who have inhaled coal dust over the years. Coal miners are exposed to dusts that are mixtures of coal, kaolin, mica, and silica.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

When coal dust is deposited in the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles, macrophages engulf the particles (by phagocytosis) and transport them to the terminal bronchioles, where they are removed by mucociliary action. In time, the clearance mechanisms cannot handle the excessive dust load, and the macrophages aggregate in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. Fibroblasts appear and a network of reticulin is laid down surrounding the
dust-laden macrophages. The bronchioles and the alveoli become clogged with coal dust, dying macrophages, and fibroblasts. This leads to the formation of the coal macule, the primary lesion of the disorder. Macules appear as blackish dots on the lungs. Fibrotic lesions develop and, as the macules enlarge, the weakening bronchioles dilate, with subsequent development of a localized emphysema. The disease begins in the upper lobes of the lungs but may progress to the lower lobes.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The first signs are a chronic cough and sputum production, similar to the signs encountered in chronic bronchitis. As the disease progresses, the patient develops dyspnea and coughs up large amounts of sputum with varying amounts of black fluid (melanoptysis), particularly if the individual is a smoker. Eventually, cor pulmonale and respiratory failure result. The diagnosis may first be made based on chest x-ray findings and a history of exposure.

\section*{Medical Management}

Preventing this disease is key because there is no effective treatment. Instead, treatment focuses on early diagnosis and management of complications. (See Chap. 24 for discussion of emphysema.)

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{TEACHING ABOUT PREVENTION}

The occupational health nurse serves as an employee advocate, making every effort to promote measures to reduce the exposure of workers to industrial products. Laws require that the work environment be ventilated properly to remove any noxious agent. Dust control can prevent many of the pneumoconioses. Dust control includes ventilation, spraying an area with water to control dust, and effective and frequent floor cleaning. Air samples need to be monitored. Toxic substances should be enclosed and placed in restricted areas. Workers must wear or use protective devices (facemasks, hoods, industrial respirators) to provide a safe air supply when a toxic element is present. Employees who are at risk should be carefully screened and followed. There is a risk of developing serious smoking-related illness (cancer) in industries in which there are unsafe levels of certain gases, dusts, fumes, fluids, and other toxic substances. Additionally, there is the potential for second-hand exposure. Asbestos and toxic dusts and substances may be transferred to others through the handling of clothing or shoes that have been exposed. Ongoing educational programs should be designed to teach workers to take responsibility for their own health and to stop smoking and receive an influenza vaccination.

The Right to Know law stipulates that employees must be informed about all hazardous and toxic substances in the workplace. Specifically, they must be educated about any hazardous or toxic substances they work with, what effects these substances can have on their health, and the measures they can take to protect themselves. The responsibility for implementing these controls inevitably falls on the federal or state government.

\section*{ChestTumors}

Tumors of the lung may be benign or malignant. A malignant chest tumor can be primary, arising within the lung, chest wall, or mediastinum, or it can be a metastasis from a primary tumor site elsewhere in the body. Metastatic lung tumors occur fre-
quently because the bloodstream transports cancer cells from primary cancers elsewhere in the body to the lungs.

\section*{LUNG CANCER (BRONCHOGENIC CARCINOMA)}

Lung cancer is the number-one cancer killer among men and women in the United States, accounting for $31 \%$ of cancer deaths in men and $25 \%$ in women (American Cancer Society, 2002; Greenlee et al., 2001). For men, the incidence of lung cancer has remained relatively constant, but in women it continues to rise. Lung cancer affects primarily those in the sixth or seventh decade of life; less than $5 \%$ of patients are under the age of 40 . In approximately $70 \%$ of lung cancer patients, the disease has spread to regional lymphatics and other sites by the time of diagnosis. As a result, the long-term survival rate for lung cancer patients is low. Evidence indicates that carcinoma tends to arise at sites of previous scarring (TB, fibrosis) in the lung. More than $85 \%$ of lung cancers are caused by the inhalation of carcinogenic chemicals, most commonly cigarette smoke (Schottenfeld, 2000).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Lung cancers arise from a single transformed epithelial cell in the tracheobronchial airways. A carcinogen (cigarette smoke, radon gas, other occupational and environmental agents) binds to a cell's DNA and damages it. This damage results in cellular changes, abnormal cell growth, and eventually a malignant cell. As the damaged DNA is passed on to daughter cells, the DNA undergoes further changes and becomes unstable. With the accumulation of genetic changes, the pulmonary epithelium undergoes malignant transformation from normal epithelium to eventual invasive carcinoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is more centrally located and arises more commonly in the segmental and subsegmental bronchi in response to repetitive carcinogenic exposures. Adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent carcinoma of the lung for both men and women; it presents more peripherally as peripheral masses or nodules and often metastasizes. Large cell carcinoma (also called undifferentiated carcinoma) is a fast-growing tumor that tends to arise peripherally. Bronchioalveolar cell cancer arises from the terminal bronchus and alveoli and is usually slower growing as compared to other bronchogenic carcinomas. Lastly, small cell carcinomas arise primarily as a proximal lesion or lesions but may arise in any part of the tracheobronchial tree.

\section*{Classification and Staging}

Non-small cell carcinoma represents 70\% to 75\% of tumors; small cell carcinoma represents $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of tumors. For non-small cell carcinoma, the cell types include squamous cell carcinoma ( $30 \%$ ), large cell carcinoma ( $10 \%$ to $16 \%$ ), and adenocarcinoma ( $31 \%$ to $34 \%$ ), including bronchioalveolar carcinoma ( $3 \%$ to $4 \%$ ). Most small cell carcinomas arise in the major bronchi and spread by infiltration along the bronchial wall. Small cell cancers account for 20\% to 25\% of all bronchogenic cancers (Matthay, Tanoue \& Carter, 2000).

In addition to cell type, lung cancers also are staged. The stage of the tumor refers to the size of the tumor, its location, whether lymph nodes are involved, and whether the cancer has spread (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 2002). Non-small cell lung cancer is staged as I to IV. Stage I is the earliest stage with the highest cure rates, while stage IV designates metastatic spread.

Small cell lung cancers are classified as limited or extensive. Diagnostic tools and further information on staging are described in Chapter 16.

\section*{Risk Factors}

Various factors have been associated with the development of lung cancer, including tobacco smoke, second-hand (passive) smoke, environmental and occupational exposures, gender, genetics, and dietary deficits. Other factors that have been associated with lung cancer include genetic predisposition and other underlying respiratory diseases, such as COPD and TB.

\section*{TOBACCO SMOKE}

Tobacco use is responsible for more than one of every six deaths in the United States from pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Smoking is the most important single preventable cause of death and disease in this country. More than $85 \%$ of lung cancers are attributable to inhalation of carcinogenic chemicals, such as cigarette smoke (American Cancer Society, 2002). Lung cancer is 10 times more common in cigarette smokers than nonsmokers. Risk is determined by the pack-year history (number of packs of cigarettes used each day, multiplied by the number of years smoked), the age of initiation of smoking, the depth of inhalation, and the tar and nicotine levels in the cigarettes smoked. The younger a person is when he or she starts smoking, the greater the risk of developing lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer decreases as the duration of smoking cessation increases.

\section*{SECOND-HAND SMOKE}

Passive smoking has been identified as a possible cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. In other words, people who are involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke in a closed environment (home, car, building) are at increased risk for developing lung cancer as compared to unexposed nonsmokers. An average lifetime passive smoke exposure to a smoking spouse or partner increases a nonsmoker's risk of lung cancer by about $35 \%$ compared to the risk of $100 \%$ for a lifetime of active smoking (Matthay, Tanoue \& Carter, 2000).

\section*{ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE}

Various carcinogens have been identified in the atmosphere, including motor vehicle emissions and pollutants from refineries and manufacturing plants. Evidence suggests that the incidence of lung cancer is greater in urban areas as a result of the buildup of pollutants and motor vehicle emissions.

Radon is a colorless, odorless gas found in soil and rocks. For many years it has been associated with uranium mines, but it is now known to seep into homes through ground rock. High levels of radon have been associated with the development of lung cancer, especially when combined with cigarette smoking. Homeowners are advised to have radon levels checked in their houses and to arrange for special venting if the levels are high.

Chronic exposure to industrial carcinogens, such as arsenic, asbestos, mustard gas, chromates, coke oven fumes, nickel, oil, and radiation, has been associated with the development of lung cancer. Laws have been passed to control exposure to such elements in the workplace.

\section*{GENETICS}

Some familial predisposition to lung cancer seems apparent, because the incidence of lung cancer in close relatives of patients
with lung cancer appears to be two to three times that of the general population regardless of smoking status.

\section*{DIETARY FACTORS}

Prior research has demonstrated that smokers who eat a diet low in fruits and vegetables have an increased risk of developing lung cancer (Bast, Kufe, Pollock et al., 2000). The actual active agents in a diet rich in fruits and vegetables have yet to be determined. It has been hypothesized that carotenoids, particularly carotene or vitamin A, may be important. Several ongoing trials may help to determine if carotene supplementation has anticancer properties. Other nutrients, including vitamin E, selenium, vitamin C, fat, and retinoids, are also being evaluated regarding their protective role against lung cancer (Bast, Kufe, Pollock et al., 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Often, lung cancer develops insidiously and is asymptomatic until late in its course. The signs and symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor, the degree of obstruction, and the existence of metastases to regional or distant sites.

The most frequent symptom of lung cancer is cough or change in a chronic cough. People frequently ignore this symptom and attribute it to smoking or a respiratory infection. The cough starts as a dry, persistent cough, without sputum production. When obstruction of airways occurs, the cough may become productive due to infection.

\section*{NURSING ALERT A cough that changes in character should arouse suspicion of lung cancer.}

Wheezing is noted (occurs when a bronchus becomes partially obstructed by the tumor) in about $20 \%$ of patients with lung cancer. Patients also may report dyspnea. Hemoptysis or bloodtinged sputum may be expectorated. In some patients, a recurring fever occurs as an early symptom in response to a persistent infection in an area of pneumonitis distal to the tumor. In fact, cancer of the lung should be suspected in people with repeated unresolved upper respiratory tract infections. Chest or shoulder pain may indicate chest wall or pleural involvement by a tumor. Pain also is a late manifestation and may be related to metastasis to the bone.

If the tumor spreads to adjacent structures and regional lymph nodes, the patient may present with chest pain and tightness, hoarseness (involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia, head and neck edema, and symptoms of pleural or pericardial effusion. The most common sites of metastases are lymph nodes, bone, brain, contralateral lung, adrenal glands, and liver. Nonspecific symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and weight loss also may be diagnostic.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

If pulmonary symptoms occur in a heavy smoker, cancer of the lung is suspected. A chest x-ray is performed to search for pulmonary density, a solitary peripheral nodule (coin lesion), atelectasis, and infection. CT scans of the chest are used to identify small nodules not visualized on the chest x-ray and also to examine serially areas of the thoracic cage not clearly visible on the chest x-ray.

Sputum cytology is rarely used to make a diagnosis of lung cancer; however, fiberoptic bronchoscopy is more commonly
used and provides a detailed study of the tracheobronchial tree and allows for brushings, washings, and biopsies of suspicious areas. For peripheral lesions not amenable to bronchoscopic biopsy, a transthoracic fine-needle aspiration may be performed under CT or fluoroscopic guidance to aspirate cells from a suspicious area. In some circumstances, an endoscopy with esophageal ultrasound (EUS) may be used to obtain a transesophageal biopsy of enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes that are not easily accessible by other means.

A variety of scans may be used to assess for metastasis of the cancer. These may include bone scans, abdominal scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, or liver ultrasound or scans. CT of the brain, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other neurologic diagnostic procedures are used to detect central nervous system metastases. Mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy may be used to obtain biopsy samples from lymph nodes in the mediastinum.

If surgery is a potential treatment, the patient is evaluated to determine whether the tumor is resectable and whether the physiologic impairment resulting from such surgery can be tolerated. Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, ventilation-perfusion scans, and exercise testing may all be used as part of the preoperative assessment (Knippel, 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

The objective of management is to provide a cure, if possible. Treatment depends on the cell type, the stage of the disease, and the physiologic status (particularly cardiac and pulmonary status) of the patient. In general, treatment may involve surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy-or a combination of these. Newer and more specific therapies to modulate the immune system (gene therapy, therapy with defined tumor antigens) are under study and show promise in treating lung cancer.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical resection is the preferred method of treating patients with localized non-small cell tumors, no evidence of metastatic spread, and adequate cardiopulmonary function. If the patient's cardiovascular status, pulmonary function, and functional status are satisfactory, surgery is generally well tolerated. Coronary artery disease, pulmonary insufficiency, and other comorbidities, however, may contraindicate surgical intervention. The cure rate of surgical resection depends on the type and stage of the cancer. Surgery is primarily used for non-small cell carcinomas because small cell cancer of the lung grows rapidly and metastasizes early and extensively. Unfortunately, in many patients with bronchogenic cancer, the lesion is inoperable at the time of diagnosis.

Several different types of lung resections may be performed (Chart 23-10). The most common surgical procedure for a small, apparently curable tumor of the lung is lobectomy (removal of a lobe of the lung). In some cases, an entire lung may be removed (pneumonectomy) (see Chap. 25 for futher details).

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

Radiation therapy may cure a small percentage of patients. It is useful in controlling neoplasms that cannot be surgically resected but are responsive to radiation. Radiation also may be used to reduce the size of a tumor, to make an inoperable tumor operable, or to relieve the pressure of the tumor on vital structures. It can control symptoms of spinal cord metastasis and superior vena caval compression. Also, prophylactic brain irradiation is used in certain patients to treat microscopic metastases to the brain. Radiation may help relieve cough, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-074.jpg?height=551&width=857&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=1022)
and bone and liver pain. Relief of symptoms may last from a few weeks to many months and is important in improving the quality of the remaining period of life.

Radiation therapy usually is toxic to normal tissue within the radiation field, and this may lead to complications such as esophagitis, pneumonitis, and radiation lung fibrosis. These may impair ventilatory and diffusion capacity and significantly reduce pulmonary reserve. The patient's nutritional status, psychological outlook, fatigue level, and signs of anemia and infection are monitored throughout the treatment. See Chapter 16 for management of the patient receiving radiation therapy.

\section*{CHEMOTHERAPY}

Chemotherapy is used to alter tumor growth patterns, to treat patients with distant metastases or small cell cancer of the lung, and as an adjunct to surgery or radiation therapy. Combinations of two or more medications may be more beneficial than single-dose regimens. A large number of medications are active against lung cancer. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents are used, including alkylating agents (ifosfamide), platinum analogues (cisplatin and carboplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), vinca alkaloids (vinblastine and vindesine), doxorubicin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, irinotecan (CPT-11), and etoposide (VP-16). The choice of agent depends on the growth of the tumor cell and the specific phase of the cell cycle that the medication affects. Numerous combinations of chemotherapy are undergoing investigation to identify the optimal regimen to treat differing types of lung cancer.

Chemotherapy may provide relief, especially of pain, but it does not usually cure the disease, nor does it often prolong life to any great degree. Chemotherapy is also accompanied by side effects. It is valuable in reducing pressure symptoms of lung cancer and in treating brain, spinal cord, and pericardial metastasis. See Chapter 16 for a discussion of chemotherapy for the patient with cancer.

\section*{PALLIATIVE THERAPY}

Palliative therapy may include radiation therapy to shrink the tumor to provide pain relief, a variety of bronchoscopic interventions to open a narrowed bronchus or airway, and pain management and other comfort measures. Evaluation and referral for hospice care are important in planning for comfortable and dignified end-of-life care for the patient and family.

\section*{Treatment-Related Complications}

A variety of complications may occur as a result of lung cancer treatments. Radiation therapy may result in diminished cardiopulmonary function and other complications, such as pulmonary
fibrosis, pericarditis, myelitis, and cor pulmonale. Chemotherapy, particularly in combination with radiation therapy, can cause pneumonitis. Pulmonary toxicity is a potential side effect of chemotherapy. Surgical resection may result in respiratory failure, particularly when the cardiopulmonary system is compromised before surgery. Surgical complications and prolonged mechanical ventilation are potential outcomes.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the patient with lung cancer is similar to that of other patients with cancer (see Chap. 16) and addresses the physiologic and psychological needs of the patient. The physiologic problems are primarily due to the respiratory manifestations of the disease. Nursing care includes strategies to ensure relief of pain and discomfort and to prevent complications.

\section*{MANAGING SYMPTOMS}

The nurse instructs the patient and family about the potential side effects of the specific treatment and strategies to manage them. Strategies for managing such symptoms as dyspnea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and anorexia will assist the patient and family to cope with the therapeutic measures.

\section*{RELIEVING BREATHING PROBLEMS}

Airway clearance techniques are key to maintaining airway patency through the removal of excess secretions. This may be accomplished through deep-breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy, directed cough, suctioning, and in some instances bronchoscopy. Bronchodilator medications may be prescribed to promote bronchial dilation. As the tumor enlarges or spreads, it may compress a bronchus or involve a large area of lung tissue, resulting in an impaired breathing pattern and poor gas exchange. At some stage of the disease, supplemental oxygen will probably be necessary.

Nursing measures focus on decreasing dyspnea by encouraging the patient to assume positions that promote lung expansion, breathing exercises for lung expansion and relaxation, and educating the patient on energy conservation and airway clearance techniques (Connolly \& O'Neill, 1999). Many of the techniques used in pulmonary rehabilitation can be applied to the lung cancer patient. Depending on the severity of disease and the patient's wishes, a referral to a pulmonary rehabilitation program may be helpful in managing respiratory symptoms.

\section*{REDUCING FATIGUE}

Fatigue is a devastating symptom that affects quality of life in the cancer patient. It is commonly experienced by the lung cancer patient and may be related to the disease itself, the cancer treatment and complications (eg, anemia), sleep disturbances, pain and discomfort, hypoxemia, poor nutrition, or the psychological ramifications of the disease (eg, anxiety, depression). The nurse is pivotal in thoroughly assessing the patient's level of fatigue, identifying potentially treatable causes, and validating with the patient that fatigue is indeed an important symptom. Educating the patient in energy conservation techniques or referring the patient to a physical therapy, occupational therapy, or pulmonary rehabilitation program may be helpful. In addition, guided exercise has been recently identified as a potential intervention for treating fatigue in cancer patients. This is an important area for research because few studies have been conducted, and only in select populations of cancer patients.

\section*{PROVIDING PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT}

Another important part of the nursing care of the patient with lung cancer is psychological support and identification of potential resources for the patient and family. Often, the nurse must help the patient and family deal with the poor prognosis and relatively rapid progression of this disease. The nurse must help the patient and family with informed decision making regarding the possible treatment options, methods to maintain the patient's quality of life during the course of this disease, and end-of-life treatment options.

\section*{TUMORS OF THE MEDIASTINUM}

Tumors of the mediastinum include neurogenic tumors, tumors of the thymus, lymphomas, germ cell, cysts, and mesenchymal tumors. These tumors may be malignant or benign. These tumors are usually described in relation to location: anterior, middle, or posterior masses or tumors.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Nearly all the symptoms of mediastinal tumors result from the pressure of the mass against important intrathoracic organs. Symptoms may include cough, wheezing, dyspnea, anterior chest or neck pain, bulging of the chest wall, heart palpitations, angina, other circulatory disturbances, central cyanosis, superior vena caval syndrome (ie, swelling of the face, neck, and upper extremities), marked distention of the veins of the neck and the chest wall (evidence of the obstruction of large veins of the mediastinum by extravascular compression or intravascular invasion), and dysphagia and weight loss from pressure or invasion into the esophagus.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Chest x-rays are the major method used initially to diagnose mediastinal tumors and cysts. CT scans are the gold standard for assessment of the mediastinum and surrounding structures. MRI may be used in some circumstances, as well as PET scans.

\section*{Medical Management}

If the tumor is malignant and has infiltrated surrounding tissue, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy are the therapeutic modalities used when complete surgical removal (discussed below) is not feasible.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Many mediastinal tumors are benign and operable. The location of the tumor (anterior, middle, or posterior compartments) in the mediastinum dictates the type of incision. The common incision used is a median sternotomy; however, a thoracotomy may be used, depending on the location of the tumor. Additional approaches may include a bilateral anterior thoracotomy (clamshell incision) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (see Chap. 25). The care is the same as for any patient undergoing thoracic surgery. The major complications include hemorrhage, injury to the phrenic or recurrent laryngeal nerve, and infection.

\section*{ChestTrauma}

Approximately $60 \%$ of all multisystem trauma victims have some type of chest or thoracic trauma (Owens, Chaudry, Eggerstedt \& Smith, 2000). Chest trauma is classified as either blunt or
penetrating. Blunt chest trauma results from sudden compression or positive pressure inflicted to the chest wall. Motor vehicle crashes (trauma due to steering wheel, seat belt), falls, and bicycle crashes (trauma due to handlebars) are the most common causes of blunt chest trauma. Penetrating trauma occurs when a foreign object penetrates the chest wall. The most common causes of penetrating chest trauma include gunshot wounds and stabbings.

\section*{BLUNT TRAUMA}

Although blunt chest trauma is more common, it is often difficult to identify the extent of the damage because the symptoms may be generalized and vague. In addition, patients may not seek immediate medical attention, which may complicate the problem.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Injuries to the chest are often life-threatening and result in one or more of the following pathologic mechanisms:
- Hypoxemia from disruption of the airway; injury to the lung parenchyma, rib cage, and respiratory musculature; massive hemorrhage; collapsed lung; and pneumothorax
- Hypovolemia from massive fluid loss from the great vessels, cardiac rupture, or hemothorax
- Cardiac failure from cardiac tamponade, cardiac contusion, or increased intrathoracic pressure
These mechanisms frequently result in impaired ventilation and perfusion leading to ARF, hypovolemic shock, and death.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Time is critical in treating chest trauma. Therefore, it is essential to assess the patient immediately to determine the following:
- When the injury occurred
- Mechanism of injury
- Level of responsiveness
- Specific injuries
- Estimated blood loss
- Recent drug or alcohol use
- Prehospital treatment

The initial assessment of thoracic injuries includes assessment of the patient for airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, flail chest, and cardiac tamponade. These injuries are life-threatening and need immediate treatment. Secondary assessment would include simple pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, traumatic aortic rupture, tracheobronchial disruption, esophageal perforation, traumatic diaphragmatic injury, and penetrating wounds to the mediastinum (Owens, Chaudry, Eggerstedt \& Smith, 2000). Although listed as secondary, these injuries may be life-threatening as well depending upon the circumstances.

The physical examination includes inspection of the airway, thorax, neck veins, and breathing difficulty. Specifics include assessing the rate and depth of breathing for abnormalities, such as stridor, cyanosis, nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles, drooling, and overt trauma to the face, mouth, or neck. The chest should be assessed for symmetric movement, symmetry of breath sounds, open chest wounds, entrance or exit wounds, impaled objects, tracheal shift, distended neck veins, subcutaneous emphysema, and paradoxical chest wall motion. In addition, the chest wall
should be assessed for bruising, petechiae, lacerations, and burns. The vital signs and skin color are assessed for signs of shock. The thorax is palpated for tenderness and crepitus; the position of the trachea is also assessed.

The initial diagnostic workup includes a chest x-ray, CT scan, complete blood count, clotting studies, type and cross-match, electrolytes, oxygen saturation, arterial blood gas analysis, and ECG. The patient is completely undressed to avoid missing additional injuries that can complicate care. Many patients with injuries involving the chest have associated head and abdominal injuries that require attention. Ongoing assessment is essential to monitor the patient's response to treatment and to detect early signs of clinical deterioration.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of treatment are to evaluate the patient's condition and to initiate aggressive resuscitation. An airway is immediately established with oxygen support and, in some cases, intubation and ventilatory support. Re-establishing fluid volume and negative intrapleural pressure and draining intrapleural fluid and blood are essential.

The potential for massive blood loss and exsanguination with blunt or penetrating chest injuries is high because of injury to the great blood vessels. Many patients die at the scene or are in shock by the time help arrives. Agitation and irrational and combative behavior are signs of decreased oxygen delivery to the cerebral cortex. Strategies to restore and maintain cardiopulmonary function include ensuring an adequate airway and ventilation, stabilizing and re-establishing chest wall integrity, occluding any opening into the chest (open pneumothorax), and draining or removing any air or fluid from the thorax to relieve pneumothorax, hemothorax, or cardiac tamponade. Hypovolemia and low cardiac output must be corrected. Many of these treatment efforts, along with the control of hemorrhage, are usually carried out simultaneously at the scene of the injury or in the emergency department. Depending on the success of efforts to control the hemorrhage in the emergency department, the patient may be taken immediately to the operating room. Principles of management are essentially those pertaining to care of the postoperative thoracic patient (see Chap. 25).

\section*{Sternal and Rib Fractures}

Sternal fractures are most common in motor vehicle crashes with a direct blow to the sternum via the steering wheel and are most common in women, patients over age 50, and those using shoulder restraints (Owens, Chaudry, Eggerstedt \& Smith, 2000).

Rib fractures are the most common type of chest trauma, occurring in more than $60 \%$ of patients admitted with blunt chest injury. Most rib fractures are benign and are treated conservatively. Fractures of the first three ribs are rare but can result in a high mortality rate because they are associated with laceration of the subclavian artery or vein. The fifth through ninth ribs are the most common sites of fractures. Fractures of the lower ribs are associated with injury to the spleen and liver, which may be lacerated by fragmented sections of the rib.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

The patient with sternal fractures has anterior chest pain, overlying tenderness, ecchymosis, crepitus, swelling, and the potential of a chest wall deformity. For the patient with rib fractures, clinical manifestations are similar: severe pain, point tenderness,
and muscle spasm over the area of the fracture, which is aggravated by coughing, deep breathing, and movement. The area around the fracture may be bruised. To reduce the pain, the patient splints the chest by breathing in a shallow manner and avoids sighs, deep breaths, coughing, and movement. This reluctance to move or breathe deeply results in diminished ventilation, collapse of unaerated alveoli (atelectasis), pneumonitis, and hypoxemia. Respiratory insufficiency and failure can be the outcomes of such a cycle.

\section*{ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS}

The patient with a sternal fracture must be closely evaluated for underlying cardiac injuries. A crackling, grating sound in the thorax (subcutaneous crepitus) may be detected with auscultation. The diagnostic workup may include a chest x-ray, rib films of a specific area, ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gas analysis.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

Medical management of the patient with a sternal fracture is directed toward controlling pain, avoiding excessive activity, and treating any associated injuries. Surgical fixation is rarely necessary unless fragments are grossly displaced and pose a potential for further injury.

The goals of treatment for rib fractures are to control pain and to detect and treat the injury. Sedation is used to relieve pain and to allow deep breathing and coughing. Care must be taken to avoid oversedation and suppression of the respiratory drive. Alternative strategies to relieve pain include an intercostal nerve block and ice over the fracture site; a chest binder may decrease pain on movement. Usually the pain abates in 5 to 7 days, and discomfort can be controlled with epidural analgesia, patient-controlled analgesia, or nonopioid analgesia. Most rib fractures heal in 3 to 6 weeks. The patient is monitored closely for signs and symptoms of associated injuries.

\section*{Flail Chest}

Flail chest is frequently a complication of blunt chest trauma from a steering wheel injury. It usually occurs when three or more adjacent ribs (multiple contiguous ribs) are fractured at two or more sites, resulting in free-floating rib segments. It may also re-
sult as a combination fracture of ribs and costal cartilages or sternum (Owens, Chaudry, Eggerstedt \& Smith, 2000). As a result, the chest wall loses stability and there is subsequent respiratory impairment and usually severe respiratory distress.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

During inspiration, as the chest expands, the detached part of the rib segment (flail segment) moves in a paradoxical manner (pendelluft movement) in that it is pulled inward during inspiration, reducing the amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs. On expiration, because the intrathoracic pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, the flail segment bulges outward, impairing the patient's ability to exhale. The mediastinum then shifts back to the affected side (Fig. 23-8). This paradoxical action results in increased dead space, a reduction in alveolar ventilation, and decreased compliance. Retained airway secretions and atelectasis frequently accompany flail chest. The patient has hypoxemia, and if gas exchange is greatly compromised, respiratory acidosis develops as a result of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention. Hypotension, inadequate tissue perfusion, and metabolic acidosis often follow as the paradoxical motion of the mediastinum decreases cardiac output.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

As with rib fracture, treatment of flail chest is usually supportive. Management includes providing ventilatory support, clearing secretions from the lungs, and controlling pain. The specific management depends on the degree of respiratory dysfunction. If only a small segment of the chest is involved, the objectives are to clear the airway through positioning, coughing, deep breathing, and suctioning to aid in the expansion of the lung, and to relieve pain by intercostal nerve blocks, high thoracic epidural blocks, or cautious use of intravenous opioids.

For mild to moderate flail chest injuries, the underlying pulmonary contusion is treated by monitoring fluid intake and appropriate fluid replacement, while at the same time relieving chest pain. Pulmonary physiotherapy focusing on lung volume expansion and secretion management techniques are performed. The patient is closely monitored for further respiratory compromise.

When a severe flail chest injury is encountered, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required to provide internal pneumatic stabilization of the flail chest and to correct abnormalities in gas exchange. This helps to treat the underlying

\begin{figure}

pulmonary contusion, serves to stabilize the thoracic cage to allow the fractures to heal, and improves alveolar ventilation and intrathoracic volume by decreasing the work of breathing. This treatment modality requires endotracheal intubation and ventilator support. Differing modes of ventilation are used depending on the patient's underlying disease and specific needs.

In rare circumstances, surgery may be required to more quickly stabilize the flail segment. This may be used in the patient who is difficult to ventilate or the high-risk patient with underlying lung disease who may be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Regardless of the type of treatment, the patient is carefully monitored by serial chest x-rays, arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and bedside pulmonary function monitoring. Pain management is key to successful treatment. Patient-controlled analgesia, intercostal nerve blocks, epidural analgesia, and intrapleural administration of opioids may be used to control thoracic pain.

\section*{Pulmonary Contusion}

Pulmonary contusion is observed in about $20 \%$ of adult patients with multiple traumatic injuries and in a higher percentage of children due to increased compliance of the chest wall. It is defined as damage to the lung tissues resulting in hemorrhage and localized edema. It is associated with chest trauma when there is rapid compression and decompression to the chest wall (ie, blunt trauma). It may not be evident initially on examination but will develop in the posttraumatic period.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

The primary pathologic defect is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitial and intra-alveolar spaces. It is thought that injury to the lung parenchyma and its capillary network results in a leakage of serum protein and plasma. The leaking serum protein exerts an osmotic pressure that enhances loss of fluid from the capillaries. Blood, edema, and cellular debris (from cellular response to injury) enter the lung and accumulate in the bronchioles and alveolar surface, where they interfere with gas exchange. An increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure occurs. The patient has hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention. Occasionally, a contused lung occurs on the other side of the point of body impact; this is called a contrecoup contusion.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

Pulmonary contusion may be mild, moderate, or severe. The clinical manifestations vary from tachypnea, tachycardia, pleuritic chest pain, hypoxemia, and blood-tinged secretions to more severe tachypnea, tachycardia, crackles, frank bleeding, severe hypoxemia, and respiratory acidosis. Changes in sensorium, including increased agitation or combative irrational behavior, may be signs of hypoxemia.

In addition, the patient with moderate pulmonary contusion has a large amount of mucus, serum, and frank blood in the tracheobronchial tree; the patient often has a constant cough but cannot clear the secretions. A patient with severe pulmonary contusion has the signs and symptoms of ARDS; these may include central cyanosis, agitation, combativeness, and productive cough with frothy, bloody secretions.

\section*{ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS}

The efficiency of gas exchange is determined by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas measurements. Pulse oximetry is also used
to measure oxygen saturation continuously. The chest x-ray may show pulmonary infiltration. The initial chest x -ray may show no changes; in fact, changes may not appear for 1 or 2 days after the injury.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

Treatment priorities include maintaining the airway, providing adequate oxygenation, and controlling pain. In mild pulmonary contusion, adequate hydration via intravenous fluids and oral intake is important to mobilize secretions. However, fluid intake must be closely monitored to avoid hypervolemia. Volume expansion techniques, postural drainage, physiotherapy including coughing, and endotracheal suctioning are used to remove the secretions. Pain is managed by intercostal nerve blocks or by opioids via patient-controlled analgesia or other methods. Usually, antimicrobial therapy is administered because the damaged lung is susceptible to infection. Supplemental oxygen is usually given by mask or cannula for 24 to 36 hours.

The patient with moderate pulmonary contusion may require bronchoscopy to remove secretions; intubation and mechanical ventilation with PEEP may also be necessary to maintain the pressure and keep the lungs inflated. Diuretics may be given to reduce edema. A nasogastric tube is inserted to relieve gastrointestinal distention.

The patient with severe contusion may develop respiratory failure and may require aggressive treatment with endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support, diuretics, and fluid restriction. Colloids and crystalloid solutions may be used to treat hypovolemia.

Antimicrobial medications may be prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary infection. This is a common complication of pulmonary contusion (especially pneumonia in the contused segment), because the fluid and blood that extravasates into the alveolar and interstitial spaces serve as an excellent culture medium.

\section*{PENETRATING TRAUMA: GUNSHOT AND STAB WOUNDS}

Gunshot and stab wounds are the most common types of penetrating chest trauma. They are classified according to their velocity. Stab wounds are generally considered of low velocity because the weapon destroys a small area around the wound. Knives and switchblades cause most stab wounds. The appearance of the external wound may be very deceptive, because pneumothorax, hemothorax, lung contusion, and cardiac tamponade, along with severe and continuing hemorrhage, can occur from any small wound, even one caused by a small-diameter instrument such as an ice pick.

Gunshot wounds to the chest may be classified as of low, medium, or high velocity. The factors that determine the velocity and resulting extent of damage include the distance from which the gun was fired, the caliber of the gun, and construction and size of the bullet. A gunshot wound can produce a variety of pathophysiologic changes. A bullet can cause damage at the site of penetration and along its pathway. It also may ricochet off bony structures and damage the chest organs and great vessels. If the diaphragm is involved in either a gunshot wound or a stab wound, injury to the chest cavity must be considered.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objective of immediate management is to restore and maintain cardiopulmonary function. After an adequate airway is ensured and ventilation is established, the patient is examined for
shock and intrathoracic and intra-abdominal injuries. The patient is undressed completely so that additional injuries will not be missed. There is a high risk for associated intra-abdominal injuries with stab wounds below the level of the fifth anterior intercostal space. Death can result from exsanguinating hemorrhage or intraabdominal sepsis.

After the status of the peripheral pulses is assessed, a large-bore intravenous line is inserted. The diagnostic workup includes a chest x-ray, chemistry profile, arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and ECG. Blood typing and cross-matching are done in case blood transfusion is required. An indwelling catheter is inserted to monitor urinary output. A nasogastric tube is inserted to prevent aspiration, minimize leakage of abdominal contents, and decompress the gastrointestinal tract.

Shock is treated simultaneously with colloid solutions, crystalloids, or blood, as indicated by the patient's condition. Chest x-rays are obtained, and other diagnostic procedures are carried out as dictated by the needs of the patient (eg, CT scans of chest or abdomen, flat plate x-ray of the abdomen, abdominal tap to check for bleeding).

A chest tube is inserted into the pleural space in most patients with penetrating wounds of the chest to achieve rapid and continuing re-expansion of the lungs. The insertion of the chest tube frequently results in a complete evacuation of the blood and air. The chest tube also allows early recognition of continuing intrathoracic bleeding, which would make surgical exploration necessary. If the patient has a penetrating wound of the heart and great vessels, the esophagus, or the tracheobronchial tree, surgical intervention is required.

\section*{PNEUMOTHORAX}

Pneumothorax occurs when the parietal or visceral pleura is breached and the pleural space is exposed to positive atmospheric pressure. Normally the pressure in the pleural space is negative or subatmospheric compared to atmospheric pressure; this negative pressure is required to maintain lung inflation. When either pleura is breached, air enters the pleural space, and the lung or a portion of it collapses. Types of pneumothorax include simple, traumatic, and tension pneumothorax.

\section*{Simple Pneumothorax}

A simple, or spontaneous, pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space through a breach of either the parietal or visceral pleura. Most commonly this occurs as air enters the pleural space through the rupture of a bleb or a bronchopleural fistula. A spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in an apparently healthy person in the absence of trauma due to rupture of an air-filled bleb, or blister, on the surface of the lung, allowing air from the airways to enter the pleural cavity. It may be associated with diffuse interstitial lung disease and severe emphysema.

\section*{Traumatic Pneumothorax}

Traumatic pneumothorax occurs when air escapes from a laceration in the lung itself and enters the pleural space or enters the pleural space through a wound in the chest wall. It can occur with blunt trauma (eg, rib fractures) or penetrating chest trauma. It may also occur from abdominal trauma (eg, stab wounds or gunshot wounds to the abdomen) and from diaphragmatic tears. Traumatic pneumothorax may occur with invasive thoracic procedures (ie, thoracentesis, transbronchial lung biopsy, insertion
of a subclavian line) in which the pleura is inadvertently punctured, or with barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.

Traumatic pneumothorax resulting from major injury to the chest is often accompanied by hemothorax (collection of blood in the pleural space resulting from torn intercostal vessels, lacerations of the great vessels, and lacerations of the lungs). Often both blood and air are found in the chest cavity (hemopneumothorax) after major trauma. Chest surgery can cause what is classified as a traumatic pneumothorax as a result of the entry into the pleural space and the accumulation of air and fluid in the pleural space.

Open pneumothorax is one form of traumatic pneumothorax. It occurs when a wound in the chest wall is large enough to allow air to pass freely in and out of the thoracic cavity with each attempted respiration. Because the rush of air through the hole in the chest wall produces a sucking sound, such injuries are termed sucking chest wounds. In such patients, not only does the lung collapse, but the structures of the mediastinum (heart and great vessels) also shift toward the uninjured side with each inspiration and in the opposite direction with expiration. This is termed mediastinal flutter or swing, and it produces serious circulatory problems.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms associated with pneumothorax depend on its size and cause. Pain is usually sudden and may be pleuritic. The patient may have only minimal respiratory distress with slight chest discomfort and tachypnea with a small simple or uncomplicated pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax is large and the lung collapses totally, acute respiratory distress occurs. The patient is anxious, has dyspnea and air hunger, has increased use of the accessory muscles, and may develop central cyanosis from severe hypoxemia. Severe chest pain may occur, accompanied by tachypnea, decreased movement of the affected side of the thorax, a tympanic sound on percussion of the chest wall, and decreased or absent breath sounds and tactile fremitus on the affected side.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical management of pneumothorax depends on its cause and severity. The goal of treatment is to evacuate the air or blood from the pleural space. A small chest tube ( 28 French) is inserted near the second intercostal space; this space is used because it is the thinnest part of the chest wall, minimizes the danger of contacting the thoracic nerve, and leaves a less visible scar. If the patient also has a hemothorax, a large-diameter chest tube ( 32 French or greater) is inserted, usually in the fourth or fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line. The tube is directed posteriorly to drain the fluid and air. Once the chest tube or tubes are inserted and suction is applied (usually to 20 mm Hg suction), effective decompression of the pleural cavity (drainage of blood or air) occurs.

If an excessive amount of blood enters the chest tube in a relatively short period, an autotransfusion may be needed. This technique involves taking the patient's own blood that has been drained from the chest, filtering it, and then transfusing it back into the patient's vascular system.

In such an emergency, anything may be used that is large enough to fill the chest wound-a towel, a handkerchief, or the heel of the hand. If conscious, the patient is instructed to inhale and strain against a closed glottis. This action assists in reexpanding the lung and ejecting the air from the thorax. In the hospital, the opening is plugged by sealing it with gauze impregnated with petrolatum. A pressure dressing is applied. Usually, a chest tube connected to water-seal drainage is inserted to permit air and fluid to drain. Antibiotics usually are prescribed to combat infection from contamination.

The severity of open pneumothorax depends on the amount and rate of thoracic bleeding and the amount of air in the pleural space. The pleural cavity can be decompressed by needle aspiration (thoracentesis) or chest tube drainage of the blood or air. The lung is then able to re-expand and resume the function of gas exchange. As a rule of thumb, the chest wall is opened surgically (thoracotomy) when more than $1,500 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood is aspirated initially by thoracentesis (or is the initial chest tube output) or when chest tube output continues at greater than $200 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour . The urgency with which the blood must be removed is determined by the respiratory compromise. An emergency thoracotomy may also be performed in the emergency department if there is suggested cardiovascular injury secondary to chest or penetrating trauma.

\section*{Tension Pneumothorax}

A tension pneumothorax occurs when air is drawn into the pleural space from a lacerated lung or through a small hole in the chest wall. It may be a complication of other types of pneumothorax. In contrast to open pneumothorax, the air that enters the chest cavity with each inspiration is trapped; it cannot be expelled during expiration through the air passages or the hole in the chest wall. In effect, a one-way valve or ball valve mechanism occurs where air enters the pleural space but cannot escape. With each breath, tension (positive pressure) is increased within the affected pleural space. This causes the lung to collapse and the heart, the great vessels, and the trachea to shift toward the unaffected side of the chest (mediastinal shift). Both respiration and circulatory function are compromised because of the increased intrathoracic pressure. The increased intrathoracic pressure decreases venous return to the heart, causing decreased cardiac output and impairment of peripheral circulation. In extreme cases, the pulse may be undetectable-this is known as pulseless electrical activity.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

The clinical picture is one of air hunger, agitation, increasing hypoxemia, central cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and profuse diaphoresis. A comparison of open and tension pneumothorax is shown in Figure 23-9.

NURSING ALERT Relief of tension pneumothorax is considered an emergency measure.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

If a tension pneumothorax is suspected, the patient should immediately be given a high concentration of supplemental oxygen to treat the hypoxemia, and pulse oximetry should be used to monitor oxygen saturation.

In an emergency situation, a tension pneumothorax can be decompressed or quickly converted to a simple pneumothorax by inserting a large-bore needle (14-gauge) at the second intercostal

\caption{EIGURE 23-9 Open pneumothorax (top) and tension pneumothorax (bottom). In open pneumothorax, air enters the chest during inspiration and exits during expiration. A slight shift of the affected lung may occur because of a decrease in pressure as air moves out of the chest. In tension pneumothorax, air enters but cannot leave the chest. As the pressure increases, the heart and great vessels are compressed and the mediastinal structures are shifted toward the opposite side of the chest. The trachea is pushed from its normal midline position toward the opposite side of the chest, and the unaffected lung is compressed.}

space, midclavicular line on the affected side. This relieves the pressure and vents the positive pressure to the external environment. A chest tube is then inserted and connected to suction to remove the remaining air and fluid, re-establish the negative pressure, and re-expand the lung. If the lung re-expands and air leakage from the lung parenchyma stops, further drainage may be unnecessary. If a prolonged air leak continues despite chest tube drainage to underwater seal, surgery may be necessary to close the leak.

\section*{CARDIAC TAMPONADE}

Cardiac tamponade is the compression of the heart as a result of fluid within the pericardial sac. It usually is caused by blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest. A penetrating wound of the heart is associated with a high mortality rate. Cardiac tamponade also may follow diagnostic cardiac catheterization, angiographic procedures, and pacemaker insertion, which can produce perforations of the heart and great vessels. Pericardial effusion with fluid compressing the heart also may develop from metastases to the pericardium from malignant tumors of the breast, lung, and mediastinum and may occur with lymphomas and leukemias,
renal failure, TB, and high-dose radiation to the chest. Cardiac tamponade is discussed in detail in Chapter 30.

\section*{SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA}

No matter what kind of chest trauma the patient has, when the lung or the air passages are injured, air may enter the tissue planes and pass for some distance under the skin (eg, neck, chest). The tissues give a crackling sensation when palpated, and the subcutaneous air produces an alarming appearance as the face, neck, body, and scrotum become misshapen by subcutaneous air. Fortunately, subcutaneous emphysema is of itself usually not a serious complication. The subcutaneous air is spontaneously absorbed if the underlying air leak is treated or stops spontaneously. In severe cases in which there is widespread subcutaneous emphysema, a tracheostomy is indicated if airway patency is threatened.

\section*{Aspiration}

Aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs is a serious complication that may cause pneumonia and result in the following clinical picture: tachycardia, dyspnea, central cyanosis, hypertension, hypotension, and finally death. It can occur when the protective airway reflexes are decreased or absent from a variety of factors (Chart 23-11).

NURSING ALERT When a nonfunctioning nasogastric tube allows the gastric contents to accumulate in the stomach, a condition known as silent aspiration may result. Silent aspiration often occurs unobserved and may be more common than suspected. If untreated, massive inhalation of gastric contents develops in a period of several hours.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The primary factors responsible for death and complications after aspiration of gastric contents are the volume and character of the aspirated gastric contents. For example, a small, localized aspiration from regurgitation can cause pneumonia and acute respiratory distress; a massive aspiration is usually fatal.

A full stomach contains solid particles of food. If these are aspirated, the problem then becomes one of mechanical blockage of the airways and secondary infection. During periods of fasting, the stomach contains acidic gastric juice, which, if aspirated, may be very destructive to the alveoli and capillaries. Fecal contamination (more likely seen in intestinal obstruction) increases the

\section*{Risk Factors for Aspiration}

Seizure activity
Decreased level of consciousness from trauma, drug or alcohol intoxication, excessive sedation, or general anesthesia
Nausea and vomiting in the patient with a decreased level of consciousness
Stroke
Swallowing disorders
Cardiac arrest
Silent aspiration
likelihood of death because the endotoxins produced by intestinal organisms may be absorbed systemically, or the thick proteinaceous material found in the intestinal contents may obstruct the airway, leading to atelectasis and secondary bacterial invasion.

Aspiration pneumonitis may develop from aspiration of substances with a pH of less than 2.5 and a volume of gastric aspirate greater than 0.3 mL per kilogram of body weight ( 20 to 25 mL in adults) (Marik, 2001). Aspiration of gastric contents causes a chemical burn of the tracheobronchial tree and pulmonary parenchyma (Marik, 2001). An inflammatory response occurs. This results in the destruction of alveolar-capillary endothelial cells, with a consequent outpouring of protein-rich fluids into the interstitial and intra-alveolar spaces. As a result, surfactant is lost, which in turn causes the airways to close and the alveoli to collapse. Finally, the impaired exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide causes respiratory failure.

Aspiration pneumonia develops following inhalation of colonized oropharyngeal material. The pathologic process involves an acute inflammatory response to bacteria and bacterial products. Most commonly, the bacteriologic findings include gram-positive cocci, gram-negative rods, and occasionally anaerobic bacteria (Marik, 2001).

\section*{Prevention}

Prevention is the primary goal when caring for patients at risk for aspiration.

\section*{COMPENSATING FOR ABSENT REFLEXES}

Aspiration is likely to occur if the patient cannot adequately coordinate protective glottic, laryngeal, and cough reflexes. This hazard is increased if the patient has a distended abdomen, is in a supine position, has the upper extremities immobilized by intravenous infusions or hand restraints, receives local anesthetics to the oropharyngeal or laryngeal area for diagnostic procedures, has been sedated, or has had long-term intubation.

When vomiting, a person can normally protect the airway by sitting up or turning on the side and coordinating breathing, coughing, gag, and glottic reflexes. If these reflexes are active, an oral airway should not be inserted. If an airway is in place, it should be pulled out the moment the patient gags so as not to stimulate the pharyngeal gag reflex and promote vomiting and aspiration. Suctioning of oral secretions with a catheter should be performed with minimal pharyngeal stimulation.

\section*{ASSESSING FEEDING TUBE PLACEMENT}

Even when the patient is intubated, aspiration may occur even with a nasogastric tube in place. This aspiration may result in nosocomial pneumonia. Assessment of tube placement is key to prevent aspiration. The best method for determining tube placement is via an x-ray. There are other nonradiologic methods that have been studied. Observation of the aspirate and testing of its pH are the most reliable. Gastric fluid may be grassy green, brown, clear, or colorless. An aspirate from the lungs may be offwhite or tan mucus. Pleural fluid is watery and usually strawcolored (Metheny \& Titler, 2001). Gastric pH values are typically lower or more acidic that that of the intestinal or respiratory tract. Gastric pH is usually between 1 and 5, while intestinal or respiratory pH is 7 or higher (Metheny \& Titler, 2001). There are differences in assessing tube placement with continuous versus intermittent feedings. For intermittent feedings with small-bore tubes, observation of aspirated contents and pH evaluation should be performed. For continuous feedings, the pH method

\section*{Purpose}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of aspiration in adults with tracheostomies and to investigate the effect of the Passy-Muir speaking valve on aspiration occurrences.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Fifteen subjects were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were that there was a tracheostomy in place and the patient was scheduled for a videofluoroscopic swallowing examination. During the swallowing examination, six presentations of thin liquids were recorded: three with and three without the Passy-Muir tracheostomy speaking valve applied.

\section*{Findings}

Seven of the 15 subjects ( $47 \%$ ) aspirated material on one or more presentations of the thin liquid. Five subjects aspirated without the valve and two subjects aspirated with and without the valve. No subjects aspirated only when the valve was applied. Aspiration occurred less frequently with the Passy-Muir tracheostomy speaking valve on than with it off.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Aspiration is a common problem that can lead to severe pulmonary complications. Potential complications of aspiration include obstruction, inflammation (pneumonitis), and infection (aspiration pneumonia). Nursing assessment and knowledge of risk factors are key in evaluating patients at risk for potential aspiration problems and preventing this complication.
is not clinically useful due to the infused formula (Metheny \& Titler, 2001).

The patient who is receiving continuous or timed-interval tube feedings must be positioned properly. The patient receiving a continuous infusion is given small volumes under low pressure in an upright position, which helps to prevent aspiration. Patients receiving tube feedings at timed intervals are maintained in an upright position during the feeding and for a minimum of 30 minutes afterward to allow the stomach to empty partially. Tube feedings must be given only when it is certain that the feeding tube is positioned correctly in the stomach. Many patients today receive enteral feeding directly into the duodenum through a small-bore flexible feeding tube or surgically implanted tube. Feedings are given slowly and regulated by a feeding pump. Correct placement is confirmed by chest x-ray.

\section*{IDENTIFYING DELAYED STOMACH EMPTYING}

A full stomach may cause aspiration because of increased intragastric or extragastric pressure. The following clinical situations cause a delayed emptying time of the stomach and may contribute to aspiration: intestinal obstruction; increased gastric secretions in gastroesophageal reflex disease; increased gastric secretions during anxiety, stress, or pain; or abdominal distention because of ileus, ascites, peritonitis, use of opioids and sedatives, severe illness, or vaginal delivery.

When a feeding tube is present, contents are aspirated, usually every 4 hours, to determine the amount of the last feeding left in the stomach (residual volume). If more than 50 mL is aspirated, there may be a problem with delayed emptying, and the next
feeding should be delayed or the continuous feeding stopped for a period of time.

\section*{MANAGING EFFECTS OF PROLONGED INTUBATION}

Prolonged endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy can depress the laryngeal and glottic reflexes because of disuse. Patients with prolonged tracheostomies are encouraged to phonate and exercise their laryngeal muscles. For patients who have had long-term intubation or tracheostomies, it may be helpful to have a rehabilitation therapist experienced in speech and swallowing disorders work with the patient to assess the swallowing reflex.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your patient, a 44-year-old unemployed man who lives with his 80-year-old mother, has recently been diagnosed with active TB. He has been started on treatment and given specific instructions about his medications. What strategies would you initiate to be sure that he takes his medications correctly? What strategies would you use to ensure that his mother is not infected? How would your care differ if the patient lived alone or were homeless?
2. You are working on a surgical unit. Your patient is a 67-year-old woman who has had surgery to repair a fractured hip that occurred following a fall associated with heavy alcohol use. She has been a heavy smoker for over 35 years and is reluctant to move in bed because of pain. What are the potential postoperative pulmonary complications? What assessment criteria would you use to assess her respiratory status? What interventions would you implement to prevent pulmonary complications in this patient? What changes, if any, would you implement if she had a history of deep vein thrombosis?
3. Your patient has experienced blunt chest trauma following a motor vehicle crash. A chest tube has been inserted to treat a pneumothorax. The chest drainage system has drained 400 mL of light-red fluid during the first 6 hours following the tube's insertion. The patient is unable to recall how he was injured or what has happened to him over the last 24 hours. The patient is experiencing pain requiring opioids and is asking that the chest tube be removed to enable him to walk to the bathroom. What additional information would you obtain through assessment and what actions would you take? How would you explain to the patient and his family the purpose of the chest tubes? How would you modify your explanation and teaching if he has little understanding of English?

}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Nurses are involved with COPD patients across the spectrum of care, from outpatient and home care to critical care and the hospice setting. Patients with COPD or asthma need care from nurses who not only have astute assessment and clinical management skills, but who also understand how these disorders can affect patients' quality of life. Patient and family teaching is an important nursing intervention to enhance self-management of COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis.

\section*{Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. This newest definition of COPD, provided by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, provides a broad description that better explains this disorder and its signs and symptoms (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2001). While previous definitions have included emphysema and chronic bronchitis under the umbrella classification of COPD, this was often confusing because most patients with COPD present with overlapping signs and symptoms of these two distinct disease processes.

COPD may include diseases that cause airflow obstruction (eg, emphysema, chronic bronchitis) or a combination of these disorders. Other diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and asthma were previously classified as types of chronic obstructive lung disease. However, asthma is now considered a separate disorder and is classified as an abnormal airway condition characterized primarily by reversible inflammation. COPD can coexist with asthma. Both of these diseases have the same major symptoms; however, symptoms are generally more variable in asthma than in COPD. This chapter discusses COPD as a disease and briefly describes chronic bronchitis and emphysema as distinct disease states, providing a foundation for understanding the pathophysiology of COPD. Bronchiectasis, asthma, and cystic fibrosis are discussed separately.

COPD is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States for all ages and both genders; fifth for men and fourth for women (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 2000). In 1998, more than 12,000 persons died of COPD. This represents a rise in the mortality rate for this disorder at a time when death rates
from other serious illnesses, such as heart disease and cerebral vascular disease, were declining. Approximately 16 million people in the United States have some form of COPD; it is responsible for over 13.4 million office visits per year and is the third most frequent justification for home care services (NCHS, 2000; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 1998). People with COPD commonly become symptomatic during the middle adult years, and the incidence of COPD increases with age. Although certain aspects of lung function normally decrease with age (eg, vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second $\left.\left[\mathrm{FEV}_{1}\right]\right)$, COPD accentuates and accelerates these physiologic changes.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In COPD, the airflow limitation is both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. The inflammatory response occurs throughout the airways, parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature (NIH, 2001). Because of the chronic inflammation and the body's attempts to repair it, narrowing occurs in the small peripheral airways. Over time, this injury-and-repair process causes scar tissue formation and narrowing of the airway lumen. Airflow obstruction may also be due to parenchymal destruction as seen with emphysema, a disease of the alveoli or gas exchange units.

In addition to inflammation, processes relating to imbalances of proteinases and antiproteinases in the lung may be responsible for airflow limitation. When activated by chronic inflammation, proteinases and other substances may be released, damaging the parenchyma of the lung. The parenchymal changes may also be consequences of inflammation, environmental, or genetic factors (eg, alpha ${ }_{1}$ antitrypsin deficiency).

Early in the course of COPD, the inflammatory response causes pulmonary vasculature changes that are characterized by thickening of the vessel wall. These changes may occur as a result of exposure to cigarette smoke or use of tobacco products or as a result of the release of inflammatory mediators (NIH, 2001).

\section*{Chronic Bronchitis}

Chronic bronchitis, a disease of the airways, is defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years. In many cases, smoke or other environmental pollutants irritate the airways, resulting in hypersecretion
air trapping: incomplete emptying of alveoli during expiration due to loss of lung tissue elasticity (emphysema), bronchospasm (asthma), or airway obstruction
alpha $_{1}$ antitrypsin deficiency: genetic disorder resulting from deficiency of alpha ${ }_{1}$ antitrypsin, a protective agent for the lung; increases patient's risk for developing panacinar emphysema even in the absence of smoking
asthma: a disease with multiple precipitating mechanisms resulting in a common clinical outcome of reversible airflow obstruction; no longer considered a category of COPD
bronchiectasis: chronic dilation of a
bronchus or bronchi; the dilated airways
become saccular and are a medium for chronic infection. Is no longer considered a category of COPD.
bronchitis: a disease of the airways defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least a combined total of 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years; is a category of COPD
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:
disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible; sometimes referred to as chronic airway obstruction or chronic obstructive lung disease
emphysema: a disease of the airways characterized by destruction of the walls of
overdistended alveoli; is a category of COPD
metered-dose inhaler (MDI): patientactivated medication canister that provides aerosolized medication that the patient inhales into the lungs
polycythemia: increase in the red blood cell concentration in the blood; in COPD, the body attempts to improve oxygen carrying capacity by producing increasing amounts of red blood cells
spirometry: pulmonary function tests that measure specific lung volumes (eg, $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$, FVC) and rates $\left(\mathrm{FEF}_{25-75 \%}\right)$; may be measured before and after bronchodilator administration
of mucus and inflammation. This constant irritation causes the mucus-secreting glands and goblet cells to increase in number, ciliary function is reduced, and more mucus is produced. The bronchial walls become thickened, the bronchial lumen is narrowed, and mucus may plug the airway (Fig. 24-1). Alveoli adjacent to the bronchioles may become damaged and fibrosed, resulting in altered function of the alveolar macrophages. This is significant because the macrophages play an important role in destroying foreign particles, including bacteria. As a result, the patient becomes more susceptible to respiratory infection. A wide range of viral, bacterial, and mycoplasmal infections can produce acute episodes of bronchitis. Exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are most likely to occur during the winter.

\section*{Emphysema}

In emphysema, impaired gas exchange (oxygen, carbon dioxide) results from destruction of the walls of overdistended alveoli. "Emphysema" is a pathological term that describes an abnormal distention of the air spaces beyond the terminal bronchioles, with destruction of the walls of the alveoli. It is the end stage of a process that has progressed slowly for many years. As the walls of the alveoli are destroyed (a process accelerated by recurrent infections), the alveolar surface area in direct contact with the pulmonary capillaries continually decreases, causing an increase in dead space (lung area where no gas exchange can occur) and impaired oxygen diffusion, which leads to hypoxemia. In the later stages of the disease, carbon dioxide elimination is impaired, resulting in increased carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood (hypercapnia) and causing respiratory acidosis. As the alveolar walls continue to break down, the pulmonary capillary bed is reduced. Consequently, pulmonary blood flow is increased, forcing the right ventricle to maintain a higher blood pressure in the pulmonary artery. Hypoxemia may futher increase pulmonary artery pressure. Thus, right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale) is one of the complications of emphysema. Congestion, dependent edema, distended neck veins, or pain in the region of the liver suggests the development of cardiac failure.

There are two main types of emphysema, based on the changes taking place in the lung: panlobular (panacinar) and centrilobular (centroacinar) (Fig. 24-2). Both types may occur in the same pa-

\begin{figure}

tient. In the panlobular (panacinar) type, there is destruction of the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveoli. All air spaces within the lobule are essentially enlarged, but there is little inflammatory disease. The patient with this type of emphysema typically has a hyperinflated (hyperexpanded) chest (barrel chest on physical examination), marked dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss. To move air into and out of the lungs, negative pressure is required during inspiration, and an adequate level of positive pressure must be attained and maintained during expiration. The resting position is one of inflation. Instead of being an involuntary passive act, expiration becomes active and requires mus-

cular effort. The patient becomes increasingly short of breath, the chest becomes rigid, and the ribs are fixed at their joints.

In the centrilobular (centroacinar) form, pathologic changes take place mainly in the center of the secondary lobule, preserving the peripheral portions of the acinus. Frequently, there is a derangement of ventilation-perfusion ratios, producing chronic hypoxemia, hypercapnia (increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the arterial blood), polycythemia, and episodes of right-sided heart failure. This leads to central cyanosis, peripheral edema, and respiratory failure. The patient may receive diuretic therapy for edema.

\section*{Risk Factors}

Risk factors for COPD include environmental exposures and host factors (Chart 24-1). The most important risk factor for COPD is cigarette smoking. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking are also risk factors. In addition, passive smoking contributes to respiratory symptoms and COPD (NIH, 2001). Smoking depresses the activity of scavenger cells and affects the respiratory tract's ciliary cleansing mechanism, which keeps breathing passages free of inhaled irritants, bacteria, and other foreign matter. When smoking damages this cleansing mechanism, airflow is obstructed and air becomes trapped behind the obstruction. The alveoli greatly distend, diminishing lung capacity. Smoking also irritates the goblet cells and mucus glands, causing an increased accumulation of mucus, which in turn produces more irritation, infection, and damage to the lung. In addition, carbon monoxide (a byproduct of smoking) combines with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin. Hemoglobin that is bound by carboxyhemoglobin cannot carry oxygen efficiently.

Smoking is not the only risk factor for COPD. Other factors include prolonged and intense exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals, indoor air pollution, and outdoor air pollution, which adds to the total burden of inhaled particles on the lung (NIH, 2001).

A host risk factor for COPD is a deficiency of alpha ${ }_{1}$ antitrypsin, an enzyme inhibitor that protects the lung parenchyma from injury. This deficiency predisposes young patients to rapid development of lobular emphysema even in the absence of smoking. Alpha ${ }_{1}$ antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common genetically linked lethal diseases among Caucasians and affects approximately one in every 3,000 Americans or approximately 80,000 to 100,000 cases (George, San Pedro \& Stoller, 2000). The genetically susceptible person is sensitive to environmental factors (smoking, air pollution, infectious agents, allergens) and in time develops chronic obstructive symptoms. Carriers of this genetic defect must be identified so that they can modify environmental risk factors to delay or prevent overt symptoms of dis-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-089.jpg?height=466&width=870&top_left_y=2144&top_left_x=202)
ease. Genetic counseling should also be offered. Alpha-protease inhibitor replacement therapy, which slows the progression of the disease, is available for patients with this genetic defect and for those with severe disease. This intermittent infusion therapy is costly and is required on an ongoing basis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

COPD is characterized by three primary symptoms: cough, sputum production, and dyspnea on exertion (NIH, 2001). These symptoms often worsen over time. Chronic cough and sputum production often precede the development of airflow limitation by many years. However, not all individuals with cough and sputum production will develop COPD. Dyspnea may be severe and often interferes with the patient's activities. Weight loss is common because dyspnea interferes with eating, and the work of breathing is energy-depleting. Often the patient cannot participate in even mild exercise because of dyspnea; as COPD progresses, dyspnea occurs even at rest. As the work of breathing increases over time, the accessory muscles are recruited in an effort to breathe. The patient with COPD is at risk for respiratory insufficiency and respiratory infections, which in turn increase the risk for acute and chronic respiratory failure.

In COPD patients with a primary emphysematous component, chronic hyperinflation leads to the "barrel chest" thorax configuration. This results from fixation of the ribs in the inspiratory position (due to hyperinflation) and from loss of lung elasticity (Fig. 24-3). Retraction of the supraclavicular fossae occurs on inspiration, causing the shoulders to heave upward (Fig. 24-4). In advanced emphysema, the abdominal muscles also contract on inspiration.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The nurse should obtain a thorough health history for a patient with known or potential COPD. Chart 24-2 lists the key factors to assess. Pulmonary function studies are used to help confirm the diagnosis of COPD, determine disease severity, and follow disease progression. Spirometry is used to evaluate airflow obstruction, which is determined by the ratio of $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ (volume of air that the patient can forcibly exhale in 1 second) to forced vital capacity (FVC). Spirometric results are expressed as an absolute volume and as percent-predicted using appropriate normal values for gender, age, and height. With obstruction, the patient either has difficulty exhaling or cannot forcibly exhale air from the lungs, reducing the $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$. Obstructive lung disease is defined as a $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ /FVC ratio of less than $70 \%$.

In addition, bronchodilator reversibility testing may be performed to rule out the diagnosis of asthma and to guide initial treatment. With this type of testing, spirometry is first obtained, then the patient is given an inhaled bronchodilator per a protocol, and finally spirometry is repeated. The patient demonstrates a degree of reversibility if the pulmonary function values improve after administration of the bronchodilator.

Arterial blood gas measurements may also be obtained to assess baseline oxygenation and gas exchange. In addition, a chest x-ray may be obtained to exclude alternative diagnoses. Lastly, alpha ${ }_{1}$ antitrypsin deficiency screening may be performed for patients under age 45 or for those with a strong family history of COPD.

The severity of COPD is classified into four stages (Table 24-1) (National Institutes of Health, 2001). Factors that determine the clinical course and survival of patients with COPD include history

\section*{Purpose}

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), physical activity is an important part of their quality of life. Yet litthe is known about the contributions of psychological and physiologic variables to physical activity in this population. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships among differing functional performance measures (physical activity, functional capacity, symptom experience, and health-related quality of life) in this population.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This cross-sectional, descriptive study evaluated 63 outpatients with COPD prior to entry into a pulmonary rehabilitation program. The sample was predominantly male ( 60 men and 3 women) with a mean age of $65.4 \pm 8.0$ years. None of the participants had been hospitalized in the past 2 months for a respiratory problem, and none was engaged in a formalized exercise program. Functional performance was measured by physical activity (evaluated by an accelerometer and selfreport). Functional capacity was measured by three measures of impairment (pulmonary function tests $\left[\mathrm{FEV}_{1}\right], 6$-minute walk test, and
a self-efficacy questionnaire for walking). The symptom experiences of dyspnea and fatigue as well as health-related quality of life were measured by widely used reliable and valid questionnaires.

\section*{Findings}

Sixty-nine subjects were initially enrolled in the study but six were withdrawn due to missing data. Daily physical activity as measured by the accelerometer was strongly associated with the maximal distance walked in the 6 -minute walk test, the level of airway obstruction as measured by pulmonary function tests, walking self-efficacy, and physical health status. Physical activity was not correlated with the subjects' self-report of functional status. The 6 -minute walk test was the only predictor of physical activity in this sample.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Functional performance status is an important multidimensional outcome measure for both nursing and medicine. This study demonstrates that the multiple measures of functional performance status, which are frequently used in clinical practice and research, may differ in their relationship to the actual physical activity level of the patient.
of cigarette smoking, passive smoking exposure, age, rate of decline of $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$, hypoxemia, pulmonary artery pressure, resting heart rate, weight loss, and reversibility of airflow obstruction (George, San Pedro \& Stoller, 2000).

In diagnosing COPD, several differential diagnoses must be ruled out. The primary differential diagnosis is asthma. Key char-
acteristics of asthma include onset often early in life, variation in daily symptoms and day-to-day occurrence or timing of symptoms, family history of asthma, and a largely reversible airflow obstruction. It may be difficult to differentiate between a patient with COPD and one with chronic asthma. A key part of differentiation is the patient history, as well as the patient's respon-

\section*{Complications}

Respiratory insufficiency and failure are major life-threatening complications of COPD. The acuity of the onset and the severity of respiratory failure depend on the patient's baseline pulmonary function, pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas values, comorbid conditions, and the severity of other complications of COPD. Respiratory insufficiency and failure may be chronic

(with severe COPD) or acute (with severe bronchospasm or pneumonia in the patient with severe COPD). Acute respiratory insufficiency and failure may necessitate ventilatory support until other acute complications, such as infection, can be treated. Management of the patient requiring ventilatory support is discussed in Chapter 25. Other complications of COPD include pneumonia, atelectasis, pneumothorax, and cor pulmonale.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{RISK REDUCTION}

Smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention to prevent COPD or slow its progression (NIH, 2001). Recent surveys indicate that $25 \%$ of all American adults smoke (USPHS, 2000). Nurses play a key role in promoting smoking cessation and educating patients about ways to do so. Patients diagnosed with COPD who continue to smoke must be encouraged and assisted to quit. Factors associated with continued smoking vary among patients and may include the strength of nicotine addiction, continued exposure to smoking-associated stimuli (at work or in social settings), stress, depression, and habit. Continued smoking is also more prevalent among those with low incomes, a low level of education, and psychosocial problems (Pohl, 2000).

Because there are multiple factors associated with continued smoking, successful cessation often requires multiple strategies. The health care provider should promote cessation by explaining the risks of smoking and personalizing the "at-risk" message to the patient. After giving a strong warning about smoking, the health care provider should work with the patient to set a definite "quit date." Referral to a smoking cessation program may be helpful. Follow-up within 3 to 5 days after the quit date to review progress and to address any problems is associated with an increased rate of success; this should be repeated as needed. Continued reinforcement with telephone calls or clinic visits is extremely beneficial. Relapses should be analyzed, and the patient and health care provider should jointly identify possible solutions to prevent future backsliding. It is important to emphasize successes rather
than failures. First-line pharmacotherapies that reliably increase long-term smoking abstinence rates are bupropion SR (Zyban, Wellbutrin), nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, or nicotine patches. Second-line pharmacotherapies include clonidine (Catapres) and nortriptyline (Aventyl) (USPHS, 2000).

Smoking cessation can begin in a variety of health care settingsoutpatient clinic, pulmonary rehabilitation, community, hospital, and the patient's home. Regardless of the setting, the nurse has the opportunity to teach the patient about the risks of smoking and the benefits of smoking cessation. A variety of materials, resources, and programs are available to assist with this effort (eg, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [formerly Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research], United States Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Cancer Institute, American Lung Association, American Cancer Society).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Bronchodilators. Bronchodilators relieve bronchospasm and reduce airway obstruction by allowing increased oxygen distribution throughout the lungs and improving alveolar ventilation. These medications, which are central in the management of COPD (NIH, 2001), are delivered through a metered-dose inhaler, by nebulization, or via the oral route in pill or liquid form. Bronchodilators are often administered regularly throughout the day as well as on an as-needed basis. They may also be used prophylactically to prevent breathlessness by having the patient use them before an activity, such as eating or walking.

A metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is a pressurized device containing an aerosolized powder of medication. A precise amount of medication is released with each activation of the canister (Dhand, 2000). Patients need to be instructed on the correct use
of the device. A spacer (holding chamber) may also be used to enhance deposition of the medication in the lung and help the patient coordinate activation of the MDI with inspiration. Spacers come in several designs, but all are attached to the MDI and have a mouthpiece on the opposite end (Fig. 24-5). Once the canister is activated, the spacer holds the aerosol in the chamber until the patient inhales (Dhand, 2000). The patient should take a slow, 3- to 5-second inhalation immediately following activation of the MDI (Expert Panel Report II, 1997).

Several classes of bronchodilators are used: beta-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergic agents, and methylxanthines. These medications may be used in combination to optimize the bronchodilation effect. Some of these medications are short-acting; others are long-acting. Long-acting bronchodilators are more convenient for patient use. Examples of medications in these differing classes are shown in Table 24-2. Nebulized medications (nebulization of medication via an air compressor) may also be effective in patients who cannot use an MDI properly or who prefer this method of administration.

Corticosteroids. Inhaled and systemic corticosteroids (oral or intravenous) may also be used in COPD but are used more frequently in asthma. Although it has been shown that corticosteroids do not slow the decline in lung function, these medications may improve symptoms. A short trial course of oral corticosteroids may be prescribed for patients with stage II or III COPD to see if pulmonary function improves and symptoms decrease. Inhaled corticosteroids via MDI may also be used. Examples of corticosteroids in the inhaled form are beclomethasone (Beclovent, Vanceril), budesonide (Pulmicort), flunisolide (AeroBid), fluticasone (Flovent), and triamcinolone (Azmacort).

Medication regimens used to manage COPD are based on disease severity. For stage I or mild COPD, a short-acting bron-

chodilator may be prescribed. For stage II or moderate COPD, one or more bronchodilators may be prescribed along with inhaled corticosteroids, if symptoms are significant. For stage III or severe COPD, medication therapy includes regular treatment with one or more bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (NIH, 2001).

Other Medications. Patients should receive a yearly influenza vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine every 5 to 7 years as preventive measures. In most healthy adults, pneumococcal vaccine titers persist for 5 or more years (George, San Pedro \& Stoller, 2000). Other pharmacologic treatments that may be used in COPD include alpha ${ }_{1}$ antitrypsin augmentation therapy, antibiotic agents, mucolytic agents, and antitussive agents.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF EXACERBATION}

An exacerbation of COPD is difficult to diagnose, but signs and symptoms may include increased dyspnea, increased sputum production and purulence, respiratory failure, changes in mental status, or worsening blood gas abnormalities. Primary causes for an acute exacerbation include tracheobronchial infection and air pollution (NIH, 2001). Secondary causes are pneumonia; pulmonary embolism; pneumothorax; rib fractures or chest trauma; inappropriate use of sedative, opioid, or beta-blocking agents; and right- or left-sided heart failure. First, the primary cause of the exacerbation is identified, and then specific treatment is administered. Optimization of bronchodilator medications is the first-line therapy and involves identifying the best medication or combinations of medications taken on a regular schedule for that patient. Depending on the signs and symptoms, corticosteroids, antibiotic agents, oxygen therapy, and intensive respiratory interventions may also be used. Indications for hospitalization of a patient with an acute exacerbation of COPD include severe dyspnea that does not respond adequately to initial therapy, confu-
sion or lethargy, respiratory muscle fatigue, paradoxical chest wall movement, peripheral edema, worsening or new onset of central cyanosis, persistent or worsening hypoxemia, and/or need for noninvasive or invasive assisted mechanical ventilation (Celli, Snider, Heffner et al., 1995; NIH, 2001).

\section*{OXYGEN THERAPY}

Oxygen therapy can be administered as long-term continuous therapy, during exercise, or to prevent acute dyspnea. Longterm oxygen therapy has been shown to improve the patient's quality of life and survival (NIH, 2001). For patients with an arterial oxygen pressure $\left(\mathrm{PaO}_{2}\right)$ of 55 mm Hg or less on room air, maintaining a constant and adequate oxygen saturation ( $>90 \%$ ) is associated with significantly reduced mortality and improved quality of life. Indications for oxygen supplementation include a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of 55 mm Hg or less or evidence of tissue hypoxia and organ damage such as cor pulmonale, secondary polycythemia, edema from right heart failure, or impaired mental status. In patients with exercise-induced hypoxemia, oxygen supplementation during exercise can improve performance. Patients who are hypoxemic while awake are likely to be so during sleep. Therefore, nighttime oxygen therapy is recommended as well, and the prescription for oxygen therapy is for continuous, 24-hour use. Intermittent oxygen therapy is indicated for those who desaturate only during exercise or sleep.

NURSING ALERT Because hypoxemia stimulates respiration in the patient with severe COPD, increasing the oxygen flow to a high rate may greatly raise the patient's blood oxygen level. At the same time, this will suppress the respiratory drive, causing increased retention of carbon dioxide and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ narcosis. The nurse should closely monitor the patient's respiratory response to oxygen administration via physical assessment, pulse oximetry, and/or arterial blood gases.

Knebel, A. R., Bentz, E., \& Barnes, P. (2000). Dyspnea management in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: Effect of oxygen administration. Nursing Research, 49(6), 333-338.

\section*{Purpose}

Limitations in activity due to dyspnea are common in persons with emphysema, including patients with alpha ${ }_{1}$ antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. The purpose of this study was to examine whether short-term oxygen administration decreased dyspnea and improved exercise tolerance in nonhypoxemic patients with emphysema caused by AAT deficiency.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Thirty-one Caucasian subjects participated in a double-blind, crossover study. The subjects' mean age was $47 \pm 7$ years; $62 \%$ were male and $38 \%$ were female. Twenty-four percent had used oxygen supplementation at some point during their illness. Oxygen saturation, 6 -minute walk distance, and end-of-walk dyspnea were measured during three practice walks and during walks with nasal cannula administration of oxygen (intervention) and compressed air (control).

\section*{Findings}

Researchers found significant differences in subjects' oxygen saturation during walks with oxygen vs. walks with compressed air ( $p=0.0001$ ),
with oxygen saturation higher with oxygen supplementation than with compressed air. There was no difference in subjects' walk distance and severity of self-reported dyspnea between oxygen and compressed air use. However, some gender differences were noted. Men showed no benefit from oxygen supplementation while walking, but women experienced less dyspnea, which corresponded with an increased walking distance.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings demonstrated that oxygen supplementation did not significantly improve the sensation of dyspnea or the distance walked in 6 minutes in the total sample of patients with AAT deficiency. However, there were trends in gender differences in relation to dyspnea levels and distance walked while receiving the intervention (oxygen supplementation). Future studies should examine subjects with differing levels of room air hypoxemia and explore potential gender differences in exercise performance with oxygen supplementation. Nurses should be aware that patients may respond differently to oxygen supplementation depending upon the underlying disease process, level of hypoxemia, and gender.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Bullectomy. A bullectomy is a surgical option for select patients with bullous emphysema. Bullae are enlarged airspaces that do not contribute to ventilation but occupy space in the thorax; these areas may be surgically excised. Many times these bullae compress areas of the lung that do have adequate gas exchange. Bullectomy may help reduce dyspnea and improve lung function. It can be done thoracoscopically (with a video-assisted thoracoscope) or via a limited thoracotomy incision (see Chap. 25).

Lung Volume Reduction Surgery. Treatment options for patients with end-stage COPD (stage III) with a primary emphysematous component are limited, although lung volume reduction surgery is an option for a specific subset of patients. This subset includes patients with homogenous disease or disease that is focused in one area and not widespread throughout the lungs. Lung volume reduction surgery involves the removal of a portion of the diseased lung parenchyma. This allows the functional tissue to expand, resulting in improved elastic recoil of the lung and improved chest wall and diaphragmatic mechanics. This type of surgery does not cure the disease, but it may decrease dyspnea, improve lung function, and improve the patient's overall quality of life. Careful selection of patients for this procedure is essential to decrease the morbidity and mortality. The long-term outcomes of this surgery are unknown.

The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) is a large, multicenter randomized clinical trial that began in 1997 and is ongoing. It is attempting to answer many questions regarding the risks and benefits of lung volume reduction surgery in the treatment of severe emphysema. All patients in this trial receive a 6 to 10 -week pulmonary rehabilitation program and comprehensive medical management. Following completion of pulmonary rehabilitation, patients are randomized to continue medical management or undergo lung volume reduction surgery. The results
of this trial will help to determine the role of lung volume reduction surgery for patients with severe emphysema (NIH, 2001). It is expected that 2,500 patients will be entered into the study.

Lung Transplantation. Lung transplantation is a viable alternative for definitive surgical treatment of end-stage emphysema. It has been shown to improve quality of life and functional capacity (NIH, 2001). Specific criteria exist for referral for lung transplantation; however, organs are in short supply and many patients die while waiting for a transplant.

\section*{PULMONARY REHABILITATION}

Pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD is well established and widely accepted as a means to alleviate symptoms and optimize functional status. In both randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials, pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve exercise tolerance, reduce dyspnea, and increase healthrelated quality of life (Rochester, 2000). The primary goal of rehabilitation is to restore patients to the highest level of independent function possible and to improve their quality of life. A successful rehabilitation program is individualized for each patient, is multidisciplinary, and attends to both the physiologic and emotional needs of the patient. Most pulmonary rehabilitation programs include educational, psychosocial, behavioral, and physical components. Breathing exercises and retraining and exercise programs are used to improve functional status, and the patient is taught methods to alleviate symptoms.

Pulmonary rehabilitation may be used therapeutically in other diseases besides COPD, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, thoracic surgery, and lung transplantation. It may be conducted in the inpatient, outpatient, or home setting; the lengths of programs vary. Selection of a program depends upon the patient's physical, functional, and psychosocial status; insurance coverage; changing health care trends; availability of programs; and patient preference (Rochester, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse plays a key role in identifying potential candidates for pulmonary rehabilitation and in facilitating and reinforcing the material learned in the rehabilitation program. Not all patients have access to a formal rehabilitation program. However, the nurse can be instrumental in teaching the patient and family as well as facilitating specific services for the patient (eg, respiratory therapy education, physical therapy for exercise and breathing retraining, occupational therapy for conserving energy during activities of daily living, and nutritional counseling). In addition, numerous educational materials are available to assist the nurse in teaching patients with COPD. Potential resources include the American Lung Association, the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, the American Thoracic Society, the American College of Chest Physicians, and the American Association for Respiratory Therapy.

\section*{PATIENT EDUCATION}

Patient education is a major component of pulmonary rehabilitation and includes a broad variety of topics. Depending on the length and setting of the program, topics may include normal anatomy and physiology of the lung, pathophysiology and changes with COPD, medications and home oxygen therapy, nutrition, respiratory therapy treatments, symptom alleviation, smoking cessation, sexuality and COPD, coping with chronic disease, communicating with the health care team, and planning for the future (advance directives, living wills, informed decision making about health care alternatives).

Breathing Exercises. The breathing pattern of most people with COPD is shallow, rapid, and inefficient; the more severe the disease, the more inefficient the breathing pattern. With practice, this type of upper chest breathing can be changed to diaphragmatic breathing, which reduces the respiratory rate, increases alveolar ventilation, and sometimes helps expel as much air as possible during expiration (see Chap. 25 for technique). Pursedlip breathing helps to slow expiration, prevents collapse of small airways, and helps the patient to control the rate and depth of respiration. It also promotes relaxation, enabling the patient to gain control of dyspnea and reduce feelings of panic.

Inspiratory Muscle Training. Once the patient masters diaphragmatic breathing, a program of inspiratory muscle training may be prescribed to help strengthen the muscles used in breathing. This program requires that the patient breathe against resistance for 10 to 15 minutes every day. As the resistance is gradually increased, the muscles become better conditioned. Conditioning of the respiratory muscles takes time, and the patient is instructed to continue practicing at home (Larson, Covey, Wirtz et al., 1999; NIH, 2001).

Activity Pacing. A patient with COPD has decreased exercise tolerance during specific periods of the day. This is especially true on arising in the morning, because bronchial secretions collect in the lungs during the night while the person is lying down. The patient may have difficulty bathing or dressing. Activities requiring the arms to be supported above the level of the thorax may produce fatigue or respiratory distress but may be tolerated better after the patient has been up and moving around for an hour or more. Working with the nurse, the patient can reduce these
limitations by planning self-care activities and determining the best time for bathing, dressing, and daily activities.

Self-Care Activities. As gas exchange, airway clearance, and the breathing pattern improve, the patient is encouraged to assume increasing participation in self-care activities. The patient is taught to coordinate diaphragmatic breathing with activities such as walking, bathing, bending, or climbing stairs. The patient should bathe, dress, and take short walks, resting as needed to avoid fatigue and excessive dyspnea. Fluids should always be readily available, and the patient should begin to drink fluids without having to be reminded. If postural drainage is to be done at home, the nurse instructs and supervises the patient before discharge or in the outpatient setting.

Physical Conditioning. Physical conditioning techniques include breathing exercises and general exercises intended to conserve energy and increase pulmonary ventilation. There is a close relationship between physical fitness and respiratory fitness. Graded exercises and physical conditioning programs using treadmills, stationary bicycles, and measured level walks can improve symptoms and increase work capacity and exercise tolerance. Any physical activity that can be done regularly is helpful. Lightweight portable oxygen systems are available for ambulatory patients who require oxygen therapy during physical activity.

Oxygen Therapy. Oxygen supplied to the home comes in compressed gas, liquid, or concentrator systems. Portable oxygen systems allow the patient to exercise, work, and travel. To help the patient adhere to the oxygen prescription, the nurse explains the proper flow rate and required number of hours for oxygen use as well as the dangers of arbitrary changes in flow rates or duration of therapy. The nurse cautions the patient that smoking with or near oxygen is extremely dangerous. The nurse also reassures the patient that oxygen is not "addictive" and explains the need for regular evaluations of blood oxygenation by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis.

Nutritional Therapy. Nutritional assessment and counseling are important aspects in the rehabilitation process for the patient with COPD. Approximately $25 \%$ of patients with COPD are undernourished (NIH, 2001; Ferreira, Brooks, Lacasse \& Goldstein, 2001). A thorough assessment of caloric needs and counseling about meal planning and supplementation are part of the rehabilitation process.

Coping Measures. Any factor that interferes with normal breathing quite naturally induces anxiety, depression, and changes in behavior. Many patients find the slightest exertion exhausting. Constant shortness of breath and fatigue may make the patient irritable and apprehensive to the point of panic. Restricted activity (and reversal of family roles due to loss of employment), the frustration of having to work to breathe, and the realization that the disease is prolonged and unrelenting may cause the patient to react with anger, depression, and demanding behavior. Sexual function may be compromised, which also diminishes self-esteem. In addition, the nurse needs to provide education and support to the spouse/significant other and family because the caregiver role in end-stage COPD can be difficult.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH COPD}

\section*{Assessment}

Assessment involves obtaining information about current symptoms as well as previous disease manifestations. Chart 24-3 lists sample questions that may be used to obtain a clear history of the disease process. In addition to the history, the nurse also reviews the results of available diagnostic tests.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Respiratory insufficiency or failure
- Atelectasis
- Pulmonary infection
- Pneumonia
- Pneumothorax
- Pulmonary hypertension

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include smoking cessation, improved gas exchange, airway clearance, improved breathing pattern, improved activity tolerance, maximal self-management, improved coping ability, adherence to the therapeutic program and home care, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING SMOKING CESSATION}

Because smoking has such a detrimental effect on the lungs, the nurse must discuss smoking cessation strategies with patients. Although patients may believe that it is too late to reverse the damage from years of smoking and that smoking cessation is futile, they should be informed that continuing to smoke impairs the mechanisms that clear the airways and keep them free of irritants. The nurse should educate the patient regarding the hazards of smoking and cessation strategies and provide resources regarding smoking cessation, counseling, and formalized programs available in the community.

\section*{IMPROVING GAS EXCHANGE}

Bronchospasm, which occurs in many pulmonary diseases, reduces the caliber of the small bronchi and may cause dyspnea, static secretions, and infection. Bronchospasm can sometimes be detected when wheezing or diminished breath sounds are heard on auscultation with a stethoscope. Increased mucus production, along with decreased mucociliary action, contributes to further reduction in the caliber of the bronchi and results in decreased airflow and decreased gas exchange. This is further aggravated by the loss of lung elasticity that occurs with COPD (NIH, 2001).

These changes in the airway require that the nurse monitor the patient for dyspnea and hypoxemia. If bronchodilators or corticosteroids are prescribed, the nurse must administer the medications properly and be alert for potential side effects. The relief of bronchospasm is confirmed by measuring improvement in expiratory flow rates and volumes (the force of expiration, how long it takes to exhale, and the amount of air exhaled) and assessing whether the patient has less dyspnea.

\section*{ACHIEVING AIRWAY CLEARANCE}

Diminishing the quantity and viscosity of sputum can clear the airway and improve pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange. All pulmonary irritants should be eliminated or reduced, particularly cigarette smoking, which is the most persistent source of pulmonary irritation. The nurse instructs the patient in directed or controlled coughing, which is more effective and reduces the fatigue associated with undirected forceful coughing. Directed coughing consists of a slow, maximal inspiration followed by breath-holding for several seconds and then two or three coughs. "Huff" coughing may also be effective. The technique consists of one or two forced exhalations ("huffs") from low to medium lung volumes with the glottis open.

Chest physiotherapy with postural drainage, intermittent positive-pressure breathing, increased fluid intake, and bland aerosol mists (with normal saline solution or water) may be useful for some patients with COPD. The use of these measures must be based on the patient's response and tolerance.

\section*{IMPROVING BREATHING PATTERNS}

Ineffective breathing patterns and shortness of breath are due to the ineffective respiratory mechanics of the chest wall and lung resulting from air trapping, ineffective diaphragmatic movement, airway obstruction, the metabolic cost of breathing, and stress. Inspiratory muscle training and breathing retraining may help to improve breathing patterns. Training in diaphragmatic breathing reduces the respiratory rate, increases alveolar ventilation, and sometimes helps expel as much air as possible during expiration. Pursed-lip breathing helps to slow expiration, prevents collapse of small airways, and helps the patient to control the rate and depth of respiration. It also promotes relaxation, which enables the patient to gain control of dyspnea and reduce feelings of panic.

\section*{IMPROVING ACTIVITY TOLERANCE}

Patients with COPD experience progressive activity and exercise intolerance. Education is focused on rehabilitative therapies to promote independence in executing activities of daily living. These may include pacing activities throughout the day or using supportive devices to decrease energy expenditure. The nurse evaluates the patient's activity tolerance and limitations and teaching strategies to promote independent activities of daily living. Also, the patient may be a candidate for exercise training to strengthen the muscles of the upper and lower extremities and improve exercise tolerance and endurance. Other health care professionals (rehabilitation therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy) may be consulted as additional resources.

\section*{ENHANCING SELF-CARE STRATEGIES}

In addition to a pulmonary rehabilitation program, the nurse helps the patient manage self-care by emphasizing the importance of setting realistic goals, avoiding temperature extremes, and modifying lifestyle (particularly stopping smoking) as applicable.

\section*{Setting Realistic Goals}

A major area of teaching is the importance of setting and accepting realistic short-term and long-range goals. If the patient is severely disabled, the objectives of treatment are to preserve current pulmonary function and relieve symptoms as much as possible. If the disease is mild, the objectives are to increase exercise tolerance and prevent further loss of pulmonary function. It is important to plan and share the goals and expectations of treatment with the patient. The patient and those providing care need patience to achieve these goals.

\section*{Avoiding Temperature Extremes}

The nurse instructs the patient to avoid extremes of heat and cold. Heat increases the body temperature, thereby raising oxygen requirements; cold tends to promote bronchospasm. Air pollutants such as fumes, smoke, dust, and even talcum, lint, and aerosol sprays may initiate bronchospasm. High altitudes aggravate hypoxemia.

\section*{Modifying Lifestyle}

Patients with COPD should adopt a lifestyle of moderate activity, ideally in a climate with minimal shifts in temperature and humidity. As much as possible, the patient should avoid emotional disturbances and stressful situations that might trigger a coughing episode. The medication regimen for patients with COPD can be quite complex; patients receiving aerosol medications by an MDI may be particularly challenged. It is crucial to review this material and to have the patient perform a return demonstration before discharge, during follow-up visits to the caregiver's office or clinic, and during home visits (Chart 24-4).

Smoking cessation goes hand in hand with lifestyle changes, and reinforcement of the patient's efforts is a key nursing activity. Smoking cessation is the single most important therapeutic intervention for patients with COPD. There are many strategies, including prevention, cessation with or without oral or topical patch medications, and behavior modification techniques.

\section*{ENHANCING INDIVIDUAL COPING STRATEGIES}

COPD and its progression promote a cycle of physical, social, and psychological consequences, all which are interrelated. Patients experience depression, altered mood states, social isolation, and altered functional status. The nurse is key to identifying this cycle and promoting interventions for improved physical functioning, psychological and emotional stability, and social support. Following the initial assessment of the patient, the nurse may provide referrals to health care professionals in these specific areas.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The nurse caring for the patient with COPD must assess for various complications, such as life-threatening respiratory insufficiency and failure and respiratory infection and atelectasis, which may increase the patient's risk for respiratory failure. The nurse also monitors for cognitive changes (personality and behavioral changes, memory impairment), increasing dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which may indicate increasing hypoxemia and impending respiratory failure.

The nurse monitors pulse oximetry values to assess the patient's need for oxygen and administers supplemental oxygen as prescribed. The nurse also instructs the patient about signs and symptoms of respiratory infection that may worsen hypoxemia and reports changes in the patient's physical and cognitive status to the physician. Other activities require assisting with the management of developing complications, with possible intubation and mechanical ventilation (see Chap. 25).

Bronchopulmonary infections must be controlled to diminish inflammatory edema and to permit recovery of normal ciliary action. Minor respiratory infections that are of no consequence to the person with normal lungs can be life-threatening to the person with COPD. The cough associated with bronchial infection introduces a vicious cycle with further trauma and damage to the lungs, progression of symptoms, increased bronchospasm, and increased susceptibility to bronchial infection. Infection compromises lung

function and is a common cause of respiratory failure in patients with COPD.

In COPD, infection may be accompanied by subtle changes. The nurse instructs the patient to report any signs of infection, such as a fever or change in sputum color, character, consistency, or amount. Any worsening of symptoms (increased tightness of the chest, increased dyspnea and fatigue) also suggests infection and must be reported. Viral infections are hazardous to these patients because they are often followed by infections caused by bacterial organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.

The nurse should encourage patients with COPD to be immunized against influenza and S. pneumoniae because these patients are prone to respiratory infection. It is important to caution patients to avoid going outdoors if the pollen count is high or if there is significant air pollution because of the risk of bron-
chospasm. The patient also should avoid exposure to high outdoor temperatures with high humidity.

Pneumothorax is a potential complication of COPD. Patients with severe emphysematous changes can develop large bullae, which may rupture and cause a pneumothorax. The development of a pneumothorax may be spontaneous or related to an activity such as severe coughing or large intrathoracic pressure changes. If the patient develops a rapid onset of shortness of breath, the nurse should quickly evaluate the patient for a potential pneumothorax by assessing the symmetry of chest movement, differences in breath sounds, and pulse oximetry. A pneumothorax is a lifethreatening event in the patient with COPD who has minimal pulmonary reserve.

Over time, pulmonary hypertension may occur as a result of chronic hypoxemia. The pulmonary arteries respond to hypoxemia by constriction, thus leading to pulmonary hypertension.

The complication may be prevented by maintaining adequate oxygenation through an adequate hemoglobin level, improved ventilation/perfusion of the lungs, or continuous administration of supplemental oxygen (if needed).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Teaching is essential throughout the course of COPD and should be part of the nursing care given to every patient with COPD. Patients' and family members' knowledge and comfort level with their knowledge should be assessed and considered when providing instructions about self-management strategies. In addition to the aspects of patient education previously described, patients and family members must become familiar with the medications that are prescribed and knowledgeable about potential side effects. Patients and family members need to learn the early signs and symptoms of infection and other complications so that they seek appropriate health care promptly.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care is important to enable the nurse to assess the patient's home environment and physical and psychological status, to evaluate the patient's adherence to the prescribed regimen, and to assess the patient's ability to cope with changes in lifestyle and physical status. The nurse assesses the patient's and family's understanding of the complications and side effects of medications. The home care visit provides an opportunity to reinforce the information and activities learned in the inpatient or outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program and to have the patient and family demonstrate correct administration of medications and oxygen, if indicated, and performance of exercises. If the patient does not have access to a formal pulmonary rehabilitation program, it is important for the nurse to provide the education and breathing retraining necessary to optimize the patient's functional status.

The nurse may direct patients to community resources such as pulmonary rehabilitation programs and smoking cessation programs to help improve their ability to cope with their chronic condition and the therapeutic regimen and to give them a sense of worth, hope, and well-being. In addition, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of participating in general health promotion activities and health screening.

\section*{Bronchiectasis}

Bronchiectasis is a chronic, irreversible dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles. Under the new definition of COPD, it is considered a separate disease process from COPD (NIH, 2001). Bronchiectasis may be caused by a variety of conditions, including:
- Airway obstruction
- Diffuse airway injury
- Pulmonary infections and obstruction of the bronchus or complications of long-term pulmonary infections
- Genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis
- Abnormal host defense (eg, ciliary dyskinesia or humoral immunodeficiency)
- Idiopathic causes

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Impaired gas exchange and airway clearance due to chronic inhalation of toxins}

\section*{Goal: Improvement in gas exchange}
1. Evaluate current smoking status, educate regarding smoking cessation, and facilitate efforts to quit.
a. Evaluate current smoking habits of patient and family.
b. Educate regarding hazards of smoking and relationship to COPD.
c. Evaluate previous smoking cessation attempts.
d. Provide educational materials.
e. Refer to a smoking cessation program or resource.
2. Evaluate current exposure to occupational exposures and indoor/outdoor pollution.
a. Evaluate current exposures to occupational toxins, indoor and outdoor air pollution (eg, smog, toxic fumes, chemicals).
b. Emphasize primary prevention to occupational exposures. This is best achieved by elimination or reduction of exposures in the workplace.
c. Educate regarding types of indoor and outdoor air pollution (eg, biomass fuel burned for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated buildings, outdoor air pollution).
d. Advise patient to monitor public announcements regarding air quality.
1. Smoking causes permanent damage to the lung and diminishes the lungs' protective mechanisms. Airflow is obstructed, secretions are increased, and lung capacity is reduced. Continued smoking increases morbidity and mortality in COPD and is also a risk factor for lung cancer.
2. Chronic inhalation of both indoor and outdoor toxins causes damage to the airways and impairs gas exchange.
- Identifies the hazards of cigarette smoking
- Enrolls in smoking cessation program
- Reports success in stopping smoking
- Identifies resources for smoking cessation
- Verbalizes types of inhaled toxins
- Minimizes or eliminates exposures
- Monitors public announcements regarding air quality and minimizes or eliminates exposures during episodes of severe pollution

Nursing Diagnosis: Impaired gas exchange related to ventilation-perfusion inequality

\section*{Goal: Improvement in gas exchange}
1. Administer bronchodilators as prescribed: a. Inhalation is the preferred route.
b. Observe for side effects: tachycardia, dysrhythmias, central nervous system excitation, nausea, and vomiting.
c. Assess for correct technique of metered-dose inhaler (MDI) administration.
2. Evaluate effectiveness of nebulizer or MDI treatments.
a. Assess for decreased shortness of breath, decreased wheezing or crackles, loosened secretions, decreased anxiety.
b. Ensure that treatment is given before meals to avoid nausea and to reduce fatigue that accompanies eating.
3. Instruct and encourage patient in diaphragmatic breathing and effective coughing.
1. Bronchodilators dilate the airways. The medication dosage is carefully adjusted for each patient, in accordance with clinical response.
2. Combining medication with aerosolized bronchodilators is typically used to control bronchoconstriction in an acute exacerbation. Generally, however, the MDI with spacer is the preferred route (less cost and time to treatment).
3. These techniques improve ventilation by opening airways to facilitate clearing the airways of sputum. Gas exchange is improved and fatigue is minimized.
- Verbalizes need for bronchodilators and for taking as prescribed
- Evidences minimal side effects; heart rate near normal, absence of dysrhythmias, normal mentation
- Reports a decrease in dyspnea
- Shows an improved expiratory flow rate
- Uses and cleans respiratory therapy equipment as applicable
- Demonstrates diaphragmatic breathing and coughing
- Uses oxygen equipment appropriately when indicated
- Evidences improved arterial blood gases or pulse oximetry
- Demonstrates correct technique for use of MDI

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Care of the Patient With COPD (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
4. Administer oxygen by the method prescribed.
a. Explain rationale and importance to patient.
b. Evaluate effectiveness; observe for signs of hypoxemia. Notify physician if restlessness, anxiety, somnolence, cyanosis, or tachycardia is present.
c. Analyze arterial blood gases and compare with baseline values. When arterial puncture is performed and a blood sample is obtained, hold puncture site for 5 minutes to prevent arterial bleeding and development of ecchymoses.
d. Initiate pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturation.
e. Explain that no smoking is permitted by patient or visitors while oxygen is in use.

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}
4. Oxygen will correct the hypoxemia. Careful observation of the liter flow or the percentage administered and its effect on the patient is important. If the patient has chronic $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention, excessive oxygen could suppress the hypoxic drive and respirations. These patients generally need low-flow oxygen rates of 1 to $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Periodic arterial blood gases and pulse oximetry help to evaluate adequacy of oxygenation. Smoking may render pulse oximetry inaccurate because the carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke also saturates hemoglobin.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective airway clearance related to bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, ineffective cough, bronchopulmonary infection, and other complications}

Goal: Achievement of airway clearance

\section*{1. Adequately hydrate the patient.}
2. Teach and encourage the use of diaphragmatic breathing and coughing techniques.
3. Assist in administering nebulizer or MDI.
4. If indicated, perform postural drainage with percussion and vibration in the morning and at night as prescribed.
5. Instruct patient to avoid bronchial irritants such as cigarette smoke, aerosols, extremes of temperature, and fumes.
6. Teach early signs of infection that are to be reported to the clinician immediately:
a. Increased sputum production
b. Change in color of sputum
c. Increased thickness of sputum
d. Increased shortness of breath, tightness in chest, or fatigue
e. Increased coughing
f. Fever or chills
7. Administer antibiotics as prescribed.
8. Encourage patient to be immunized against influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
1. Systemic hydration keeps secretions moist and easier to expectorate. Fluids must be given with caution if right- or left-sided heart failure is present.
2. These techniques help to improve ventilation and mobilize secretions without causing breathlessness and fatigue.
3. This ensures adequate delivery of medication to the airways.
4. Uses gravity to help raise secretions so they can be more easily expectorated or suctioned.
5. Bronchial irritants cause bronchoconstriction and increased mucus production, which then interferes with airway clearance.
6. Minor respiratory infections that are of no consequence to the person with normal lungs can produce fatal disturbances in the lungs of the person with emphysema. Early recognition is crucial.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective breathing pattern related to shortness of breath, mucus, bronchoconstriction, and airway irritants \\ Goal: Improvement in breathing pattern}

\section*{1. Teach patient diaphragmatic and pursedlip breathing.}
2. Encourage alternating activity with rest periods. Allow patient to make some decisions (bath, shaving) about care based on tolerance level.
3. Encourage use of an inspiratory muscle trainer if prescribed.
1. Helps patient prolong expiration time and decreases air trapping. With these techniques, patient will breathe more efficiently and effectively.
2. Pacing activities permits patient to perform activities without excessive distress.
- Practices pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing and uses them when short of breath and with activity
- Shows signs of decreased respiratory effort and paces activities
- Uses inspiratory muscle trainer as prescribed
3. Strengthens and conditions the respiratory muscles.

Nursing Diagnosis: Self-care deficits related to fatigue secondary to increased work of breathing and insufficient ventilation and oxygenation
Goal: Independence in self-care activities
1. Teach patient to coordinate diaphragmatic breathing with activity (eg, walking, bending).
2. Encourage patient to begin to bathe self, dress self, walk, and drink fluids. Discuss energy conservation measures.
3. Teach postural drainage if appropriate.
1. This will allow the patient to be more active and to avoid excessive fatigue or dyspnea during activity.
2. As condition resolves, patient will be able to do more but needs to be encouraged to avoid increasing dependence.
3. Encourages patient to become involved in own care. Prepares patient to manage at home.
- Uses controlled breathing while bathing, bending, and walking
- Paces activities of daily living to alternate with rest periods to reduce fatigue and dyspnea

Nursing Diagnosis: Activity intolerance due to fatigue, hypoxemia, and ineffective breathing patterns
Goal: Improvement in activity tolerance
1. Support patient in establishing a regular regimen of exercise using treadmill and exercycle, walking, or other appropriate exercises, such as mall walking.
a. Assess the patient's current level of functioning and develop exercise plan based on baseline functional status.
b. Suggest consultation with a physical therapist or pulmonary rehabilitation program to determine an exercise program specific to the patient's capability. Have portable oxygen unit available if oxygen is prescribed for exercise.
1. Muscles that are deconditioned consume more oxygen and place an additional burden on the lungs. Through regular, graded exercise, these muscle groups become more conditioned, and the patient can do more without getting as short of breath. Graded exercise breaks the cycle of debilitation.
- Performs activities with less shortness of breath
- Verbalizes need to exercise daily and demonstrates an exercise plan to be carried out at home
- Walks and gradually increases walking time and distance to improve physical condition

A person may be predisposed to bronchiectasis as a result of recurrent respiratory infections in early childhood, measles, influenza, tuberculosis, and immunodeficiency disorders.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The inflammatory process associated with pulmonary infections damages the bronchial wall, causing a loss of its supporting structure and resulting in thick sputum that ultimately obstructs the bronchi. The walls become permanently distended and distorted, impairing mucociliary clearance. The inflammation and infection
extend to the peribronchial tissues; in the case of saccular bronchiectasis, each dilated tube virtually amounts to a lung abscess, the exudate of which drains freely through the bronchus. Bronchiectasis is usually localized, affecting a segment or lobe of a lung, most frequently the lower lobes.

The retention of secretions and subsequent obstruction ultimately cause the alveoli distal to the obstruction to collapse (atelectasis). Inflammatory scarring or fibrosis replaces functioning lung tissue. In time the patient develops respiratory insufficiency with reduced vital capacity, decreased ventilation, and an increased ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity. There is impair-
ment in the matching of ventilation to perfusion (ventilationperfusion imbalance) and hypoxemia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Characteristic symptoms of bronchiectasis include chronic cough and the production of purulent sputum in copious amounts. Many patients with this disease have hemoptysis. Clubbing of the fingers also is common because of respiratory insufficiency. The patient usually has repeated episodes of pulmonary infection. Even with modern treatment approaches, the average age at death is approximately 55 years.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Bronchiectasis is not readily diagnosed because the symptoms can be mistaken for those of simple chronic bronchitis. A definite sign is offered by the prolonged history of productive cough, with sputum consistently negative for tubercle bacilli. The diagnosis is established by a computed tomography (CT) scan, which demonstrates either the presence or absence of bronchial dilation.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment objectives are to promote bronchial drainage to clear excessive secretions from the affected portion of the lungs and to prevent or control infection. Postural drainage is part of all treatment plans because draining the bronchiectatic areas by gravity reduces the amount of secretions and the degree of infection. Sometimes mucopurulent sputum must be removed by bronchoscopy. Chest physiotherapy, including percussion and postural drainage, is important in secretion management.

Smoking cessation is important because smoking impairs bronchial drainage by paralyzing ciliary action, increasing bronchial secretions, and causing inflammation of the mucous membranes, resulting in hyperplasia of the mucous glands. Infection is controlled with antimicrobial therapy based on the results of sensitivity studies on organisms cultured from sputum. A year-round regimen of antibiotic agents may be prescribed, with different types of antibiotics at intervals. Some clinicians prescribe antibiotic agents throughout the winter or when acute upper respiratory tract infections occur. Patients should be vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia. Bronchodilators, which may be prescribed for patients who also have reactive airway disease, may also assist with secretion management.

Surgical intervention, although used infrequently, may be indicated for the patient who continues to expectorate large amounts of sputum and has repeated bouts of pneumonia and hemoptysis despite adhering to the treatment regimen. However, the disease must involve only one or two areas of the lung that can be removed without producing respiratory insufficiency. The goals of surgical treatment are to conserve normal pulmonary tissue and to avoid infectious complications. Diseased tissue is removed, provided that the postoperative lung function will be adequate. It may be necessary to remove a segment of a lobe (segmental resection), a lobe (lobectomy), or rarely an entire lung (pneumonectomy). (See Chart 25-16 for further information.) Segmental resection is the removal of an anatomic subdivision of a pulmonary lobe. The chief advantage is that only diseased tissue is removed and healthy lung tissue is conserved.

The surgery is preceded by a period of careful preparation. The objective is to obtain a dry (free of infection) tracheobronchial tree to prevent complications (atelectasis, pneumonia,
bronchopleural fistula, and empyema). This is accomplished by postural drainage or, depending on the location, by direct suction through a bronchoscope. A course of antibacterial therapy may be prescribed. After surgery, the care is the same as for any patient undergoing chest surgery (see Chap. 25).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient with bronchiectasis focuses on alleviating symptoms and assisting the patient to clear pulmonary secretions. Smoking and other factors that increase the production of mucus and hamper its removal are targeted in patient teaching. The patient and family are taught to perform postural drainage and to avoid exposure to others with upper respiratory and other infections. If the patient experiences fatigue and dyspnea, strategies to conserve energy while maintaining as active a lifestyle as possible are discussed. The patient needs to become knowledgeable about early signs of respiratory infection and the progression of the disorder so that appropriate treatment can be implemented promptly. Because the presence of a large amount of mucus may decrease the patient's appetite and result in an inadequate dietary intake, the patient's nutritional status is assessed and strategies are implemented to ensure an adequate diet.

\section*{Asthma}

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes airway hyperresponsiveness, mucosal edema, and mucus production. This inflammation ultimately leads to recurrent episodes of asthma symptoms: cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and dyspnea (Fig. 24-6). Estimates show that nearly 17 million Americans have asthma, and more than 5,000 die from this disease annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1998; CDC, 1999; NCHS, 2001). In 1998, asthma accounted for over 13.9 million outpatient visits to physician offices or hospital clinics and over 2.0 million emergency room visits (NCHS, 2001).

Asthma differs from the other obstructive lung diseases in that it is largely reversible, either spontaneously or with treatment. Patients with asthma may experience symptom-free periods alternating with acute exacerbations, which last from minutes to hours or days. Asthma can occur at any age and is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Despite increased knowledge regarding the pathology of asthma and the development of better medications and management plans, the death rate from asthma continues to increase. For most patients it is a disruptive disease, affecting school and work attendance, occupational choices, physical activity, and general quality of life.

Allergy is the strongest predisposing factor for asthma. Chronic exposure to airway irritants or allergens also increases the risk for developing asthma. Common allergens can be seasonal (eg, grass, tree, and weed pollens) or perennial (eg, mold, dust, roaches, or animal dander). Common triggers for asthma symptoms and exacerbations in patients with asthma include airway irritants (eg, air pollutants, cold, heat, weather changes, strong odors or perfumes, smoke), exercise, stress or emotional upsets, sinusitis with postnasal drip, medications, viral respiratory tract infections, and gastroesophageal reflux. Most people who have asthma are sensitive to a variety of triggers. A patient's asthma condition will change depending upon the environment, activities, management practices, and other factors (NHLBI, 1998).

\end{figure}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The underlying pathology in asthma is reversible and diffuse airway inflammation. The inflammation leads to obstruction from the following: swelling of the membranes that line the airways (mucosal edema), reducing the airway diameter; contraction of the bronchial smooth muscle that encircles the airways (bronchospasm), causing further narrowing; and increased mucus production, which diminishes airway size and may entirely plug the bronchi.

The bronchial muscles and mucus glands enlarge; thick, tenacious sputum is produced; and the alveoli hyperinflate. Some patients may have airway subbasement membrane fibrosis. This is called airway "remodeling" and occurs in response to chronic inflammation. The fibrotic changes in the airway lead to airway narrowing and potentially irreversible airflow limitation (NIH, 2001; NHLBI, 1998).

Cells that play a key role in the inflammation of asthma are mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Mast cells, when activated, release several chemicals called mediators. These chemicals, which include histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, perpetuate the inflammatory response, causing increased blood flow, vasoconstriction, fluid leak from the vasculature, attraction of white blood cells to the area, and bronchoconstriction (NHLBI, 1998). Regulation of these chemicals is the aim of much of the current research regarding pharmacologic therapy for asthma.

Further, alpha- and beta ${ }_{2}$-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system are located in the bronchi. When the alphaadrenergic receptors are stimulated, bronchoconstriction occurs; when the beta $_{2}$-adrenergic receptors are stimulated, bronchodila-
tion results. The balance between alpha and beta ${ }_{2}$ receptors is controlled primarily by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation results in a decrease in cAMP, which leads to an increase of chemical mediators released by the mast cells and bronchoconstriction. Beta ${ }_{2}$-receptor stimulation results in increased levels of cAMP, which inhibits the release of chemical mediators and causes bronchodilation (NHLBI, 1998).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The three most common symptoms of asthma are cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. In some instances, cough may be the only symptom. Asthma attacks often occur at night or early in the morning, possibly due to circadian variations that influence airway receptor thresholds.

An asthma exacerbation may begin abruptly but most frequently is preceded by increasing symptoms over the previous few days. There is cough, with or without mucus production. At times the mucus is so tightly wedged in the narrowed airway that the patient cannot cough it up. There may be generalized wheezing (the sound of airflow through narrowed airways), first on expiration and then possibly during inspiration as well. Generalized chest tightness and dyspnea occur. Expiration requires effort and becomes prolonged. As the exacerbation progresses, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and a widened pulse pressure may occur along with hypoxemia and central cyanosis (a late sign of poor oxygenation). Although life-threatening and severe hypoxemia can occur in asthma, it is relatively uncommon. The hypoxemia is secondary to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch and readily responds to supplemental oxygenation.

Symptoms of exercise-induced asthma include maximal symptoms during exercise, absence of nocturnal symptoms, and sometimes only a description of a "choking" sensation during exercise.

Asthma is categorized according to symptoms and objective measures of airflow obstruction (Table 24-3) (Expert Panel Report II, 1997).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A complete family, environmental, and occupational history is essential. To establish the diagnosis, the clinician must determine that periodic symptoms of airflow obstruction are present, airflow is at least partially reversible, and other etiologies have been excluded. A positive family history and environmental factors, including seasonal changes, high pollen counts, mold, climate changes (particularly cold air), and air pollution, are primarily associated with asthma. In addition, asthma is associated with a variety of occupation-related chemicals and compounds, including metal salts, wood and vegetable dust, medications (eg, aspirin, antibiotics, piperazine, cimetidine), industrial chemicals and plastics, biologic enzymes (eg, laundry detergents), animal and insect dusts, sera, and secretions. Comorbid conditions that may accompany asthma include gastroesophageal reflux, drug-induced asthma, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Other possible allergic reactions that may accompany asthma include eczema, rashes, and temporary edema.

During acute episodes, sputum and blood tests may disclose eosinophilia (elevated levels of eosinophils). Serum levels of immunoglobulin E may be elevated if allergy is present. Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry reveal hypoxemia during acute attacks. Initially, hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis are present. As the condition worsens and the patient becomes more fatigued, the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ may rise. A normal $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ value may be a signal of impending respiratory failure. Because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is 20 times more diffusible than oxygen, it is rare for $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ to be normal or elevated in a person who is breathing very rapidly. During an exacerbation, the $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ and FVC are markedly decreased but improve with bronchodilator administration (demonstrating reversibility). Pulmonary function is usually normal between exacerbations.

The occurrence of a severe, continuous reaction is referred to as status asthmaticus and is considered life-threatening (see below).

\section*{Prevention}

Patients with recurrent asthma should undergo tests to identify the substances that precipitate the symptoms. Possible causes are dust, dust mites, roaches, certain types of cloth, pets, horses, detergents, soaps, certain foods, molds, and pollens. If the attacks are seasonal, pollens can be strongly suspected. The patient is instructed to avoid the causative agents whenever possible.

Knowledge is the key to quality asthma care. Although national guidelines are available for the care of the asthma patient, unfortunately health care providers may not follow them. Failure to follow the guidelines in the following areas has been noted: lack of treatment of patients who have symptoms more than 2 days per week with a regular medication schedule, lack of patientspecific advice on improving the environment and an explanation about the importance of doing so, lack of encouragement for patients to monitor their peak flow measurements with a diary, and lack of written, up-to-date educational materials (Plaut, 2001).

A 1998 survey by a group called "Asthma in America" found that $11 \%$ of physicians were unaware of the national asthma guidelines. Only $35 \%$ of patients with asthma who were surveyed reported having pulmonary function testing in the past year.

While $83 \%$ of physicians reported prescribing peak flow meter monitoring, only $62 \%$ of patients had ever heard of a peak flow meter (Rickard \& Stempel, 1999). All health care providers caring for asthma patients need to be aware of the national guidelines and use them (Expert Panel Report II, 1997).

\section*{Complications}

Complications of asthma may include status asthmaticus, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and atelectasis. Airway obstruction, particularly during acute asthmatic episodes, often results in hypoxemia, requiring the administration of oxygen and the monitoring of pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases. Fluids are administered because people with asthma are frequently dehydrated from diaphoresis and insensible fluid loss with hyperventilation.

\section*{Medical Management}

Immediate intervention is necessary because the continuing and progressive dyspnea leads to increased anxiety, aggravating the situation.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Two general classes of asthma medications are long-acting medications to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma and quick-relief medications for immediate treatment of asthma symptoms and exacerbations (Table 24-4). Because the underlying pathology of asthma is inflammation, control of persistent asthma is accomplished primarily with regular use of antiinflammatory medications. These medications have systemic side effects when used long term. The route of choice for administration of these medications is the MDI because it allows for topical administration. Critical to the success of inhaled therapy is the proper use of the MDI (see Chart 24-4). If the patient has difficulty with this procedure, the use of a spacer device is indicated. Table 24-3 presents a stepwise approach for managing asthma (Expert Panel Report II, 1997). Information on use of the MDI and spacer device is given in the previous section on COPD.

Long-Acting Control Medications. Corticosteroids are the most potent and effective anti-inflammatory medications currently available. They are broadly effective in alleviating symptoms, improving airway function, and decreasing peak flow variability. Initially, the inhaled form is used. A spacer should be used with inhaled corticosteroids and the patient should rinse the mouth after administration to prevent thrush, a common complication of inhaled corticosteroid use. A systemic preparation may be used to gain rapid control of the disease; to manage severe, persistent asthma; to treat moderate to severe exacerbations; to accelerate recovery; and to prevent recurrence (Dhand, 2000).

Cromolyn sodium (Intal) and nedocromil (Tilade) are mild to moderate anti-inflammatory agents that are used more commonly in children. They also are effective on a prophylactic basis to prevent exercise-induced asthma or in unavoidable exposure to known triggers. These medications are contraindicated in acute asthma exacerbations.

Long-acting beta ${ }_{2}$-adrenergic agonists are used with antiinflammatory medications to control asthma symptoms, particularly those that occur during the night. These agents are also effective for preventing exercise-induced asthma. Long-acting beta $_{2}$-adrenergic agonists are not indicated for immediate relief of symptoms.

\section*{$\downarrow$ Step Down}

Review treatment every 1 to 6 months; a gradual stepwise reduction in treatment may be possible.

\section*{Notes:}
- The stepwise approach presents general guidelines to assist clinical decision making; it is not intended to be a specific prescription. Asthma is highly variable; clinicians should tailor specific medication plans to the needs and circumstances of individual patients.
- Gain control as quickly as possible; then decrease treatment to the least medication necessary to maintain control. Gaining control may be accomplished either by starting treatment at the step most appropriate to the initial severity of the condition or by starting at a higher level of therapy (eg, a course of systemic corticosteroids or higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids).

\section*{$\uparrow$ Step Up}

If control is not maintained, consider step up. First, review patient medication technique, adherence, and environmental control (avoidance of allergens or other factors that contribute to asthma severity).
- A rescue course of systemic corticosteroid may be needed at any time and at any step.
- Some patients with intermittent asthma experience severe and lifethreatening exacerbations separated by long periods of normal lung function and no symptoms. This may be especially common with exacerbations provoked by respiratory infections. A short course of systemic corticosteroids is recommended.
- At each step, patients should control their environment to avoid or control factors that make their asthma worse (eg, allergens, irritants); this requires specific diagnosis and education.

Methylxanthines (theophylline [Slo-bid, Theo-24, Theo-Dur]) are mild to moderate bronchodilators usually used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, mainly for relief of nighttime asthma symptoms. There is some evidence that theophylline may have a mild anti-inflammatory effect (NHLBI, 1998).

Leukotriene modifiers (inhibitors) or antileukotrienes are a new class of medications. Leukotrienes are potent bronchoconstrictors that also dilate blood vessels and alter permeability. Leukotriene inhibitors act by either interfering with leukotriene synthesis or blocking the receptors where leukotrienes exert their action (Boushey, Fick, Lazarus \& Martin, 2000). At this time, they may provide an alternative to inhaled corticosteroids for mild persistent asthma or may be added to a regimen of inhaled corticosteroids in more severe asthma to attain further control.

In addition, combination products are also available (eg, albuterol/ipratropium [Combivent]) and offer ease of use for the patient.

Quick-Relief Medications. Short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists are the medications of choice for relieving acute symptoms and preventing exercise-induced asthma. They have a rapid onset of action. Anticholinergics (eg, ipratropium bromide [Atrovent]) may bring added benefit in severe exacerbations, but they are used more frequently in COPD patients.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA EXACERBATION}

Asthma exacerbations are best managed by early treatment and education of the patient (Expert Panel Report II, 1997). Quickacting beta-adrenergic medications are first used for prompt re-
lief of airflow obstruction. Systemic corticosteroids may be necessary to decrease airway inflammation in patients who fail to respond to inhaled beta-adrenergic medications. In some patients, oxygen supplementation may be required to relieve hypoxemia associated with a moderate to severe exacerbation (Expert Panel Report II, 1997). Also, response to treatment may be monitored by serial measurements of lung function.

A written action plan is the most useful tool for the patient (Fig. 24-7). This helps to guide the patient in self-management strategies regarding an exacerbation and also provides instructions regarding recognition of early warning signs of worsening asthma. Patient self-management and early recognition of problems lead to more efficient communication with health care providers regarding an asthma exacerbation (Expert Panel Report II, 1997).

\section*{PEAK FLOW MONITORING}

Peak flow meters measure the highest airflow during a forced expiration (Fig. 24-8). Daily peak flow monitoring is recommended for all patients with moderate or severe asthma because it helps measure asthma severity and, when added to symptom monitoring, indicates the current degree of asthma control. The patient is instructed in the proper technique, particularly to give maximal effort. The "personal best" is determined after monitoring peak flows for 2 or 3 weeks after receiving optimal asthma therapy. The green ( $80 \%$ to $100 \%$ of personal best), yellow ( $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ ), and red (less than $60 \%$ ) zones are determined, and specific actions are delineated for each zone, enabling the patient to monitor and manipulate his or her own therapy after careful instruction (Expert Panel Report II, 1997). This reinforces compliance, independence, and self-efficacy (Reinke, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The immediate nursing care of the patient with asthma depends on the severity of the symptoms. The patient may be treated successfully as an outpatient if asthma symptoms are relatively mild, or he or she may require hospitalization and intensive care for acute and severe asthma.

The patient and family are often frightened and anxious because of the patient's dyspnea. Thus, an important aspect of care is a calm approach. The nurse assesses the patient's respiratory status by monitoring the severity of symptoms, breath sounds, peak flow, pulse oximetry, and vital signs. The nurse obtains a history of allergic reactions to medications before administering medications and identifies the patient's current use of medications. The nurse administers medications as prescribed and monitors the patient's responses to those medications. Fluids may be administered if the patient is dehydrated, and antibiotic agents may be prescribed if the patient has an underlying respiratory infection. If the patient requires intubation because of acute respiratory failure, the nurse assists with the intubation procedure, continues close monitoring of the patient, and keeps the patient and family informed about procedures.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. A major challenge is to implement basic asthma management principles at the community level (Reinke, 2000). Key issues include education of health care providers, establishment of programs for asthma education (for patients and providers), use of outpatient follow-up care for patients, and a focus on chronic management versus acute episodic care. The nurse is pivotal to achieving all of these objectives.

Patient teaching is a critical component of care for the patient with asthma (Plaut, 2001). Multiple inhalers, different types of inhalers, antiallergy therapy, antireflux medications, and avoidance measures are all integral for long-term control. This complex therapy requires a patient-provider partnership to determine the desired outcomes and to formulate a plan to achieve those outcomes. The patient then carries out daily therapy as part of self-care management, with input and guidance by the health care provider. Before a partnership can be established, the patient needs to understand the following:
- The nature of asthma as a chronic inflammatory disease
- The definition of inflammation and bronchoconstriction
- The purpose and action of each medication
- Triggers to avoid, and how to do so
- Proper inhalation technique
- How to perform peak flow monitoring (Chart 24-5)
- How to implement an action plan
- When to seek assistance, and how to do so

An assortment of excellent educational materials is available from the Expert Panel Report II (1997) and the National Heart,

Lung and Blood Institute. The nurse should obtain current educational materials for the patient based on the patient's diagnosis, causative factors, educational level, and cultural factors.

Continuing Care. The nurse who has contact with the patient in the hospital, clinic, school, or office uses the opportunity to assess the patient's respiratory status and ability to manage self-care to prevent serious exacerbations. The nurse emphasizes adherence to the prescribed therapy, preventive measures, and the need to keep follow-up appointments with the primary health care provider. A home visit to assess the home environment for allergens may be indicated for the patient with recurrent exacerbations. The nurse refers the patient to community support groups. In addition, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of health promotion strategies and recommended health screening.

\section*{STATUS ASTHMATICUS}

Status asthmaticus is severe and persistent asthma that does not respond to conventional therapy. The attacks can last longer than 24 hours. Infection, anxiety, nebulizer abuse, dehydration, increased adrenergic blockage, and nonspecific irritants may contribute to these episodes. An acute episode may be precipitated by hypersensitivity to aspirin.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The basic characteristics of asthma (constriction of the bronchiolar smooth muscle, swelling of the bronchial mucosa, and thickened secretions) decrease the diameter of the bronchi and are apparent in status asthmaticus. A ventilation-perfusion abnormality results in hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis initially, followed by respiratory acidosis. There is a reduced $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ and an initial respiratory alkalosis, with a decreased $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and an increased pH . As status asthmaticus worsens, the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ increases and the pH falls, reflecting respiratory acidosis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical manifestations are the same as those seen in severe asthma: labored breathing, prolonged exhalation, engorged neck veins, and wheezing. However, the extent of wheezing does not indicate the severity of the attack. As the obstruction worsens, the wheezing may disappear, and this is frequently a sign of impending respiratory failure.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Pulmonary function studies are the most accurate means of assessing acute airway obstruction. Arterial blood gas measurements are obtained if the patient cannot perform pulmonary function maneuvers because of severe obstruction or fatigue, or if the patient does not respond to treatment. Respiratory alkalosis (low $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ) is the most common finding in patients with asthma. A rising $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ (to normal levels or levels indicating respiratory acidosis) frequently is a danger sign of impending respiratory failure.

\section*{Medical Management}

In the emergency setting, the patient is treated initially with a short-acting beta-adrenergic agonist and corticosteroids. The pa-
tient usually requires supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids for hydration. Oxygen therapy is initiated to treat dyspnea, central cyanosis, and hypoxemia. Humidified oxygen by either Venturi mask or nasal catheter is administered. The flow is based on pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas values. The $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is maintained at 65 to 85 mm Hg . Sedative medications are contraindicated. If there is no response to repeated treatments, hospitalization is required. Other criteria indicating the need for hospitalization include poor pulmonary function test results and deteriorating blood gas levels (respiratory acidosis), which may indicate that the patient is tiring and will require mechanical ventilation. Although most patients do not need mechanical ventilation, it is used for patients in respiratory failure, for those who tire and are too fatigued by the attempt to breathe, or for those whose conditions do not respond to initial treatment.

Death from asthma is associated with several risk factors, including the following:
- Past history of sudden and severe exacerbations
- Prior endotracheal intubation for asthma
- Prior admission to the intensive care unit for an asthma exacerbation
- Two or more hospitalizations for asthma within the past year
- Three or more emergency care visits for asthma in the past year
- Excessive use of short-acting beta-adrenergic inhalers (more than two canisters per month)
- Recent withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids
- Comorbidity of cardiovascular disease or COPD
- Psychiatric disease
- Low socioeconomic status
- Urban residence (Expert Panel Report II, 1997)

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse constantly monitors the patient for the first 12 to 24 hours, or until status asthmaticus is under control. The nurse also assesses the patient's skin turgor to identify signs of dehydration. Fluid intake is essential to combat dehydration, to loosen secretions, and to facilitate expectoration. The nurse administers intravenous fluids as prescribed, up to 3 to $4 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, unless contraindicated. The patient's energy needs to be conserved, and the room should be quiet and free of respiratory irritants, including flowers, tobacco smoke, perfumes, or odors of cleaning agents. A nonallergenic pillow should be used.

\section*{Cystic Fibrosis}

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disease among the Caucasian population. An individual must inherit a defective copy of the CF gene (one from each parent) to have CF. One in 31 Americans are unknowing symptom carriers of this gene (Katkin, 2002). The frequency of CF is 1 in 2,000 to 3,000 live births, and there are approximately 30,000 children and adults with this disease in the United States (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2002). Although CF was once considered a fatal childhood disease, approximately $38 \%$ of people living with the disease are 18 years of age or older (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2002). Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, but patients may be diagnosed later in life. For individuals diagnosed later in life, respiratory symptoms are frequently the major manifestation of the disease.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

This disease is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein, which is a chloride channel found in all exocrine tissues (Katkin, 2002). Chloride transport problems lead to thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive tract as well as increased salt content in sweat gland secretions. In 1989, major breakthroughs were made in this disease with the identification of the CF gene. The ability to detect the common mutations of this gene allows for routine screening for this disease as well as the detection of carriers. Genetic counseling is an important part of health care for couples at risk.

Airflow obstruction is a key feature in the presentation of CF. This obstruction is due to bronchial plugging by purulent secretions, bronchial wall thickening due to inflammation, and, over time, airway destruction (Katkin, 2002). These chronic retained secretions in the airways set up an excellent reservoir for continued bronchial infections.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The pulmonary manifestations of this disease include a productive cough, wheezing, hyperinflation of the lung fields on chest x-ray, and pulmonary function test results consistent with obstructive airways disease (Katkin, 2002). Colonization of the airways with pathogenic bacteria usually occurs early in life. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are common organisms during early childhood. As the disease progresses, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ultimately isolated from the sputum of most patients. Upper respiratory manifestations of the disease include sinusitis and nasal polyps.

Nonpulmonary clinical manifestations include gastrointestinal problems (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, recurrent abdominal pain, biliary cirrhosis, vitamin deficiencies, recurrent pancreatitis, weight loss), genitourinary problems (male and female infertility), and clubbing of the extremities. (See Chap. 40 for a discussion of pancreatitis.)

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Most of the time, the diagnosis of CF is made based on an elevated result of a sweat chloride concentration test, along with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with the disease. Repeated sweat chloride values of greater than $60 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ distinguish most individuals with CF from those with other obstructive diseases. A molecular diagnosis may also be used in evaluating common genetic mutations of the CF gene.

\section*{Medical Management}

Pulmonary problems remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Because chronic bacterial infection of the airways occurs in individuals with CF, control of infections is key in the treatment. Antibiotic medications are routinely prescribed for acute pulmonary exacerbations of the disease. Depending upon the severity of the exacerbation, aerosolized, oral, or intravenous antibiotic therapy may be used. Antibiotic agents are selected based upon the results of a sputum culture and sensitivity. Patients with CF have problems with bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs and require multiple courses of antibiotic agents over long periods of time.

Bronchodilators are frequently administered to decrease airway obstruction. Differing pulmonary techniques are used to enhance secretion clearance. Examples include manual postural drainage and chest physical therapy, high-frequency chest wall oscillation, and other devices that assist in airway clearance (PEP masks [masks that generate positive expiratory pressure], "flutter devices" [devices that provide an oscillatory expiratory pressure pattern with positive expiratory pressure and assist with expectoration of secretions]).

Inhaled mucolytic agents such as dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) or N -acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) may also be used. These agents help to decrease the viscosity of the sputum and promote expectoration of secretions.

To decrease the inflammation and ongoing destruction of the airways, anti-inflammatory agents may also be used. These may include inhaled corticosteroids or systemic therapy. Other antiinflammatory medications have also been studied in CF. Ibuprofen was studied in children with CF and some benefit was demonstrated, but there is little information on its use in young or older adults with CF (Katkin, 2002).

Supplemental oxygen is used to treat the progressive hypoxemia that occurs with CF. It helps to correct the hypoxemia and may minimize the complications seen with chronic hypoxemia (pulmonary hypertension).

Lung transplantation is an option for a small, select population of CF patients. A double lung transplant technique is used due to the chronically infected state of the lungs seen in end-stage CF. Because there is a long waiting list for lung transplant recipients, many patients die while awaiting a transplant.

Gene therapy is a promising approach to management, with many clinical trials underway. It is hoped that various methods of administering gene therapy will carry healthy genes to the damaged cells and correct defective CF cells. Efforts are underway to develop innovative methods of delivering therapy to the CF cells of the airways.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the adult with CF includes assisting the patient to manage pulmonary symptoms and to prevent complications of CF. Specific nursing measures include strategies that promote removal of pulmonary secretions; chest physiotherapy, including postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration, and breathing exercises are implemented and are taught to the patient and to the family when the patient is very young. The patient is reminded of the need to reduce risk factors associated with respiratory infections (eg, exposure to crowds and to persons with known infections). The patient is taught the early signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and disease progression that indicate the need to notify the primary health care provider.

The nurse emphasizes the importance of an adequate fluid and dietary intake to promote removal of secretions and to ensure an adequate nutritional status. Because CF is a life-long disorder, patients often have learned to modify their daily activities to accommodate their symptoms and treatment modalities. As the disease progresses, however, assessment of the home environment may be warranted to identify modifications required to address changes in the patient's needs, increasing dyspnea and fatigue, and nonpulmonary symptoms.

Although gene therapy and double lung transplantation are promising therapies for CF, they are limited in availability and largely experimental. As a result, the life expectancy of adults with CF is shortened. Therefore, end-of-life issues and concerns need
to be addressed in patients when warranted. For the patient whose disease is progressing and who is developing increasing hypoxemia, preferences for end-of-life care should be discussed, documented, and honored (see Chap. 17). Patients and family members need support as they face a shortened life span and an uncertain future.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 75 -year-old woman with end-stage COPD was recently admitted to your unit from the emergency room. She cannot lie flat in bed, she is extremely short of breath, and she has decreased breath sounds throughout the chest and crackles in the posterior basilar areas. What is the pathophysiology associated with these findings? What medical and nursing interventions might be used to decrease or alleviate these signs/symptoms?
2. Your patient at an outpatient asthma clinic is a 35 -yearold inner-city Mexican-American mother with asthma. Use of an MDI on a regular daily schedule has been repeatedly prescribed for her, but she reports that she does not use the MDI except as needed when extremely short of breath. Describe teaching techniques you might use to assess the patient's knowledge of the medication and provide education about the action of the MDI, frequency of use, and correct administration of the medication. What methods would you use to monitor use of the MDI and reinforce education?
3. As a nurse in your hospital's community outreach clinic, you are responsible for providing group education and counseling to patients with asthma. What areas would you address regarding triggers for asthma? How might you have patients assess their home environments?
4. Your 64-year-old patient has a history of bronchiectasis and heart failure following two myocardial infarctions. To promote removal of pulmonary secretions, his physician has prescribed chest physiotherapy and postural drainage. The patient reports that he is able to breathe easily only in a sitting position. Describe how you would modify chest physiotherapy and postural drainage given his statement that he cannot breathe in a supine or prone position.
5. Your 22-year-old patient is a college student with a history of cystic fibrosis; he has been admitted to your unit for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Describe what pulmonary rehabilitation techniques would be appropriate for his disease process, which are age-specific and consistent with his activity level.

\section*{Respiratory Care Modalities}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the nursing management for patients receiving oxygen therapy, intermittent positive-pressure breathing, mini-nebulizer therapy, incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy, and breathing retraining.
2. Describe the patient education and home care considerations for patients receiving oxygen therapy.
3. Describe the nursing care for a patient with an endotracheal tube and for a patient with a tracheostomy.
4. Demonstrate the procedure of tracheal suctioning.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients who are mechanically ventilated.
6. Describe the process of weaning the patient from mechanical ventilation.
7. Describe the significance of preoperative nursing assessment and patient teaching for the patient who is to have thoracic surgery.
8. Explain the principles of chest drainage and the nursing responsibilities related to the care of the patient with a chest drainage system.
9. Describe the patient education and home care considerations for patients who have had thoracic surgery.

Nuumerous treatment modalities are used when caring for patients with various respiratory conditions. The choice of modality is based on the oxygenation disorder and whether there is a problem with gas ventilation, diffusion, or both. Therapies range from simple and noninvasive modalities (oxygen and nebulizer therapy, chest physiotherapy, breathing retraining) to complex and highly invasive treatments (intubation, mechanical ventilation, surgery). Assessment and management of the patient with respiratory disorders are best accomplished when the approach is multidisciplinary and collaborative.

\section*{Noninvasive RespiratoryTherapies}

\section*{OXYGEN THERAPY}

Oxygen therapy is the administration of oxygen at a concentration greater than that found in the environmental atmosphere. At sea level, the concentration of oxygen in room air is $21 \%$. The goal of oxygen therapy is to provide adequate transport of oxygen in the blood while decreasing the work of breathing and reducing stress on the myocardium.

Oxygen transport to the tissues depends on factors such as cardiac output, arterial oxygen content, concentration of hemoglobin, and metabolic requirements. These factors must be kept in mind when oxygen therapy is considered. (Respiratory physiology and oxygen transport are discussed in Chap. 21.)

\section*{Indications}

A change in the patient's respiratory rate or pattern may be one of the earliest indicators of the need for oxygen therapy. The change in respiratory rate or pattern may result from hypoxemia
or hypoxia. Hypoxemia (a decrease in the arterial oxygen tension in the blood) is manifested by changes in mental status (progressing through impaired judgment, agitation, disorientation, confusion, lethargy, and coma), dyspnea, increase in blood pressure, changes in heart rate, dysrhythmias, central cyanosis (late sign), diaphoresis, and cool extremities. Hypoxemia usually leads to hypoxia, which is a decrease in oxygen supply to the tissues. Hypoxia, if severe enough, can be life-threatening.

The signs and symptoms signaling the need for oxygen may depend on how suddenly this need develops. With rapidly developing hypoxia, changes occur in the central nervous system because the higher neurologic centers are very sensitive to oxygen deprivation. The clinical picture may resemble that of alcohol intoxication, with the patient exhibiting lack of coordination and impaired judgment. Longstanding hypoxia (as seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and chronic heart failure) may produce fatigue, drowsiness, apathy, inattentiveness, and delayed reaction time. The need for oxygen is assessed by arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry as well as by clinical evaluation. For more information about hypoxia, see Chart 25-1.

\section*{Cautions in Oxygen Therapy}

As with other medications, the nurse administers oxygen with caution and carefully assesses its effects on each patient. Oxygen is a medication and except in emergency situations is administered only when prescribed by a physician.

In general, patients with respiratory conditions are given oxygen therapy only to raise the arterial oxygen pressure ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) back to the patient's normal baseline, which may vary from 60 to 95 mm Hg . In terms of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (see Chap. 21),
assist-control ventilation: mode of mechanical ventilation in which the patient's breathing pattern may trigger the ventilator to deliver a preset tidal volume; in the absence of spontaneous breathing, the machine delivers a controlled breath at a preset minimum rate and tidal volume
chest drainage system: use of a chest tube and closed drainage system to reexpand the lung and to remove excess air, fluid, and blood
chest percussion: manually cupping over the chest wall to mobilize secretions by mechanically dislodging viscous or adherent secretions in the lungs
chest physiotherapy (CPT): therapy used to remove bronchial secretions, improve ventilation, and increase the efficiency of the respiratory muscles. Types include postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration.
controlled ventilation: mode of mechanical ventilation in which the ventilator completely controls the patient's ventilation according to preset tidal volumes and respiratory rate. Because of problems with synchrony, it is rarely used except in paralyzed or anesthetized patients.
endotracheal intubation: insertion of a breathing tube through the nose or mouth into the trachea
fraction of inspired oxygen ( $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ ): concentration of oxygen delivered ( $1.0=$ 100\% oxygen)
hypoxemia: decrease in arterial oxygen tension in the blood
hypoxia: decrease in oxygen supply to the tissues and cells
incentive spirometry: method of deep breathing that provides visual feedback to help the patient inhale deeply and slowly and achieve maximum lung inflation mechanical ventilator: a positive- or negative-pressure breathing device that supports ventilation and oxygenation
pneumothorax: partial or complete collapse of the lung due to positive pressure in the pleural space
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): positive pressure maintained by the ventilator at the end of exhalation (instead of a normal zero pressure) to increase functional residual capacity and open collapsed alveoli; improves oxygenation with lower $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$
postural drainage: positioning the patient to allow drainage from all the lobes of the lungs and airways
pressure support ventilation (PSV): mode of mechanical ventilation in which preset positive pressure is delivered with spontaneous breaths to decrease work of breathing
respiratory weaning: process of gradual, systematic withdrawal and/or removal of ventilator, breathing tube, and oxygen
synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV): mode of mechanical ventilation in which the ventilator allows the patient to breathe spontaneously while providing a preset number of breaths to ensure adequate ventilation; ventilated breaths are synchronized with spontaneous breathing
thoracotomy: surgical opening into the chest cavity
tracheotomy: surgical opening into the trachea
tracheostomy tube: indwelling tube inserted directly into the trachea to assist with ventilation
vibration: a type of massage administered by quickly tapping the chest with the fingertips or alternating the fingers in a rhythmic manner, or by using a mechanical device to assist in mobilizing lung secretions

Hypoxia can occur from either severe pulmonary disease (inadequate oxygen supply) or from extrapulmonary disease (inadequate oxygen delivery) affecting gas exchange at the cellular level. The four general types of hypoxia are hypoxemic hypoxia, circulatory hypoxia, anemic hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia.

\section*{Hypoxemic Hypoxia}

Hypoxemic hypoxia is a decreased oxygen level in the blood resulting in decreased oxygen diffusion into the tissues. It may be caused by hypoventilation, high altitudes, ventilation-perfusion mismatch (as in pulmonary embolism), shunts in which the alveoli are collapsed and cannot provide oxygen to the blood (commonly caused by atelectasis), and pulmonary diffusion defects. It is corrected by increasing alveolar ventilation or providing supplemental oxygen.

\section*{Circulatory Hypoxia}

Circulatory hypoxia is hypoxia resulting from inadequate capillary circulation. It may be caused by decreased cardiac output, local vascular obstruction, low-flow states such as shock, or cardiac arrest. Although tissue partial pressure of oxygen ( $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ) is reduced, arterial oxygen ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) remains normal. Circulatory hypoxia is corrected by identifying and treating the underlying cause.

\section*{Anemic Hypoxia}

Anemic hypoxia is a result of decreased effective hemoglobin concentration, which causes a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. It is rarely accompanied by hypoxemia. Carbon monoxide poisoning, because it reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin, produces similar effects but is not strictly anemic hypoxia because hemoglobin levels may be normal.

\section*{Histotoxic Hypoxia}

Histotoxic hypoxia occurs when a toxic substance, such as cyanide, interferes with the ability of tissues to use available oxygen.
the blood at these levels is $80 \%$ to $98 \%$ saturated with oxygen; higher inspired oxygen flow ( $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ ) values add no further significant amounts of oxygen to the red blood cells or plasma. Instead of helping, increased amounts of oxygen may produce toxic effects on the lungs and central nervous system or may depress ventilation (see discussion below).

It is important to observe for subtle indicators of inadequate oxygenation when oxygen is administered by any method. Therefore, the nurse assesses the patient frequently for confusion, restlessness progressing to lethargy, diaphoresis, pallor, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension. Intermittent or continuous pulse oximetry is used to monitor oxygen levels.

\section*{OXYGEN TOXICITY}

Oxygen toxicity may occur when too high a concentration of oxygen (greater than $50 \%$ ) is administered for an extended period (longer than 48 hours). It is caused by overproduction of oxygen free radicals, which are byproducts of cell metabolism. If oxygen toxicity is untreated, these radicals can severely damage or kill cells. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene may help defend against oxygen free radicals (Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999). The dietitian can adjust the patient's diet so that it is rich in antioxidants; supplements are also available for patients who have a decreased appetite or who are unable to eat.

Signs and symptoms of oxygen toxicity include substernal discomfort, paresthesias, dyspnea, restlessness, fatigue, malaise, progressive respiratory difficulty, and alveolar infiltrates evident on chest x-rays.

Prevention of oxygen toxicity is achieved by using oxygen only as prescribed. If high concentrations of oxygen are necessary, it is important to minimize the duration of administration and reduce its concentration as soon as possible. Often, positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is used with oxygen therapy to reverse or prevent microatelectasis, thus allowing a lower percentage of oxygen to be used. The level of PEEP that allows the best oxygenation without hemodynamic compromise is known as "best PEEP."

\section*{SUPPRESSION OF VENTILATION}

In patients with COPD, the stimulus for respiration is a decrease in blood oxygen rather than an elevation in carbon dioxide levels. Thus, administration of a high concentration of oxygen removes the respiratory drive that has been created largely by the patient's chronic low oxygen tension. The resulting decrease in alveolar ventilation can cause a progressive increase in arterial carbon dioxide pressure ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ), ultimately leading to the patient's death from carbon dioxide narcosis and acidosis. Oxygen-induced hypoventilation is prevented by administering oxygen at low flow rates (1 to $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ).

\section*{OTHER COMPLICATIONS}

Because oxygen supports combustion, there is always a danger of fire when it is used. It is important to post "no smoking" signs when oxygen is in use. Oxygen therapy equipment is also a potential source of bacterial cross-infection; thus, the nurse changes the tubing according to infection control policy and the type of oxygen delivery equipment.

\section*{Methods of Oxygen Administration}

Oxygen is dispensed from a cylinder or a piped-in system. A reduction gauge is necessary to reduce the pressure to a working level, and a flow meter regulates the flow of oxygen in liters per minute. When oxygen is used at high flow rates, it should be moistened by passing it through a humidification system to prevent it from drying the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract.

The use of oxygen concentrators is another means of providing varying amounts of oxygen, especially in the home setting. These devices are relatively portable, easy to operate, and costeffective. However, they require more maintenance than tank or liquid systems and probably cannot deliver oxygen flows in excess of 4 L , which provides an $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ of about $36 \%$.

Many different oxygen devices are used, and all deliver oxygen if they are used as prescribed and maintained correctly (Table 25-1). The amount of oxygen delivered is expressed as a percentage concentration (eg, 70\%). The appropriate form of oxygen therapy is best determined by arterial blood gas levels, which indicate the patient's oxygenation status.

Oxygen delivery systems are classified as low-flow or high-flow delivery systems. Low-flow systems contribute partially to the inspired gas the patient breathes. This means the patient breathes some room air along with the oxygen. These systems do not provide a constant or known concentration of inspired oxygen. The amount of inspired oxygen changes as the patient's breathing changes. Examples of low-flow systems include nasal cannula, oropharyngeal catheter, simple mask, and partial-rebreather and non-rebreather masks. High-flow systems provide the total amount of inspired air. A specific percentage of oxygen is delivered independent of the patient's breathing. High-flow systems are indicated for patients who require a constant and precise amount of oxygen. Examples of such systems include transtracheal catheters, Venturi

masks, aerosol masks, tracheostomy collars, T -piece, and face tents (Cairo \& Philbeam, 1999; Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999).

A nasal cannula is used when the patient requires a low to medium concentration of oxygen for which precise accuracy is not essential. This method is relatively simple and allows the patient to move about in bed, talk, cough, and eat without interrupting oxygen flow. Flow rates in excess of 6 to $8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ may lead to swallowing of air; this may cause irritation and drying of the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa.

The oropharyngeal catheter is rarely used but may be prescribed for short-term therapy to administer low to moderate concentrations of oxygen. The catheter should be changed every 8 hours, alternating nostrils to prevent infection and nasal irritation.

When oxygen is administered via cannula or catheter, the percentage of oxygen reaching the lungs varies with the depth and rate of respirations, particularly if the nasal mucosa is swollen or if the patient is a mouth breather.

Oxygen masks come in several forms. Each is used for different purposes (Fig. 25-1). Simple masks are used for low to moderate concentrations of oxygen. The body of the mask itself gathers and stores oxygen between breaths. The patient exhales directly through openings or ports in the body of the mask. If oxygen flow ceases, the patient can draw air in through these openings around the mask edges (Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999). Although widely used, these masks cannot be used for controlled oxygen concentrations and must be adjusted for proper fit. They should not press too tightly against the skin, because this may cause a sense of claustrophobia and skin breakdown; adjustable elastic bands are provided to ensure comfort and security.

Partial-rebreathing masks have a reservoir bag that must remain inflated during both inspiration and expiration. The nurse
should adjust the liter flow to ensure that the bag does not collapse during inhalation. A higher concentration of oxygen can be delivered because both the mask and bag serve as reservoirs for oxygen. Oxygen enters the mask through small-bore tubing that connects at the junction of the mask and bag. As the patient inhales, gas is drawn from the mask, the bag, and potentially from room air through the exhalation ports. As the patient exhales, the first third of the exhalation fills the reservoir bag. This is mainly dead space and does not participate in gas exchange in the lungs. Therefore, it has a high oxygen concentration. The remainder of the exhaled gas is vented through the exhalation ports. The actual percentage of oxygen delivered is influenced by the patient's ventilatory pattern (Cairo \& Pilbeam, 1999).

Non-rebreathing masks are similar in design to partialrebreathing masks except that they have two valves. The first valve is a one-way valve located between the reservoir bag and the base of the mask. The valve allows gas from the reservoir bag to enter the mask on inhalation and prevents gas in the mask from flowing back into the reservoir bag during exhalation. The second valve is a set of valves located at the exhalation ports. These one-way valves prevent room air from entering the mask during inhalation. They also allow the patient's exhaled gases to exit the mask on exhalation (Cairo \& Pilbeam, 1999). As with the partial-rebreathing mask, it is important to adjust the liter flow so that the reservoir bag does not completely collapse on inspiration. In theory, if the nonrebreather mask fits the patient snugly and both side exhalation ports have one-way valves, it is possible for the patient to receive $100 \%$ oxygen, making the non-rebreather a high-flow oxygen system. However, because it is difficult to get an exact fit from the mask on every patient, and some non-rebreather masks have only one one-way exhalation valve, it is nearly impossible to ensure $100 \%$ oxygen delivery, making it a low-flow oxygen system.

The Venturi mask is the most reliable and accurate method for delivering precise concentrations of oxygen through noninvasive means. The mask is constructed in a way that allows a constant flow of room air blended with a fixed flow of oxygen. It is used primarily for patients with COPD because it can provide low levels of supplemental oxygen, thus avoiding the risk of suppressing the hypoxic drive.

The Venturi mask employs the Bernoulli principle of air entrainment (trapping the air like a vacuum), which provides a high air flow with controlled oxygen enrichment. For each liter of oxygen that passes through a jet orifice, a fixed proportion of room air will be entrained. A precise volume of oxygen can be delivered by varying the size of the jet orifice and adjusting the flow of oxygen. Excess gas leaves the mask through the two exhalation ports, carrying with it the exhaled carbon dioxide. This method allows a constant oxygen concentration to be inhaled regardless of the depth or rate of respiration.

The mask should fit snugly enough to prevent oxygen from flowing into the patient's eyes. The nurse should check the patient's skin for irritation. It is necessary to remove the mask so that the patient can eat, drink, and take medications.

The transtracheal oxygen catheter is inserted directly into the trachea and is indicated for patients with chronic oxygen therapy needs. These catheters are more comfortable, less dependent on breathing patterns, and less obvious than other oxygen delivery methods. Because no oxygen is lost into the surrounding environment, the patient achieves adequate oxygenation at lower rates, making this method less expensive and more efficient.

The $T$-piece connects to the endotracheal tube and is useful in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation (Fig. 25-2).

Other oxygen devices include aerosol masks, tracheostomy collars, and face tents, all of which are used with aerosol devices (nebulizers) that can be adjusted for oxygen concentrations from $27 \%$ to $100 \%$ ( 0.27 to 1.00 ). If the gas mixture flow falls below patient demand, room air is pulled in, diluting the concentration. The aerosol mist must be available for the patient during the entire inspiratory phase.

Although most oxygen therapy is administered as continuous flow oxygen, new methods of oxygen conservation are coming
into use. Demand oxygen delivery systems (DODS) interrupt the flow of oxygen during exhalation, when the oxygen flow is otherwise mostly wasted. Several versions of DODS are being researched for their effectiveness. Studies show that DODS models conserve oxygen and maintain oxygen saturations better than continuous-flow oxygen when the respiratory rate increases (Bliss, McCoy \& Adams, 1999).

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the administration of oxygen at pressures greater than one atmosphere. As a result, the amount of oxygen dissolved in plasma is increased, which raises oxygen levels in the tissues. It is administered through a small (single patient use) or large (multiple patient use) cylinder chamber. During therapy, the patient is placed in the chamber. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat conditions such as air embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning, gangrene, tissue necrosis, and hemorrhage. Other uses for this therapy include treatment for multiple sclerosis, diabetic foot ulcers, closed head trauma, and acute myocardial infarction. Research continues in the area of hyperbaric oxygen use because of potential side effects, including ear trauma, central nervous system disorders, and oxygen toxicity (Takezawa, 2000; Woodrow \& Roe, 2000).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The respiratory system changes throughout the aging process, and it is important for nurses to be aware of these changes when assessing patients who are receiving oxygen therapy. As the respiratory muscles weaken and the large bronchi and alveoli become enlarged, the available surface area of the lungs decreases, resulting in reduced ventilation and respiratory gas exchange. The number of functional cilia is also reduced, decreasing ciliary action and the cough reflex. As a result of osteoporosis and the calcification of the costal cartilages, chest wall compliance is decreased. Patients may display increased chest rigidity and respiratory rate and decreased $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ and lung expansion. Nurses should be aware that the older adult is at risk for aspiration and infection related to these changes. In addition, patient education regarding adequate nutrition is essential, because appropriate dietary intake can help

to diminish the excess build-up of carbon dioxide and to maintain optimal respiratory functioning (Abraham, Bottrell, Fulmer \& Mezey, 1999; Eliopoulos, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. At times oxygen must be administered to the patient at home. The nurse instructs the patient or family in the methods for administering oxygen and informs the patient and family that oxygen is available in gas, liquid, and concentrated forms. The gas and liquid forms come in portable de-
vices so that the patient can leave home while receiving oxygen therapy. Humidity must be provided while oxygen is used (except with portable devices) to counteract the dry, irritating effects of compressed oxygen on the airway (Chart 25-2).

Continuing Care. Home visits by a home health nurse or respiratory therapist may be arranged based on the patient's status and needs. It is important to assess the patient's home environment, the patient's physical and psychological status, and the need for further teaching. The nurse reinforces the teaching points on how to use oxygen safely and effectively, including fire safety tips because oxygen is flammable. To maintain a consistent quality of care and to maximize the patient's financial reimbursement for

home oxygen therapy, the nurse ensures that the physician's prescription includes the diagnosis, the prescribed oxygen flow, and conditions for use (eg, continuous use, nighttime use only). Because oxygen is a medication, the nurse reminds the patient receiving long-term oxygen therapy and family about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with the physician. The patient is instructed to see the physician every 6 months or more often, if indicated. Blood gas measurements and laboratory tests are repeated annually, or more often if the patient's condition changes (Smith \& Matti, 1999).

\section*{INTERMITTENT POSITIVE-PRESSURE BREATHING}

Intermittent positive-pressure breathing (IPPB) is a form of assisted or controlled respiration produced by a ventilatory apparatus in which compressed gas is delivered under positive pressure into a person's airways until a preset pressure is reached. Passive exhalation is allowed through a valve. The specific pressure and volume amounts, along with the use of any nebulizing medications, are prescribed individually for patients. The nurse should encourage patients to relax and reassure them that the machine will automatically shut off airflow at the end of inspiration. The IPPB machine may be powered by electricity or gas and may be connected with a mouthpiece, mask, or tracheostomy adapter.

\section*{Indications}

General indications for IPPB include difficulty in raising respiratory secretions, reduced vital capacity with ineffective deep breathing and coughing, or unsuccessful trials of simpler and less costly methods for loosening secretions, delivering aerosol, or expanding the lungs.

\section*{Complications}

IPPB therapy is used rarely today because of its inherent hazards, which may include pneumothorax, mucosal drying, increased intracranial pressure, hemoptysis, gastric distention, vomiting with possible aspiration, psychological dependency (especially with long-term use, as in COPD patients), hyperventilation, excessive oxygen administration, and cardiovascular problems.

\section*{MINI-NEBULIZER THERAPY}

The mini-nebulizer is a hand-held apparatus that disperses a moisturizing agent or medication, such as a bronchodilator or mucolytic agent, into microscopic particles and delivers it to the lungs as the patient inhales. The mini-nebulizer is usually air-driven by means of a compressor through connecting tubing. In some instances, the nebulizer is oxygen-driven rather than air-driven. To be effective, a visible mist must be available for the patient to inhale.

\section*{Indications}

The indications for use of a mini-nebulizer are similar to the indications for IPPB, except that the patient must be able to generate a deep breath without the aid of the positive-pressure machine. Diaphragmatic breathing (Chart 25-3) is a helpful technique to prepare for proper use of the mini-nebulizer. Frequently,

\section*{Chart 25-3 • PATIENT EDUCATION Breathing Exercises}

\section*{General Instructions}
- Breathe slowly and rhythmically to exhale completely and empty the lungs completely.
- Inhale through the nose to filter, humidify, and warm the air before it enters the lungs.
- If you feel out of breath, breathe more slowly by prolonging the exhalation time.
- Keep the air moist with a humidifier.

\section*{Diaphragmatic Breathing}

Goal: To use and strengthen the diaphragm during breathing
- Place one hand on the abdomen (just below the ribs) and the other hand on the middle of the chest to increase the awareness of the position of the diaphragm and its function in breathing.
- Breathe in slowly and deeply through the nose, letting the abdomen protrude as far as possible.
- Breathe out through pursed lips while tightening (contracting) the abdominal muscles.
- Press firmly inward and upward on the abdomen while breathing out.
- Repeat for 1 minute; follow with a rest period of 2 minutes.
- Gradually increase duration up to 5 minutes, several times a day (before meals and at bedtime).

\section*{Pursed-Lip Breathing}

Goal: To prolong exhalation and increase airway pressure during expiration, thus reducing the amount of trapped air and the amount of airway resistance.
- Inhale through the nose while counting to 3-the amount of time needed to say "Smell a rose."
- Exhale slowly and evenly against pursed lips while tightening the abdominal muscles. (Pursing the lips increases intratracheal pressure; exhaling through the mouth offers less resistance to expired air.)
- Count to 7 while prolonging expiration through pursed lips-the length of time to say "Blow out the candle."
- While sitting in a chair: Fold arms over the abdomen. Inhale through the nose while counting to 3 . Bend forward and exhale slowly through pursed lips while counting to 7.
- While walking: Inhale while walking two steps.
Exhale through pursed lips while walking four or five steps.
mini-nebulizers are used for patients with COPD to dispense inhaled medications and are commonly used at home on a longterm basis.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse instructs the patient to breathe through the mouth, taking slow, deep breaths, and then to hold the breath for a few seconds at the end of inspiration to increase intrapleural pressure and reopen collapsed alveoli, thereby increasing functional residual capacity. The nurse encourages the patient to cough and to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy. The nurse instructs the patient and family about the purpose of the treatment, equipment set-up, medication additive, and proper cleaning and storage of the equipment.

\section*{INCENTIVE SPIROMETRY (SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATION)}

Incentive spirometry is a method of deep breathing that provides visual feedback to help the patient inhale slowly and deeply to maximize lung inflation and prevent or reduce atelectasis. Ideally, the patient assumes a sitting or semi-Fowler's position to enhance diaphragmatic excursion (Chart 25-4). However, this procedure may be performed with the patient in any position.

Incentive spirometers may be one of two types: volume or flow. In the volume type, the tidal volume of the spirometer is set according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purpose of the device is to ensure that the volume of air inhaled is increased gradually as the patient takes deeper and deeper breaths. The patient takes a deep breath through the mouthpiece, pauses at peak lung inflation, and then relaxes and exhales. Taking several normal breaths before attempting another with the incentive spirometer helps avoid fatigue. The volume is periodically increased as tolerated.

A flow spirometer has the same purpose as a volume spirometer, but the volume is not preset. The spirometer contains a number of movable balls that are pushed up by the force of the breath and held suspended in the air while the patient inhales. The amount of air inhaled and the flow of the air are estimated by how long and how high the balls are suspended.

\section*{Indications}

Incentive spirometry is used after surgery, especially thoracic and abdominal surgery, to promote the expansion of the alveoli and to prevent or treat atelectasis. As a preventive measure, incentive spirometry may be more effective than IPPB because it maximizes the amount of air inhaled while maintaining relatively low airway pressures.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient using incentive spirometry includes placing the patient in the proper position, teaching the technique for using the incentive spirometer, setting realistic goals for the patient, and recording the results of the therapy.

\section*{CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY}

Chest physiotherapy (CPT) includes postural drainage, chest percussion and vibration, and breathing exercises/breathing retraining. In addition, teaching the patient effective coughing technique is an important part of chest physiotherapy. The goals of chest physiotherapy are to remove bronchial secretions, improve ventilation, and increase the efficiency of the respiratory muscles.

\section*{Postural Drainage (Segmented Bronchial Drainage)}

Postural drainage uses specific positions that allow the force of gravity to assist in the removal of bronchial secretions. The secretions drain from the affected bronchioles into the bronchi and trachea and are removed by coughing or suctioning. Postural drainage is used to prevent or relieve bronchial obstruction caused by accumulation of secretions.

Because the patient usually sits in an upright position, secretions are likely to accumulate in the lower parts of the lungs. With postural drainage, different positions (Fig. 25-3) are used so that the force of gravity helps to move secretions from the smaller bronchial airways to the main bronchi and trachea. The secretions then are removed by coughing. The nurse should instruct the patient to inhale bronchodilators and mucolytic agents, if prescribed, before postural drainage because these medications improve bronchial tree drainage.

\section*{Chart 25-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION Assisting the Patient to Perform Incentive Spirometry}
- Explain the reason and objective for the therapy: the inspired air helps to inflate the lungs. The ball or weight in the spirometer will rise in response to the intensity of the intake of air. The higher the ball rises, the deeper the breath.
- Assess the patient's level of pain and administer pain medication if prescribed.
- Position the patient in semi-Fowler's position or in an upright position (although any position is acceptable).
- Demonstrate how to use diaphragmatic breathing.
- Instruct the patient to place the mouthpiece of the spirometer firmly in the mouth, to breathe air in (inspire), and to hold the breath at the end of inspiration for about 3 seconds. The patient then exhales slowly.
- Encourage approximately 10 breaths per hour with the spirometer during waking hours.
- Set a reasonable volume and repetition goal (to provide encouragement and give the patient a sense of accomplishment).
- Encourage coughing during and after each session.
- Assist the patient to splint the incision when coughing postoperatively.
- Place the spirometer within easy reach of the patient.
- For the postoperative patient, begin the therapy immediately.

\caption{EIGURE 25-3 Postural drainage positions and the areas of lung drained by each position.}
\end{figure}

Postural drainage exercises can be directed at any of the segments of the lungs. The lower and middle lobe bronchi drain more effectively when the head is down; the upper lobe bronchi drain more effectively when the head is up. Frequently, five positions are used, one for drainage of each lobe: head down, prone, right and left lateral, and sitting upright.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse should be aware of the patient's diagnosis as well as the lung lobes or segments involved, the cardiac status, and any structural deformities of the chest wall and spine. Auscultating the chest before and after the procedure helps to identify the areas needing drainage and to assess the effectiveness of treatment. The nurse teaches family members who will be assisting the patient at home to evaluate breath sounds before and after treatment. The nurse explores strategies that will enable the patient to assume the indicated positions at home. This may require the creative use of objects readily available at home, such as pillows, cushions, or cardboard boxes.

Postural drainage is usually performed two to four times daily, before meals (to prevent nausea, vomiting, and aspiration) and at bedtime. Prescribed bronchodilators, water, or saline may be nebulized and inhaled before postural drainage to dilate the bronchioles, reduce bronchospasm, decrease the thickness of mucus and sputum, and combat edema of the bronchial walls. The recommended sequence of positioning is as follows: positions to drain the lower lobes first, then positions to drain the upper lobes.

The nurse makes the patient as comfortable as possible in each position and provides an emesis basin, sputum cup, and paper tissues. The nurse instructs the patient to remain in each position for 10 to 15 minutes and to breathe in slowly through the nose and then breathe out slowly through pursed lips to help keep the airways open so that secretions can drain while in each position. If a position cannot be tolerated, the nurse helps the patient to assume a modified position. When the patient changes position, the nurse explains how to cough and remove secretions (Chart 25-5).

If the patient cannot cough, the nurse may need to suction the secretions mechanically. It also may be necessary to use chest percussion and vibration to loosen bronchial secretions and mucus plugs that adhere to the bronchioles and bronchi and to propel sputum in the direction of gravity drainage (see "Chest Percussion and Vibration," below). If suctioning is required at home, the nurse instructs caregivers in safe suctioning technique and care of the suctioning equipment.

\section*{Chelpts \\ 25-5}

\section*{Effective Coughing Technique}
1. The patient assumes a sitting position and bends slightly forward. This upright position permits a stronger cough.
2. The patient's knees and hips are flexed to promote relaxation and reduce the strain on the abdominal muscles while coughing.
3. The patient inhales slowly through the nose and exhales through pursed lips several times.
4. The patient should cough twice during each exhalation while contracting (pulling in) the abdomen sharply with each cough.
5. The patient splints the incisional area, if any, with firm hand pressure or supports it with a pillow or rolled blanket while coughing (see Fig. 25-8). (The nurse can initially demonstrate this by using the patient's hands.)

After the procedure, the nurse notes the amount, color, viscosity, and character of the expelled sputum. It is important to evaluate the patient's skin color and pulse the first few times the procedure is performed. It may be necessary to administer oxygen during postural drainage.

If the sputum is foul-smelling, it is important to perform postural drainage in a room away from other patients and/or family members and to use deodorizers unless contraindicated. Deodorizers delivered in aerosol sprays can cause bronchospasm and irritation to the patient with a respiratory disorder and should be used cautiously (Zang \& Allender, 1999). After the procedure, the patient may find it refreshing to brush the teeth and use a mouthwash before resting.

\section*{Chest Percussion and Vibration}

Thick secretions that are difficult to cough up may be loosened by tapping (percussing) and vibrating the chest. Chest percussion and vibration help to dislodge mucus adhering to the bronchioles and bronchi.

Percussion is carried out by cupping the hands and lightly striking the chest wall in a rhythmic fashion over the lung segment to be drained. The wrists are alternately flexed and extended so that the chest is cupped or clapped in a painless manner (Fig. 25-4). A soft cloth or towel may be placed over the segment of the chest that is being cupped to prevent skin irritation and redness from direct contact. Percussion, alternating with vibration, is performed for 3 to 5 minutes for each position. The patient uses diaphragmatic breathing during this procedure to promote relaxation (see "Breathing Retraining," below). As a precaution, percussion over chest drainage tubes, the sternum, spine, liver, kidneys, spleen, or breasts (in women) is avoided. Percussion is performed cautiously in the elderly because of their increased incidence of osteoporosis and risk of rib fracture.

Vibration is the technique of applying manual compression and tremor to the chest wall during the exhalation phase of respiration (see Fig. 25-4). This helps to increase the velocity of the air expired from the small airways, thus freeing the mucus. After three or four vibrations, the patient is encouraged to cough, using the abdominal muscles. (Contracting the abdominal muscles increases the effectiveness of the cough.)

A scheduled program of coughing and clearing sputum, together with hydration, reduces the amount of sputum in most patients. The number of times the percussion and vibration cycle is repeated depends on the patient's tolerance and clinical response. It is important to evaluate breath sounds before and after the procedures.

\section*{Nursing Management}

When performing chest physiotherapy, the nurse ensures that the patient is comfortable, is not wearing restrictive clothing, and has not just eaten. The uppermost areas of the lung are treated first. The nurse gives medication for pain, as prescribed, before percussion and vibration and splints any incision and provides pillows for support as needed. The positions are varied, but focus is placed on the affected areas. On completion of the treatment, the nurse assists the patient to assume a comfortable position.

The nurse must stop treatment if any of the following occur: increased pain, increased shortness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, or hemoptysis. Therapy is indicated until the patient has normal respirations, can mobilize secretions, and has normal breath sounds, and when the chest x-ray findings are normal.

\end{figure}

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Chest physiotherapy is frequently indicated at home for patients with COPD, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. The techniques are the same as described above, but gravity drainage is achieved by placing the hips over a box, a stack of magazines, or pillows (unless a hospital bed is available). The nurse instructs the patient and family in the positions and techniques of percussion and vibration so that therapy can be continued in the home. In addition, the nurse instructs the patient to maintain an adequate fluid intake and air humidity to prevent secretions from becoming thick and tenacious. It also is important to teach the patient to recognize early signs of infection, such as fever and a change in the color or character of sputum. Resting 5 to 10 minutes in each postural drainage position before chest physiotherapy maximizes the amount of secretions obtained.

Continuing Care. Chest physical therapy may be carried out during visits by a home care nurse. The nurse also assesses the patient's physical status, understanding of the treatment plan, and compliance with recommended therapy, as well as the effectiveness of therapy. It is important to reinforce patient and family teaching during these visits. The nurse reports to the patient's physician any deterioration in the patient's physical status and inability to clear secretions.

\section*{Breathing Retraining}

Breathing retraining consists of exercises and breathing practices designed to achieve more efficient and controlled ventilation and to decrease the work of breathing. Breathing retraining is especially indicated in patients with COPD and dyspnea. These exercises promote maximal alveolar inflation and muscle relaxation, relieve anxiety, eliminate ineffective, uncoordinated patterns of respiratory muscle activity, slow the respiratory rate, and decrease the work of breathing. Slow, relaxed, and rhythmic breathing also helps to control the anxiety that occurs with dyspnea. Specific breathing exercises include diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing (see Chart 25-3).

The goal of diaphragmatic breathing is to use and strengthen the diaphragm during breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing can become automatic with sufficient practice and concentration. Pursed-lip breathing, which improves oxygen transport, helps to
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-127.jpg?height=650&width=840&top_left_y=219&top_left_x=1116)
induce a slow, deep breathing pattern and assists the patient to control breathing, even during periods of stress. This type of breathing helps prevent airway collapse secondary to loss of lung elasticity in emphysema. The goal of pursed-lip breathing is to train the muscles of expiration to prolong exhalation and increase airway pressure during expiration, thus lessening the amount of airway trapping and resistance. The nurse instructs the patient in diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing, as described earlier in Chart 25-3. Breathing exercises may be practiced in several positions because air distribution and pulmonary circulation vary with the position of the chest. Many patients require additional oxygen, using a low-flow method, while performing breathing exercises. Emphysema-like changes in the lung occur as part of the natural aging process of the lung; therefore, breathing exercises are appropriate for all elderly patients who are hospitalized and elderly patients in any setting who are sedentary, even without primary lung disease.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse instructs the patient to breathe slowly and rhythmically in a relaxed manner and to exhale completely to empty the lungs. The patient is instructed always to inhale through the nose because this filters, humidifies, and warms the air. If short of breath, the patient should concentrate on breathing slowly and rhythmically. To avoid initiating a cycle of increasing shortness of breath and panic, it is often helpful to instruct the patient to concentrate on prolonging the length of exhalation rather than merely slowing the rate of breathing. Minimizing the amount of dust or particles in the air and providing adequate humidification may also make it easier for the patient to breathe. Strategies to decrease dust or particles in the air include removing drapes or upholstered furniture, using air filters, and washing floors and dusting and vacuuming frequently.

The nurse instructs the patient that an adequate dietary intake promotes gas exchange and increases energy levels. It is important to provide adequate nutrition without overfeeding patients. Nurses should teach patients to consume small, frequent meals and snacks. Having ready-prepared meals and favorite foods available helps encourage nutrient consumption. Gas-producing foods such as beans, legumes, broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts should be avoided to prevent gastric distress. Because many of these patients
lack the energy to eat, they should be taught to rest before and after meals to conserve energy (Lutz \& Przytulski, 2001).

\section*{Airway Management}

Adequate ventilation is dependent on free movement of air through the upper and lower airways. In many disorders, the airway becomes narrowed or blocked as a result of disease, bronchoconstriction (narrowing of airway by contraction of muscle fibers), a foreign body, or secretions. Maintaining a patent (open) airway is achieved through meticulous airway management, whether in an emergency situation such as airway obstruction or in long-term management, as in caring for a patient with an endotracheal or a tracheostomy tube.

\section*{EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OF UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION}

Upper airway obstruction has a variety of causes. Acute upper airway obstruction may be caused by food particles, vomitus, blood clots, or any other particle that enters and obstructs the larynx or trachea. It also may occur from enlargement of tissue in the wall of the airway, as in epiglottitis, laryngeal edema, laryngeal carcinoma, or peritonsillar abscess, or from thick secretions. Pressure on the walls of the airway, as occurs in retrosternal goiter, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, hematoma around the upper airway, and thoracic aneurysm, also may result in upper airway obstruction.

The patient with an altered level of consciousness from any cause is at risk for upper airway obstruction because of loss of the protective reflexes (cough and swallowing) and the tone of the pharyngeal muscles, causing the tongue to fall back and block the airway.

The nurse makes the following rapid observations to assess for signs and symptoms of upper airway obstruction:
- Inspection-Is the patient conscious? Is there any inspiratory effort? Does the chest rise symmetrically? Is there use or retraction of accessory muscles? What is the skin color? Are there any obvious signs of deformity or obstruction (trauma, food, teeth, vomitus)? Is the trachea midline?
- Palpation-Do both sides of the chest rise equally with inspiration? Are there any specific areas of tenderness, fracture, or subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus)?
- Auscultation-Is there any audible air movement, stridor (inspiratory sound), or wheezing (expiratory sound)? Are breath sounds present bilaterally in all lobes?
As soon as an upper airway obstruction is identified, the nurse takes emergency measures (Chart 25-6). (See "Guidelines for Managing a Foreign Body Airway Obstruction" in Chap. 71 for more details, or see Chap. 22.)

\section*{ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION}

Endotracheal intubation involves passing an endotracheal tube through the mouth or nose into the trachea (Fig. 25-5). Intubation provides a patent airway when the patient is having respiratory distress that cannot be treated with simpler methods. It is the method of choice in emergency care. Endotracheal intubation is a means of providing an airway for patients who cannot maintain an adequate airway on their own (eg, comatose patients or pa-
tients with upper airway obstruction), for mechanical ventilation, and for suctioning secretions from the pulmonary tree.

An endotracheal tube usually is passed with the aid of a laryngoscope by specifically trained medical, nursing, or respiratory therapy personnel. (See "Guidelines for Inserting an Oropharyngeal Airway" in Chap. 71 for more details.) Once the tube is inserted, a cuff around the tube is inflated to prevent air from leaking around the outer part of the tube, to minimize the possibility of subsequent aspiration, and to prevent movement of the tube.

Nurses should be aware that complications could occur from pressure in the cuff on the tracheal wall. Cuff pressures should be checked with a calibrated aneroid manometer device every 8 to 12 hours to maintain cuff pressure between 20 and 25 mm Hg . High cuff pressure can cause tracheal bleeding, ischemia, and pressure necrosis, while low cuff pressure can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Routine deflation of the cuff is not recommended due to the increased risk of aspiration and hypoxia. The cuff is deflated prior to removing the endotracheal tube (St. John, 1999b).

Tracheobronchial secretions are suctioned through the tube. Warmed, humidified oxygen should always be introduced through the tube, whether the patient is breathing spontaneously or is receiving ventilatory support. Endotracheal intubation may be used for no more than 3 weeks, by which time a tracheostomy must be considered to decrease irritation of and trauma to the tracheal lining, to reduce the incidence of vocal cord paralysis (secondary to laryngeal nerve damage), and to decrease the work of breathing. Chart 25-7 discusses the nursing care of the patient with an endotracheal tube.

There are several disadvantages of endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes. First, the tube causes discomfort. In addition, the cough reflex is depressed because closure of the glottis is hindered. Secretions tend to become thicker because the warming and humidifying effect of the upper respiratory tract has been bypassed. The swallowing reflexes, composed of the glottic, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes, are depressed because of prolonged disuse and the mechanical trauma of the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube, which puts the patient at increased risk for aspiration. In addition, ulceration and stricture of the larynx or trachea may develop. Of great concern to the patient is the inability to talk and to communicate needs.

Unintentional or premature removal of the tube is a potentially life-threatening complication of endotracheal intubation. Removal of the tube is a frequent problem in intensive care units and occurs mainly during nursing care or by the patient. It is important for nurses to instruct patients and family members about the purpose of the tube and the dangers of removing it. Baseline and ongoing assessment of the patient and equipment ensures effective care. Providing comfort measures, including opioid analgesia and sedation, can improve the patient's tolerance of the endotracheal tube.

NURSING ALERT Inadvertent removal of an endotracheal tube can cause laryngeal swelling, hypoxemia, bradycardia, hypotension, and even death. Measures must be taken to prevent premature or inadvertent removal.

To prevent tube removal by the patient, the nurse can use the following strategies: explain to the patient and family the purpose of the tube, distract the patient through one-to-one interaction with the nurse and family or with television, and maintain comfort measures. As a last resort, soft wrist restraints may be used, according to agency policy.

\section*{Clearing an Upper Airway Obstruction}

Clearing the Airway
- Hyperextend the patient's neck by placing one hand on the forehead and placing the fingers of the other hand underneath the jaw and lifting upward and forward. This action pulls the tongue away from the back of the pharynx.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
- Assess the patient by observing the chest and listening and feeling for the movement of air.
- Use a cross-finger technique to open the mouth and observe for obvious obstructions such as secretions, blood clots, or food particles.
- If no passage of air is detected, apply five quick sharp abdominal thrusts just below the xiphoid process to expel the obstruction (Heimlich maneuver). Repeat this procedure until the obstruction is expelled.
- After the obstruction is expelled, roll the patient as a unit onto the side for recovery.
- When the obstruction is relieved and the patient can breathe spontaneously but not cough, swallow, or gag, insert an oral or nasopharyngeal airway.

\section*{Bag and Mask Resuscitation}
- Use a resuscitation bag and mask if assisted ventilation is required.
- Apply the mask to the patient's face and create a seal by pressing the thumb of the nondominant hand on the bridge of the nose and the index finger on the chin. Use the rest of the fingers on the hand and pull on the chin and the angle of the mandible to maintain the head in extension. Use the dominant hand to inflate the lungs by squeezing the bag to its full volume.

\end{figure}

Studies have shown that the most effective way to prevent tube removal by the patient is through the use of soft wrist restraints (Happ, 2000). However, discretion and caution must always be used before applying any restraint. If the patient cannot move the arms and hands to the endotracheal tube, restraints would not be needed. If the patient is alert, oriented, able to follow directions, and
cooperative to the point that it is highly unlikely that he or she will remove the endotracheal tube, restraints are not needed. On the other hand, if the nurse determines there is a risk that the patient may try to remove the tube, soft wrist restraints are appropriate with a physician's order (check agency policy). Close monitoring of the patient remains essential to ensure safety and prevent harm.

\section*{TRACHEOSTOMY}

A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the trachea. The indwelling tube inserted into the trachea is called a tracheostomy tube. A tracheostomy may be either temporary or permanent.

A tracheostomy is used to bypass an upper airway obstruction, to allow removal of tracheobronchial secretions, to permit the long-term use of mechanical ventilation, to prevent aspiration of oral or gastric secretions in the unconscious or paralyzed patient (by closing off the trachea from the esophagus), and to replace an endotracheal tube. There are many disease processes and emergency conditions that make a tracheostomy necessary.

\section*{Procedure}

The surgical procedure is usually performed in the operating room or in an intensive care unit, where the patient's ventilation can be well controlled and optimal aseptic technique can be maintained.

A surgical opening is made in the second and third tracheal rings. After the trachea is exposed, a cuffed tracheostomy tube of an appropriate size is inserted. The cuff is an inflatable attachment to the tracheostomy tube that is designed to occlude the space between the trachea walls and the tube to permit effective mechanical ventilation and to minimize the risk of aspiration.

The tracheostomy tube is held in place by tapes fastened around the patient's neck. Usually a square of sterile gauze is placed between the tube and the skin to absorb drainage and prevent infection.

\section*{Complications}

Complications may occur early or late in the course of tracheostomy tube management. They may even occur years after the tube has been removed. Early complications include bleeding, pneumothorax, air embolism, aspiration, subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema, recurrent laryngeal nerve damage, and posterior tracheal wall penetration. Long-term complications include airway obstruction from accumulation of secretions or protrusion of the cuff over the opening of the tube, infection, rupture of the innominate artery, dysphagia, tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheal dilation, and tracheal ischemia and necrosis. Tracheal stenosis may develop after the tube is removed. Chart 25-8 outlines measures nurses can take to prevent complications.

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Management}

The patient requires continuous monitoring and assessment. The newly made opening must be kept patent by proper suctioning of secretions. After the vital signs are stable, the patient is placed in a semi-Fowler's position to facilitate ventilation, promote drainage, minimize edema, and prevent strain on the suture lines. Analgesia and sedative agents must be administered with caution because of the risk of suppressing the cough reflex.

Major objectives of nursing care are to alleviate the patient's apprehension and to provide an effective means of communica-

\section*{Care of the Patient with an Endotracheal Tube}

Immediately After Intubation
1. Check symmetry of chest expansion.
- Auscultate breath sounds of anterior and lateral chest bilaterally.
- Obtain order for chest x-ray to verify proper tube placement.
- Check cuff pressure every 8-12 hours.
- Monitor for signs and symptoms of aspiration.
2. Ensure high humidity; a visible mist should appear in the T-piece or ventilator tubing.
3. Administer oxygen concentration as prescribed by physician.
4. Secure the tube to the patient's face with tape, and mark the proximal end for position maintenance.
- Cut proximal end of tube if it is longer than 7.5 cm ( 3 inches) to prevent kinking.
- Insert an oral airway or mouth device to prevent the patient from biting and obstructing the tube.
5. Use sterile suction technique and airway care to prevent iatrogenic contamination and infection.
6. Continue to reposition patient every 2 hours and as needed to prevent atelectasis and to optimize lung expansion.
7. Provide oral hygiene and suction the oropharynx whenever necessary.

Extubation (Removal of Endotracheal Tube)
1. Explain procedure.
2. Have self-inflating bag and mask ready in case ventilatory assistance is required immediately after extubation.
3. Suction the tracheobronchial tree and oropharynx, remove tape, and then deflate the cuff.
4. Give oxygen for a few breaths, then insert a new, sterile suction catheter inside tube.
5. Have the patient inhale. At peak inspiration remove the tube, suctioning the airway through the tube as it is pulled out.
Note: In some hospitals this procedure can be performed by respiratory therapists; in others, by nurses. Check hospital policy.

\section*{Care of Patient Following Extubation}
1. Give heated humidity and oxygen by face mask.
2. Monitor respiratory rate and quality of chest excursions. Note stridor, color change, and change in mental alertness or behavior.
3. Monitor the patient's oxygen level using a pulse oximeter.
4. Keep NPO or give only ice chips for next few hours.
5. Provide mouth care.
6. Teach patient how to perform coughing and deep-breathing exercises.

\section*{SUCTIONING THE TRACHEAL TUBE (TRACHEOSTOMY OR ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE)}

When a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube is in place, it is usually necessary to suction the patient's secretions because of the decreased effectiveness of the cough mechanism. Tracheal suctioning is performed when adventitious breath sounds are detected or whenever secretions are obviously present. Unnecessary suctioning can initiate bronchospasm and cause mechanical trauma to the tracheal mucosa.

All equipment that comes into direct contact with the patient's lower airway must be sterile to prevent overwhelming pulmonary and systemic infections. The procedure for suctioning a tracheostomy is presented in Chart 25-10. In mechanically ventilated patients, an in-line suction catheter may be used to allow rapid suction when needed and to minimize cross-contamination of airborne pathogens. An in-line suction device allows the patient to be suctioned without being disconnected from the ventilator circuit.

\section*{MANAGING THE CUFF}

As a general rule, the cuff on an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube should be inflated. The pressure within the cuff should be the lowest possible that allows delivery of adequate tidal volumes and prevents pulmonary aspiration. Usually the pressure is maintained at less than $25 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to prevent injury and at more than 20 cm H 2 O to prevent aspiration. Cuff pressure must be monitored at least every 8 hours by attaching a hand-held pressure gauge to the pilot balloon of the tube or by using the minimal leak volume or minimal occlusion volume technique. With longterm intubation, higher pressures may be needed to maintain an adequate seal.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. If the patient is at home with a tracheostomy, the nurse instructs the patient and family about its daily care as well as measures to take in an emergency. The nurse also makes sure the patient and family are aware of community contacts for education and support needs. It is important for the
nurse to teach the patient and family strategies to prevent infection when performing tracheostomy care (McConnell, 2000).

\section*{MechanicalVentilation}

Mechanical ventilation may be required for a variety of reasons, including the need to control the patient's respirations during surgery or during treatment of severe head injury, to oxygenate the blood when the patient's ventilatory efforts are inadequate, and to rest the respiratory muscles. Many patients placed on a ventilator can breathe spontaneously, but the effort needed to do so may be exhausting.

A mechanical ventilator is a positive- or negative-pressure breathing device that can maintain ventilation and oxygen delivery for a prolonged period. Caring for a patient on mechanical ventilation has become an integral part of nursing care in critical care or general medical-surgical units, extended care facilities, and the home. Nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists must understand each patient's specific pulmonary needs and work together to set realistic goals. Positive patient outcomes depend on an understanding of the principles of mechanical ventilation and the patient's care needs as well as open communication among members of the health care team about the goals of therapy, weaning plans, and the patient's tolerance of changes in ventilator settings.

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR MECHANICAL VENTILATION}

If a patient has a continuous decrease in oxygenation ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ), an increase in arterial carbon dioxide levels ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ), and a persistent acidosis (decreased pH ), mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Conditions such as thoracic or abdominal surgery, drug overdose, neuromuscular disorders, inhalation injury, COPD, multiple trauma, shock, multisystem failure, and coma all may lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. The criteria for mechanical ventilation (Chart 25-11) guide the decision to place a patient on a ventilator. A patient with apnea that is not readily reversible also is a candidate for mechanical ventilation.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF VENTILATORS}

Several types of mechanical ventilators exist; they are classified according to the manner in which they support ventilation. The two general categories are negative-pressure and positive-pressure ventilators. The most common category in use today is the positivepressure ventilator.

\section*{Negative-Pressure Ventilators}

Negative-pressure ventilators exert a negative pressure on the external chest. Decreasing the intrathoracic pressure during inspiration allows air to flow into the lung, filling its volume. Physiologically, this type of assisted ventilation is similar to spontaneous ventilation. It is used mainly in chronic respiratory failure associated with neuromuscular conditions, such as poliomyelitis, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis. It is inappropriate for the unstable or complex patient or the patient whose condition requires frequent ventilatory changes. Negative-pressure ventilators are simple to use and do not require intubation of the airway; consequently, they are especially adaptable for home use.

There are several types of negative-pressure ventilators: iron lung, body wrap, and chest cuirass.

\section*{IRON LUNG (DRINKER RESPIRATOR TANK)}

The iron lung is a negative-pressure chamber used for ventilation. It was used extensively during polio epidemics in the past and currently is used by polio survivors and patients with other neuromuscular disorders.

\section*{BODY WRAP (PNEUMOWRAP) AND CHEST CUIRASS (TORTOISE SHELL)}

Both of these portable devices require a rigid cage or shell to create a negative-pressure chamber around the thorax and abdomen.

Because of problems with proper fit and system leaks, these types of ventilators are used only with carefully selected patients.

\section*{Positive-Pressure Ventilators}

Positive-pressure ventilators inflate the lungs by exerting positive pressure on the airway, similar to a bellows mechanism, forcing the alveoli to expand during inspiration. Expiration occurs passively. Endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy is necessary in most cases. These ventilators are widely used in the hospital setting and are increasingly used in the home for patients with primary lung disease. There are three types of positive-pressure ventilators, which are classified by the method of ending the inspiratory phase of respiration: pressure-cycled, time-cycled, and

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 25-1}

\section*{The Effect of Normal Saline Instillation Before Suctioning on Oxygenation Status}

Kinloch, D. (1999). Instillation of normal saline during endotracheal suctioning: effects on mixed venous oxygen saturation. American Journal of Critical Care, 8(4), 231-240.

\section*{Purpose}

Although it has been suggested that instilling normal saline into an endotracheal tube before suctioning facilitates the removal of secretions, few studies have addressed this issue using in vivo measures of patients' oxygenation status. The purpose of this study was to determine if instillation of normal saline before endotracheal suctioning improves patients' oxygenation status.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A descriptive, observational study design was used to investigate the effect of normal saline instillation (NSI) before endotracheal suctioning on mixed venous oxygen saturations. Thirty-five patients recovering from coronary artery bypass grafting were included in the study. The decision to instill normal saline into the endotracheal tube was made by the clinician caring for the patient. Patients were divided into NSI ( $\mathrm{n}=15$ ) and non-NSI groups ( $\mathrm{n}=20$ ). Patients in the NSI group received 5 mL of normal saline before endotracheal suctioning, and patients in the non-NSI group did not. A standardized suctioning protocol was used; other than NSI, suctioning procedures for both groups were identical. Baseline levels of mixed venous oxygenated
blood saturation ( $\mathrm{S} \overline{\mathrm{v}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) levels were obtained through the use of a pulmonary artery catheter at 1 -minute intervals for 5 minutes before the start of suctioning; the mean of these levels was considered the patient's baseline value. After suctioning, $\mathrm{S} \overline{\mathrm{v}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels were measured at 1 -minute intervals until they returned to baseline levels.

\section*{Findings}

The mean post-suctioning $\mathrm{S} \overline{\mathrm{v}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ level of the NSI group was significantly lower ( $p=.007$ ) than that of the non-NSI group. Further, the NSI group took an average of 3.8 minutes longer to return to baseline $\mathrm{S} \overline{\mathrm{v}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ than the non-NSI group; this difference was statistically significant ( $p=.05$ ).

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The current standard of practice for nurses is to instill normal saline before suctioning, especially if the secretions are thick and tenacious. Although the findings of this study suggest that this practice should no longer be used, the issue needs further study with a larger sample and with randomization of patients to groups. The findings of this study are relevant to nurses caring for patients requiring endotracheal suctioning.

$\mathrm{PaO}_{2}>50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ with $\mathrm{pH}<7.25$

Respiratory rate $>35 / \mathrm{min}$
volume-cycled. Another type of positive-pressure ventilator used for selected patients is noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation.

\section*{PRESSURE-CYCLED VENTILATORS}

The pressure-cycled ventilator ends inspiration when a preset pressure has been reached. In other words, the ventilator cycles on, delivers a flow of air until it reaches a predetermined pressure, then cycles off. Its major limitation is that the volume of air or oxygen can vary as the patient's airway resistance or compliance changes. As a result, the tidal volume delivered may be inconsistent, possibly compromising ventilation. Consequently, in adults, pressure-cycled ventilators are intended only for short-term use. The most common type is the IPPB machine (see previous discussion of IPPB).

\section*{TIME-CYCLED VENTILATORS}

Time-cycled ventilators terminate or control inspiration after a preset time. The volume of air the patient receives is regulated by the length of inspiration and the flow rate of the air. Most ventilators have a rate control that determines the respiratory rate, but pure time-cycling is rarely used for adults. These ventilators are used in newborns and infants.

\section*{VOLUME-CYCLED VENTILATORS}

Volume-cycled ventilators are by far the most commonly used positive-pressure ventilators today (Fig. 25-6). With this type of ventilator, the volume of air to be delivered with each inspiration is preset. Once this preset volume is delivered to the patient, the ventilator cycles off and exhalation occurs passively. From breath to breath, the volume of air delivered by the ventilator is relatively constant, ensuring consistent, adequate breaths despite varying airway pressures.

\section*{NONINVASIVE POSITIVE-PRESSURE VENTILATION}

Positive-pressure ventilation can be given via facemasks that cover the nose and mouth, nasal masks, or other nasal devices. This eliminates the need for endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy and decreases the risk for nosocomial infections such as pneumonia. The most comfortable mode for the patient is pressurecontrolled ventilation with pressure support. This eases the work of breathing and enhances gas exchange. The ventilator can be set with a minimum backup rate for patients with periods of apnea.

Patients are considered candidates for noninvasive ventilation if they have acute or chronic respiratory failure, acute pulmonary edema, COPD, or chronic heart failure with a sleep-related breathing disorder. The device also may be used at home to improve tissue oxygenation and to rest the respiratory muscles while the patient sleeps at night. It is contraindicated for those who have experienced respiratory arrest, serious dysrhythmias, cognitive impairment, or head or facial trauma. Noninvasive ventilation may also be used for patients at the end of life and those who do not want endotracheal intubation but may need short- or long-term ventilatory support (Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999).

Bilevel positive airway pressure (bi-PAP) ventilation offers independent control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures while providing pressure support ventilation. It delivers two levels of

positive airway pressure provided via a nasal or oral mask, nasal pillow, or mouthpiece with a tight seal and a portable ventilator. Each inspiration can be initiated either by the patient or by the machine if it is programmed with a backup rate. The backup rate ensures that the patient will receive a set number of breaths per minute (Perkins \& Shortall, 2000). Bi-PAP is most often used for patients who require ventilatory assistance at night, such as those with severe COPD or sleep apnea. Tolerance is variable; bi-PAP is usually most successful with highly motivated patients.

\section*{ADJUSTING THE VENTILATOR}

The ventilator is adjusted so that the patient is comfortable and breathes "in sync" with the machine. Minimal alteration of the normal cardiovascular and pulmonary dynamics is desired. Modes of mechanical ventilation are described in Figure 25-7. If the volume ventilator is adjusted appropriately, the patient's arterial blood gas values will be satisfactory and there will be little or no cardiovascular compromise. Chart 25-12 discusses how to achieve adequate mechanical ventilation for each patient.

\begin{figure}

\caption{FIGURE 25-7 Modes of mechanical ventilation with air flow waveforms.}
\end{figure}

\section*{ASSESSING THE EQUIPMENT}

The ventilator needs to be assessed to make sure that it is functioning properly and that the settings are appropriate. Even though the nurse is not primarily responsible for adjusting the settings on the ventilator or measuring ventilator parameters (usually the responsibility of the respiratory therapist), the nurse is responsible for the patient and therefore needs to evaluate how the ventilator affects the patient's overall status.

In monitoring the ventilator, the nurse should note the following:
- Type of ventilator (such as volume-cycled, pressure-cycled, negative-pressure)
- Controlling mode (such as controlled ventilation, assistcontrol ventilation, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation)
- Tidal volume and rate settings (tidal volume is usually 10 to $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$; rate is usually 12 to $16 / \mathrm{min}$ )
- $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ (fraction of inspired oxygen) setting

A Flow in the controlled ventilation mode. A preset volume of gas is delivered to the patient under positive pressure while spontaneous patient respiratory effort is "locked out."

B Gas flow in the assist/control ventilation mode. In this mode, a preset volume of gas is delivered to the patient at a preset rate, but the patient may trigger a ventilator breath with negative inspiratory effort.

C Gas flow in the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode. A preset minimum number of breaths are synchronously delivered to the patient but the patient may also take spontaneous breaths of varying volumes. Note how inspiratory and expiratory pressures differ between spontaneous and ventilator breaths.

D Airway pressure with varying levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Note that at end expiration, the airway is not allowed to return to zero. (FRC: functional residual capacity.)

E Spontaneous ventilation with continous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This ventilatory adjunct is used only with spontaneous ventilation; the patient breathes spontaneously through the ventilator at an elevated baseline pressure throughout the breathing cycle.

F Spontaneous ventilation with pressure support (PS). The patient breathes spontaneously with pressure assistance to each spontaneous inspiration.

25-12 Initial Ventilator Settings
The following guide is an example of the steps involved in operating a mechanical ventilator. The nurse, in collaboration with the respiratory therapist, always reviews the manufacturer's instructions, which vary according to the equipment, before beginning mechanical ventilation.
1. Set the machine to deliver the tidal volume required ( 10 to $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ ).
2. Adjust the machine to deliver the lowest concentration of oxygen to maintain normal $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ( 80 to 100 mm Hg ). This setting may be high initially but will gradually be reduced based on arterial blood gas results.
3. Record peak inspiratory pressure.
4. Set mode (assist-control or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation) and rate according to physician order. (See the glossary for definitions of modes of mechanical ventilation.) Set PEEP and pressure support if ordered.
5. Adjust sensitivity so that the patient can trigger the ventilator with a minimal effort (usually 2 mm Hg negative inspiratory force).
6. Record minute volume and measure carbon dioxide partial pressure $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right), \mathrm{pH}$, and $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ after 20 minutes of continuous mechanical ventilation.
7. Adjust setting ( $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ and rate) according to results of arterial blood gas analysis to provide normal values or those set by the physician.
8. If the patient suddenly becomes confused or agitated or begins bucking the ventilator for some unexplained reason, assess for hypoxia and manually ventilate on $100 \%$ oxygen with a resuscitation bag.
- Inspiratory pressure reached and pressure limit (normal is 15 to $20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$; this increases if there is increased airway resistance or decreased compliance)
- Sensitivity (a 2-cm H2O inspiratory force should trigger the ventilator)
- Inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (usually $1: 3$ [1 second of inspiration to 3 seconds of expiration] or $1: 2$ )
- Minute volume (tidal volume $\times$ respiratory rate, usually 6 to $8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ )
- Sigh settings (usually 1.5 times the tidal volume and ranging from 1 to 3 per hour), if applicable
- Water in the tubing, disconnection or kinking of the tubing
- Humidification (humidifier filled with water) and temperature
- Alarms (turned on and functioning properly)
- PEEP and/or pressure support level, if applicable. PEEP is usually 5 to $15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$

NURSING ALERT If the ventilator system malfunctions and the problem cannot be identified and corrected immediately, the nurse must ventilate the patient with a manual resuscitation bag until the problem is resolved.

\section*{PROBLEMS WITH MECHANICAL VENTILATION}

Because of the seriousness of the patient's condition and the highly complex and technical nature of mechanical ventilation, a number of problems or complications can occur. Such situations fall
into two categories: ventilator problems and patient problems. In either case, the patient must be supported while the problem is identified and corrected. Ventilator complications include cardiovascular compromise, pneumothorax, and pulmonary infection. These problems, their probable causes, and solutions are listed in Table 25-2.

\section*{BUCKING THE VENTILATOR}

The patient is "in sync" with the ventilator when thoracic expansion coincides with the inspiratory phase of the machine and exhalation occurs passively. The patient is said to fight or buck the ventilator when out of phase with the machine. This is manifested when the patient attempts to breathe out during the ventilator's mechanical inspiratory phase or when there is jerky and increased abdominal muscle effort. The following factors contribute to this problem: anxiety, hypoxia, increased secretions, hypercapnia, inadequate minute volume, and pulmonary edema. These problems must be corrected before resorting to the use of paralyzing agents to reduce bucking; otherwise, the underlying problem is simply masked and the patient's condition will continue to deteriorate.

Muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, analgesic agents, and paralyzing agents are sometimes administered to patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Their purpose is ultimately to increase the patient-machine synchrony by decreasing the patient's anxiety, hyperventilation, or excessive muscle activity. The selection and dose of the appropriate medication are determined carefully and are based on the patient's requirements and the cause of his or her restlessness. Paralyzing agents are always used as a last resort, and always in conjunction with a sedative medication.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Increasingly, patients are being cared for in extended care facilities or at home while on mechanical ventilators, with tracheostomy tubes, or on oxygen therapy. Patients receiving home ventilator care usually have chronic neuromuscular conditions or COPD.

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Caring for the patient with mechanical ventilator support at home can be accomplished successfully, but the family must be emotionally, educationally, and physically able to assume the role of primary caregiver. A home care team consisting of the nurse, physician, respiratory therapist, social service or home care agency, and equipment supplier is needed. The home is evaluated to determine if the electrical equipment needed can be operated safely. A summary of the basic assessment criteria needed for successful home care is presented in Chart 25-13.

Once the decision is made to initiate mechanical ventilation at home, the nurse prepares the patient and family for home care. It is important to teach them about the ventilator, suctioning, tracheostomy care, signs of pulmonary infection, cuff inflation and deflation, and assessment of vital signs. Teaching often begins in the hospital and continues at home. Nursing responsibilities include evaluating the patient's and family's understanding of the information presented.

The nurse teaches the family cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including mouth-to-tracheostomy tube (instead of mouth-tomouth) breathing. The nurse also explains how to handle a power failure, which usually involves converting the ventilator from an electrical power source to a battery power source. Conversion is

\section*{Criteria for Successful Home Ventilator Care}

The decision to proceed with home ventilation therapy is usually based on the following parameters.

\section*{Patient Criteria}
- The patient has chronic underlying pulmonary abnormalities.
- The patient's clinical pulmonary status is stable.
- The patient is willing to go home on mechanical ventilation.

\section*{Home Criteria}
- The home environment is conducive to care of the patient.
- The electrical facilities are adequate to operate all equipment safely.
- The home environment is controlled, without drafts in cold weather and with proper ventilation in warm weather.
- Space is available for cleaning and storing ventilator equipment.

\section*{Family Criteria}
- Family members are competent, dependable, and willing to spend the time required for proper training with available professional support.
- Family members understand the diagnosis and prognosis.
- Family has sufficient financial and supportive resources.
automatic in most types of home ventilators and lasts approximately 1 hour. The nurse instructs the family on using a manual self-inflation bag should it be necessary. Some of the patient's and family's responsibilities are listed in Chart 25-14.

Continuing Care. A home care nurse monitors and evaluates how well the patient and family are adapting to providing care in the home. The nurse also assesses the adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation as well as airway patency. The nurse addresses any unique adaptation problems the patient may have and listens to the patient's and family's anxieties and frustrations, offering support and encouragement where possible. The home care nurse helps identify and contact community resources that may assist in home management of the patient with mechanical ventilation.

The technical aspects of the ventilator are managed by vendor follow-up. A respiratory therapist usually is assigned to the patient and makes frequent home visits to evaluate the patient and perform a maintenance check of the ventilator.

Transportation services are identified should the patient require transportation in an emergency. These arrangements must be made before an emergency arises.

Providing the opportunity for ventilator-dependent patients to return home to live with their families in familiar surroundings can be a positive experience. The ultimate goal of home ventilator therapy is to enhance the patient's quality of life, not simply to support or prolong life.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT ON A VENTILATOR}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse has a vital role in assessing the patient's status and the functioning of the ventilator.

In assessing the patient, the nurse evaluates the patient's physiologic status and how he or she is coping with mechanical ventilation. Physical assessment includes systematic assessment of all body systems, with an in-depth focus on the respiratory system. Respiratory assessment includes vital signs, respiratory rate and pattern, breath sounds, evaluation of spontaneous ventilatory effort, and potential evidence of hypoxia. Increased adventitious breath sounds may indicate a need for suctioning. The nurse also evaluates the settings and functioning of the mechanical ventilator, as described previously.

Assessment also addresses the patient's neurologic status and effectiveness of coping with the need for assisted ventilation and the changes that accompany it. The nurse should assess the patient's comfort level and ability to communicate as well. Finally, weaning from mechanical ventilation requires adequate nutrition. Therefore, it is important to assess the function of the gastrointestinal system and nutritional status.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include:
- Impaired gas exchange related to underlying illness, or ventilator setting adjustment during stabilization or weaning.
- Ineffective airway clearance related to increased mucus production associated with continuous positive-pressure mechanical ventilation
- Risk for trauma and infection related to endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy
- Impaired physical mobility related to ventilator dependency
- Impaired verbal communication related to endotracheal tube and attachment to ventilator
- Defensive coping and powerlessness related to ventilator dependency

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Alterations in cardiac function
- Barotrauma (trauma to the alveoli) and pneumothorax
- Pulmonary infection
- Sepsis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include achievement of optimal gas exchange, maintenance of a patent airway, absence of trauma or infection, attainment of optimal mobility, adjustment to nonverbal methods of communication, acquisition of successful coping measures, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Nursing care of the mechanically ventilated patient requires expert technical and interpersonal skills. Nursing interventions are similar regardless of the setting; however, the frequency of interventions and the stability of the patient vary from setting to setting. Nursing interventions for the mechanically ventilated patient are not uniquely different from other pulmonary patients, but astute nursing assessment and a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship are critical. The specific interventions used by the nurse are determined by the underlying disease process and the patient's response.

Two general nursing interventions important in the care of the mechanically ventilated patient are pulmonary auscultation and interpretation of arterial blood gas measurements. The nurse is often the first to note changes in physical assessment findings or significant trends in blood gases that signal the development of a
serious problem (eg, pneumothorax, tube displacement, pulmonary embolus).

\section*{ENHANCING GAS EXCHANGE}

The purpose of mechanical ventilation is to optimize gas exchange by maintaining alveolar ventilation and oxygen delivery. The alteration in gas exchange may be due to the underlying illness or to mechanical factors related to the adjustment of the machine to the patient. The health care team, including the nurse, physician, and respiratory therapist, continually assesses the patient for adequate gas exchange, signs and symptoms of hypoxia, and response to treatment. Thus, the nursing diagnosis impaired gas exchange is, by its complex nature, multidisciplinary and collaborative. The team members must share goals and information freely. All other goals directly or indirectly relate to this primary goal.

Nursing interventions to promote optimal gas exchange include judicious administration of analgesic agents to relieve pain without suppressing the respiratory drive and frequent repositioning to diminish the pulmonary effects of immobility. The nurse also monitors for adequate fluid balance by assessing for the presence of peripheral edema, calculating daily intake and output, and monitoring daily weights. The nurse administers medications prescribed to control the primary disease and monitors for their side effects.

\section*{PROMOTING EFFECTIVE AIRWAY CLEARANCE}

Continuous positive-pressure ventilation increases the production of secretions regardless of the patient's underlying condition. The nurse assesses for the presence of secretions by lung auscultation at least every 2 to 4 hours. Measures to clear the airway of secretions include suctioning, chest physiotherapy, frequent position changes, and increased mobility as soon as possible. Frequency of suctioning should be determined by patient assessment. If excessive secretions are identified by inspection or auscultation techniques, suctioning should be performed. Sputum is not produced continuously or every 1 to 2 hours but as a response to a pathologic condition. Therefore, there is no rationale for routine suctioning of all patients every 1 to 2 hours. Although suctioning is used to aid in the clearance of secretions, it can damage the airway mucosa and impair cilia action (Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999).

The sigh mechanism on the ventilator may be adjusted to deliver at least one to three sighs per hour at 1.5 times the tidal volume if the patient is on assist-control. Because of the risk of hyperventilation and trauma to pulmonary tissue from excess ventilator pressure (barotrauma, pneumothorax), this feature is not being used as frequently today. If the patient is on the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode, the mandatory ventilations act as sighs because they are of greater volume than the patient's spontaneous breaths. Periodic sighing prevents atelectasis and the further retention of secretions.

Humidification of the airway via the ventilator is maintained to help liquefy secretions so they are more easily removed. Bronchodilators are administered to dilate the bronchioles and are classified as adrenergic or anticholinergic. Adrenergic bronchodilators are mostly inhaled and work by stimulating the betareceptor sites, mimicking the effects of epinephrine in the body. The desired effect is smooth muscle relaxation, thus dilating the constricted bronchial tubes. Medications include albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), isoetharine (Bronkosol), isoproterenol (Isuprel), metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), pirbuterol acetate (Maxair), salmeterol (Serevent), and terbutaline (Brethine, Brethaire, Bricanyl). Tachycardia, heart palpitations, and tremors are side effects that have been reported with use of these medications (Zang \& Allender, 1999). Anticholinergic bronchodilators
such as ipratropium (Atrovent) and ipratropium with albuterol (Combivent) produce airway relaxation by blocking cholinergicinduced bronchoconstriction. Patients receiving bronchodilator therapy of either type should be monitored for adverse effects including dizziness, nausea, decreased oxygen saturation, hypokalemia, increased heart rate, and urine retention. Mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) are administered as prescribed to liquefy secretions so that they are more easily mobilized. Nursing management of patients receiving mucolytic therapy includes assessment for an adequate cough reflex, sputum characteristics, and improvement in incentive spirometry (McKenry \& Salerno, 2001). Side effects include nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, stomatitis (oral ulcers), urticaria, and runny nose (LeFever \& Hayes, 2000).

\section*{PREVENTING TRAUMA AND INFECTION}

Airway management must involve maintaining the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The nurse positions the ventilator tubing so that there is minimal pulling or distortion of the tube in the trachea; this reduces the risk of trauma to the trachea. Cuff pressure is monitored every 8 hours to maintain the pressure at less than 25 cm H 2 O . The nurse evaluates for the presence of a cuff leak at the same time.

Patients with endotracheal intubation or a tracheostomy tube do not have the normal defenses of the upper airway. In addition, these patients frequently have multiple additional body system disturbances that lead to immunocompromise. Tracheostomy care is performed at least every 8 hours, and more frequently if needed, because of the increased risk of infection. The ventilator circuit and in-line suction tubing is replaced periodically, according to infection control guidelines, to decrease the risk of infection.

The nurse administers oral hygiene frequently because the oral cavity is a primary source of contamination of the lungs in the intubated and compromised patient. The presence of a nasogastric tube in the intubated patient can increase the risk for aspiration, leading to nosocomial pneumonia. The nurse positions the patient with the head elevated above the stomach as much as possible. Antiulcer medications such as sucralfate (Carafate) are given to maintain normal gastric pH ; research has demonstrated a lower incidence of aspiration pneumonia when sucralfate is administered (Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999).

\section*{PROMOTING OPTIMAL LEVEL OF MOBILITY}

The patient's mobility is limited because he or she is connected to the ventilator. The nurse should assist a patient whose condition has become stable to get out of bed and to a chair as soon as possible. Mobility and muscle activity are beneficial because they stimulate respirations and improve morale. If the patient cannot get out of bed, the nurse encourages the patient to perform active range-of-motion exercises every 6 to 8 hours. If the patient cannot perform these exercises, the nurse performs passive range-ofmotion exercises every 8 hours to prevent contractures and venous stasis.

\section*{PROMOTING OPTIMAL COMMUNICATION}

It is important to develop alternative methods of communication for the patient on a ventilator. The nurse assesses the patient's communication abilities to evaluate for limitations. Questions to consider when assessing the ventilator-dependent patient's ability to communicate include the following:
- Is the patient conscious and able to communicate? Can the patient nod or shake the head?
- Is the patient's mouth unobstructed by the tube so that words can be mouthed?
- Is the patient's hand strong and available for writing? (For example, if the patient is right-handed, the intravenous line is placed in the left arm if possible so that the right hand is free.)
Once the patient's limitations are known, the nurse offers several appropriate communication approaches: lip reading (use single key words), pad and pencil or Magic Slate, communication board, gesturing, or electric larynx. Use of a "talking" or fenestrated tracheostomy tube may be suggested to the physician; this allows the patient to talk while on the ventilator. If indicated, the nurse should make sure that the patient's eyeglasses and hearing aid and a translator are available to enhance the patient's ability to communicate.

The patient must be assisted to find the most suitable communication method. Some methods may be frustrating to the patient, family, and nurse; these need to be identified and minimized. A speech therapist can assist in determining the most appropriate method.

\section*{PROMOTING COPING ABILITY}

Dependence on a ventilator is frightening to both the patient and family and disrupts even the most stable families. Encouraging the family to verbalize their feelings about the ventilator, the patient's condition, and the environment in general is beneficial. Explaining procedures every time they are performed helps to reduce anxiety and familiarizes the patient with ventilator procedures. To restore a sense of control, the nurse encourages the patient to participate in decisions about care, schedules, and treatment when possible. The patient may become withdrawn or depressed while on mechanical ventilation, especially if its use is prolonged. To promote effective coping, the nurse informs the patient about progress when appropriate. It is important to provide diversions such as watching television, playing music, or taking a walk (if appropriate and possible). Stress reduction techniques (eg, a backrub, relaxation measures) help relieve tension and help the patient to deal with anxieties and fears about both the condition and the dependence on the ventilator.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS

\section*{Alterations in Cardiac Function}

Alterations in cardiac output may occur as a result of positivepressure ventilation. The positive intrathoracic pressure during inspiration compresses the heart and great vessels, thereby reducing venous return and cardiac output. This is usually corrected during exhalation when the positive pressure is off. Patients may have decreased cardiac output and resultant decreased tissue perfusion and oxygenation.

To evaluate cardiac function, the nurse first looks for signs and symptoms of hypoxia (restlessness, apprehension, confusion, tachycardia, tachypnea, labored breathing, pallor progressing to cyanosis, diaphoresis, transient hypertension, and decreased urine output). If a pulmonary artery catheter is in place, cardiac output, cardiac index, and other hemodynamic values can be used to assess the patient's status.

\section*{Barotrauma and Pneumothorax}

Excessive positive pressure may cause barotrauma, which results in a spontaneous pneumothorax. This may quickly develop into a tension pneumothorax, further compromising venous return,
cardiac output, and blood pressure. The nurse should consider any sudden onset of changes in oxygen saturation or respiratory distress to be a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate action.

\section*{Pulmonary Infection}

The patient is at high risk for infection, as described above. The nurse should report fever or a change in the color or odor of sputum to the physician for follow-up.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Exhibits adequate gas exchange, as evidenced by normal breath sounds, acceptable arterial blood gas levels, and vital signs
2. Demonstrates adequate ventilation with minimal mucus accumulation
3. Is free of injury or infection, as evidenced by normal temperature and white blood count
4. Is mobile within limits of ability
a. Gets out of bed to chair, bears weight, or ambulates as soon as possible
b. Performs range-of-motion exercises every 6 to 8 hours
5. Communicates effectively through written messages, gestures, or other communication strategies
6. Copes effectively
a. Verbalizes fears and concerns about condition and equipment
b. Participates in decision making when possible
c. Uses stress reduction techniques when necessary
7. Absence of complications
a. Absence of cardiac compromise, as evidenced by stable vital signs and adequate urine output
b. Absence of pneumothorax, as evidenced by bilateral chest excursion, normal chest x-ray, and adequate oxygenation
c. Absence of pulmonary infection, as evidenced by normal temperature, clear pulmonary secretions, and negative sputum cultures

\section*{WEANING THE PATIENT FROM THE VENTILATOR}

Respiratory weaning, the process of withdrawing the patient from dependence on the ventilator, takes place in three stages: the patient is gradually removed from the ventilator, then from the tube, and finally from oxygen. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is performed at the earliest possible time consistent with patient safety. The decision must be made from a physiologic rather than from a mechanical viewpoint. A thorough understanding of the patient's clinical status is required in making this decision. Weaning is started when the patient is recovering from the acute stage of medical and surgical problems and when the cause of respiratory failure is sufficiently reversed.

Successful weaning involves collaboration among the physician, respiratory therapist, and nurse. Each health care provider must understand the scope and function of other team members in relation to patient weaning to conserve the patient's strength, use resources efficiently, and maximize successful outcomes.

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 25-2}

\section*{Early Versus Late Tracheostomy Decannulation}

Clini, E., Vitacca, M., Bianchi, L., Porta, R., \& Ambrosino, N. (1999). Long-term tracheostomy in severe COPD patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. Respiratory Care, 44(4), 241-244.

\section*{Purpose}

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who require mechanical ventilation for management of acute respiratory failure are at risk for relapse. It is not known if patients with spontaneous respirations would benefit from retaining a tracheostomy after discharge from the intensive care unit. This study was conducted to determine the effects of maintaining a tracheal cannula in spontaneously breathing patients following discharge.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Investigators studied 20 patients with severe COPD who were undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation. The researchers used a prospective, randomized, and controlled design to measure tracheal cannula use in two groups of patients: 10 patients had the tracheal cannula removed, and 10 did not. Breathing pattern, forced lung volumes, respiratory muscle strength, and arterial blood gases were evaluated in patients at hospital discharge and at 1,3 , and 6 months after discharge. Investigators measured breathing patterns and forced lung volumes with a portable spirometer and assessed respiratory muscle strength by measuring maximal inspiratory pressure. They also recorded number
of hospital days, mortality rate, and number of new exacerbations requiring antibiotics.

\section*{Results}

No significant differences were found between the two groups with regard to breathing patterns, forced lung volumes, respiratory strength, or arterial blood gases. In both groups, 2 of the 10 patients ( $20 \%$ ) died due to respiratory causes. During the follow-up period, exacerbations were significantly greater in the patients with tracheostomies than in those whose tracheostomies had been removed ( $p<.005$ ).

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings of this study suggest that retaining a chronic tracheostomy following weaning from mechanical ventilation in patients with COPD is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events, including exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. Although there were no significant findings with regard to breathing pattern, forced lung volumes, respiratory muscle strength, and arterial blood gases, the patient population was small, thus necessitating further study. The results suggest that clinics should consider early decannulation in COPD patients weaned from mechanical ventilation.

\section*{Criteria for Weaning}

Careful assessment is required to determine whether the patient is ready to be removed from mechanical ventilation. If the patient is stable and showing signs of improvement or reversal of the disease or condition that caused the need for mechanical ventilation, weaning indices should be assessed. These indices include:
- Vital capacity: the amount of air expired after maximum inspiration. Used to assess the patient's ability to take deep breaths. Vital capacity should be 10 to $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ to meet the criteria for weaning.
- Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP): used to assess the patient's respiratory muscle strength. It is also known as negative inspiratory pressure and should be at least $-20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
- Tidal volume: volume of air that is inhaled or exhaled from the lungs during an effortless breath. It is normally 7 to $9 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$.
- Minute ventilation: equal to the respiratory rate multiplied by tidal volume. Normal is about $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$.
- Rapid/shallow breathing index: used to assess the breathing pattern and is calculated by dividing the respiratory rate by tidal volume. Patients with indices below 100 breaths $/ \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{L}$ are more likely to be successful at weaning.
Other measurements used to assess readiness for weaning include a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of greater than 60 mm Hg with an $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ of less than $40 \%$. Stable vital signs and arterial blood gases are also important predictors of successful weaning. Once readiness has been determined, the nurse records baseline measurements of weaning indices to monitor progress (Cull \& Inwood, 1999).

\section*{Patient Preparation}

To maximize the chances of success of weaning, the nurse must consider the patient as a whole, taking into account factors that impair the delivery of oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide
as well as those that increase oxygen demand (sepsis, seizures, thyroid imbalances) or decrease the patient's overall strength (nutrition, neuromuscular disease). Adequate psychological preparation is necessary before and during the weaning process. Patients need to know what is expected of them during the procedure. They are often frightened by having to breathe on their own again and need reassurance that they are improving and are well enough to handle spontaneous breathing. The nurse explains what will happen during weaning and what role the patient will play in the procedure. The nurse emphasizes that someone will be with or near the patient at all times, and answers any questions simply and concisely. Proper preparation of the patient can reduce the weaning time.

\section*{Methods of Weaning}

Considerable effort has been devoted to finding the best method of weaning from mechanical ventilation, but research has not established which method is best (Tasota \& Dobbin, 2000). Success depends on the combination of adequate patient preparation, available equipment, and an interdisciplinary approach to solving patient problems (Chart 25-15). The most common weaning methods in use today are described below.

Assist-control may be used as the resting mode for patients undergoing weaning trials. This mode provides full ventilatory support by delivering a preset tidal volume and respiratory rate; if the patient takes a breath, the ventilator delivers the preset volume. The cycle does not adapt to the patient's spontaneous efforts. The nurse assesses patients being weaned on this mode for the following signs of distress: rapid shallow breathing, use of accessory muscles, reduced level of consciousness, increase in carbon dioxide levels, decrease in oxygen saturations, and tachycardia.

The patient on intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) can increase the respiratory rate, but each spontaneous breath receives only the tidal volume the patient generates. Mechanical breaths

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}
1. Assess patient for weaning criteria: Vital capacity- 10 to $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) at least $-20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ Tidal volume- 7 to $9 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ Minute ventilation- $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ Rapid/shallow breathing index-below 100 breaths/minute/L $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ greater than 60 mm Hg with $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ less than $40 \%$
2. Monitor activity level, assess dietary intake, and monitor results of laboratory tests of nutritional status.
3. Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the weaning process and address any concerns about the process. Explain that the patient may feel short of breath initially and provide encouragement as needed. Reassure the patient that he or she will be attended closely and that if the weaning attempt is not successful, it can be tried again later.
4. Implement the weaning method prescribed: A/C, IMV, SIMV, PSV, PAV, CPAP, or T-piece.
5. Monitor vital signs, pulse oximetry, ECG, and respiratory pattern constantly for the first 20 to 30 minutes and every 5 minutes after that until weaning is complete.
6. Maintain a patent airway; monitor arterial blood gas levels and pulmonary function tests. Suction the airway as needed.
7. In collaboration with the physician, terminate the weaning process if adverse reactions occur. These include a heart rate increase of 20 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$, systolic blood pressure increase of 20 mm Hg , a decrease in oxygen saturation to less than $90 \%$, respiratory rate less than 8 or greater than 20 breaths/minute, ventricular dysrhythmias, fatigue, panic, cyanosis, erratic or labored breathing, paradoxical chest movement.
8. If the weaning process continues, measure tidal volume and minute ventilation every 20 to 30 minutes; compare with the patient's desired values, which have been determined in collaboration with the physician.
9. Assess for psychological dependence if the physiologic parameters indicate weaning is feasible and the patient still resists.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. Careful assessment of multiple weaning indices helps to determine readiness for weaning. When the criteria have been met, the patient's likelihood of successful weaning increases.
2. Reestablishing independent spontaneous ventilation can be physically exhausting. It is crucial that the patient have enough energy reserves to succeed. Providing periods of rest and recommended nutritional intake can increase the likelihood of successful weaning.
3. The weaning process can be psychologically tiring; emotional support can help promote a sense of security. Explaining that weaning will be attempted again later helps reduce the sense of failure if the first attempts are unsuccessful.
4. The prescribed weaning method should reflect the patient's individualized criteria for weaning and weaning history. By having different methods to choose from, the physician can select the one that best fits the patient.
5. Monitoring the patient closely provides ongoing indications of success or failure.
6. These values can be compared to baseline measurements to evaluate weaning. Suctioning helps to reduce the risk of aspiration and maintain the airway.
7. These signs and symptoms indicate an unstable patient at risk for hypoxia and ventricular dysrhythmias. Continuing the weaning process can lead to cardiopulmonary arrest.
8. These values help to determine if weaning is successful and should be continued.
9. Psychological dependence is a common problem after mechanical ventilation. Possible causes include fear of dying and depression from chronic illness. It is important to address this issue before the next weaning attempt.
are delivered at preset intervals and a preselected tidal volume, regardless of the patient's efforts. IMV allows patients to use their own muscles of ventilation to help prevent muscle atrophy. IMV lowers mean airway pressure, which can assist in preventing barotrauma.

Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) delivers a preset tidal volume and number of breaths per minute. Between ventilator-delivered breaths, the patient can breathe spontaneously with no assistance from the ventilator on those extra breaths. As the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously increases, the preset number of ventilator breaths is decreased and the patient does more of the work of breathing. SIMV is indicated if the patient satisfies all the criteria for weaning but cannot sustain adequate spontaneous ventilation for long periods.

IMV and SIMV can be used to provide full or partial ventilatory support. Nursing interventions for both of these include
monitoring progress by recording respiratory rate, minute volume, spontaneous and machine-generated tidal volume, $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$, and arterial blood gas levels.

The pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode assists SIMV by applying a pressure plateau to the airway throughout the patienttriggered inspiration to decrease resistance by the tracheal tube and ventilator tubing. Pressure support is reduced gradually as the patient's strength increases. A SIMV backup rate may be added for extra support. The nurse must closely observe the patient's respiratory rate and tidal volumes on initiation of PSV. It may be necessary to adjust the pressure support to avoid tachypnea or large tidal volumes.

The proportional assist ventilation (PAV) mode of partial ventilatory support allows the ventilator to generate pressure in proportion to the patient's efforts. With every breath, the ventilator synchronizes with the patient's ventilatory efforts (Giannouli,

Webster, Roberts \& Younes, 1999). Nursing assessment should include careful monitoring of the patient's respiratory rate, arterial blood gases, tidal volume, minute ventilation, and breathing pattern.

The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode allows the patient to breathe spontaneously, while applying positive pressure throughout the respiratory cycle to keep the alveoli open and promote oxygenation. Providing CPAP during spontaneous breathing also offers the advantage of an alarm system and may reduce patient anxiety if the patient has been taught that the machine is keeping track of breathing. It also maintains lung volumes and improves the patient's oxygenation status. CPAP is often used in conjunction with PSV. Nurses should carefully assess for tachypnea, tachycardia, reduced tidal volumes, decreasing oxygen saturations, and increasing carbon dioxide levels.

Weaning trials using a T -piece or tracheostomy mask (see Fig. 25-2) are normally conducted with the patient disconnected from the ventilator, receiving humidified oxygen only, and performing all work of breathing. Patients who do not have to overcome the resistance of the ventilator may find this mode more comfortable, or they may become anxious as they breathe with no support from the ventilator. During T -piece trials, the nurse monitors the patient closely and provides encouragement. This method of weaning is usually used when the patient is awake and alert, is breathing without difficulty, has good gag and cough reflexes, and is hemodynamically stable. During the weaning process, the patient is maintained on the same or a higher oxygen concentration than when on the ventilator. While on the T-piece, the patient should be observed for signs and symptoms of hypoxia, increasing respiratory muscle fatigue, or systemic fatigue. These include restlessness, increased respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths $/ \mathrm{min}$, use of accessory muscles, tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, and paradoxical chest movement (asynchronous breathing, chest contraction during inspiration and expansion during expiration). Fatigue or exhaustion is initially manifested by an increased respiratory rate associated with a gradual reduction in tidal volume; later there is a slowing of the respiratory rate.

If the patient appears to be tolerating the T-piece trial, a second set of arterial blood gas measurements is drawn 20 minutes after the patient has been on spontaneous ventilation at a constant $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ pressure support ventilation. (Alveolar-arterial equilibration takes 15 to 20 minutes to occur.)

Signs of exhaustion and hypoxia correlated with deterioration in the blood gas measurements indicate the need for ventilatory support. The patient is placed back on the ventilator each time signs of fatigue or deterioration develop.

If clinically stable, the patient usually can be extubated within 2 or 3 hours of weaning and allowed spontaneous ventilation by means of a mask with humidified oxygen. Patients who have had prolonged ventilatory assistance usually require more gradual weaning; it may take days or even weeks. They are weaned primarily during the day and placed back on the ventilator at night to rest.

Because patients respond in different manners to the various weaning methods, there is no definitive way to assess which method is best. With all of the methods, ongoing assessment of respiratory status is essential to monitor patient progress (Woodruff, 1999).

Successful weaning from the ventilator is supplemented by intensive pulmonary care. The following are continued:
- Oxygen therapy
- Arterial blood gas evaluation
- Pulse oximetry
- Bronchodilator therapy
- Chest physiotherapy
- Adequate nutrition, hydration, and humidification
- Incentive spirometry

These patients still have borderline pulmonary function and need vigorous supportive therapy before their respiratory status returns to a level that supports activities of daily living.

\section*{Weaning From the Tube}

Weaning from the tube is considered when the patient can breathe spontaneously, maintain an adequate airway by effectively coughing up secretions, swallow, and move the jaw. If frequent suctioning is needed to clear secretions, tube weaning may be unsuccessful (Ecklund, 1999). Secretion clearance and aspiration risks are assessed to determine if active pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are intact.

Once the patient can clear secretions adequately, a trial period of mouth breathing or nose breathing is conducted. This can be accomplished by several methods. The first method requires changing to a smaller size tube to increase the resistance to airflow and simultaneously plugging the tracheostomy tube (deflating the cuff). The smaller tube is sometimes replaced by a cuffless tracheostomy tube, which allows the tube to be plugged at lengthening intervals to monitor patient progress. A second method involves changing to a fenestrated tube (a tube with an opening or window in its bend). This permits air to flow around and through the tube to the upper airway and enables talking. A third method involves switching to a smaller tracheostomy button (stoma button). A tracheostomy button is a plastic tube approximately 1 inch long that helps to keep the windpipe open after the larger tracheostomy tube has been removed. Finally, when the patient demonstrates the ability to maintain a patent airway without a tracheostomy tube, the tube can be removed. An occlusive dressing is placed over the stoma, which usually heals anywhere from several days to many weeks (Ecklund, 1999).

\section*{Weaning From Oxygen}

The patient who has been successfully weaned from the ventilator, cuff, and tube and has adequate respiratory function is then weaned from oxygen. The $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ is gradually reduced until the $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is in the range of 70 to 100 mm Hg while the patient is breathing room air. If the $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is less than 70 mm Hg on room air, supplemental oxygen is recommended. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, formerly the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), requires that the patient's $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ on room air be less than 55 mm Hg for the patient to be eligible for financial reimbursement for in-home oxygen.

\section*{Nutrition}

Success in weaning the long-term ventilator-dependent patient requires early and aggressive but judicious nutritional support. The respiratory muscles (diaphragm and especially intercostals) become weak or atrophied after just a few days of mechanical ventilation, especially if nutrition is inadequate. Fat kilocalories produce less carbon dioxide than carbohydrate kilocalories. For this reason, a high-fat diet may assist patients with respiratory failure who are being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Research is being conducted on the role of fatty acids in lung disease (Schwartz,
2000). A high-fat diet may provide as much as $50 \%$ of the total daily kilocalories. Adequate protein intake is important in increasing respiratory muscle strength. Protein intake should be approximately 25\% of total daily kilocalories, or 1.2 to $1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Because a high-carbohydrate diet can lead to increased carbon dioxide production and retention, total carbohydrate intake should not exceed $25 \%$ of total daily kilocalories, or $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day in patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Care must be taken not to overfeed patients because excessive intake can raise the demand for oxygen and the production of carbon dioxide. Total daily kilocalories should be closely monitored (Lutz \& Prytulski, 2001).

Soon after the patient is admitted, a consultation with a dietitian or nutrition support team should be arranged to plan the best form of nutritional replacement. Adequate nutrition may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and prevent other complications, especially sepsis. Sepsis can occur if bacteria enter the bloodstream and release toxins that, in turn, cause vasodilation and hypotension, fever, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, and coma. Aggressive treatment of sepsis is essential to reverse this threat to survival and to promote weaning from the ventilator when the patient's condition improves. Optimal nutritional intake is an essential part of the treatment of sepsis.

\section*{The Patient Undergoing Thoracic Surgery}

Assessment and management are particularly important in the patient undergoing thoracic surgery. Frequently, patients undergoing such surgery also have obstructive pulmonary disease with compromised breathing. Preoperative preparation and careful postoperative management are crucial for successful patient outcomes because these patients may have a narrow range between their physical tolerance for certain activities and their limitations, which, if exceeded, can lead to distress. Various types of thoracic surgical procedures are performed to relieve disease conditions such as lung abscesses, lung cancer, cysts, and benign tumors (Chart 25-16). An exploratory thoracotomy (creation of a surgical opening into the thoracic cavity) may be performed to diagnose lung or chest disease. A biopsy may be performed in this procedure with a small amount of lung tissue removed for analysis; the chest incision is then closed.

The objectives of preoperative care for the patient undergoing thoracic surgery are to ascertain the patient's functional reserve to determine if the patient can survive the surgery and to ensure that the patient is in optimal condition for surgery.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The nurse performs chest auscultation to assess breath sounds in the different regions of the lungs (see Chap. 21). It is important to note if breath sounds are normal, indicating a free flow of air in and out of the lungs. (In the patient with emphysema, the breath sounds may be markedly decreased or even absent on auscultation.) The nurse notes crackles and wheezes and assesses for hyperresonance and decreased diaphragmatic motion. Unilateral diminished breath sounds and rhonchi can be the result of occlusion of the bronchi by mucus plugs. The nurse assesses for retained secretions during auscultation by asking the patient to cough. It is important to note any signs of rhonchi or wheezing.

The patient history and assessment should include the following questions:
- What signs and symptoms are present (cough, sputum expectorated [amount and color], hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea)?
- If there is a smoking history, how long has the patient smoked? Does the patient smoke currently? How many packs a day?
- What is the patient's cardiopulmonary tolerance while resting, eating, bathing, and walking?
- What is the patient's breathing pattern? How much exertion is required to produce dyspnea?
- Does the patient need to sleep in an upright position or with more than two pillows?
- What is the patient's physiologic status (eg, general appearance, mental alertness, behavior, nutritional status)?
- What other medical conditions exist (eg, allergies, cardiac disorders, diabetes)?

A number of tests are performed to determine the patient's preoperative status and to assess the patient's physical assets and limitations. Many patients are seen by their surgeons in the office, and many tests and examinations are performed on an outpatient basis. The decision to perform any pulmonary resection is based on the patient's cardiovascular status and pulmonary reserve. Pulmonary function studies (especially lung volume and vital capacity) are performed to determine whether the planned resection will leave sufficient functioning lung tissue. Arterial blood gas values are assessed to provide a more complete picture of the functional capacity of the lung. Exercise tolerance tests are useful to determine if the patient who is a candidate for pneumonectomy can tolerate removal of one of the lungs.

Preoperative studies are performed to provide a baseline for comparison during the postoperative period and to detect any unsuspected abnormalities. These studies may include a bronchoscopic examination (a lighted scope is inserted into the airways to examine the bronchi), chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (for arteriosclerotic heart disease, conduction defects), nutritional assessment, determination of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine (renal function), glucose tolerance or blood glucose (diabetes), assessment of serum electrolytes and protein levels, blood volume determinations, and complete blood cell count.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE NURSING MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Improving Airway Clearance}

The underlying lung condition often is associated with increased respiratory secretions. Before surgery, the airway is cleared of secretions to reduce the possibility of postoperative atelectasis or infection. Risk factors for postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia are listed in Chart 25-17. Strategies to reduce the risk for atelectasis and infection include humidification, postural drainage, and chest percussion after bronchodilators are administered, if prescribed. The nurse estimates the volume of sputum if the patient expectorates large amounts of secretions. Such measurements are carried out to determine if and when the amount decreases. Antibiotics are administered as prescribed for infection, which may be causing the excessive secretions.

\section*{Thoracic Surgeries and Procedures}

Pneumonectomy
The removal of an entire lung (pneumonectomy) is performed chiefly for cancer when the lesion cannot be removed by a less extensive procedure. It also may be performed for lung abscesses, bronchiectasis, or extensive unilateral tuberculosis. The removal of the right lung is more dangerous than the removal of the left, because the right lung has a larger vascular bed and its removal imposes a greater physiologic burden.

A posterolateral or anterolateral thoracotomy incision is made, sometimes with resection of a rib. The pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins are ligated and severed. The main bronchus is divided and the lung removed. The bronchial stump is stapled, and usually no drains are used because the accumulation of fluid in the empty hemithorax prevents mediastinal shift.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-145.jpg?height=570&width=832&top_left_y=865&top_left_x=232}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Pneumonectomy}
\end{figure}

\section*{Lobectomy}

When the pathology is limited to one area of a lung, a lobectomy (removal of a lobe of a lung) is performed. Lobectomy, which is more common than pneumonectomy, may be carried out for bronchogenic carcinoma, giant emphysematous blebs or bullae, benign tumors, metastatic malignant tumors, bronchiectasis, and fungus infections.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-145.jpg?height=551&width=832&top_left_y=1845&top_left_x=229}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Lobectomy}
\end{figure}

The surgeon makes a thoracotomy incision: its exact location depends on the lobe to be resected. When the pleural space is entered, the involved lung collapses and the lobar vessels and the bronchus are ligated and divided. After the lobe is removed, the remaining lobes of the lung are reexpanded. Usually, two chest catheters are inserted for drainage. The upper tube is for air removal; the lower one is for fluid drainage. Sometimes, only one catheter is needed. The chest tube is connected to a chest drainage apparatus for several days.

\section*{Segmentectomy (Segmental Resection)}

Some lesions are located in only one segment of the lung. Bronchopulmonary segments are subdivisions of the lung that function as individual units. They are held together by delicate connective tissue. Disease processes may be limited to a single segment. Care is used to preserve as much healthy and functional lung tissue as possible, especially in patients who already have limited cardiopulmonary reserve. Single segments can be removed from any lobe; the right middle lobe, which has only two small segments, invariably is removed entirely. On the left side, corresponding to a middle lobe, is a "lingular" segment of the upper lobe. This can be removed as a single segment or by lingulectomy. This segment frequently is involved in bronchiectasis.

\section*{Wedge Resection}

A wedge resection of a small, well-circumscribed lesion may be performed without regard for the location of the intersegmental planes. The pleural cavity usually is drained because of the possibility of an air or blood leak. This procedure is performed for diagnostic lung biopsy and for the excision of small peripheral nodules.

\section*{Bronchoplastic or Sleeve Resection}

Bronchoplastic resection is a procedure in which only one lobar bronchus, together with a part of the right or left bronchus, is excised. The distal bronchus is reanastomosed to the proximal bronchus or trachea.

\section*{Lung Volume Reduction}

Lung volume reduction is a surgical procedure involving the removal of $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of a patient's lung through a midsternal incision or video thoracoscopy. The diseased lung tissue is identified on a lung perfusion scan. Although some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have reported an improvement in the quality of their lives for at least 6 months to 1 year after the surgery, results have generally been disappointing. Research is ongoing to examine the benefits of lung volume reduction surgery using video thoracoscopy (Baker \& Flynn, 1999; National Institutes of Health, 2001).

\section*{Video Thoracoscopy}

A video thoracoscopy is an endoscopic procedure that allows the surgeon to look into the thorax without making a large incision. The procedure is performed to obtain specimens of tissue for biopsy, to treat recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, and to diagnose either pleural effusions or pleural masses. Thoracoscopy has also been found to be an effective diagnostic and therapeutic alternative for the treatment of mediastinal disorders (Cirino et al., 2000). Some advantages of video thoracoscopy include rapid diagnosis and treatment of some conditions, a decrease in postoperative complications, and a shortened hospital stay (see Chap. 21).

\section*{Teaching the Patient}

Increasingly, patients are admitted on the day of surgery, which does not provide much time for the acute care nurse to talk with the patient. Nurses in all settings must take an active role in educating the patient and relieving anxiety. The nurse informs the patient what to expect, from administration of anesthesia to thoracotomy and the likely use of chest tubes and a drainage system in the postoperative period. The patient is also informed about the usual postoperative administration of oxygen to facilitate breathing, and the possible use of a ventilator. It is essential to explain the importance of frequent turning to promote drainage of lung secretions. Instruction in the use of incentive spirometry begins before surgery to familiarize the patient with its correct use. The nurse should teach diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing, and the patient should begin practicing these techniques (see Chart 25-3, "Breathing Exercises," and Chart 25-4, "Assisting the Patient to Perform Incentive Spirometry").

Because a coughing schedule will be necessary in the postoperative period to promote the clearance or removal of secretions, the nurse instructs the patient in the technique of coughing and warns the patient that the coughing routine may be uncomfortable. The nurse teaches the patient to splint the incision with the hands, a pillow, or a folded towel (see Chart 25-5).

Another technique, "huffing," may be helpful for the patient with diminished expiratory flow rates or for the patient who refuses to cough because of severe pain. Huffing is the expulsion of air through an open glottis. This type of forced expiration technique (FET) stimulates pulmonary expansion and assists in alveolar inflation. The nurse instructs the patient as follows:
- Take a deep diaphragmatic breath and exhale forcefully against your hand in a quick, distinct pant, or huff.
- Practice doing small huffs and progress to one strong huff during exhalation.

Patients should be informed preoperatively that blood and other fluids may be administered, oxygen will be administered, and vital signs will be checked often for several hours after surgery. If a chest tube is needed, the patient should be informed that it will drain the fluid and air that normally accumulate after chest surgery. The patient and family are informed that the patient may be admitted to the intensive care unit for 1 to 2 days after surgery, that the patient may experience pain at the incision site, and that medication is available to relieve pain and discomfort (Finkelmeier, 2000).

\section*{Relieving Anxiety}

The nurse listens to the patient to evaluate his or her feelings about the illness and proposed treatment. The nurse also determines the patient's motivation to return to normal or baseline function. The patient may reveal significant concerns: fear of hemorrhage because of bloody sputum, fear of discomfort from a chronic cough and chest pain, fear of ventilator dependence, or fear of death because of dyspnea and the underlying disease (eg, tumor).

The nurse helps the patient to overcome these fears and to cope with the stress of surgery by correcting any misconceptions, supporting the patient's decision to undergo surgery, reassuring the patient that the incision will "hold," and dealing honestly with questions about pain and discomfort and their treatment. The management and control of pain begin before surgery, when the nurse informs the patient that many postoperative problems can be overcome by following certain routines related to deep breathing, coughing, turning, and moving. If patient-controlled analgesia or epidural analgesia is to be used after surgery, the nurse instructs the patient in its use.

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

After surgery the vital signs are checked frequently. Oxygen is administered by a mechanical ventilator, nasal cannula, or mask for as long as necessary. A reduction in lung capacity requires a period of physiologic adjustment, and fluids may be given at a low hourly rate to prevent fluid overload and pulmonary edema. When the patient is conscious and the vital signs have stabilized, the head of the bed may be elevated 30 to 45 degrees. Careful positioning of the patient is important. Following pneumonectomy, a patient is usually turned every hour from the back to the operative side and should not be completely turned to the unoperated side. This allows the fluid left in the space to consolidate and prevents the remaining lung and the heart from shifting (mediastinal shift) toward the operative side. The patient with a lobectomy may be turned to either side, and a patient with a segmental resection usually is not turned onto the operative side unless the surgeon prescribes this position (Finkelmeier, 2000).

Medication for pain is needed for several days after surgery. Because coughing can be painful, patients should be taught to splint the chest. Exercises are resumed early in the postoperative
period to facilitate lung ventilation. The nurse assesses for signs of complications, including cyanosis, dyspnea, and acute chest pain. These may indicate atelectasis and should be reported immediately. Increased temperature or white blood cell count may indicate an infection, and pallor and increased pulse may indicate internal hemorrhage. Dressings should be assessed for fresh bleeding.

\section*{Mechanical Ventilation}

Depending on the nature of the surgery, the patient's underlying condition, the intraoperative course, and the depth of anesthesia, the patient may require mechanical ventilation after surgery. The physician is responsible for determining the ventilator settings and modes, as well as determining the overall method and pace of weaning. However, the physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist work together closely to assess the patient's tolerance and weaning progress. Early extubation from mechanical ventilation can also lead to earlier removal of arterial lines (Zevola \& Maier, 1999).

\section*{Chest Drainage}

A crucial intervention for improving gas exchange and breathing in the postoperative period is the proper management of chest drainage and the chest drainage system. After thoracic surgery, chest tubes and a closed drainage system are used to re-expand the involved lung and to remove excess air, fluid, and blood. Chest
drainage systems also are used in treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax and trauma resulting in pneumothorax. Table 25-3 describes and compares the main features of these systems. Management of chest drainage systems is explained in Chart 2518. Prevention of cardiopulmonary complications following thoracic surgery is discussed in Chart 25-19.

The normal breathing mechanism operates on the principle of negative pressure; that is, the pressure in the chest cavity normally is lower than the pressure of the atmosphere, causing air to move into the lungs during inspiration. Whenever the chest is opened, there is a loss of negative pressure, which can result in the collapse of the lung. The collection of air, fluid, or other substances in the chest can compromise cardiopulmonary function and can also cause the lung to collapse. Pathologic substances that collect in the pleural space include fibrin, or clotted blood; liquids (serous fluids, blood, pus, chyle); and gases (air from the lung, tracheobronchial tree, or esophagus).

Chest tubes may be inserted to drain fluid or air from any of the three compartments of the thorax (the right and left pleural spaces and the mediastinum). The pleural space, located between the visceral and parietal pleura, normally contains 20 mL or less of fluid, which helps to lubricate the visceral and parietal pleura. Surgical incision of the chest wall almost always causes some degree of pneumothorax (air accumulating in the pleural space) or hemothorax (build-up of serous fluid or blood in the pleural space). Air and fluid collect in the pleural space, restricting lung expansion and reducing gas exchange. Placement of a chest tube in the pleural space restores the negative intrathoracic pressure needed for lung re-expansion following surgery or trauma.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}
1. If using a chest drainage system with a water seal, fill the water seal chamber with sterile water to the level specified by the manufacturer.
2. When using suction in chest drainage systems with a water seal, fill the suction control chamber with sterile water to the $20-\mathrm{cm}$ level or as prescribed. In systems without a water seal, set the regulator dial at the appropriate suction level.
3. Attach the drainage catheter exiting the thoracic cavity to the tubing coming from the collection chamber. Tape securely with adhesive tape.
4. If suction is used, connect the suction control chamber tubing to the suction unit. If using a wet suction system, turn on the suction unit and increase pressure until slow but steady bubbling appears in the suction control chamber. If using a chest drainage system with a dry suction control chamber, turn the regulator dial to $20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

Example of a disposable chest drainage system.
5. Mark the drainage from the collection chamber with tape on the outside of the drainage unit. Mark hourly/daily increments (date and time) at the drainage level.
6. Ensure that the drainage tubing does not kink, loop, or interfere with the patient's movements.
7. Encourage the patient to assume a comfortable position with good body alignment. With the lateral position, make sure that the patient's body does not compress the tubing. The patient should be turned and repositioned every 1.5 to 2 hours. Provide adequate analgesia.

RATIONALE
Water seal drainage allows air and fluid to escape into a drainage chamber. The water acts as a seal and keeps the air from being drawn back into the pleural space.
The water level regulator dial setting determines the degree of suction applied.

In chest drainage units, the system is closed. The only connection is the one to the patient's catheter.

With a wet suction system, the degree of suction is determined by the amount of water in the suction control chamber and is not dependent on the rate of bubbling or the pressure gauge setting on the suction unit.
With a dry suction control chamber, the regulator dial replaces the water.

This marking shows the amount of fluid loss and how fast fluid is collecting in the drainage chamber. It serves as a basis for determining the need for blood replacement, if the fluid is blood. Visibly bloody drainage will appear in the chamber in the immediate postoperative period but should gradually becomes serous. If the patient is bleeding as heavily as 100 mL every 15 minutes, check the drainage every few minutes. A reoperation or autotransfusion may be needed. The transfusion of blood collected in the drainage chamber must be reinfused within 4 to 6 hours. Usually, however, drainage decreases progressively in the first 24 hours.
Kinking, looping, or pressure on the drainage tubing can produce back-pressure, which may force fluid back into the pleural space or impede its drainage.
Frequent position changes promote drainage, and good body alignment helps prevent postural deformities and contractures. Proper positioning also helps breathing and promotes better air exchange. Analgesics may be needed to promote comfort.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Managing Chest Drainage Systems (Continued)}

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}
8. Assist the patient with range-of-motion exercises for the affected arm and shoulder several times daily. Provide adequate analgesia.
9. Gently "milk" the tubing in the direction of the drainage chamber as needed.
10. Make sure there is fluctuation ("tidaling") of the fluid level in the water seal chamber (in wet systems), or check the air leak indicator for leaks (in dry systems with a one-way valve). Note: Fluid fluctuations in the water seal chamber or air leak indicator area will stop when:
- The lung has reexpanded
- The tubing is obstructed by blood clots, fibrin, or kinks
- A loop of tubing hangs below the rest of the tubing
- Suction motor or wall suction is not working properly
11. With a dry system, assess for the presence of the indicator (bellows or float device) when setting the regulator dial to the desired level of suction.
12. Observe for air leaks in the drainage system; they are indicated by constant bubbling in the water seal chamber, or by the air leak indicator in dry systems with a one-way valve. Also assess the chest tube system for correctable external leaks. Notify the physician immediately of excessive bubbling in the water seal chamber not due to external leaks.
13. When turning down the dry suction, depress the manual highnegativity vent, and assess for a rise in the water level of the water seal chamber.
14. Observe and immediately report rapid and shallow breathing, cyanosis, pressure in the chest, subcutaneous emphysema, symptoms of hemorrhage, or significant changes in vital signs.
15. Encourage the patient to breathe deeply and cough at frequent intervals. Provide adequate analgesia. If needed, request an order for patient-controlled analgesia. Also teach the patient how to perform incentive spirometry.
16. If the patient is lying on a stretcher and must be transported to another area, place the drainage system below the chest level. If the tubing disconnects, cut off the contaminated tips of the chest tube and tubing, insert a sterile connector in the cut ends, and reattach to the drainage system. Do not clamp the chest tube during transport.
17. When assisting in the chest tube's removal, instruct the patient to perform a gentle Valsalva maneuver or to breathe quietly. The chest tube is then clamped and quickly removed. Simultaneously, a small bandage is applied and made airtight with petrolatum gauze covered by a $4 \times 4$-inch gauze pad and thoroughly covered and sealed with nonporous tape.

\section*{RATIONALE}

Exercise helps to prevent ankylosis of the shoulder and to reduce postoperative pain and discomfort. Analgesics may be needed to relieve pain.
"Milking" prevents the tubing from becoming obstructed by clots and fibrin. Constant attention to maintaining the patency of the tube facilitates prompt expansion of the lung and minimizes complications.
Fluctuation of the water level in the water seal shows effective connection between the pleural cavity and the drainage chamber and indicates that the drainage system remains patent. Fluctuation is also a gauge of intrapleural pressure in systems with a water seal (wet and dry, but not with the one-way valve).
An air leak indicator shows changes in intrathoracic pressure in dry systems with a one-way valve. Bubbles will appear if a leak is present. The air leak indicator takes the place of fluid fluctuations in the water seal chamber.
The indicator shows that the vacuum is adequate to maintain the desired level of suction.

Leaking and trapping of air in the pleural space can result in tension pneumothorax.

A rise in the water level of the water seal chamber indicates high negative pressure in the system that could lead to increased intrathoracic pressure.
Many clinical conditions can cause these signs and symptoms, including tension pneumothorax, mediastinal shift, hemorrhage, severe incisional pain, pulmonary embolus, and cardiac tamponade. Surgical intervention may be necessary.
Deep breathing and coughing help to raise the intrapleural pressure, which promotes drainage of accumulated fluid in the pleural space. Deep breathing and coughing also promote removal of secretions from the tracheobronchial tree, which in turn promotes lung expansion and prevents atelectasis (alveolar collapse).
The drainage apparatus must be kept at a level lower than the patient's chest to prevent fluid from flowing backward into the pleural space. Clamping can result in a tension pneumothorax.

The chest tube is removed as directed when the lung is reexpanded (usually 24 hours to several days), depending on the cause of the pneumothorax. During tube removal, the chief priorities are preventing air from entering the pleural cavity as the tube is withdrawn and preventing infection.

The mediastinal space is an extrapleural space that lies between the right and left thoracic cavities. Mediastinal chest tubes promote the removal of blood or other fluid from around the heart (Finkelmeier, 2000). Accumulating fluid can stop the heart from beating if it is not drained. A mediastinal tube can be inserted either anteriorly or posteriorly to the heart to drain blood after surgery or trauma. Without a tube, compression of the heart could occur, leading to death (Carroll, 2000).

There are two types of chest tubes: small-bore and large-bore catheters. Small-bore catheters (7F to 12F) have a one-way valve apparatus to prevent air from moving back into the patient. They can be inserted through a small skin incision. Large-bore catheters,
which range in size up to 40 F , are usually connected to a chest drainage system to collect any pleural fluid and monitor for air leaks (Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999). After the chest tube is positioned, it is sutured to the skin and connected to a drainage apparatus to remove the residual air and fluid from the pleural or mediastinal space. This results in the re-expansion of remaining lung tissue.

\section*{CHEST DRAINAGE SYSTEMS}

Chest drainage systems have a suction source, a collection chamber for pleural drainage, and a mechanism to prevent air from reentering the chest with inhalation. Various types of
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-150.jpg?height=1040&width=863&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=112)
chest drainage systems are available for use in removal of air and fluid from the pleural space and re-expansion of the lungs. Chest drainage systems come with either wet (water seal) or dry suction control. In wet suction systems, the amount of suction is determined by the amount of water instilled in the suction chamber. The amount of bubbling in the suction chamber indicates how strong the suction is. Wet systems use a water seal to prevent air from moving back into the chest on inspiration. Dry systems use a one-way valve and a suction control dial in place of the water needed with wet or water seal system. Both systems can operate by gravity drainage, without a suction source.

Water Seal Chest Drainage Systems. The traditional water seal chest drainage system (or wet suction) has three chambers: a collection chamber, a water seal chamber, and a wet suction control chamber. The collection chamber acts as a reservoir for fluid draining from the chest tube. It is graduated to permit easy measurement of drainage. Suction may be added to create negative pressure and promote drainage of fluid and removal of air. The suction control chamber regulates the amount of negative pressure applied to the chest. The amount of suction is determined by the water level. It is generally set at $20-\mathrm{cm}$ water; adding more fluid results in more suction. After the suction is turned on, bubbling appears in the suction chamber. A positivepressure valve is located at the top of the suction chamber that automatically opens with increases in positive pressure within the system. Air will automatically be released through a posi-tive-pressure relief valve if the suction tubing is inadvertently clamped or kinked.

The water seal chamber has a one-way valve or water seal that prevents air from moving back into the chest when the patient in-
hales. There will be an increase in the water level with inspiration and a return to the baseline level during exhalation; this is referred to as tidaling. Intermittent bubbling in the water seal chamber is normal, but continuous bubbling can indicate an air leak. Bubbling and tidaling do not occur when the tube is placed in the mediastinal space; however, fluid may pulsate with the patient's heartbeat. If the chest tube is connected to gravity drainage only, suction is not used. The pressure is equal to the water seal only. Two-chamber chest drainage systems (water seal chamber and collection chamber) are available for use with patients who need only gravity drainage.

The water level in the water seal chamber reflects the negative pressure present in the intrathoracic cavity. A rise in the water level indicates negative pressure in the pleural or mediastinal space. Excessive negative pressure can cause trauma to tissue (Bar-El, Ross, Kablawi \& Egenburg, 2001). Most chest drainage systems have an automatic means to prevent excessive negative pressure. By pressing and holding a manual high-negativity vent (usually located on the top of the chest drainage system) until the water level in the water seal chamber returns to the $2-\mathrm{cm}$ mark, excessive negative pressure is avoided, preventing damage to tissue.

NURSING ALERT When the wall vacuum is turned off, the drainage system must be open to the atmosphere so that intrapleural air can escape from the system. This can be done by detaching the tubing from the suction port to provide a vent.

NURSING ALERT If the chest tube and drainage system become disconnected, air can enter the pleural space, producing a pneumothorax. To prevent pneumothorax if the chest tube is inadvertently disconnected from the drainage system, a temporary water seal can be established by immersing the chest tube's open end in a bottle of sterile water.

Dry Suction Water Seal Systems. Dry suction water seal systems, also referred to as dry suction, have a collection chamber for drainage, a water seal chamber, and a dry suction control chamber. The water seal chamber is filled with water to the $2-\mathrm{cm}$ level. Bubbling in this area can indicate an air leak. The dry suction control chamber contains a regulator dial that conveniently regulates vacuum to the chest drain. Water is not needed for suction as it is in the wet system. Without the bubbling in the suction chamber, the machine is quieter.

Once the tube is connected to the suction source, the regulator dial allows the desired level of suction to be dialed in; the suction is increased until an indicator appears. The indicator has the same function as the bubbling in the traditional water seal system; that is, it indicates that the vacuum is adequate to maintain the desired level of suction. Some drainage systems use a bellows (a chamber that can be expanded or contracted) or an orangecolored float device as an indicator of when the suction control regulator is set.

When the water in the water seal rises above the $2-\mathrm{cm}$ level, intrathoracic pressure increases. Dry suction water seal systems have a manual high-negativity vent located on top of the drain. Pressing the manual high-negativity vent until the indicator appears (either a float device or bellows) and the water level in the water seal returns to the desired level, intrathoracic pressure is decreased.

NURSING ALERT The manual vent should not be used to lower the water level in the water seal when the patient is on gravity drainage (no suction) because intrathoracic pressure is equal to the pressure in the water seal.

Dry Suction with a One-Way Valve System. A third type of chest drainage system is dry suction with a one-way mechanical valve. This system has a collection chamber, a one-way mechanical valve, and a dry suction control chamber. The valve acts in the same way as a water seal and permits air to leave the chest but prevents it from moving back into the pleural space. This model lacks a water seal chamber and therefore has the advantage of a system that operates without water. For example, it can be set up quickly in emergency situations, and the dry control drain will still work even if it is knocked over. If the wet suction drain is knocked over, the water seal could be lost. This makes the dry suction systems useful for the patient who is ambulating or being transported. However, without the water seal chamber, there is no way to tell by inspection if the pressure in the chest has changed. An air leak indicator is present so that the system can be checked for air leaks. If an air leak is suspected, 30 mL of water are injected into the air leak indicator. Bubbles will appear if a leak is present (Carroll, 2000).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: \\ THE PATIENT UNDERGOING THORACIC SURGERY}

\section*{Postoperative Assessment}

The nurse monitors the heart rate and rhythm by auscultation and electrocardiography because episodes of major dysrhythmias are common after thoracic and cardiac surgery. In the immediate postoperative period, an arterial line may be maintained to allow frequent monitoring of arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit values, and arterial pressure. Central venous pressure may be monitored to detect early signs of fluid volume disturbances. Central venous pressure monitoring devices are being used less frequently and for shorter periods of time than in the past. Early extubation from mechanical ventilation can also lead to earlier removal of arterial lines (Zevola \& Maier, 1999). Another important component of postoperative assessment is to note the results of the preoperative evaluation of the patient's lung reserve by pulmonary function testing. A preoperative $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ of more than 2 L or more than $70 \%$ of predicted value indicates a good lung reserve. Patients who have a postoperative predicted $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ of less than $40 \%$ of predicted value have a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality (Scanlan, Wilkins \& Stoller, 1999). This results in decreased tidal volumes, placing the patient at risk for respiratory failure.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major postoperative nursing diagnoses may include:
- Impaired gas exchange related to lung impairment and surgery
- Ineffective airway clearance related to lung impairment, anesthesia, and pain
- Acute pain related to incision, drainage tubes, and the surgical procedure
- Impaired physical mobility of the upper extremities related to thoracic surgery
- Risk for imbalanced fluid volume related to the surgical procedure
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements related to dyspnea and anorexia
- Deficient knowledge about self-care procedures at home

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Respiratory distress
- Dysrhythmias
- Atelectasis, pneumothorax, and bronchopleural fistula
- Blood loss and hemorrhage
- Pulmonary edema

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include improvement of gas exchange and breathing, improvement of airway clearance, relief of pain and discomfort, increased arm and shoulder mobility, maintenance of adequate fluid volume and nutritional status, understanding of self-care procedures, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING GAS EXCHANGE AND BREATHING}

Gas exchange is determined by evaluating oxygenation and ventilation. In the immediate postoperative period, this is achieved by measuring vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and respirations) at least every 15 minutes for the first 1 to 2 hours, then less frequently as the patient's condition stabilizes.

Pulse oximetry is used for continuous monitoring of the adequacy of oxygenation. It is important to draw blood for arterial blood gas measurements early in the postoperative period to establish a baseline to assess the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and the possible retention of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The frequency with which postoperative arterial blood gases are measured depends on whether the patient is mechanically ventilated or exhibits signs of respiratory distress; these measurements can help determine appropriate therapy. It also is common practice for patients to have an arterial line in place to obtain blood for blood gas measurements and to monitor blood pressure closely. Hemodynamic monitoring may be used to assess hemodynamic stability.

Breathing techniques, such as diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing, that were taught before surgery should be performed by the patient every 2 hours to expand the alveoli and prevent atelectasis. Another technique to improve ventilation is sustained maximal inspiration therapy or incentive spirometry. This technique promotes lung inflation, improves the cough mechanism, and allows early assessment of acute pulmonary changes. (See Charts 25-3 and 25-4 for more information.)

Positioning also improves breathing. When the patient is oriented and blood pressure is stabilized, the head of the bed is elevated 30 to 40 degrees during the immediate postoperative period. This facilitates ventilation, promotes chest drainage from the lower chest tube, and helps residual air to rise in the upper portion of the pleural space, where it can be removed through the upper chest tube.

The nurse should consult with the surgeon about patient positioning. There is controversy regarding the best side-lying position. In general, the patient should be positioned from back to
side frequently and moved from horizontal to semi-upright position as soon as tolerated. Most commonly, the patient is instructed to lie on the operative side. However, the patient with unilateral lung pathology may not be able to turn well onto that side because of pain. In addition, positioning the patient with the "good lung" (the nonoperated lung) down allows a better match of ventilation and perfusion and therefore may actually improve oxygenation. The patient's position is changed from horizontal to semi-upright as soon as possible, because remaining in one position tends to promote the retention of secretions in the dependent portion of the lungs. After a pneumonectomy, the operated side should be dependent so that fluid in the pleural space remains below the level of the bronchial stump, and the other lung can fully expand.

The procedure for turning the patient is as follows:
- Instruct the patient to bend the knees and use the feet to push.
- Have the patient shift hips and shoulders to the opposite side of the bed while pushing with the feet.
- Bring the patient's arm over the chest, pointing it in the direction toward which the patient is being turned. Have the patient grasp the side rail with the hand.
- Turn the patient in log-roll fashion to prevent twisting at the waist and pain from possible pulling on the incision.

\section*{IMPROVING AIRWAY CLEARANCE}

Retained secretions are a threat to the thoracotomy patient after surgery. Trauma to the tracheobronchial tree during surgery, diminished lung ventilation, and diminished cough reflex all result in the accumulation of excessive secretions. If the secretions are retained, airway obstruction occurs. This, in turn, causes the air in the alveoli distal to the obstruction to become absorbed and the affected portion of the lung to collapse. Atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure may result.

Several techniques are used to maintain a patent airway. First, secretions are suctioned from the tracheobronchial tree before the endotracheal tube is discontinued. Secretions continue to be removed by suctioning until the patient can cough up secretions effectively. Nasotracheal suctioning may be needed to stimulate a deep cough and aspirate secretions that the patient cannot cough up. However, it should be used only after other methods to raise secretions have been unsuccessful (Chart 25-20).

Coughing technique is another measure used in maintaining a patent airway. The patient is encouraged to cough effectively; ineffective coughing results in exhaustion and retention of secretions (see Chart 25-5). To be effective, the cough must be low-pitched, deep, and controlled. Because it is difficult to cough in a supine position, the patient is helped to a sitting position on the edge of the bed, with the feet resting on a chair. The patient should cough at least every hour during the first 24 hours and when necessary thereafter. If audible crackles are present, it may be necessary to use chest percussion with the cough routine until the lungs are clear. Aerosol therapy is helpful in humidifying and mobilizing secretions so that they can easily be cleared with coughing. To minimize incisional pain during coughing, the nurse supports the incision or encourages the patient to do so (Fig. 25-8).

After helping the patient to cough, the nurse should listen to both lungs, anteriorly and posteriorly, to determine whether there are any changes in breath sounds. Diminished breath sounds may indicate collapsed or hypoventilated alveoli.

\section*{Performing Nasotracheal Suction}

Sterile Technique to Be Used
1. Explain procedure to the patient.
2. Medicate patient for pain if necessary.
3. Place the patient in a sitting or semi-Fowler's position. Make sure the patient's head is not flexed forward. Remove excess pillows if necessary.
4. Oxygenate the patient several minutes before initiating the suctioning procedure. Have oxygen source ready nearby during procedure.
5. Put on sterile gloves.
6. Lubricate catheter with water-soluble gel.
7. Gently pass catheter through the patient's nose to the pharynx. If it is difficult to pass the catheter, and repeated suctioning is expected, a soft rubber nasal trumpet may be placed nasopharyngeally to provide easier catheter passage. Check the position of the tip of the catheter by asking the patient to open the mouth and inspecting it; the tip of the catheter should be in the lower pharynx.
8. Instruct the patient to take a deep breath or stick out the tongue. This action opens the epiglottis and promotes downward movement of the catheter.
9. Advance the catheter into the trachea only during inspiration. Listen for cough or for passage of air through the catheter.
10. Attach the catheter to suction apparatus. Apply intermittent suction while slowly withdrawing the catheter. Do not let suction exceed 120 mm Hg .
11. Do not suction for longer than 10 to 15 seconds, as dysrhythmias, bradycardia, or cardiac arrest may occur in patients with borderline oxygenation.
12. If additional suctioning is needed, withdraw the catheter to the back of the pharynx. Reassure patient and oxygenate for several minutes before resuming suctioning.

Chest physiotherapy is the final technique for maintaining a patent airway. If a patient is identified as being at high risk for developing postoperative pulmonary complications, then chest physiotherapy is started immediately (perhaps even before surgery). The techniques of postural drainage, vibration, and percussion help to loosen and mobilize the secretions so that they can be coughed up or suctioned.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Pain after a thoracotomy may be severe, depending on the type of incision and the patient's reaction to and ability to cope with pain. Deep inspiration is very painful after thoracotomy. Pain can lead to postoperative complications if it reduces the patient's ability to breathe deeply and cough, and if it further limits chest excursions so that ventilation becomes ineffective.

Immediately after the surgical procedure and before the incision is closed, the surgeon may perform a nerve block with a longacting local anesthetic such as bupivacaine (Marcaine, Sensorcaine). Bupivacaine is titrated to relieve postoperative pain while allowing the patient to cooperate in deep breathing, coughing, and mobilization. However, it is important to avoid depressing the respiratory system with excessive analgesia: the patient should not be so sedated as to be unable to cough. There is controversy about the effectiveness of injections of local anesthetic for pain relief after thoracotomy surgery. Research has shown that bupivacaine was no

more effective than saline injections in treating postoperative thoracotomy pain (Silomon et al., 2000).

Lidocaine and prilocaine are local anesthetic agents used to treat pain at the site of the chest tube insertion. These medications are administered as topical transdermal analgesics that penetrate the skin. Lidocaine and prilocaine have also been found to be effective when used together. EMLA cream, which is a mixture of the two medications, has been found to be effective in treating pain from chest tube removal, and recent studies found it to be more effective than intravenous morphine (Valenzuela \& Rosen, 1999).

Because of the need to maximize patient comfort without depressing the respiratory drive, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is often used. Opioid analgesic agents such as morphine are commonly used. PCA, administered through an intravenous pump or an epidural catheter, allows the patient to control the frequency and total dosage. Preset limits on the pump avoid overdosage. With proper instruction, these methods are well tolerated and allow earlier mobilization and cooperation with the treatment regimen. (See Chap. 13 for a more extensive discussion of PCA and pain management.)

NURSING ALERT It is important not to confuse the restlessness of hypoxia with the restlessness caused by pain. Dyspnea, restlessness, increasing respiratory rate, increasing blood pressure, and tachycardia are warning signs of impending respiratory insufficiency. Pulse oximetry is used to monitor oxygenation and to differentiate causes of restlessness.

\section*{PROMOTING MOBILITY AND SHOULDER EXERCISES}

Because large shoulder girdle muscles are transected during a thoracotomy, the arm and shoulder must be mobilized by full range of motion of the shoulder. As soon as physiologically possible, usually within 8 to 12 hours, the patient is helped to get out of bed. Although this may be painful initially, the earlier the patient moves, the sooner the pain will subside. In addition to getting out of bed, the patient begins arm and shoulder exercises to restore movement and prevent painful stiffening of the affected arm and shoulder (Chart 25-21).

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID VOLUME AND NUTRITION}

\section*{Intravenous Therapy}

During the surgical procedure or immediately after, the patient may receive a transfusion of blood products, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion. Because a reduction in lung capacity often occurs following thoracic surgery, a period of physiologic adjustment is needed. Fluids should be administered at a low hourly rate and titrated (as prescribed) to prevent overloading the vascular system and precipitating pulmonary edema. The nurse performs careful respiratory and cardiovascular assessments, as well as intake and output, vital signs, and assessment of jugular vein distention. The nurse should also monitor the infusion site for signs of infiltration, including swelling, tenderness, and redness.

\section*{Diet}

It is not unusual for patients undergoing thoracotomy to have poor nutritional status before surgery because of dyspnea, sputum production, and poor appetite. Therefore, it is especially important

Arm and shoulder exercises are performed after thoracic surgery to restore movement, prevent painful stiffening of the shoulder, and improve muscle power.

\end{figure}
that adequate nutrition be provided. A liquid diet is provided as soon as bowel sounds return; the patient is progressed to a full diet as soon as possible. Small, frequent meals are better tolerated and are crucial to the recovery and maintenance of lung function.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Complications after thoracic surgery are always a possibility and must be identified and managed early. In addition, the nurse monitors the patient at regular intervals for signs of respiratory distress or developing respiratory failure, dysrhythmias, bronchopleural fistula, hemorrhage and shock, atelectasis, and pulmonary infection.

Respiratory distress is treated by identifying and eliminating its cause while providing supplemental oxygen. If the patient progresses to respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary, eventually requiring weaning.

Dysrhythmias are often related to the effects of hypoxia or the surgical procedure. They are treated with antiarrhythmic medication and supportive therapy (see Chap. 27). Pulmonary infec-
tions or effusion, often preceded by atelectasis, may occur a few days into the postoperative course.

Pneumothorax may occur following thoracic surgery if there is an air leak from the surgical site to the pleural cavity or from the pleural cavity to the environment. Failure of the chest drainage system will prevent return of negative pressure in the pleural cavity and result in pneumothorax. In the postoperative patient pneumothorax is often accompanied by hemothorax. The nurse maintains the chest drainage system and monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of pneumothorax: increasing shortness of breath, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, and increasing respiratory distress.

Bronchopleural fistula is a serious but rare complication preventing the return of negative intrathoracic pressure and lung reexpansion. Depending on its severity, it is treated with closed chest drainage, mechanical ventilation, and possibly talc pleurodesis (described in Chap. 23).

Hemorrhage and shock are managed by treating the underlying cause, whether by reoperation or by administration of blood products or fluids. Pulmonary edema from overinfusion of intravenous fluids is a significant danger. The early symptoms are dys-
pnea, crackles, bubbling sounds in the chest, tachycardia, and pink, frothy sputum. This constitutes an emergency and must be reported and treated immediately.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse instructs the patient and family about postoperative care that will be continued at home. The nurse explains signs and symptoms that should be reported to the physician. These include:
- Change in respiratory status: increasing shortness of breath, fever, increased restlessness or other changes in mental or cognitive status, increased respiratory rate, change in respiratory pattern, change in amount or color of sputum
- Bleeding or other drainage from the surgical incision or chest tube exit sites
- Increased chest pain

In addition, respiratory care and other treatment modalities (oxygen, incentive spirometer, chest physiotherapy, and oral, inhaled, or intravenous medications) may be continued at home. Therefore, the nurse needs to instruct the patient and family in their correct and safe use.

The nurse emphasizes the importance of progressively increased activity. The nurse instructs the patient to ambulate within limits and explains that return of strength is likely to be very gradual. Another important aspect of patient teaching addresses shoulder exercises. It is important to instruct the patient to do these exercises five times daily. Additional patient teaching is described in Chart 25-22.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Depending on the patient's physical status and the availability of family assistance, a home care referral may be indicated. The home care nurse assesses the patient's recovery from surgery, with special attention to respiratory status, the surgical incision, chest drainage, pain control, ambulation, and nutritional status. The patient's use of respiratory modalities should be assessed to ensure they are being used correctly and safely. In addition, the nurse assesses the patient's compliance with the
postoperative treatment plan and identifies acute or late postoperative complications.

The recovery process may be longer than the patient had expected, and providing support to the patient is an important task for the home care nurse. Because of shorter hospital stays, attending follow-up physician appointments is essential. The nurse teaches the patient about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments and completing laboratory tests as prescribed to assist the physician in evaluating recovery. The home care nurse provides continuous encouragement and education to the patient and family during the process. As recovery progresses, the nurse also reminds the patient and family about the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

5. Encourage deep-breathing exercises (see section on Breathing Retraining) and effective use of incentive spirometer (sustained maximal inspiration).
6. Encourage and promote an effective cough routine to be performed every $1-2$ hours during first 24 hours.
7. Assess and monitor the chest drainage system:*
a. Assess for leaks and patency as needed.
b. Monitor amount and character of drainage and document every 2 hours. Notify physician if drainage is $150 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ or greater.
c. See Chart 25-18 for summary of nurse's role in management of chest drainage systems.
1. Changes in pulmonary status indicate improvement or onset of complications.
2. Aid in evaluating effect of surgery on cardiac status.
3. Dysrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) are more frequently seen after thoracic surgery. A patient with total pneumonectomy is especially prone to cardiac irregularity.
4. Maximum lung excursion is achieved when patient is as close to upright as possible.
5. Helps to achieve maximal lung inflation and to open closed airways.
6. Coughing is necessary to remove retained secretions.
7. System is used to eliminate any residual air or fluid after thoracotomy.
- Lungs are clear on auscultation
- Respiratory rate is within acceptable range with no episodes of dyspnea
- Vital signs are stable
- Dysrhythmias are not present or are under control
- Demonstrates deep, controlled, effective breathing to allow maximal lung expansion
- Uses incentive spirometer every 2 hours while awake
- Demonstrates deep, effective coughing technique
- Lungs are expanded to capacity (evidenced by chest x-ray)

Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective airway clearance related to lung impairment, anesthesia, and pain
Goal: Improvement of airway clearance and achievement of a patent airway
1. Maintain an open airway.
2. Perform endotracheal suctioning until patient can raise secretions effectively.
3. Assess and medicate for pain. Encourage deep-breathing and coughing exercises. Help splint incision during coughing.
1. Provides for adequate ventilation and gas exchange
2. Endotracheal secretions are present in excessive amounts in post-thoracotomy patients due to trauma to the tracheobronchial tree during surgery, diminished lung ventilation, and cough reflex.
3. Helps to achieve maximal lung inflation and to open closed airways. Coughing is painful; incision needs to be supported.
- Airway is patent
- Coughs effectively
- Splints incision while coughing
- Sputum is clear or colorless
- Lungs are clear on auscultation

\footnotetext{
*A patient with a pneumonectomy usually does not have water seal chest drainage because it is desirable that the pleural space fill with an effusion, which eventually obliterates this space. Some surgeons do use a modified water seal system.
}

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Care of the Patient After Thoracotomy (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
4. Monitor amount, viscosity, color, and odor of sputum. Notify physician if sputum is excessive or contains bright-red blood.
5. Administer humidification and mininebulizer therapy as prescribed.
6. Perform postural drainage, percussion, and vibration as prescribed. Do not percuss or vibrate directly over operative site.
7. Auscultate both sides of chest to determine changes in breath sounds.

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Patient Outcomes}
4. Changes in sputum suggest presence of infection or change in pulmonary status. Colorless sputum is not unusual; opacification or coloring of sputum may indicate dehydration or infection.
5. Secretions must be moistened and thinned if they are to be raised from the chest with the least amount of effort.
6. Chest physiotherapy uses gravity to help remove secretions from the lung.
7. Indications for tracheal suctioning are determined by chest auscultation.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Acute pain related to incision, drainage tubes, and the surgical procedure}

\section*{Goal: Relief of pain and discomfort}
1. Evaluate location, character, quality, and severity of pain. Administer analgesic medication as prescribed and as needed. Observe for respiratory effect of opioid. Is patient too somnolent to cough? Are respirations depressed?
2. Maintain care postoperatively in positioning the thoracotomy patient:
a. Place patient in semi-Fowler's position.
b. Patients with limited respiratory reserve may not be able to turn on unoperated side.
c. Assist or turn patient every 2 hours.
3. Assess incision area every 8 hours for redness, heat, induration, swelling, separation, and drainage.
4. Request order for patient-controlled analgesia pump if appropriate for patient.
1. Pain limits chest excursions and thereby decreases ventilation.
2. The patient who is comfortable and free of pain will be less likely to splint the chest while breathing. A semi-Fowler's position permits residual air in the pleural space to rise to upper portion of pleural space and be removed via the upper chest catheter.
3. These signs indicate possible infection.
4. Allowing patient control over frequency and dose improves comfort and compliance with treatment regimen.
- Asks for pain medication, but verbalizes that he or she expects some discomfort while deep breathing and coughing
- Verbalizes that he or she is comfortable and not in acute distress
- No signs of incisional infection evident

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Anxiety related to outcomes of surgery, pain, technology}

Goal: Reduction of anxiety to a manageable level
1. Explain all procedures in understandable language.
2. Assess for pain and medicate, especially before potentially painful procedures.
3. Silence all unnecessary alarms on technology (monitors, ventilators).
4. Encourage and support patient while increasing activity level.
5. Mobilize resources (family, clergy, social worker) to help patient cope with outcomes of surgery (diagnosis, change in functional abilities).
1. Explaining what can be expected in understandable terms decreases anxiety and increases cooperation.
2. Premedication before painful procedures or activities improves comfort and minimizes undue anxiety.
3. Unnecessary alarms increase the risk of sensory overload and may increase anxiety.
4. Positive reinforcement improves patient motivation and independence.
5. A multidisciplinary approach promotes the patient's strengths and coping mechanisms.
- States that anxiety is at a manageable level
- Participates with health care team in treatment regimen
- Uses appropriate coping skills (verbalization, pain relief strategies, use of support systems such as family, clergy)
- Demonstrates basic understanding of technology used in care

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Care of the Patient After Thoracotomy (Continued)}

Nursing Interventions
Rationale
Expected Patient Outcomes
Nursing Diagnosis: Impaired physical mobility of the upper extremities related to thoracic surgery
Goal: Increased mobility of the affected shoulder and arm
1. Assist patient with normal range of motion and function of shoulder and trunk:
a. Teach breathing exercises to mobilize thorax.
b. Encourage skeletal exercises to promote abduction and mobilization of shoulder (see Chart 25-21).
c. Assist out of bed to chair as soon as pulmonary and circulatory systems are stable (usually by evening of surgery).
2. Encourage progressive activities according to level of fatigue.
1. Necessary to regain normal mobility of arm and shoulder and to speed recovery and minimize discomfort
2. Increases patient's use of affected shoulder and arm
- Demonstrates arm and shoulder exercises and verbalizes intent to perform them on discharge
- Regains previous range of motion in shoulder and arm

Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for imbalanced fluid volume related to the surgical procedure
Goal: Maintenance of adequate fluid volume
1. Monitor and record hourly intake and output. Urine output should be at least 30 mL h after surgery.
2. Administer blood component therapy and parenteral fluids and/or diuretics as prescribed to restore and maintain fluid volume.
1. Fluid management may be altered before, during, and after surgery, and patient's response to and need for fluid management must be assessed.
2. Pulmonary edema due to transfusion or fluid overload is an ever-present threat; after pneumonectomy, the pulmonary vascular system has been greatly reduced.
- Patient is adequately hydrated, as evidenced by:
- Urine output greater than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$
- Vital signs stable, heart rate, and central venous pressure approaching normal
- No excessive peripheral edema

Nursing Diagnosis: Deficient knowledge of home care procedures
Goal: Increased ability to carry out care procedures at home
1. Encourage patient to practice arm and shoulder exercises five times daily at home.
2. Instruct patient to practice assuming a functionally erect position in front of a full-length mirror.
3. Instruct patient in following aspects of home care:
a. Relieve intercostal pain by local heat or oral analgesia.
b. Alternate activities with frequent rest periods.
c. Practice breathing exercises at home.
d. Avoid heavy lifting until complete healing has occurred.
e. Avoid undue fatigue, increased shortness of breath, or chest pain.
f. Avoid bronchial irritants.
g. Prevent colds or lung infection.
h. Get annual influenza vaccine.
i. Keep follow-up appointment with physician.
j. Stop smoking.
1. Exercise accelerates recovery of muscle function and reduces long-term pain and discomfort.
2. Practice will help restore normal posture.
3. Knowing what to expect facilitates recovery.
a. Some soreness may persist for several weeks.
b. Weakness and fatigue are common for the first 3 weeks or longer.
c. Effective breathing is necessary to prevent splinting of affected side, which may lead to atelectasis.
d. Chest muscles and incision may be weaker than normal for 3-6 months.
e. Undue stress may prolong the healing process.
f. The lung is more susceptible to irritants.
g. The lung is more susceptible to infection during the recovery phase.
h. Vaccination helps prevent flu.
i. This allows timely follow-up assessment.
j. Smoking will slow healing process by decreasing oxygen delivery to tissues and make lung susceptible to infection and other complications.
- Demonstrates arm and shoulder exercises
- Verbalizes need to try to assume an erect posture
- Verbalizes the importance of relieving discomfort, alternating walking and rest, performing breathing exercises, avoiding heavy lifting, avoiding undue fatigue, avoiding bronchial irritants, preventing colds or lung infections, getting flu vaccine, keeping follow-up visits, and stopping smoking

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Oxygen therapy is required for the following patients: a 45-year-old patient who has undergone a right lower lobe lobectomy and needs short-term, low-flow oxygen; a 62-year-old patient with severe COPD admitted to the hospital for the fourth time in the past year; and a 74-yearold patient with dyspnea secondary to advanced lung cancer. Describe the explanations and safety precautions indicated for each of these patients and their families.
2. Your patient has just returned from the operating room after chest surgery with an endotracheal tube, a chest tube, and two intravenous lines and cardiac monitoring in place. Identify the priorities of assessment and interventions for this patient.
3. Your patient, who underwent a thoracotomy less than 24 hours ago, has a chest tube in place on the right side. Identify the actions that are indicated for each of the following situations and state the rationale for your actions:
a. Output in chest drainage chamber of 500 mL of serous drainage in the last 8 hours
b. Continuous bubbling in the water seal chamber c. Patient reports chest pain and dyspnea; absence of breath sounds on the right side of the thorax
4. A patient is being discharged home on oxygen therapy for the first time. The physician's prescription is for 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. Write a teaching plan for home oxygen therapy to be discussed with the patient before discharge from the hospital.
5. A patient who had a chest tube inserted 8 hours ago becomes confused and disconnects the chest tube from the drainage system. What immediate actions are indicated in this situation? What nursing assessments and interventions are needed once the immediate situation has been corrected?

\section*{Assessment of Cardiovascular Function}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Explain cardiac physiology in relation to cardiac anatomy and the conduction system of the heart.
2. Incorporate assessment of functional health patterns and cardiac risk factors into the health history and physical assessment of the patient with cardiac conditions.
3. Identify the clinical significance and related nursing implications of the various tests and procedures used for diagnostic assessment of cardiac function.
4. Compare central venous pressure monitoring, pulmonary artery pressure monitoring, and systemic intra-arterial monitoring with regard to clinical usefulness and significance, possible complications, and nursing responsibilities.

$T_{h}$hroughout the continuum of care, whether in a home, hospital, or rehabilitation setting, all patients with cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and major blood vessels; CVD) require similar assessments. Key components of the cardiovascular assessment include obtaining a health history, performing a physical assessment, and monitoring a variety of laboratory and diagnostic test results. An accurate and timely assessment of cardiovascular function provides the data necessary to identify nursing diagnoses, formulate a plan of care, and evaluate the response of the patient to the care provided. Essential to the development of these assessment skills is an understanding of the structure and function of the heart in health and in disease.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The heart is a hollow, muscular organ located in the center of the thorax, where it occupies the space between the lungs (mediastinum) and rests on the diaphragm. It weighs approximately 300 g ( 10.6 oz ), although heart weight and size are influenced by age, gender, body weight, extent of physical exercise and conditioning, and heart disease. The heart pumps blood to the tissues, supplying them with oxygen and other nutrients.

The pumping action of the heart is accomplished by the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of its muscular wall. During systole (contraction of the muscle), the chambers of the heart become smaller as the blood is ejected. During diastole (relaxation of the muscle), the heart chambers fill with blood in preparation for the subsequent ejection. A normal resting adult heart beats approximately 60 to 80 times per minute. Each ventricle ejects approxi-
mately 70 mL of blood per beat and has an output of approximately 5 L per minute.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE HEART}

The heart is composed of three layers (Fig. 26-1). The inner layer, or endocardium, consists of endothelial tissue and lines the inside of the heart and valves. The middle layer, or myocardium, is made up of muscle fibers and is responsible for the pumping action. The exterior layer of the heart is called the epicardium.

The heart is encased in a thin, fibrous sac called the pericardium, which is composed of two layers. Adhering to the epicardium is the visceral pericardium. Enveloping the visceral pericardium is the parietal pericardium, a tough fibrous tissue that attaches to the great vessels, diaphragm, sternum, and vertebral column and supports the heart in the mediastinum. The space between these two layers (pericardial space) is filled with about 30 mL of fluid, which lubricates the surface of the heart and reduces friction during systole.

\section*{Heart Chambers}

The four chambers of the heart constitute the right- and leftsided pumping systems. The right side of the heart, made up of the right atrium and right ventricle, distributes venous blood (deoxygenated blood) to the lungs via the pulmonary artery (pulmonary circulation) for oxygenation. The right atrium receives blood returning from the superior vena cava (head, neck, and upper extremities), inferior vena cava (trunk and lower extremities), and coronary sinus (coronary circulation). The left
afterload: the amount of resistance to ejection of blood from the ventricle
apical impulse (also called point of maximum impulse [PMI]): impulse normally palpated at the fifth intercostal space, left midclavicular line; caused by contraction of the left ventricle
baroreceptors: nerve fibers located in the aortic arch and carotid arteries that are responsible for reflex control of the blood pressure
cardiac catheterization: an invasive procedure used to measure cardiac chamber pressures and assess patency of the coronary arteries
cardiac conduction system: specialized heart cells strategically located throughout the heart that are responsible for methodically generating and coordinating the transmission of electrical impulses to the myocardial cells
cardiac output: amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in liters per minute; normal cardiac output is 5 L per minute in the resting adult heart
cardiac stress test: a test used to evaluate the functioning of the heart during a period of increased oxygen demand
contractility: ability of the cardiac muscle to shorten in response to an electrical impulse
depolarization: electrical activation of a cell caused by the influx of sodium into the cell while potassium exits the cell
diastole: period of ventricular relaxation resulting in ventricular filling
ejection fraction: percentage of the enddiastolic blood volume ejected from the ventricle with each heartbeat
hemodynamic monitoring: use of monitoring devices to measure cardiovascular function
hypertension: blood pressure greater than $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
hypotension: a decrease in blood pressure to less than $100 / 60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
international normalized ratio (INR): a standard method for reporting prothrombin levels, eliminating the variation in test results from laboratory to laboratory
murmurs: sounds created by abnormal, turbulent flow of blood in the heart
myocardial ischemia: condition in which heart muscle cells receive less oxygen than needed
myocardium: muscle layer of the heart responsible for the pumping action of the heart
normal heart sounds: sounds produced when the valves close; normal heart sounds are $S_{1}$ (atrioventricular valves) and $S_{2}$ (semilunar valves)
postural (orthostatic) hypotension: a significant drop in blood pressure (usually 10 mm Hg systolic or more) after an upright posture is assumed
preload: degree of stretch of the cardiac muscle fibers at the end of diastole
pulmonary vascular resistance: resistance to right ventricle ejection of blood
radioisotopes: unstable atoms that emit small amounts of energy in the form of gamma rays; used in cardiac nuclear medicine studies
repolarization: return of the cell to resting state, caused by reentry of potassium into the cell while sodium exits the cell
sinoatrial (SA) node: primary pacemaker of the heart, located in the right atrium stroke volume: amount of blood ejected from the ventricle per heartbeat; normal stroke volume is 70 mL in the resting heart
systemic vascular resistance: resistance to left ventricle ejection
systole: period of ventricular contraction resulting in ejection of blood from the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and aorta
telemetry: the process of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring by the transmission of radiowaves from a battery-operated transmitter worn by the patient
venodilating agent: medication causing dilation of veins

side of the heart, composed of the left atrium and left ventricle, distributes oxygenated blood to the remainder of the body via the aorta (systemic circulation). The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary circulation via the pulmonary veins. The relationships of the four heart chambers are shown in Figure 26-1.

The varying thicknesses of the atrial and ventricular walls relate to the workload required by each chamber. The atria are thin-walled because blood returning to these chambers generates low pressures. In contrast, the ventricular walls are thicker because they generate greater pressures during systole. The right ventricle contracts against low pulmonary vascular pressure and has thinner walls than the left ventricle. The left ventricle, with walls two-and-a-half times more muscular than those of the right ventricle, contracts against high systemic pressure.

Because the heart lies in a rotated position within the chest cavity, the right ventricle lies anteriorly (just beneath the sternum) and the left ventricle is situated posteriorly. The left ventricle is responsible for the apex beat or the point of maximum impulse (PMI), which is normally palpable in the left midclavicular line of the chest wall at the fifth intercostal space.

\section*{Heart Valves}

The four valves in the heart permit blood to flow in only one direction. The valves, which are composed of thin leaflets of fibrous tissue, open and close in response to the movement of blood and pressure changes within the chambers. There are two types of valves: atrioventricular and semilunar.

\section*{ATRIOVENTRICULAR VALVES}

The valves that separate the atria from the ventricles are termed atrioventricular valves. The tricuspid valve, so named because it is composed of three cusps or leaflets, separates the right atrium from the right ventricle. The mitral, or bicuspid (two cusps) valve, lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle (see Fig. 26-1).

Normally, when the ventricles contract, ventricular pressure rises, closing the atrioventricular valve leaflets. Two additional structures, the papillary muscles and the chordae tendineae, maintain valve closure. The papillary muscles, located on the sides of the ventricular walls, are connected to the valve leaflets by thin fibrous bands called chordae tendineae. During systole, contraction of the papillary muscles causes the chordae tendineae to become taut, keeping the valve leaflets approximated and closed.

\section*{SEMILUNAR VALVES}

The two semilunar valves are composed of three half-moon-like leaflets. The valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery is called the pulmonic valve; the valve between the left ventricle and the aorta is called the aortic valve.

\section*{Coronary Arteries}

The left and right coronary arteries and their branches (Fig. 26-2) supply arterial blood to the heart. These arteries originate from the aorta just above the aortic valve leaflets. The heart has large metabolic requirements, extracting approximately $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the oxygen delivered (other organs consume, on average, $25 \%$ ). Unlike other arteries, the coronary arteries are perfused during diastole. An increase in heart rate shortens diastole and can decrease myocardial perfusion. Patients, particularly those with coronary artery disease (CAD), can develop myocardial ischemia (inadequate oxygen supply) when the heart rate accelerates.

The left coronary artery has three branches. The artery from the point of origin to the first major branch is called the left main coronary artery. Two bifurcations arise off the left main coronary artery. These are the left anterior descending artery, which courses down the anterior wall of the heart, and the circumflex artery, which circles around to the lateral left wall of the heart.

The right side of the heart is supplied by the right coronary artery, which progresses around to the bottom or inferior wall of the heart. The posterior wall of the heart receives its blood supply by an additional branch from the right coronary artery called the posterior descending artery.

Superficial to the coronary arteries are the coronary veins. Venous blood from these veins returns to the heart primarily through the coronary sinus, which is located posteriorly in the right atrium.

\end{figure}

\section*{Cardiac Muscle}

The myocardium is composed of specialized muscle tissue. Microscopically, myocardial muscle resembles striated (skeletal) muscle, which is under conscious control. Functionally, however, myocardial muscle resembles smooth muscle because its contraction is involuntary. The myocardial muscle fibers are arranged in an interconnected manner (called a syncytium) that allows for coordinated myocardial contraction and relaxation. The sequential pattern of contraction and relaxation of individual muscle fibers ensures the rhythmic behavior of the myocardium as a whole and enables it to function as an effective pump.

\section*{FUNCTION OF THE HEART: CONDUCTION SYSTEM}

The specialized heart cells of the cardiac conduction system methodically generate and coordinate the transmission of electrical impulses to the myocardial cells. The result is sequential atrioventricular contraction, which provides for the most effective flow of blood, thereby optimizing cardiac output. Three physiologic characteristics of the cardiac conduction cells account for this coordination:

Automaticity: ability to initiate an electrical impulse
Excitability: ability to respond to an electrical impulse
Conductivity: ability to transmit an electrical impulse from one cell to another

The sinoatrial (SA) node, referred to as the primary pacemaker of the heart, is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium (Fig. 26-3). The SA node in a normal resting heart has an inherent firing rate of 60 to 100 impulses per minute, but the rate can change in response to the metabolic demands of the body.

The electrical impulses initiated by the SA node are conducted along the myocardial cells of the atria via specialized tracts called internodal pathways. The impulses cause electrical stimulation

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-165.jpg?height=679&width=693&top_left_y=1805&top_left_x=1201}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 26-3 The cardiac conduction system. AV, atrioventricular; SA, sinoatrial.}
\end{figure}
and subsequent contraction of the atria. The impulses are then conducted to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The AV node (located in the right atrial wall near the tricuspid valve) consists of another group of specialized muscle cells similar to those of the SA node. The AV node coordinates the incoming electrical impulses from the atria and, after a slight delay (allowing the atria time to contract and complete ventricular filling), relays the impulse to the ventricles. This impulse is then conducted through a bundle of specialized conduction cells (bundle of His) that travel in the septum separating the left and right ventricles. The bundle of His divides into the right bundle branch (conducting impulses to the right ventricle) and the left bundle branch (conducting impulses to the left ventricle). To transmit impulses to the largest chamber of the heart, the left bundle branch bifurcates into the left anterior and left posterior bundle branches. Impulses travel through the bundle branches to reach the terminal point in the conduction system, called the Purkinje fibers. This is the point at which the myocardial cells are stimulated, causing ventricular contraction.

The heart rate is determined by the myocardial cells with the fastest inherent firing rate. Under normal circumstances, the SA node has the highest inherent rate, the AV node has the secondhighest inherent rate ( 40 to 60 impulses per minute), and the ventricular pacemaker sites have the lowest inherent rate ( 30 to 40 impulses per minute). If the SA node malfunctions, the AV node generally takes over the pacemaker function of the heart at its inherently lower rate. Should both the SA and the AV nodes fail in their pacemaker function, a pacemaker site in the ventricle will fire at its inherent bradycardic rate of 30 to 40 impulses per minute.

\section*{Physiology of Cardiac Conduction}

Cardiac electrical activity is the result of the movement of ions (charged particles such as sodium, potassium, and calcium) across the cell membrane. The electrical changes recorded within a single cell result in what is known as the cardiac action potential (Fig. 26-4).

In the resting state, cardiac muscle cells are polarized, which means an electrical difference exists between the negatively charged inside and the positively charged outside of the cell membrane.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-166.jpg?height=473&width=869&top_left_y=1907&top_left_x=109}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 26-4 Cardiac action potential. The arrows indicate the approximate time and direction of movement of each ion influencing membrane potential. $\mathrm{Ca}^{++}$movement out of the cell is not well defined but is thought to occur during Phase 4.}
\end{figure}

As soon as an electrical impulse is initiated, cell membrane permeability changes and sodium moves rapidly into the cell, while potassium exits the cell. This ionic exchange begins depolarization (electrical activation of the cell), converting the internal charge of the cell to a positive one (see Fig. 26-4). Contraction of the myocardium follows depolarization. The interaction between changes in membrane voltage and muscle contraction is called electromechanical coupling. As one cardiac muscle cell is depolarized, it acts as a stimulus to its neighboring cell, causing it to depolarize. Sufficient depolarization of a single specialized conduction system cell results in depolarization and contraction of the entire myocardium. Repolarization (return of the cell to its resting state) occurs as the cell returns to its baseline or resting state; this corresponds to relaxation of myocardial muscle.

After the rapid influx of sodium into the cell during depolarization, the permeability of the cell membrane to calcium is changed. Calcium enters the cell and is released from intracellular calcium stores. The increase in calcium, which occurs during the plateau phase of repolarization, is much slower than that of sodium and continues for a longer period.

Cardiac muscle, unlike skeletal or smooth muscle, has a prolonged refractory period during which it cannot be restimulated to contract. There are two phases of the refractory period, referred to as the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period. The absolute refractory period is the time during which the heart cannot be restimulated to contract regardless of the strength of the electrical stimulus. This period corresponds with depolarization and the early part of repolarization. During the latter part of repolarization, however, if the electrical stimulus is stronger than normal, the myocardium can be stimulated to contract. This short period at the end of repolarization is called the relative refractory period.

Refractoriness protects the heart from sustained contraction (tetany), which would result in sudden cardiac death. Normal electromechanical coupling and contraction of the heart depend on the composition of the interstitial fluid surrounding the heart muscle cells. In turn, the composition of this fluid is influenced by the composition of the blood. A change in serum calcium concentration may alter the contraction of the heart muscle fibers. A change in serum potassium concentration is also important, because potassium affects the normal electrical voltage of the cell.

\section*{Cardiac Hemodynamics}

An important determinant of blood flow in the cardiovascular system is the principle that fluid flows from a region of higher pressure to one of lower pressure. The pressures responsible for blood flow in the normal circulation are generated during systole and diastole. Figure $26-5$ depicts the pressure differences in the great vessels and in the four chambers of the heart during systole and diastole.

\section*{CARDIAC CYCLE}

Beginning with systole, the pressure inside the ventricles rapidly rises, forcing the atrioventricular valves to close. As a result, blood ceases to flow from the atria into the ventricles and regurgitation (backflow) of blood into the atria is prevented. The rapid rise of pressure inside the right and left ventricles forces the pulmonic and aortic valves to open, and blood is ejected into the pulmonary artery and aorta, respectively. The exit of blood is at first rapid;

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 26-5 Great vessel and chamber pressures. Pressures are identified in millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ) as mean pressure or systolic over diastolic pressure.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-167.jpg?height=1010&width=1267&top_left_y=355&top_left_x=715}
\end{figure}
then, as the pressure in each ventricle and its corresponding artery equalizes, the flow of blood gradually decreases. At the end of systole, pressure within the right and left ventricles rapidly decreases. This lowers pulmonary artery and aortic pressure, causing closure of the semilunar valves. These events mark the onset of diastole.

During diastole, when the ventricles are relaxed and the atrioventricular valves are open, blood returning from the veins flows into the atria and then into the ventricles. Toward the end of this diastolic period, the atrial muscles contract in response to an electrical impulse initiated by the SA node (atrial systole). The resultant contraction raises the pressure inside the atria, ejecting blood into the ventricles. Atrial systole augments ventricular blood volume by $15 \%$ to $25 \%$ and is sometimes referred to as the "atrial kick." At this point, ventricular systole begins in response to propagation of the electrical impulse that began in the SA node some milliseconds previously. The following section reviews the chamber pressures generated during systole and diastole.

Chamber Pressures. In the right side of the heart, the pressure generated during ventricular systole ( 15 to 25 mm Hg ) exceeds the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure ( 8 to 15 mm Hg ), and blood is ejected into the pulmonary circulation. During diastole, venous blood flows into the atrium because pressure in the superior and inferior vena cava ( 8 to 10 mm Hg ) is higher than that in the atrium. Blood flows through the open tricuspid valve and
into the right ventricle until the two right chamber pressures equalize ( 0 to 8 mm Hg ).

In the left side of the heart, similar events occur, although higher pressures are generated. As pressure mounts in the left ventricle during systole ( 110 to 130 mm Hg ), resting aortic pressure $(80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$ is exceeded and blood is ejected into the aorta. During left ventricular ejection, the resultant aortic pressure ( 110 to 130 mm Hg ) forces blood progressively through the arteries. Forward blood flow into the aorta ceases as the ventricle relaxes and pressure drops. During diastole, oxygenated blood returning from the pulmonary circulation via the four pulmonary veins flows into the atrium, where pressure remains low. Blood readily flows into the left ventricle because ventricular pressure is also low. At the end of diastole, pressure in the atrium and ventricle equilibrates ( 4 to 12 mm Hg ). Figure 26-5 depicts the systolic and diastolic pressures in the four chambers of the heart.

Pressure Measurement. Chamber pressures are measured with the use of special monitoring catheters and equipment. This technique is called hemodynamic monitoring. Nurses caring for critically ill patients must have a sophisticated working knowledge of normal chamber pressures and the hemodynamic changes that occur during serious illnesses. The data obtained from hemodynamic monitoring assist with the diagnosis and management of pathophysiologic conditions affecting critically ill patients. Hemodynamic monitoring is covered in more detail at the end of this chapter.

\section*{Cardiac Output}

Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle during a given period. The cardiac output in a resting adult is about 5 L per minute but varies greatly depending on the metabolic needs of the body. Cardiac output is computed by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate. Stroke volume is the amount of blood ejected per heartbeat. The average resting stroke volume is about 70 mL , and the heart rate is 60 to 80 beats per minute (bpm). Cardiac output can be affected by changes in either stroke volume or heart rate.

\section*{CONTROL OF HEART RATE}

Cardiac output must be responsive to changes in the metabolic demands of the tissues. For example, during exercise the total cardiac output may increase fourfold, to 20 L per minute. This increase is normally accomplished by approximate doubling of both the heart rate and the stroke volume. Changes in heart rate are accomplished by reflex controls mediated by the autonomic nervous system, including its sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. The parasympathetic impulses, which travel to the heart through the vagus nerve, can slow the cardiac rate, whereas sympathetic impulses increase it. These effects on heart rate result from action on the SA node, to either decrease or increase its inherent rate. The balance between these two reflex control systems normally determines the heart rate. The heart rate is stimulated also by an increased level of circulating catecholamines (secreted by the adrenal gland) and by excess thyroid hormone, which produces a catecholamine-like effect.

Heart rate is also affected by central nervous system and baroreceptor activity. Baroreceptors are specialized nerve cells located in the aortic arch and in both right and left internal carotid arteries (at the point of bifurcation from the common carotid arteries). The baroreceptors are sensitive to changes in blood pressure (BP). During elevations in BP (hypertension), these cells increase their rate of discharge, transmitting impulses to the medulla. This initiates parasympathetic activity and inhibits sympathetic response, lowering the heart rate and the BP. The opposite is true during hypotension (low BP). Hypotension results in less baroreceptor stimulation, which prompts a decrease in parasympathetic inhibitory activity in the SA node, allowing for enhanced sympathetic activity. The resultant vasoconstriction and increased heart rate elevate the BP.

\section*{CONTROL OF STROKE VOLUME}

Stroke volume is primarily determined by three factors: preload, afterload, and contractility.

Preload is the term used to describe the degree of stretch of the cardiac muscle fibers at the end of diastole. The end of diastole is the period when filling volume in the ventricles is the highest and the degree of stretch on the muscle fibers is the greatest. The volume of blood within the ventricle at the end of diastole determines preload. Preload has a direct effect on stroke volume. As the volume of blood returning to the heart increases, muscle fiber stretch also increases (increased preload), resulting in stronger contraction and a greater stroke volume. This relationship, called the Frank-Starling law of the heart (or sometimes the Starling law of the heart), is maintained until the physiologic limit of the muscle is reached.

The Frank-Starling law is based on the fact that, within limits, the greater the initial length or stretch of the cardiac muscle cells (sarcomeres), the greater the degree of shortening that occurs. This result is caused by increased interaction between the
thick and thin filaments within the cardiac muscle cells. Preload is decreased by a reduction in the volume of blood returning to the ventricles. Diuresis, venodilating agents (eg, nitrates), and loss of blood or body fluids from excessive diaphoresis, vomiting, or diarrhea reduce preload. Preload is increased by increasing the return of circulating blood volume to the ventricles. Controlling the loss of blood or body fluids and replacing fluids (ie, blood transfusions and intravenous fluid administration) are examples of ways to increase preload.

The second determinant of stroke volume is afterload, the amount of resistance to ejection of blood from the ventricle. The resistance of the systemic BP to left ventricular ejection is called systemic vascular resistance. The resistance of the pulmonary BP to right ventricular ejection is called pulmonary vascular resistance. There is an inverse relationship between afterload and stroke volume. For example, afterload is increased by arterial vasoconstriction, which leads to decreased stroke volume. The opposite is true with arterial vasodilation: afterload is reduced because there is less resistance to ejection, and stroke volume increases.

Contractility is a term used to denote the force generated by the contracting myocardium under any given condition. Contractility is enhanced by circulating catecholamines, sympathetic neuronal activity, and certain medications (eg, digoxin, intravenous dopamine or dobutamine). Increased contractility results in increased stroke volume. Contractility is depressed by hypoxemia, acidosis, and certain medications (eg, beta-adrenergic blocking agents such as atenolol [Tenormin]).

The heart can achieve a greatly increased stroke volume (eg, during exercise) by increasing preload (through increased venous return), increasing contractility (through sympathetic nervous system discharge), and decreasing afterload (through peripheral vasodilation with decreased aortic pressure).

The percentage of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected with each stroke is called the ejection fraction. With each stroke, about $42 \%$ (right ventricle) to $50 \%$ (left ventricle) or more of the end-diastolic volume is ejected by the normal heart. The ejection fraction can be used as an index of myocardial contractility: the ejection fraction decreases if contractility is depressed.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Changes in cardiac structure and function are clearly observable in the older heart. To understand the changes specifically related to aging, it is helpful to distinguish the normal aging process from changes related to CVD. The anatomic and functional changes in the aging heart are listed in Table 26-1.

Studies show that the normal aging heart can produce adequate cardiac output under ordinary circumstances but may have a limited ability to respond to situations that cause physical or emotional stress. In an elderly person who is less active, the left ventricle may become smaller (atrophy) as a consequence of physical deconditioning. Aging also results in decreased elasticity and widening of the aorta, thickening and rigidity of the cardiac valves, and increased connective tissue in the SA and AV nodes and bundle branches.

These changes lead to decreased myocardial contractility, increased left ventricular ejection time (prolonged systole), and delayed conduction. Therefore, stressful physical and emotional conditions, especially those that occur suddenly, may have adverse effects on the aged person. The heart cannot respond to such conditions with an adequate rate increase and needs more time to return to a normal resting rate after even a minimal increase in heart rate. In some patients, the added stress may precipitate heart failure (HF).

\section*{GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CARDIAC STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION}

Compared with a man's heart, a woman's heart tends to be smaller. It weighs less and has smaller coronary arteries. These structural differences have significant implications. Because the coronary arteries of a woman are smaller, they occlude from atherosclerosis more easily, making procedures such as cardiac catheterization and angioplasty technically more difficult, with a higher incidence of postprocedure complications. In addition, the resting rate, stroke volume, and ejection fraction of a woman's heart are higher than those of a man's, and the conduction time of an electrical impulse coursing from the SA node through the AV node to the Purkinje fibers is briefer.

Another significant difference between the genders is the physiologic effects of estrogen on the cardiovascular system. Two important effects of estrogen, regulation of vasomotor tone and of response to vascular injury, may be the mechanisms that protect women against the development of atherosclerosis. An additional, potentially beneficial effect of estrogen is its action on the
liver, which results in improved lipid profiles. On the other hand, less favorable effects of estrogen include an increase in coagulation proteins and a decrease in fibrinolytic protein, which enhance the risk of thrombus formation. Progesterone also has vascular effects, but its role in the development of CVD is unclear at this time. Beneficial effects of estrogen disappear after menopause, as evidenced by the increased incidence of CVD in this population. However, because of health risks associated with hormone replacement therapy, the American Heart Association does not recommend its use as a primary or secondary prevention intervention for CVD (Mosca et al., 2001; Roussouw et al., 2002).

\section*{Assessment}

The severity of the patient's symptoms, the practice setting of the nurse, and the purpose of the assessment are factors that need to be considered when determining the frequency and extent of nursing assessment required. The assessment of the acutely ill cardiac patient will be different from that of a patient with stable or chronic cardiac conditions. For example, the assessment per-
formed by an emergency department nurse caring for a patient who is experiencing an acute myocardial infarction (MI) must be very focused and must be performed rapidly. The nurse must assess the patient for complications associated with the MI, screen the patient for contraindications to coronary artery reperfusion strategies including thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and evaluate the patient's response to medical and nursing interventions. For this patient, the health history, physical assessment, and important nursing interventions (eg, cardiac monitoring, administration of intravenous medications) are performed simultaneously.

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

For the patient experiencing an acute MI, the nurse obtains the health history using a few specific questions about the onset and severity of chest discomfort, associated symptoms, current medications, and allergies. At the same time, the nurse observes the
patient's general appearance and evaluates hemodynamic status (heart rate and rhythm, BP ). Once the condition of the patient stabilizes, a more extensive history can be obtained.

With stable patients, a complete health history is obtained during the initial contact. Often, it is helpful to have the patient's spouse or partner available during the health history interview. Initially, demographic information regarding age, gender, and ethnic origin is obtained. The family history, as well as the physical examination, should include assessment for genetic abnormalities associated with cardiovascular disorders (see Genetics in Nursing Practice box). Height, current weight, and usual weight (if there has been a recent weight loss or gain) are established. During the interview, the nurse conveys sensitivity to the cultural background and religious practices of the patient. This removes barriers to communication that may result if the interview is based only on the nurse's personal frame of reference. Patients from different cultural and ethnic groups may have different ways of describing symptoms such as pain and may engage in different health practices before seeking formal medical attention.

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 26-1}

\section*{Racial Differences in Coronary Artery Disease: Symptoms and Seeking Cave}

Richards, S. B., Funk, M., \& Milner, K. A. (2000). Differences between blacks and whites with coronary heart disease in initial symptoms and delay in seeking care. American Journal of Critical Care, 9, 237-244.

\section*{Purpose}

Mortality rates due to coronary artery disease (CAD) are higher in African American men ( $7 \%$ ) and African American women ( $35 \%$ ) than in their Caucasian counterparts. Recent findings suggest that African Americans may delay longer than Caucasians in seeking emergency care and commonly have atypical symptom presentation. The purpose of this study was to explore differences between African Americans and Caucasians in both manifestations of symptoms of CAD and delay in seeking treatment by answering the following research questions:
- Do African Americans and Caucasians differ in their manifestation of symptoms of CAD?
- Among patients with confirmed CAD, do African Americans and Caucasians differ in the elapsed time between the onset of symptoms and arrival at the emergency department?

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This study, part of a larger study investigating aspects of CAD presentation, is the first of its kind to use a prospective, observational design. One member of the team of nurse researchers unobtrusively observed patients in the emergency department as they described their symptoms to the clinician.

The sample consisted of African Americans and Caucasians drawn from a total of 545 patients who were recruited from the emergency department of an 810 -bed university teaching hospital. Patients with one or more typical or atypical symptoms of CAD, who met agespecific inclusion criteria based on the Framingham Heart Study, were enrolled. Electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme criteria were used to confirm the diagnosis of angina or myocardial infarction.

\section*{Findings}

Of the 231 patients with CAD, 40 (17\%) were African American and $191(82.7 \%)$ were Caucasian. The majority of the patients were male $(58 \%)$. Ages ranged from 31 to 91 years. There were statistically sig-
nificant differences in age and cardiac risk factors between the groups of African Americans and Caucasians. The mean age was significantly younger in African Americans than in Caucasians. Caucasians were more likely than African Americans to have hyperlipidemia, and African Americans were more likely than Caucasians to have hypertension.

Among all patients, shortness of breath, not chest pain, was the most common symptom $(39.8 \%)$. Next, in descending order, were substernal chest pain ( $34 \%$ ) and arm pain ( $27.2 \%$ ). Both research questions were answered affirmatively. African Americans were more likely than Caucasians to have atypical presentation of acute CAD symptoms. These patients, the majority of whom were female ( $62.5 \%$ ), were about three times more likely than Caucasians to experience shortness of breath as the predominant symptom and two times more likely to complain of left-sided chest pain. African Americans were found to have a median delay time of 11 hours, while Caucasians delayed 5 hours. This difference was significant ( $p=.05$ ), demonstrating a trend toward longer delays by African Americans compared with Caucasians. Nineteen people in this study delayed 72 hours or longer before seeking treatment.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Studies such as this one contribute to the growing body of evidence showing that there are racial differences in the presentation of acute CAD. Nurses and other health care professionals need to be aware that "atypical" symptoms of angina and myocardial infarction, such as shortness of breath or left-sided chest pain, are common, especially among African Americans. Any patient with shortness of breath or left-sided chest pain should be assessed for other symptoms of CAD. Nurses should consult with nurse practitioners or physicians regarding diagnostic studies for CAD for any patient experiencing one or both of these symptoms. Nurses can teach colleagues and the lay public about shortness of breath, left-sided chest pain, and other symptoms of CAD and instruct them on how to access the emergency medical system if any of these symptoms are experienced.

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Cardiovascular Disorders}

Several cardiovascular disorders are associated with genetic abnormalities. Some examples are:
- Familial hypercholesterolemia
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Long QT syndrome (LQTS)
- Hereditary hemochromatosis
- Elevated homocystine levels

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Assess all patients with cardiovascular symptoms for coronary artery disease, regardless of age (early-onset CAD occurs).
- Assess family history of sudden death in persons who may or may not have been diagnosed with coronary disease (especially of early onset).
- Ask about sudden death in a previously asymptomatic child, adolescent, or adult.
- Ask about other family members with biochemical or neuromuscular conditions (eg, hemochromatosis or muscular dystrophy).
- Assess whether DNA mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on an affected family member

\section*{ASSESSMENT}
- Assess for signs and symptoms of hyperlipidemias (xanthomas, corneal arcus, abdominal pain of unexplained origin).
- Assess for muscular weakness.

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that the family can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of genetic testing, and genebased interventions
- Offer appropriate genetic information and resources (eg, Genetic Alliance website, American Heart Association, Muscular Dystrophy Association)
- Provide support to families newly diagnosed with geneticrelated cardiovascular disease

The baseline information derived from the history assists in identifying pertinent issues related to the patient's condition and educational and self-care needs. Once these problems are clearly identified, a plan of care is instituted. During subsequent contacts or visits with the patient, a more focused health history is performed to determine whether goals have been met, whether the plan needs to be modified, and whether new problems have developed. During the interview, the nurse asks questions to evaluate cardiac symptoms and health status.

\section*{Cardiac Signs and Symptoms}

Patients with cardiovascular disorders commonly have one or more of the following signs and symptoms:
- Chest pain or discomfort (angina pectoris, MI, valvular heart disease)
- Shortness of breath or dyspnea (MI, left ventricular failure, HF)
- Edema and weight gain (right ventricular failure, HF)
- Palpitations (dysrhythmias resulting from myocardial ischemia, valvular heart disease, ventricular aneurysm, stress, electrolyte imbalance)
- Fatigue (earliest symptom associated with several cardiovascular disorders)
- Dizziness and syncope or loss of consciousness (postural hypotension, dysrhythmias, vasovagal effect, cerebrovascular disorders)

Not all chest discomfort is related to myocardial ischemia. When a patient has chest discomfort, questions should focus on differentiating a serious, life-threatening condition such as MI from conditions that are less serious or that would be treated differently (see Table 26-2).

The following points should be remembered when assessing patients with cardiac symptoms:
- Women are more likely to present with atypical symptoms of MI than are men.
- There is little correlation between the severity of the chest discomfort and the gravity of its cause. Elderly people and those with diabetes may not have pain with angina or MI because of neuropathies. Fatigue and shortness of breath may be the predominant symptoms in these patients.
- There is poor correlation between the location of chest discomfort and its source.
- The patient may have more than one clinical condition occurring simultaneously.
- In a patient with a history of CAD, the chest discomfort should be assumed to be secondary to ischemia until proven otherwise.

NURSING ALERT People experiencing myocardial ischemia can have a variety of symptoms. The typical symptom is angina presenting as pressure, fullness, squeezing pain, or discomfort in the center of the chest. This pain may radiate to the shoulders, neck, jaw, or arms. Angina can also have an atypical or uncommon presentation, referred to as anginal equivalent. It is characterized by shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, or pain in other parts of the upper body, including the neck, shoulder, jaw, arm, back, or stomach. Angina patterns are usually predictable (eg, with activity). Rest or sublingual nitroglycerin relieves symptoms within a few minutes. A patient in the midst of an MI, however, can present with angina or its equivalent symptoms, which last longer than 15 minutes. Signs and symptoms associated with an MI include lightheadedness, fainting, diaphoresis, unexplained anxiety, nausea, and shortness of breath. Symptoms are unrelieved by rest or nitroglycerin.

\section*{HEALTH PERCEPTION AND MANAGEMENT}

In an effort to determine how patients perceive their current health status. The nurse might ask some of the following questions:

Do you have any health problems? If so, what do you think caused them?
How has your health been recently? Have you noticed any changes from last year? from 5 years ago?
Do you have a cardiologist or primary health care provider? How often do you go for checkups?
Do you use tobacco or consume alcohol?
What are your risk factors for heart disease? What do you do to stay healthy and take care of your heart?
What prescription and over-the-counter medications are you taking? Do you take vitamins or herbal supplements?
Some patients may not be aware of their own medical diagnosis. For example, patients may not realize that their heart attack was caused by CAD. Patients who do not understand that their behaviors or diagnoses pose a threat to their health may be less motivated to make lifestyle changes or to manage their illness effectively. On the other hand, patients who perceive that their modifiable cardiovascular risk factors have contributed to their health conditions may be more likely to change these behaviors (Chart 26-1).

The patient's ability to recognize cardiac symptoms and to know what to do when they occur is essential for effective self-care

\section*{Risk Factors for Heart Disease}

Nonmodifiable risk factors include the following:
Positive family history for premature coronary artery disease
Increasing age
Gender (men and postmenopausal women)
Race (higher incidence in African Americans than in Caucasians)
Modifiable risk factors include the following:
Hyperlipidemia
Hypertension
Cigarette smoking
Elevated blood glucose level (ie, diabetes mellitus)
Obesity
Physical inactivity
Type A personality characteristics, particularly hostility
Use of oral contraceptives
management. All too often, patients' new symptoms or symptoms of progressing cardiac dysfunction go unrecognized. This results in prolonged delays in seeking life-saving treatment. Major barriers to seeking prompt medical care include lack of knowledge about symptoms to expect with heart disease, attribution of symptoms to a benign source, psychological factors such as denial of symptom significance, and social factors, specifically feeling embarrassed about having symptoms (Zerwic, 1999).

An additional issue to consider is the patient's medication history, dosages, and schedules. Is the patient independent in taking medications? Are the medications taken as prescribed? Does the patient understand why the medication regimen is important? Are doses ever forgotten or skipped, or does the patient ever decide to stop taking a medication? An aspirin a day is a common nonprescription medication that improves patient outcomes after an MI. However, if patients are not aware of this benefit, they may be inclined to stop taking aspirin if they think it is a trivial medication. A careful medication history will often uncover common medication errors and causes for nonadherence to the medication regimen.

Table 26-2 summarizes the characteristics and patterns of the more common cardiac and noncardiac causes of chest pain. Table 26-3 identifies typical questions nurses use to assess cardiac signs and symptoms, as well as those used to determine the patient's ability to recognize and manage them. Some of the patient's responses may require further clarification and follow-up.

\section*{NUTRITION AND METABOLISM}

Dietary modifications, exercise, weight loss, and careful monitoring are important strategies for managing three major cardiovascular risk factors: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia (diabetes mellitus). Diets that are restricted in sodium, fat, cholesterol, and/or calories are commonly prescribed. The nurse should obtain the following information:
- The patient's current height and weight (to determine body mass index), waist measurement (assessment for obesity), BP , and any laboratory test results such as blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (diabetes), total blood cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoprotein levels, and triglyceride levels (hyperlipidemia).
- How often the patient self-monitors BP, blood glucose, and weight as appropriate to the medical diagnoses.
- The patient's level of awareness regarding his or her target goals for each of the risk factors and any problems achieving or maintaining these goals.
- What the patient normally eats and drinks in a typical day and any food preferences (including cultural or ethnic preferences).
- Eating habits (canned or commercially prepared foods versus fresh foods, restaurant cooking versus home cooking, assessing for high sodium foods, dietary intake of fats).
- Who shops for groceries and prepares meals.

\section*{ELIMINATION}

Typical bowel and bladder habits need to be identified. Nocturia (awakening at night to urinate) is common for patients with HF. Fluid collected in the dependent tissues (extremities) during the day redistributes into the circulatory system once the patient is recumbent at night. The increased circulatory volume is excreted by the kidneys (increased urine production). Patients need to be aware of their response to diuretic therapy and any changes in urination. This is vitally important for patients with HF. Patients may be taught to modify (titrate) their dose of diuretics based on urinary pattern, daily weight, and symptoms of dyspnea.

\end{tabular}

To avoid straining, patients who become easily constipated need to establish a regular bowel regimen. When straining, the patient tends to bear down (the Valsalva maneuver), which momentarily increases pressure on the baroreceptors. This triggers a vagal response, causing the heart rate to slow down and resulting in syncope in some patients. For the same reason, straining during urination should be avoided. Because many cardiac medications can cause gastrointestinal side effects or bleeding, the nurse asks about bloating, diarrhea, constipation, stomach upset, heartburn, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Patients taking platelet-inhibiting medications such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix); intravenous GP IIb/IIIa platelet aggregation inhibitors such as abciximab (ReoPro), eptifibatide (Integrilin), and tirofiban (Aggrastat); and anticoagulants such as low-molecular-weight
heparin (ie, dalteparin [Fragmin]), enoxaparin (Lovenox), heparin, or warfarin (Coumadin) are screened for bloody urine or stools.

\section*{ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE}

As the nurse assesses the patient's activity and exercise history, it is important to note that decreases in activity tolerance are typically gradual and may go unnoticed by the patient. Therefore, the nurse needs to determine whether there has been a change in the activity pattern during the last 6 to 12 months. The patient's subjective response to activity is an essential assessment parameter. New symptoms or a change in the usual angina or angina equivalent during activity is a significant finding. Fatigue, associated with low ejection fraction and certain medications (eg, beta-blockers), can result in activity intolerance. Patients with fatigue may benefit

from having their medications adjusted and learning energy conservation techniques.

Additional areas to ask about include possible architectural barriers and challenges in the home, and what the patient does for exercise. If the patient exercises, the nurse asks additional questions: What is the intensity, and how long and how often is exercise performed? Has the patient ever participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program? Functional levels are known to improve for almost all patients who participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program, and attendance is highly recommended (Smith et al., 2001). Patients with disabilities may require an individually tailored exercise program.

\section*{SLEEP AND REST}

Clues to worsening cardiac disease, especially HF, can be revealed by sleep-related events. Determining where the patient sleeps or rests is important. Recent changes, such as sleeping upright in a chair instead of in bed, increasing the number of pillows used, awakening short of breath at night (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea [PND]), or awakening with angina (nocturnal angina), are all indicative of worsening HF.

\section*{COGNITION AND PERCEPTION}

Evaluating cognitive ability helps to determine whether the patient has the mental capacity to manage safe and effective selfcare. Is the patient's short-term memory intact? Is there any history of dementia? Is there evidence of depression or anxiety? Can the patient read? Can the patient read English? What is the patient's reading level? What is the patient's preferred learning style? What information does the patient perceive as important?

Providing the patient with written information can be a valuable part of patient education, but only if the patient can read and comprehend the information. Related assessments include possible hearing or visual impairments. If vision is impaired, patients with HF may not be able to weigh themselves independently nor keep records of weight, BP, pulse, or other data requested by the health care team.

\section*{SELF-PERCEPTION AND SELF-CONCEPT}

Personality factors are associated with the development of and recovery from CAD. Most commonly cited is "type A behavior," which is characterized by competitive, hard-driving behaviors and a sense of time urgency. Although this behavior is not an independent risk factor for CAD, anger and hostility (personality traits common in people with "type A behavior") do affect the heart. People with these traits react to frustrating situations with an increase in BP, heart rate, and neuroendocrine responses. This
physiologic activation, called cardiac reactivity, is thought to trigger acute cardiovascular events (Woods et al., 1999).

During the health history, the nurse discovers how patients feel about themselves by asking questions such as: How would you describe yourself? Have you changed the way you feel about yourself since your heart attack or surgery? Do you find that you are easily angered or hostile? How do you feel right now? What helps to manage these feelings? To fully evaluate this health pattern, assistance from a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist, psychologist, or psychiatrist may be necessary.

\section*{ROLES AND RELATIONSHIPS}

Determining the patient's social support systems is vitally important in today's health care environment. Hospital stays for cardiac illnesses have shortened. Many invasive diagnostic cardiac procedures, such as cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) are performed as outpatient procedures. Patients are discharged back into the community with activity limitations, such as driving restrictions, and with greater nursing care and educational needs. These needs have significant implications for people who are independent under normal circumstances, and for people who are at higher risk for problems, such as older adults.

To assess support systems, the nurse needs to ask: Who is the primary caregiver? With whom does the patient live? Are there adequate services in place to provide a safe home environment? The nurse also assesses for any significant effects the cardiac illness has had on the patient's role in the family. Are there adequate finances and health insurance? The answers to these questions will assist the nurse in developing a plan to meet the patient's home care needs.

\section*{SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION}

Although people recovering from cardiac illnesses or procedures are concerned about sexual activity, they are less likely to ask their nurse or other health care provider for information to help them resume their normal sex life. Lack of correct information and fear lead to reduced frequency and satisfaction with sexual activity. Therefore, nurses need to initiate this discussion with patients and not wait for them to bring it up in conversation. At first, inform the patient that it is common for people with similar heart problems to worry about resuming sexual activity. Then ask the patient to talk about his or her concerns.

The most commonly cited reasons for changes in sexual activity are fear of another heart attack or sudden death; untoward symptoms such as angina, dyspnea, or palpitations; and problems
with impotence or depression. In men, impotence may develop as a side effect of cardiac medications (beta-adrenergic blocking agents) and may prompt patients to stop taking them. Other medications can be substituted, so patients should be encouraged to discuss this problem with their health care provider. Often, patients and their partners do not have adequate information about the physical demands related to sexual activity and ways in which these demands can be modified. The physiologic demands are greatest during orgasm, reaching 5 or 6 metabolic equivalents (METs). This level of activity is equivalent to walking 3 to 4 miles per hour on a treadmill. The METs expended before and after orgasm are considerably less, at 3.7 METs (Steinke, 2000). Having this information may make patients and their partners more comfortable with resuming sexual activity.

A reproductive history is necessary for women of childbearing age, particularly those with seriously compromised cardiac function. These women may be advised by their physicians not to become pregnant. The reproductive history includes information about previous pregnancies, plans for future pregnancies, oral contraceptive use (especially in women older than 35 years of age who are smokers), and use of hormone replacement therapy.

\section*{COPING AND STRESS TOLERANCE}

It is important to determine the presence of psychosocial factors that adversely affect cardiac health. Anxiety, depression, and stress are known to influence both the development of and recovery from CAD. High levels of anxiety are associated with an increased incidence of CAD and increased in-hospital complication rates after MI. People with depression have an increased risk of MIand heart disease-related death, compared to people without depression. It is postulated that people who are depressed feel hopeless and are less motivated to make lifestyle changes and follow treatment plans, explaining the association between mortality and depression (Buselli \& Stuart, 1999).

Stress initiates a variety of physiologic responses, including increases in the circulation of catecholamines and cortisol, and has been strongly linked to cardiovascular events. Therefore, patients need to be assessed for presence of negative and positive emotions, as well as sources of stress. This is achieved by asking questions about recent or ongoing stressors, previous coping styles and effectiveness, and the patient's perception of his or her current mood and coping ability. To adequately evaluate this health pattern, consultation with a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist, psychologist, or psychiatrist may be indicated.

\section*{PREVENTION STRATEGIES}

Additional features of the health history include identification of risk factors and measures taken by the patient to prevent disease. The nurse's questions need to focus on the patient's health promotion practices. Epidemiologic studies show that certain conditions or behaviors (ie, risk factors) are associated with a greater incidence of coronary artery, peripheral vascular, and cerebrovascular disease. Risk factors are classified by the extent to which they can be modified by changing one's lifestyle or modifying personal behaviors.

Once a patient's risk factors are determined, the nurse assesses whether the patient has a plan for making necessary behavioral changes and whether assistance is needed to support these lifestyle changes. For example, tobacco use is the most common avoidable cause of CAD. The first step in treating this health risk is to identify patients who use tobacco products and those who have recently quit. Because $70 \%$ of smokers visit a health care facility each
year, nurses have ample opportunities to assess patients for tobacco use. For those who use tobacco, it is imperative to ask whether they are willing to quit. Provide cessation advice, motivation to quit, and relapse prevention strategies, as outlined in a U.S. Public Health Service report (The Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline Update Panel, Staff, and Consortium Representatives, 2000), can be delivered. For patients who have obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, the nurse determines any problems the patient may be having following the prescribed management plan (ie, diet, exercise, and medications). It may be necessary to clarify the patient's responsibilities, assist with finding additional resources, or make alternative plans for risk factor modification.

Comprehensive secondary prevention strategies (early diagnosis and prompt intervention to halt or slow the disease process and its consequences) aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk factors improve overall survival, improve quality of life, reduce the need for revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass surgery and PTCA), and reduce the incidence of subsequent MIs. The overall benefits of secondary prevention also apply to other patient groups with atherosclerotic vascular disease, including patients with transient ischemic attacks, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (the leading cause of disability and death in these patients being CAD). Despite these findings, only one third of eligible patients, over the long term, adhere to risk factor interventions. Patient compliance increases significantly with a team approach that includes long-term follow-up with office or clinic visits and telephone contact (Smith et al., 2001).

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

A physical examination is performed to confirm the data obtained in the health history. In addition to observing the patient's general appearance, a cardiac physical examination should include an evaluation of the following:
- Effectiveness of the heart as a pump
- Filling volumes and pressures
- Cardiac output
- Compensatory mechanisms

Indications that the heart is not contracting sufficiently or functioning effectively as a pump include reduced pulse pressure, cardiac enlargement, and murmurs and gallop rhythms (abnormal heart sounds).

The amount of blood filling the atria and ventricles and the resulting pressures (called filling volumes and pressures) are estimated by the degree of jugular vein distention and the presence or absence of congestion in the lungs, peripheral edema, and postural changes in BP that occur when the individual sits up or stands.

Cardiac output is reflected by cognition, heart rate, pulse pressure, color and texture of the skin, and urine output. Examples of compensatory mechanisms that help maintain cardiac output are increased filling volumes and elevated heart rate. Note that the findings on the physical examination are correlated with data obtained from diagnostic procedures, such as hemodynamic monitoring (discussed later).

The examination, which proceeds logically from head to toe, can be performed in about 10 minutes with practice and covers the following areas: (1) general appearance, (2) cognition, (3) skin, (4) BP, (5) arterial pulses, (6) jugular venous pulsations and pressures, (7) heart, (8) extremities, (9) lungs, and (10) abdomen.

\section*{General Appearance and Cognition}

The nurse observes the patient's level of distress, level of consciousness, and thought processes as an indication of the heart's ability to propel oxygen to the brain (cerebral perfusion). The nurse also observes for evidence of anxiety, along with any effects emotional factors may have on cardiovascular status. The nurse attempts to put the anxious patient at ease throughout the examination.

\section*{Inspection of the Skin}

Examination of the skin begins during the evaluation of the general appearance of the patient and continues throughout the assessment. It includes all body surfaces, starting with the head and finishing with the lower extremities. Skin color, temperature, and texture are assessed. The more common findings associated with cardiovascular disease are as follows.
- Pallor-a decrease in the color of the skin-is caused by lack of oxyhemoglobin. It is a result of anemia or decreased arterial perfusion. Pallor is best observed around the fingernails, lips, and oral mucosa. In patients with dark skin, the nurse observes the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
- Peripheral cyanosis-a bluish tinge, most often of the nails and skin of the nose, lips, earlobes, and extremities - suggests decreased flow rate of blood to a particular area, which allows more time for the hemoglobin molecule to become desaturated. This may occur normally in peripheral vasoconstriction associated with a cold environment, in patients with anxiety, or in disease states such as HF.
- Central cyanosis-a bluish tinge observed in the tongue and buccal mucosa-denotes serious cardiac disorders (pulmonary edema and congenital heart disease) in which venous blood passes through the pulmonary circulation without being oxygenated.
- Xanthelasma-yellowish, slightly raised plaques in the skin-may be observed along the nasal portion of one or both eyelids and may indicate elevated cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolemia).
- Reduced skin turgor occurs with dehydration and aging.
- Temperature and moistness are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Normally the skin is warm and dry. Under stress, the hands may become cool and moist. In cardiogenic shock, sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction, and the skin becomes cold and clammy. During an acute MI, diaphoresis is common.
- Ecchymosis (bruise)-a purplish-blue color fading to green, yellow, or brown over time-is associated with blood outside of the blood vessels and is usually caused by trauma. Patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy should be carefully observed for unexplained ecchymosis. In these patients, excessive bruising indicates prolonged clotting times (prothrombin or partial thromboplastin time) caused by an anticoagulant dosage that is too high.
- Wounds, scars, and tissue surrounding implanted devices should also be examined. Wounds are assessed for adequate healing, and any scars from previous surgeries are noted. The skin surrounding a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator generator is examined for thinning, which could indicate erosion of the device through the skin.

\section*{Blood Pressure}

Systemic arterial BP is the pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries during ventricular systole and diastole. It is affected by factors such as cardiac output, distention of the arteries, and the volume, velocity, and viscosity of the blood. BP usually is expressed as the ratio of the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure, with normal adult values ranging from $100 / 60$ to $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The average normal BP usually cited is $120 / 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. An increase in BP above the upper normal range is called hypertension (see Chap. 32 for further definitions and management), whereas a decrease below the lower range is called hypotension.

\section*{BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT}

BP can be measured with the use of invasive arterial monitoring systems (discussed later) or noninvasively by a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope or by an automated BP monitoring device. A detailed description of the procedure for obtaining BP can be found in nursing skills textbooks, and specific manufacturer's instructions review the proper use of the automated monitoring devices. Several important details must be observed to ensure that BP measurements are accurate; these are highlighted in Chart 26-2.

\section*{PULSE PRESSURE}

The difference between the systolic and the diastolic pressures is called the pulse pressure. It is a reflection of stroke volume, ejection velocity, and systemic vascular resistance. Pulse pressure, which normally is 30 to 40 mm Hg , indicates how well the patient maintains cardiac output. The pulse pressure increases in conditions that elevate the stroke volume (anxiety, exercise, bradycardia), reduce systemic vascular resistance (fever), or reduce distensibility of the arteries (atherosclerosis, aging, hypertension). Decreased pulse pressure is an abnormal condition reflecting reduced stroke volume and ejection velocity (shock, HF, hypovolemia, mitral regurgitation) or obstruction to blood flow during systole (mitral or aortic

Ensuring Accurate Blood Pressure Measurement
- Cuff size must be appropriate for the patient. (The cuff size should have a bladder width at least $40 \%$ and length at least $80 \%$ of limb circumference.) The average adult cuff is 12 to 14 cm wide and 30 cm long. Using a cuff that is too small will give a high reading, whereas, too large a cuff results in a falsely low reading.
- Calibration of the sphygmomanometer should be performed routinely to ensure accuracy of blood pressure reading.
- Cuff is firmly wrapped around the arm, and cuff bladder is centered over the brachial artery.
- Patient's arm should be at heart level.
- Initial recordings are made on both arms, and subsequent measurements are taken on the arm with the higher pressure. Normally, in the absence of disease of the vasculature, there is a difference of no more than 5 mm Hg between arm pressures.
- Position of the patient and site of blood pressure measurement (eg, RA for right arm) are recorded.
- Palpation of the systolic pressure before auscultation helps to detect an auscultatory gap more readily.
- The patient is asked not to talk during blood pressure measurements. A significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate occurs when subjects are talking.
stenosis). A pulse pressure of less than 30 mm Hg signifies a serious reduction in cardiac output and requires further cardiovascular assessment.

\section*{POSTURAL BLOOD PRESSURE CHANGES}

Postural (orthostatic) hypotension occurs when the BP drops significantly after the patient assumes an upright posture. It is usually accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope.

Although there are many causes of postural hypotension, the three most common causes in patients with cardiac problems are a reduced volume of fluid or blood in the circulatory system (intravascular volume depletion, dehydration), inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms, and insufficient autonomic effect on vascular constriction. Postural changes in BP and an appropriate history help health care providers differentiate among these causes. The following recommendations are important when assessing postural BP changes:
- Position the patient supine and flat (as symptoms permit) for 10 minutes before taking the initial BP and heart rate measurements.
- Check supine measurements before checking upright measurements.
- Do not remove the BP cuff between position changes, but check to see that it is still correctly placed.
- Assess postural BP changes with the patient sitting on the edge of the bed with feet dangling and, if appropriate, with the patient standing at the side of the bed.
- Wait 1 to 3 minutes after each postural change before measuring BP and heart rate.
- Be alert for any signs or symptoms of patient distress. If necessary, return the patient to a lying position before completing the test.
- Record both heart rate and BP and indicate the corresponding position (e.g., lying, sitting, standing) and any signs or symptoms that accompany the postural change.
Normal postural responses that occur when a person stands up or goes from a lying to a sitting position include (1) a heart rate increase of 5 to 20 bpm above the resting rate (to offset reduced stroke volume and maintain cardiac output); (2) an unchanged systolic pressure, or a slight decrease of up to 10 mm Hg ; and (3) a slight increase of 5 mm Hg in diastolic pressure.

A decrease in the amount of blood or fluid in the circulatory system should be suspected after diuretic therapy or bleeding, when a postural change results in an increased heart rate and either a decrease in systolic pressure by 15 mm Hg or a drop in the diastolic pressure by 10 mm Hg . Vital signs alone do not differentiate between a decrease in intravascular volume and inadequate constriction of the blood vessels as a cause of postural hypotension. With intravascular volume depletion, the reflexes that maintain cardiac output (increased heart rate and peripheral vasoconstriction) function correctly; the heart rate increases, and the peripheral vessels constrict. However, because of lost volume, the BP falls. With inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms, the heart rate again responds appropriately, but because of diminished peripheral vasoconstriction the BP drops. The following is an example of a postural BP recording showing either intravascular volume depletion or inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms:

Lying down, BP 120/70, heart rate 70
Sitting, BP $100 / 55$, heart rate 90
Standing, BP 98/52, heart rate 94

In autonomic insufficiency, the heart rate is unable to increase to completely compensate for the gravitational effects of an upright posture. Peripheral vasoconstriction may be absent or diminished. Autonomic insufficiency does not rule out a concurrent decrease in intravascular volume. The following is an example of autonomic insufficiency as demonstrated by postural BP changes:

Lying down, BP 150/90, heart rate 60
Sitting, BP 100/60, heart rate 60

\section*{Arterial Pulses}

Factors to be evaluated in examining the pulse are rate, rhythm, quality, configuration of the pulse wave, and quality of the arterial vessel.

\section*{PULSE RATE}

The normal pulse rate varies from a low of 50 bpm in healthy, athletic young adults to rates well in excess of 100 bpm after exercise or during times of excitement. Anxiety frequently raises the pulse rate during the physical examination. If the rate is higher than expected, it is appropriate to reassess it near the end of the physical examination, when the patient may be more relaxed.

\section*{PULSE RHYTHM}

The rhythm of the pulse is as important to assess as the rate. Minor variations in regularity of the pulse are normal. The pulse rate, particularly in young people, increases during inhalation and slows during exhalation. This is called sinus arrhythmia.

For the initial cardiac examination, or if the pulse rhythm is irregular, the heart rate should be counted by auscultating the apical pulse for a full minute while simultaneously palpating the radial pulse.

Any discrepancy between contractions heard and pulses felt is noted. Disturbances of rhythm (dysrhythmias) often result in a pulse deficit, a difference between the apical rate (the heart rate heard at the apex of the heart) and the peripheral rate. Pulse deficits commonly occur with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, premature ventricular contractions, and varying degrees of heart block. See Chapter 27 for a detailed discussion of these dysrhythmias.

To understand the complexity of dysrhythmias that may be encountered during the examination, the nurse needs to have a sophisticated knowledge of cardiac electrophysiology, obtained through advanced education and training.

\section*{PULSE QUALITY}

The quality, or amplitude, of the pulse can be described as absent, diminished, normal, or bounding. It should be assessed bilaterally. Scales can be used to rate the strength of the pulse. The following is an example of a 0 -to- 4 scale:

\begin{tabular}{rl}
0 & pulse not palpable or absent \\
+1 & weak, thready pulse; difficult to palpate; \\
& obliterated with pressure \\
+2 & diminished pulse; cannot be obliterated \\
+3 & easy to palpate, full pulse; cannot be obliterated \\
+4 & strong, bounding pulse; may be abnormal
\end{tabular}

The numerical classification is quite subjective; therefore, when documenting the pulse quality, it helps to specify a scale range (eg, "left radial $+3 /+4$ ").

\section*{PULSE CONFIGURATION}

The configuration (contour) of the pulse conveys important information. In patients with stenosis of the aortic valve, the valve
opening is narrowed, reducing the amount of blood ejected into the aorta. The pulse pressure is narrow, and the pulse feels feeble. In aortic insufficiency, the aortic valve does not close completely, allowing blood to flow back or leak from the aorta into the left ventricle. The rise of the pulse wave is abrupt and strong, and its fall is precipitous-a "collapsing" or "water hammer" pulse. The true configuration of the pulse is best appreciated by palpating over the carotid artery rather than the distal radial artery, because the dramatic characteristics of the pulse wave may be distorted when the pulse is transmitted to smaller vessels.

\section*{EFFECT OF VESSEL QUALITY ON PULSE}

The condition of the vessel wall also influences the pulse and is of concern, especially in older patients. Once rate and rhythm have been determined, the nurse assesses the quality of the vessel by palpating along the radial artery and comparing it with normal vessels. Does the vessel wall appear to be thickened? Is it tortuous?

To assess peripheral circulation, the nurse locates and evaluates all arterial pulses. Arterial pulses are palpated at points where the arteries are near the skin surface and are easily compressed against bones or firm musculature. Pulses are detected over the temporal, carotid, brachial, radial, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries. A reliable assessment of the pulses of the lower extremities depends on accurate identification of the location of the artery and careful palpation of the area. Light palpation is essential; firm finger pressure can easily obliterate the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses and confuse the examiner. In approximately $10 \%$ of patients, the dorsalis pedis pulses are not palpable. In such circumstances, both are usually absent together, and the posterior tibial arteries alone provide adequate blood supply to the feet. Arteries in the extremities are often palpated simultaneously to facilitate comparison of quality. NURSING ALERT Do not palpate temporal or carotid arteries simultaneously, because it is possible to decrease the blood flow to the brain.

\section*{Jugular Venous Pulsations}

An estimate of right-sided heart function can be made by observing the pulsations of the jugular veins of the neck. This provides a means of estimating central venous pressure, which reflects right atrial or right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (the pressure immediately preceding the contraction of the right ventricle).

Pulsations of the internal jugular veins are most commonly assessed. If they are difficult to see, pulsations of the external jugular veins may be noted. These veins are more superficial and are visible just above the clavicles, adjacent to the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The external jugular veins are frequently distended while the patient lies supine on the examining table or bed. As the patient's head is elevated, the distention of the veins disappears. The veins normally are not apparent if the head of the bed or examining table is elevated more than 30 degrees.

Obvious distention of the veins with the patient's head elevated 45 degrees to 90 degrees indicates an abnormal increase in the volume of the venous system. This is associated with right-sided HF, less commonly with obstruction of blood flow in the superior vena cava, and rarely with acute massive pulmonary embolism.

\section*{Heart Inspection and Palpation}

The heart is examined indirectly by inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation of the chest wall. A systematic approach is the cornerstone of a thorough assessment. Examination of the chest wall is performed in the following six areas (Fig. 26-6):
1. Aortic area-second intercostal space to the right of the sternum. To determine the correct intercostal space, start at the angle of Louis by locating the bony ridge near the top of the sternum, at the junction of the body and the manubrium. From this angle, locate the second intercostal space by sliding one finger to the left or right of the sternum. Subsequent intercostal spaces are located from this reference point by palpating down the rib cage.
2. Pulmonic area-second intercostal space to the left of the sternum
3. Erb's point-third intercostal space to the left of the sternum
4. Right ventricular or tricuspid area-fourth and fifth intercostal spaces to the left of the sternum
5. Left ventricular or apical area-the PMI, location on the chest where heart contractions can be palpated
6. Epigastric area-below the xiphoid process

For most of the examination, the patient lies supine, with the head slightly elevated. The right-handed examiner is positioned at the right side of the patient and the left-handed examiner at the left side.

In a systematic fashion, each area of the precordium is inspected and then palpated. Oblique lighting is used to assist the examiner in identifying subtle pulsation. A normal impulse that is distinct and located over the apex of the heart is called the apical impulse (PMI). It may be observed in young people and in older people who are thin. The apical impulse is normally located and auscultated in the left fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line (Fig. 26-7).

In many cases, the apical impulse is palpable and is normally felt as a light pulsation, 1 to 2 cm in diameter. It is felt at the onset of the first heart sound and lasts for only half of systole. (See the next section for a discussion of heart sounds.) The nurse uses the palm of the hand to locate the apical impulse initially and the fingerpads to assess its size and quality. A broad and forceful apical impulse is

known as a left ventricular heave or lift. It is so named because it appears to lift the hand from the chest wall during palpation.

An apical impulse below the fifth intercostal space or lateral to the midclavicular line usually denotes left ventricular enlargement from left ventricular failure. Normally, the apical impulse is palpable in only one intercostal space; palpability in two or more adjacent intercostal spaces indicates left ventricular enlargement. If the apical impulse can be palpated in two distinctly separate areas and the pulsation movements are paradoxical (not simultaneous), a ventricular aneurysm should be suspected.

Abnormal, turbulent blood flow within the heart may be palpated with the palm of the hand as a purring sensation. This phenomenon is called a thrill and is associated with a loud murmur. A thrill is always indicative of significant pathology within the heart. Thrills also may be palpated over vessels when blood flow is significantly and substantially obstructed and over the carotid arteries if aortic stenosis is present or if the aortic valve is narrowed.

\section*{Chest Percussion}

Normally, only the left border of the heart can be detected by percussion. It extends from the sternum to the midclavicular line in the third to fifth intercostal spaces. The right border lies under
the right margin of the sternum and is not detectable. Enlargement of the heart to either the left or right usually can be noted. In people with thick chests, obesity, or emphysema, the heart may lie so deep under the thoracic surface that not even its left border can be noted unless the heart is enlarged. In such cases, unless the nurse detects a displaced apical impulse and suspects cardiac enlargement, percussion is omitted.

\section*{Cardiac Auscultation}

All areas identified in Figure 26-6, except the epigastric area, are auscultated. These include the aortic area, the pulmonary area, Erb's point, the tricuspid area, and the apical area. The actions of the four valves are uniquely reflected at specific locations on the chest wall. These locations do not correspond to the anatomic locations of the valves within the chest; rather, they reflect the patterns by which heart sounds radiate toward the chest wall. Sound in vessels through which blood is flowing is always reflected downstream. For example, the actions of the mitral valve are usually heard best in the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This is called the mitral valve area.

\section*{HEART SOUNDS}

The normal heart sounds, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, are produced primarily by the closing of the heart valves. The time between $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ corresponds to systole (Fig. 26-8). This is normally shorter than the time between $S_{2}$ and $S_{1}$ (diastole). As the heart rate increases, diastole shortens.

In normal physiology, the periods of systole and diastole are silent. Ventricular disease, however, can give rise to transient sounds in systole and diastole that are called gallops, snaps, or clicks. Significant narrowing of the valve orifices at times when they should be open, or residual gapping of valves at times when they should be closed, gives rise to prolonged sounds called murmurs.
$\mathbf{S}_{1}$-First Heart Sound. Closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves creates the first heart sound $\left(S_{1}\right)$, although vibration of the myocardial wall also may contribute to this sound. Although $S_{1}$ is heard over the entire precordium, it is heard best at the apex of the heart (apical area). Its intensity increases when the valve leaflets are made rigid by calcium in rheumatic heart disease and in any circumstance in which ventricular contraction occurs at a time when the valve is caught wide open. The latter circumstance occurs, for example, when a premature ventricular contraction interrupts the normal cardiac cycle. $S_{1}$ varies in intensity from beat to beat when atrial contraction is not synchronous with ventricular contraction. This is because the valve may be fully or partially closed on one beat and open on the subsequent one as a function of irregular atrial activity. $S_{1}$ is easily identifiable and serves as the point of reference for the remainder of the cardiac cycle.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|cc|c}
\multicolumn{2}{c|}{ systole } & diastole & systole & diastole & systole & \\
\hline & & & & & & \\
$\mathrm{S}_{1}$ & & $\mathrm{~S}_{1}$ & & $\mathrm{~S}_{1}$ & \\
& $\mathrm{~S}_{2}$ & & $\mathrm{~S}_{2}$ & & $\mathrm{~S}_{2}$
\end{tabular}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 26-8 Normal heart sounds. The first heart sound $\left(\mathrm{S}_{1}\right)$ is produced by the closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves and is best heard at the apex of the heart (left ventricular or apical area). The second heart sound $\left(S_{2}\right)$ is produced by the closing of the aortic and pulmonic valves and is loudest at the base of the heart. The time between $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ corresponds to systole. The time between $S_{2}$ and $S_{1}$ is diastole.}
\end{table}
$\mathbf{S}_{2}$-Second Heart Sound. Closing of the aortic and pulmonic valves produces the second heart sound $\left(S_{2}\right)$. Although these two valves close almost simultaneously, the pulmonic valve usually lags slightly behind. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the two components of the second sound may be heard separately (split $S_{2}$ ). The splitting is more likely to be accentuated on inspiration and to disappear on exhalation. (More blood is ejected from the right ventricle during inspiration than during exhalation.)
$\mathrm{S}_{2}$ is heard loudest at the base of the heart. The aortic component of $S_{2}$ is heard clearly in both the aortic and pulmonic areas, and less clearly at the apex. The pulmonic component of $S_{2}$, if present, may be heard only over the pulmonic area. Therefore, one may hear a "single" $S_{2}$ in the aortic area and a split $S_{2}$ in the pulmonic area.

Gallop Sounds. If the blood filling the ventricle is impeded during diastole, as occurs in certain disease states, then a temporary vibration may occur in diastole that is similar to, although usually softer than, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$. The heart sounds then come in triplets and have the acoustic effect of a galloping horse; they are called gallops. This may occur early in diastole, during the rapid-filling phase of the cardiac cycle, or later at the time of atrial contraction.

A gallop sound occurring during rapid ventricular filling is called a third heart sound ( $S_{3}$ ); it represents a normal finding in children and young adults (Fig. 26-9A). Such a sound is heard in patients who have myocardial disease or in those who have HF and whose ventricles fail to eject all of their blood during systole. An $S_{3}$ gallop is heard best with the patient lying on the left side.

Gallop sounds heard during atrial contraction are called fourth heart sounds ( $\mathrm{S}_{4}$ ) (see Fig. 26-9B). An $\mathrm{S}_{4}$ is often heard when the ventricle is enlarged or hypertrophied and therefore resistant to filling. Such a circumstance may be associated with CAD, hypertension, or stenosis of the aortic valve. On rare occasions, all four heart sounds are heard within a single cardiac cycle, giving rise to what is called a quadruple rhythm.

\begin{figure}

\caption{EIGURE 26-9 Gallops.

(B) An $S_{4}$ gallop is heard immediately preceding the $S_{1}$. The $S_{4}$ sound occurs during atrial contraction and is often heard when the ventricle is enlarged or hypertrophied. Associated conditions include coronary artery disease, hypertension, and stenosis of the aortic valve.}
\end{figure}

Gallop sounds are very low-frequency sounds and may be heard only with the bell of the stethoscope placed very lightly against the chest. They are heard best at the apex, although occasionally, when emanating from the right ventricle, they may be heard to the left of the sternum.

Snaps and Clicks. Stenosis of the mitral valve resulting from rheumatic heart disease gives rise to an unusual sound very early in diastole that is high-pitched and is best heard along the left sternal border. The sound is caused by high pressure in the left atrium with abrupt displacement of a rigid mitral valve. The sound is called an opening snap. It occurs too long after $S_{2}$ to be mistaken for a split $S_{2}$ and too early in diastole to be mistaken for a gallop. It almost always is associated with the murmur of mitral stenosis and is specific to this disorder.

In a similar manner, stenosis of the aortic valve gives rise to a short, high-pitched sound immediately after $S_{1}$ that is called an ejection click. This is caused by very high pressure within the ventricle, displacing a rigid and calcified aortic valve.

Murmurs. Murmurs are created by the turbulent flow of blood. The causes of the turbulence may be a critically narrowed valve, a malfunctioning valve that allows regurgitant blood flow, a congenital defect of the ventricular wall, a defect between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, or an increased flow of blood through a normal structure (eg, with fever, pregnancy, hyperthyroidism). Murmurs are characterized and consequently described by several characteristics, including timing in the cardiac cycle, location on the chest wall, intensity, pitch, quality, and pattern of radiation (Chart 26-3).

Friction Rub. In pericarditis, a harsh, grating sound that can be heard in both systole and diastole is called a friction rub. It is caused by abrasion of the pericardial surfaces during the cardiac cycle. Because a friction rub may be confused with a murmur, care should be taken to identify the sound and to distinguish it from murmurs that may be heard in both systole and diastole. A pericardial friction rub can be heard best using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, with the patient sitting up and leaning forward.

\section*{AUSCULTATION PROCEDURE}

During auscultation, the patient remains supine and the examining room is as quiet as possible. A stethoscope with a diaphragm and a bell is necessary for accurate auscultation of the heart.

Using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, the examiner starts at the apical area and progresses upward along the left sternal border to the pulmonic and aortic areas. If desired, the examiner may choose to begin the examination at the aortic and pulmonic areas and progress downward to the apex of the heart. Initially, $S_{1}$ is identified and evaluated with respect to its intensity and splitting. Next, $S_{2}$ is identified, and its intensity and any splitting are noted. After concentrating on $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, the examiner listens for extra sounds in systole and then in diastole.

Sometimes it helps to ask the following questions: Do I hear snapping or clicking sounds? Do I hear any high-pitched blowing sounds? Is this sound in systole, or diastole, or both? The examiner again proceeds to move the stethoscope to all of the designated areas of the precordium, listening carefully for these sounds. Finally, the patient is turned on the left side and the stethoscope is placed on the apical area, where an $S_{3}$, an $S_{4}$, and a mitral murmur are more readily detected.

Once an abnormality is heard, the entire chest surface is reexamined to determine the exact location of the sound and its

\section*{Characteristics of Heart Murmurs}

Heart murmurs are described in terms of location, timing, intensity, pitch, quality, and radiation. These characteristics provide data about the location and nature of the cardiac abnormality.

\section*{Location}

The location of the murmur (where it is detected on the chest wall) is crucial. Depending on the type of valvular disorder, a murmur can be heard only at the apex or more widely over the chest wall, or along the left sternal border between the third and fourth interspaces.

\section*{Timing}

Timing of the murmur in the cardiac cycle is vital. The examiner first determines whether the murmur is occurring in systole or in diastole. Then, does it begin simultaneously with a heart sound, or is there some delay between the sound and the beginning of the murmur? Does the murmur continue to (or through) the second heart sound, or is there a delay between the end of the murmur and the second heart sound? Are diastolic murmurs (between the second and first heart sounds) continuous, or do they subside in midor late diastole?

\section*{Intensity}

The intensity of murmurs is conventionally graded from I through VI. Sometimes, grade I murmurs are difficult to hear. However, a grade II cardiac murmur can be easily perceived by the experienced examiner. Murmurs of grades IV or louder are usually associated with thrills that may be palpated on the surface of the chest wall. A grade VI murmur can be heard with the stethoscope off the chest. A murmur may vary in intensity from its beginning to its conclusion. This is very characteristic of certain valvular disorders.

\section*{Pitch}

The next important characteristic of a murmur is its pitch, which may be low, often heard only with the bell of the stethoscope placed lightly on the chest wall, or a very high-pitched murmur, heard best with the stethoscope's diaphragm. Other murmurs contain the full spectrum of sound frequency.

\section*{Quality}

In addition to the intensity and pitch, the character of the sound. A murmur may be described as rumbling, blowing, whistling, harsh, or musical.

\section*{Radiation}

The last feature of concern is radiation of the murmur. A murmur can radiate into the axilla, the carotid arteries in the neck, the left shoulder, or the back.
radiation. Also, the patient, who may be concerned about the prolonged examination, must be supported and reassured. The auscultatory findings, particularly murmurs, are documented by identifying the following characteristics:
- Location on chest wall.
- Timing of sound as either during systole or during diastole; described as early, middle, or late. (If heard throughout the systole, the sound is often referred to as pansystolic or holosystolic.)
- Intensity of the sound (I, very faint; II, quiet; III, moderately loud; IV, loud; V, very loud; or VI, heard with stethoscope removed from the chest).
- Pitch, desrcribed as high, medium, or low.
- Quality of the sound, commonly described as blowing, harsh, or musical.
- Location of radiation of the sound away from where it is heard the loudest.

\section*{INTERPRETATION OF CARDIAC SOUNDS}

Interpreting cardiac sounds requires detailed knowledge of cardiac physiology and the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases. There are different levels of performance at which the nurse may be expected to function. The first level is simply recognizing that what one is hearing is not normal-such as a third heart sound, a murmur in systole or diastole, a pericardial friction rub over the midsternum, or a second heart sound that is widely split. These findings are reported to the physician and acted on accordingly. This level of function is useful in screening. It is the kind of activity involved in performing physical examinations in schools on normal children or in performing routine physical examinations or screening examinations.

The second level involves recognizing patterns. The nurse correctly observes the findings and can recognize the constellation of sounds and the diagnostic significance of common ones.

At its most sophisticated level, cardiac diagnosis can be interpretive. Highly skilled nurses can differentiate among dysrhythmias and respond accordingly. They can determine the significance of the appearance and disappearance of gallops during the treatment of patients who have had MIs or who have HF. This is the role that the coronary care nurse and the cardiovascular advanced practice nurse assume. They function with a team of other health care professionals who have highly tuned skills of cardiovascular assessment and diagnosis.

\section*{Inspection of the Extremities}

The hands, arms, legs, and feet are observed for skin and vascular changes. The most noteworthy changes include the following:
- Decreased capillary refill time indicates a slower peripheral flow rate from sluggish reperfusion and is often observed in patients with hypotension or HF. Capillary refill time provides the basis for estimating the rate of peripheral blood flow. To test capillary refill, briefly compress the nailbed so that it blanches, and then release the pressure. Normally, reperfusion occurs within 3 seconds, as evidenced by the return of color.
- Vascular changes from decreased arterial circulation include decrease in quality or loss of pulse, discomfort or pain, paresthesia, numbness, decrease in temperature, pallor, and loss of movement. During the first few hours after invasive cardiac procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization), affected extremities should be assessed for vascular changes frequently.
- Hematoma, or a localized collection of clotted blood in the tissue, may be observed in patients who have undergone invasive cardiac procedures such as cardiac catheterization, PTCA, or cardiac electrophysiology testing. Major blood vessels of the arms and legs are selected for catheter insertion. During these procedures, systemic anticoagulation with heparin is necessary, and minor or small hematomas may occur at the catheter puncture site. However, large hematomas are a serious complication that can compromise circulating blood volume and cardiac output, requiring blood transfusions. All patients who have undergone these procedures must have their puncture sites frequently observed until hemostasis is adequately achieved.
- Peripheral edema is fluid accumulation in dependent areas of the body (feet and legs, sacrum in the bedridden patient). Assess for pitting edema (a depression over an area of pres-
sure) by pressing firmly for 5 seconds with the thumb over the dorsum of each foot, behind each medial malleolus, and over the shins. Pitting edema is graded as absent or as present on a scale from slight ( $1+=0$ to 2 mm ) to very marked $(4+=$ more than 8 mm$)$. Peripheral edema is observed in patients with HF and in those with peripheral vascular diseases such as deep vein thrombosis or chronic venous insufficiency.
- Clubbing of the fingers and toes implies chronic hemoglobin desaturation, as in congenital heart disease.
- Lower extremity ulcers are observed in patients with arterial or venous insufficiency. Chapter 31 provides a complete description of differentiating characteristics.

\section*{Other Systems}

\section*{LUNGS}

The details of respiratory assessment are described in Chapter 21. Findings frequently exhibited by cardiac patients include the following:

Tachypnea: Rapid, shallow breathing may be noted in patients who have HF or pain, and in those who are extremely anxious.
Cheyne-Stokes respirations: Patients with severe left ventricular failure may exhibit Cheyne-Stokes breathing, a pattern of rapid respirations alternating with apnea. It is important to note the duration of the apnea.
Hemoptysis: Pink, frothy sputum is indicative of acute pulmonary edema.
Cough: A dry, hacking cough from irritation of small airways is common in patients with pulmonary congestion from HF.
Crackles: HF or atelectasis associated with bed rest, splinting from ischemic pain, or the effects of pain medications and sedatives often results in the development of crackles. Typically, crackles are first noted at the bases (because of gravity's effect on fluid accumulation and decreased ventilation of basilar tissue), but they may progress to all portions of the lung fields.
Wheezes: Compression of the small airways by interstitial pulmonary edema may cause wheezing. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers), such as propranolol (Inderal), may precipitate airway narrowing, especially in patients with underlying pulmonary disease.

\section*{ABDOMEN}

For the cardiac patient, two components of the abdominal examination are frequently performed.

Hepatojugular reflux: Liver engorgement occurs because of decreased venous return secondary to right ventricular failure. The liver is enlarged, firm, nontender, and smooth. The hepatojugular reflux may be demonstrated by pressing firmly over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen for 30 to 60 seconds and noting a rise of 1 cm or more in jugular venous pressure. This rise indicates an inability of the right side of the heart to accommodate increased volume.
Bladder distention: Urine output is an important indicator of cardiac function, especially when urine output is reduced. This may indicate inadequate renal perfusion or a less serious problem such as one caused by urinary retention. When the urine output is decreased, the patient needs to be assessed for a distended bladder or difficulty voiding. The bladder may be assessed with an ultrasound scanner or
the suprapubic area palpated for an oval mass and percussed for dullness, indicative of a full bladder.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

When performing a cardiovascular examination on an elderly patient, the nurse may note such differences as more readily palpable peripheral pulses because of increased hardness of the arteries and a loss of adjacent connective tissue. Palpation of the precordium in the elderly is affected by the changes in the shape of the chest. For example, a cardiac impulse may not be palpable in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because these patients usually have an increased anterior-posterior chest diameter. Kyphoscoliosis, a spinal deformity that occurs frequently in elderly patients, may dislocate the cardiac apex downward so that the diagnostic significance of palpating the apical impulse is obscured.

Systolic BP increases with age, but diastolic BP usually plateaus after 50 years. Medication therapy is usually initiated for high BP when consistent systolic readings of 160 mm Hg or diastolic readings of 95 mm Hg are observed. For the elderly patient, however, many factors are considered before initiating treatment. Orthostatic hypotension may reflect a decreasing sensitivity of postural reflexes, which must be considered when medication therapy is prescribed.

An $S_{4}$ is heard in about $90 \%$ of elderly patients; this is thought to be caused by decreased compliance of the left ventricle. The $S_{2}$ is usually split. At least $60 \%$ of elderly patients have murmurs, the most common being a soft systolic ejection murmur resulting from sclerotic changes of the aortic leaflets (see Table 26-1).

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

Diagnostic tests and procedures are used to confirm the data obtained by history and physical assessment. Some tests are easy to interpret, but others must be interpreted by expert clinicians. All tests should be explained to the patient. Some necessitate special preparation before they are performed and special monitoring by the nurse after the procedure.

\section*{LABORATORY TESTS}

Laboratory tests may be performed for the following reasons:
- To assist in diagnosing an acute MI. (Angina pectoris, chest pain resulting from an insufficient supply of blood to the heart, cannot be confirmed by either blood or urine studies.)
- To identify abnormalities in the blood that affect the prognosis of a patient with a cardiac condition
- To assess the degree of inflammation
- To screen for risk factors associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease
- To determine baseline values before performing therapeutic interventions
- To monitor serum levels of medications
- To assess the effects of medications (e.g., the effects of diuretics on serum potassium levels)
- To screen generally for abnormalities

Because different laboratories use different equipment and different methods of measurements, normal test values may vary depending on the laboratory and the health care institution.

\section*{Cardiac Enzyme Analysis}

Plasma cardiac enzyme analysis is part of a diagnostic profile that also includes the health history, symptoms, and electrocardiogram (ECG), associated with acute MI. Enzymes are released from injured cells when the cell membranes rupture. Most enzymes are nonspecific in relation to the particular organ that has been damaged. Certain isoenzymes, however, come only from myocardial cells and are released when the cells are damaged, such as by sustained hypoxia resulting in infarction or by trauma. The isoenzymes leak into the interstitial spaces of the myocardium and are carried into the general circulation by the lymphatic system and the coronary circulation, resulting in elevated serum enzyme concentrations.

Because different enzymes move into the blood at varying periods after MI, enzyme levels should be tested in relation to the time of onset of chest discomfort or other symptoms. Creatine kinase (CK) and its isoenzyme CK-MB are the most specific enzymes analyzed in acute MI, and they are the first enzyme levels to rise. Lactic dehydrogenase and its isoenzymes also are analyzed in patients who have delayed seeking medical attention, because these blood levels rise and peak in 2 to 3 days, much later than CK levels (see Table 28-5 in Chap. 28 for the time course of cardiac enzymes).

Myoglobin, an early marker of MI, is a heme protein with a small molecular weight. This allows it to be rapidly released from damaged myocardial tissue and accounts for its early rise, within 1 to 3 hours after the onset of an acute MI. Myoglobin peaks in 4 to 12 hours and returns to normal in 24 hours. Myoglobin is not used alone to diagnose MI, because elevations can also occur in patients with renal or musculoskeletal disease. However, negative results are helpful in ruling out an early diagnosis of MI.

Troponin I is measured in a laboratory test that has several advantages over traditional enzyme studies. Troponin I is a contractile protein found only in cardiac muscle. After myocardial injury, elevated serum troponin I concentrations can be detected within 3 to 4 hours; they peak in 4 to 24 hours and remain elevated for 1 to 3 weeks. These early and prolonged elevations make very early diagnosis of MI possible or allow for late diagnosis if the patient has delayed seeking treatment.

\section*{Blood Chemistry}

\section*{LIPID PROFILE}

Cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoproteins are measured to evaluate a person's risk for developing atherosclerotic disease, especially if there is a family history of premature heart disease, or to diagnose a specific lipoprotein abnormality. Cholesterol and triglycerides are transported in the blood by combining with protein molecules to form lipoproteins. The lipoproteins are referred to as low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). The risk of CAD increases as the ratio of LDL to HDL or the ratio of total cholesterol (LDL + HDL) to HDL increases. Although cholesterol levels remain relatively constant over 24 hours, the blood specimen for the lipid profile should be obtained after a 12-hour fast.

\section*{CHOLESTEROL LEVELS}

Cholesterol (normal level, less than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) is a lipid required for hormone synthesis and cell membrane formation. It is found in large quantities in brain and nerve tissue. Two major sources of cholesterol are diet (animal products) and the liver, where cholesterol is synthesized. Elevated cholesterol levels are
known to increase the risk for CAD. Factors that contribute to variations in cholesterol levels include age, gender, diet, exercise patterns, genetics, menopause, tobacco use, and stress levels.

LDLs (normal level, less than $130 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) are the primary transporters of cholesterol and triglycerides into the cell. One harmful effect of LDL is the deposition of these substances in the walls of arterial vessels. Elevated LDL levels are associated with a greater incidence of CAD . In people with known CAD or diabetes, the primary goal for lipid management is reduction of LDL levels to less than $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

HDLs (normal range in men, 35 to $65 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$; in women, 35 to $85 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) have a protective action. They transport cholesterol away from the tissue and cells of the arterial wall to the liver for excretion. Therefore, there is an inverse relationship between HDL levels and risk for CAD. Factors that lower HDL levels include smoking, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. In patients with CAD, a secondary goal of lipid management is the increase of HDL levels to more than $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

Triglycerides (normal range, 40 to $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), composed of free fatty acids and glycerol, are stored in the adipose tissue and are a source of energy. Triglyceride levels increase after meals and are affected by stress. Diabetes, alcohol use, and obesity can elevate triglyceride levels. These levels have a direct correlation with LDL and an inverse one with HDL.

\section*{SERUM ELECTROLYTE LEVELS}

Sodium, potassium, and calcium are ions that are vital to cellular depolarization and repolarization. In addition, the serum sodium concentration reflects relative fluid balance. Generally, hyponatremia (low sodium level) indicates fluid excess, and hypernatremia (high sodium level) indicates fluid deficit.

Serum potassium is affected by renal function and may be decreased by diuretic agents that are used to treat HF. A decrease in potassium causes cardiac irritability and predisposes the patient receiving a digitalis preparation to digitalis toxicity and dysrhythmias. The effect of an elevated serum potassium concentration is myocardial depression and ventricular irritability. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia can lead to ventricular fibrillation or cardiac standstill. Calcium is necessary for blood coagulability and neuromuscular activity. Hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia can cause dysrhythmias.

Magnesium is integral to the absorption of calcium and the maintenance of potassium stores. It is required in the metabolism of adenosine triphosphate, playing a major role in protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and muscular contraction. Initial symptoms of hypermagnesemia are lethargy and decreased neuromuscular activity. On the ECG, hypomagnesemia lengthens the QT interval, predisposing the patient to life-threatening dysrhythmias.

\section*{BLOOD UREA NITROGEN LEVEL}

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is an end product of protein metabolism and is excreted by the kidneys. In the patient with cardiac disease, an elevated BUN level may reflect reduced renal perfusion (from decreased cardiac output) or intravascular fluid volume deficit (from diuretic therapy or dehydration). The cause of elevated BUN is determined from the serum creatinine: high BUN and high creatinine reflect renal impairment, high BUN and normal creatinine reflect intravascular fluid volume deficit.

\section*{SERUM GLUCOSE LEVEL}

The serum glucose level is important to monitor, because many patients with cardiac disease also have diabetes mellitus. In addi-
tion, the serum glucose level may be mildly elevated in stressful situations, when mobilization of endogenous epinephrine results in conversion of liver glycogen to glucose. Serum glucose levels are drawn in a fasting state. Glycosylated hemoglobin is an important measure to monitor in people with diabetes, because it reflects the blood glucose levels over 2 to 3 months. Hemoglobin $A_{1 C}$ is the common name for this test. The goal of diabetes management is to maintain the hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ below $7 \%$ (normal range $4 \%-6 \%$ ), reflecting consistent near-normal blood glucose levels. This is particularly important for primary and secondary prevention of CVD (Brundy et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2001).

\section*{Coagulation Studies}

The formation of a thrombus is initiated by injury to a vessel wall or to the tissue. These events activate the coagulation cascade, a complex series of interactions among phospholipids, calcium, and various clotting factors that converts prothrombin to thrombin. The coagulation cascade has two pathways, the intrinsic pathway and the extrinsic pathway. Coagulation studies are routinely performed before invasive procedures, such as cardiac catheterization, electrophysiology testing, and coronary or cardiac surgery.

Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measure the activity of the intrinsic pathway. The values of PTT and aPTT are used to assess the effects of heparin therapy. Patients receiving heparin have their PTT or aPTT levels maintained at 1.5 to 2.5 times their baseline values (reference range, 25 to 38 seconds). Prothrombin time (PT) measures the extrinsic pathway activity and is used to monitor the effects of therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin). Laboratory results of PT also include the International Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR provides a standard method for reporting PT levels, eliminating the variation of PT results from laboratory to laboratory. The INR, rather than the PT alone, is used to monitor patients receiving warfarin therapy. The INR is maintained between 2.0 and 3.0 for patients with deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, valvular heart disease, or atrial fibrillation, and between 2.5 and 3.5 for patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valve replacements.

\section*{Hematologic Studies}

The complete blood cell count (CBC) identifies the total number of white and red blood cells, the platelet count, and the hemoglobin and hematocrit. The CBC is carefully monitored in patients with CVD. White blood cell counts are monitored in immunocompromised patients, including patients with transplanted hearts, and in situations where there is concern for infection (eg, after invasive procedures or surgery). The red blood cells carry hemoglobin, which transports oxygen to the cells. The hematocrit is a measure of the relative proportion of red blood cells and plasma. Low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels have serious consequences for patients with CAD , such as more frequent angina episodes. Platelets are the first line of protection against bleeding. Once activated by blood vessel wall injury or rupture of atherosclerotic plaque, platelets undergo chemical changes that form a thrombus. Patients are prescribed medications to inhibit platelet function, including aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and intravenous GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab [ReoPro], eptifibatide [Integrilin], tirofiban [Aggrastat]); therefore, it is essential to monitor for thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts). Chapter 33 provides an in-depth review of these laboratory tests and normal values.

\section*{CHEST X-RAY AND FLUOROSCOPY}

A chest x-ray usually is obtained to determine the size, contour, and position of the heart. It reveals cardiac and pericardial calcifications and demonstrates physiologic alterations in the pulmonary circulation. It does not help diagnose acute MI but can help diagnose some complications (eg, HF). Correct placement of cardiac catheters, such as pacemakers and pulmonary artery catheters, is also confirmed by chest x-ray.

Fluoroscopy allows visualization of the heart on an x-ray screen. It shows cardiac and vascular pulsations and unusual cardiac contours. Fluoroscopy is useful for positioning intravenous pacing electrodes and for guiding catheter insertion during cardiac catheterization.

\section*{ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY}

The ECG is a diagnostic tool used in assessing the cardiovascular system. It is a graphic recording of the electrical activity of the heart; an ECG can be recorded with 12, 15, or 18 leads, showing the activity from those different reference points. The ECG is obtained by placing disposable electrodes in standard positions on the skin of the chest wall and extremities. The heart's electrical impulses are recorded as a tracing on special graph paper.

The standard 12-lead ECG is the most commonly used tool to diagnose dysrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, enlarged heart chambers, myocardial ischemia or infarction, high or low calcium and potassium levels, and effects of some medications. A 15-lead ECG adds 3 additional chest leads across the right precordium and is a valuable tool for the early diagnosis of right ventricular and posterior left ventricular infarction. The 18 -lead ECG adds 3 posterior leads to the 15-lead ECG and is very useful for early detection of myocardial ischemia and injury (Wung \& Drew, 1999). To enhance interpretation of the ECG, the patient's age, gender, BP, height, weight, symptoms, and medications (especially digitalis and antiarrhythmic agents) should be noted on the ECG requisition. The details of electrocardiography are covered in Chapter 27.

\section*{Continuous Electrocardiographic Monitoring}

Continuous ECG monitoring is standard for patients who are at high risk for dysrhythmias. Two continuous ECG monitoring techniques are hardwire monitoring, found in critical care units and specialty step-down units, and telemetry, found in specialty step-down units and general nursing care units. Patients who are receiving continuous ECG monitoring need to be informed of its purpose and cautioned that this monitoring method will not detect symptoms such as dyspnea or chest pain. Therefore, patients need to be advised to report symptoms to the nurse whenever they occur.

\section*{HARDWIRE CARDIAC MONITORING}

The patient's ECG can be continuously observed for dysrhythmias and conduction disorders on an oscilloscope at the bedside or at a central monitoring station by a hardwire monitoring system. This system is composed of three to five electrodes positioned on the patient's chest, a lead cable, and a bedside monitor. Hardwire monitoring systems vary in sophistication but in general can do the following:
- Monitor more than one lead simultaneously
- Monitor ST segments (ST-segment depression is a marker of myocardial ischemia; ST-segment elevation provides evidence of an evolving MI)
- Provide graded visual and audible alarms (based on priority, asystole would be highest)
- Computerize rhythm monitoring (dysrhythmias are interpreted and stored in memory)
- Print a rhythm strip
- Record a 12-lead ECG

Two leads commonly used for continuous monitoring are leads II and V1 or a modification of V1 (MCL1) (Fig. 26-10). Lead II provides the best visualization of atrial depolarization (represented by the P wave). Leads V1 and MCL1 best visualize the ventricle responsible for ectopic or abnormal ventricular beats.

\section*{TELEMETRY}

In addition to hardwire monitoring systems, the ECG can be continuously observed by telemetry, the transmission of radiowaves from a battery-operated transmitter worn by the patient to a central bank of monitors. Although telemetry systems have the same capabilities as hardwire systems, they are wireless, allowing the patient to ambulate while being monitored. Following the guidelines for electrode placement will ensure good conduction and a clear picture of the patient's rhythm on the monitor:
- Clean the skin surface with soap and water and dry well (or as recommended by the manufacturer) before applying the electrodes. If the patient has much hair where the electrodes need to be placed, shave or clip the hair.
- Apply a small amount of benzoin to the skin if the patient is diaphoretic (sweaty) and the electrodes do not adhere well.
- Change the electrodes every 24 to 48 hours and examine the skin for irritation. Apply the electrodes to different locations each time they are changed.
- If the patient is sensitive to the electrodes, use hypoallergenic electrodes.

\section*{SIGNAL-AVERAGED ELECTROCARDIOGRAM}

For some patients who are considered to be at high risk for sudden cardiac death, a signal-averaged ECG is performed. This highresolution ECG assists in identifying the risk for life-threatening dysrhythmias and helps to determine the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. Signal averaging works by averaging about 150 to 300 QRS waveforms (QRS waveforms represent depolarization
of the ventricle). The resulting averaged QRS complex is analyzed for certain characteristics that are likely to lead to lethal ventricular dysrhythmias. The recording is performed at the bedside and requires about 15 minutes.

\section*{CONTINUOUS AMBULATORY MONITORING}

In ambulatory ECG monitoring, which may occur in the hospital but is more commonly prescribed for outpatients, one lead of the patient's ECG can be monitored by a Holter monitor. This monitor is a small tape recorder that continuously (for 10 to 24 hours) documents the heart's electrical activity on a magnetic tape. The tape recorder weighs approximately 2 pounds and can be carried over the shoulder or worn around the waist day and night to detect dysrhythmias or evidence of myocardial ischemia during activities of daily living. The patient keeps a diary of activity, noting the time of any symptoms, experiences, or unusual activities performed. The tape recording is then examined with a special scanner, analyzed, and interpreted. Evidence obtained in this way helps the physician diagnose dysrhythmias and myocardial ischemia and evaluate therapy, such as antiarrhythmic and antianginal medications or pacemaker function.

\section*{TRANSTELEPHONIC MONITORING}

Another method of evaluating the ECG of a patient at home is by transtelephonic monitoring. The patient attaches a specific lead system for transmitting the signals and places a telephone mouthpiece over the transmitter box; the ECG is recorded and evaluated at another location. This method is often used for diagnosing dysrhythmias and in follow-up evaluation of permanent cardiac pacemakers.

\section*{CARDIAC STRESS TESTING}

Normally, the coronary arteries dilate to four times their usual diameter in response to increased metabolic demands for oxygen and nutrients. Coronary arteries with atherosclerosis, however, dilate much less, compromising blood flow to the myocardium and causing ischemia. Therefore, abnormalities in cardiovascular function are more likely to be detected during times of increased demand, or "stress." The cardiac stress test procedures-the exercise stress test, the pharmacologic stress test, and, more recently, the mental or emotional stress test-are noninvasive ways to evaluate the response of the cardiovascular system to stress. The stress

To monitor lead II, the negative electrode is placed on the right upper chest; the positive electrode is placed on the left lower chest.

\end{figure}
test helps determine the following: (1) CAD, (2) cause of chest pain, (3) functional capacity of the heart after an MI or heart surgery, (4) effectiveness of antianginal or antiarrhythmic medications, (5) dysrhythmias that occur during physical exercise, and (6) specific goals for a physical fitness program. Contraindications to stress testing include severe aortic stenosis, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, severe hypertension, suspected left main CAD, HF, and unstable angina. Because complications associated with stress testing can be life-threatening (MI, cardiac arrest, HF, and severe dysrhythmias), testing facilities must have staff and equipment ready to provide advanced cardiac life support.

Mental stress testing uses a mental arithmetic test or simulated public speech to determine whether an ischemic myocardial response occurs, similar to the response evoked by a conventional treadmill exercise test. Although its use for diagnostic purposes in patients with CAD is currently investigational, preliminary results indicate that the ischemic and hemodynamic measures obtained from mental stress testing may be useful in assessing the prognosis of patients with CHD who have had a positive exercise test (Krantz et al., 1999).

Stress testing is often combined with echocardiography or radionuclide imaging (discussed later). These techniques are performed during the resting state and immediately after stress.

\section*{Exercise Stress Testing}

In an exercise stress test, the patient walks on a treadmill (most common) or pedals a stationary bicycle or arm crank. Exercise intensity progresses according to established protocols. The Bruce protocol, for example, is a common treadmill protocol in which the speed and grade of the treadmill are increased every 3 minutes. The goal of the test is to increase the heart rate to the "target heart rate." This is $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of the maximum predicted heart rate and is based on the age and gender of the patient. During the test, the following are monitored: two or more ECG leads for heart rate, rhythm, and ischemic changes; BP ; skin temperature; physical appearance; perceived exertion; and symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, leg cramping, and fatigue. The test is terminated when the target heart rate is achieved or when the patient experiences chest pain, extreme fatigue, a decrease in BP or pulse rate, serious dysrhythmias or ST segment changes on ECG, or other complications. When significant ECG abnormalities occur during the stress test (ST segment depressions), the test result is reported as positive and further diagnostic testing is required.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

In preparation for the exercise stress test, the patient is instructed to fast for 4 hours before the test and to avoid stimulants such as tobacco and caffeine. Medications may be taken with sips of water. The physician may instruct patients not to take certain cardiac medications, such as beta-blockers, before the test. Clothes and sneakers or rubber-soled shoes suitable for exercising are to be worn. Women are advised to wear a bra that provides adequate support. The nurse describes the equipment used and the sensations and experiences that the patient may have during the test. The nurse explains the monitoring equipment used, the need to have an intravenous line placed, and the symptoms to report. The type of exercise is reviewed, and patients are asked to put forth their best exercise effort. If the test is to be performed with echocardiography or radionuclide imaging, this information is reviewed as well. After the test, patients are monitored for 10 to 15 minutes. Once stable, they may resume their usual activities.

\section*{Pharmacologic Stress Testing}

Physically disabled or deconditioned patients will not be able to achieve their target heart rate by exercising on a treadmill or bicycle. Two vasodilating agents, dipyridamole (Persantin) and adenosine (Adenocard), administered intravenously, are used to mimic the effects of exercise by maximally dilating the coronary arteries. The effects of dipyridamole last about 15 to 30 minutes. The side effects are related to its vasodilating action and include chest discomfort, dizziness, headache, flushing, and nausea. Adenosine has similar side effects, although patients report these symptoms as more severe. A unique property of adenosine is that it has an extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds), so any severe effects rapidly subside. Dipyridamole and adenosine are the agents of choice used in conjunction with radionuclide imaging techniques. Theophylline and other xanthines, such as caffeine, block the effects of dipyridamole and adenosine and must be avoided before either of these pharmacologic stress tests.

Dobutamine (Dobutrex) is another medication that may be used for patients who cannot exercise. Dobutamine, a synthetic sympathomimetic, increases heart rate, myocardial contractility, and BP , thereby increasing the metabolic demands of the heart. It is the agent of choice when echocardiography is used because of its effects on altering myocardial wall motion (due to enhanced contractility). In addition, dobutamine is used for patients who have bronchospasm or pulmonary disease and cannot tolerate having doses of theophylline withheld.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

In preparation for the pharmacologic stress test, patients are instructed not to eat or drink anything for at least 4 hours before the test. This includes chocolate, caffeine, caffeine-free coffee, tea, carbonated beverages, or medications with caffeine (eg, Anacin, Darvon). If caffeine is ingested before a dipyridamole or adenosine stress test, the test will have to be rescheduled. Patients taking aminophylline or theophylline are instructed to stop taking these medications for 24 to 48 hours before the test (if tolerated). Oral doses of dipyridamole are to be withheld as well. Patients are informed about the transient sensations they may experience during infusion of the vasodilating agent, such as flushing or nausea, which will disappear quickly. The patient is instructed to report any other symptoms occurring during the test to the cardiologist or nurse. An explanation of echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is also provided as necessary. The stress test may take about 1 hour, or up to 3 hours if imaging is performed.

\section*{ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY}

Echocardiography is a noninvasive ultrasound test that is used to examine the size, shape, and motion of cardiac structures. It is a particularly useful tool for diagnosing pericardial effusions, determining the etiology of heart murmurs, evaluating the function of prosthetic heart valves, determining chamber size, and evaluating ventricular wall motion. It involves transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the heart through the chest wall and recording of the return signals. The ultrasound is generated by a hand-held transducer applied to the front of the chest. The transducer picks up the echoes, converts them to electrical impulses, and transmits them to the echocardiography machine for display on an oscilloscope and recording on a videotape. An ECG is recorded simultaneously to assist with interpreting the echocardiogram.

M-mode (motion), the unidimensional mode that was first introduced, provides information about the cardiac structures and their motion. Two-dimensional or cross-sectional echocardiography (Fig. 26-11), an enhancement of the technique, creates a sophisticated, spatially correct image of the heart. Other techniques, such as Doppler and color flow imaging echocardiography, show the direction and velocity of the blood flow through the heart.

As previously mentioned, echocardiography may be performed with an exercise or pharmacologic stress test; resting and stress images are obtained. Myocardial ischemia from decreased perfusion during stress causes abnormalities in ventricular wall motion and is easily detected by echocardiography. A stress test using echocardiography is considered positive if abnormalities in ventricular wall motion are detected during stress but not during rest. These findings are highly suggestive of CAD and require further evaluation, such as a cardiac catheterization.

\section*{Transesophageal Echocardiography}

A significant limitation of traditional echocardiography has been the poor quality of the images produced. Ultrasound loses its clarity as it passes through tissue, lung, and bone. Another echocardiographic technique involves threading a small transducer through the mouth and into the esophagus. This technique, called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), provides clearer images because ultrasound waves are passing through less tissue. Pharmacologic stress testing using dobutamine and TEE can also be performed. The high-quality imaging obtained during TEE makes this technique an important adjunct to the technology available for detecting and evaluating the severity of CAD. Complications are uncommon during TEE, but if they do occur they are serious. These complications are caused by sedation and impaired swallowing from topical anesthesia (respiratory depression and aspiration) and by insertion and manipulation of the transducer into the esophagus and stomach (vasovagal response or esophageal perforation). The patient must be assessed before TEE for a history of dysphagia or radiation therapy to the chest that would increase the risk for complications.

\end{figure}

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Before traditional echocardiography, the nurse informs the patient about the test, explaining that it is painless. Echocardiographic monitoring is performed while a transducer that emits the sound waves is moved about the chest. Gel applied to the skin helps transmit the sound waves. Periodically, the patient will have to turn onto the left side or hold a breath. The test takes about 30 to 45 minutes. If the patient is to undergo an exercise or pharmacologic stress test with echocardiography, information on stress testing is also reviewed.

In preparation for a TEE study, the following information is reviewed:
- The patient must fast for 6 hours before the study.
- An intravenous line is started for administering a sedative and any pharmacologic stress testing medications.
- The patient's throat is anesthetized before the probe is inserted.
- BP and the ECG are monitored throughout the study.
- The patient will be kept comfortable but not heavily sedated. The patient must be alert enough to follow instructions and to report symptoms such as chest pain.
After the study, monitoring continues for 30 to 60 minutes. The patient is to continue fasting for 4 hours. The patient may have a sore throat for the next 24 hours.

\section*{RADIONUCLIDE IMAGING}

Radionuclide imaging studies involve the use of radioisotopes to evaluate coronary artery perfusion noninvasively, to detect myocardial ischemia and infarction, and to assess left ventricular function. Radioisotopes are atoms in an unstable form. Thallium 201 ( $\mathrm{Tl}^{201}$ ) and technetium 99 m ( $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ ) are two of the most common radioisotopes used in cardiac nuclear medicine studies. As they decay, they give off small amounts of energy in the form of gamma rays. When they are injected intravenously into the bloodstream, the energy emitted by the radioisotope can be detected by a gamma scintillation camera positioned over the body. Planar imaging, used with thallium, is a technique that provides a one-dimensional view of the heart from three locations. A relatively new technique called single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides three-dimensional images. With SPECT, the patient is positioned supine with arms raised above the head, while the camera moves around the patient's chest in a 180- to 360 -degree arc to identify the areas of decreased myocardial perfusion more precisely.

\section*{Myocardial Perfusion Imaging}

The radioisotope $\mathrm{Tl}^{201}$ is used to assess myocardial perfusion. It resembles potassium and readily crosses into the cells of healthy myocardium. It is taken up more slowly and in smaller amounts by myocardial cells that are ischemic from decreased blood flow. However, thallium will not cross into the necrotic tissue that results from an MI.

Often, thallium is used with stress testing to assess changes in myocardial perfusion immediately after exercise (or after injection of one of the agents used in stress testing) and at rest. One or two minutes before the end of the stress test, a dose of $\mathrm{Tl}^{201}$ is injected into the intravenous line, allowing the radioisotope to be distributed into the myocardium. Images are taken immediately. Areas that do not show thallium uptake are noted as defects and indicate areas of either infarction or stress-induced myocardial
ischemia. The resting images, taken 3 hours later, help to differentiate infarction from ischemia. Infarcted tissue is unable to take up thallium regardless of when the scan is taken; the defect remains the same size. This is called a fixed defect, indicating that there is no perfusion in that area of the myocardium. Ischemic myocardium, on the other hand, recovers in a few hours. Once perfusion is restored, thallium crosses into the myocardial cells, and the area of defect on the resting images is either smaller or completely reversed. These reversible defects constitute positive stress test findings. Usually, cardiac catheterization is recommended after a positive test result to determine whether angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery is needed.

Another radioisotope used for cardiac imaging is $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$. Technetium can be combined with various chemical compounds, giving it an affinity for different types of cells. For example, $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ sestamibi (Cardiolite) is distributed to myocardial cells in proportion to their amount of perfusion, making this tracer excellent for assessing perfusion to the myocardium. The procedure for cardiac imaging using $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ sestamibi with stress testing is similar to the one using thallium, with two differences. Patients receiving $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ sestamibi can have their resting images recorded before or after the exercise images. Timing of the images is not important because the half-life of $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ is short, and $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ needs to be injected before each scan. Also, SPECT imaging with $\mathrm{Tc}^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ sestamibi provides high-quality images.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The patient undergoing nuclear imaging techniques with stress testing should be prepared for the type of stressor to be used (exercise or drug) and the type of imaging technique (planar or SPECT). The patient may be concerned about receiving a radioactive substance and needs to be reassured that these tracers are safe, the radiation exposure being similar to that of other diagnostic x-ray studies. No postprocedure radiation precautions are necessary.

When providing teaching for patients undergoing SPECT, the nurse should instruct them that their arms will need to be positioned over their head for about 20 to 30 minutes. If they are physically unable to do this, thallium with planar imaging can be used.

\section*{Test of Ventricular Function and Wall Motion}

Equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA), also known as multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning, is a common noninvasive technique that uses a conventional scintillation camera interfaced with a computer to record images of the heart during several hundred heartbeats. The computer processes the data and allows for sequential viewing of the functioning heart. The sequential images are analyzed to evaluate left ventricular function, wall motion, and ejection fraction. MUGA scanning can also be used to assess the differences in left ventricular function during rest and exercise.

The patient is reassured that there is no known radiation danger and is instructed to remain motionless during the scan.

\section*{Computed Tomography}

Computed tomography (CT), also called computerized axial tomographic (CAT) scanning or electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT), uses x-rays to provide cross-sectional images of the chest, including the heart and great vessels. These techniques are used to evaluate cardiac masses and diseases of the aorta and pericardium.

EBCT, also known as the Ultrafast CT, is an especially fast x-ray scanning technique that results in much faster image acquisition with a higher degree of resolution than traditional x-ray or CT scanning provides (Woods et al., 1999). It is used to evaluate bypass graft patency, congenital heart lesions, left and right ventricular muscle mass, chamber volumes, cardiac output, and ejection fraction. For people without previous MI, PTCA, or coronary artery bypass surgery, the EBCT is used to determine the amount of calcium deposits in the coronary arteries and underlying atherosclerosis. From this scan, a calcium score is derived that predicts the incidence of cardiac events, such as MI or the need for a revascularization procedure within the next 1 to 2 years.

The EBCT is not widely used, but it does show great promise for early detection of CAD that is not yet clinically significant and that would not be identified by traditional testing methods, such as the exercise stress test.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Patient preparation is the primary role of the nurse for these tests. The nurse should instruct the patient that he will be positioned on a table during the scan while the scanner rotates around him. The procedure is noninvasive and painless. However, to obtain adequate images, the patient must lie perfectly still during the scanning process. An intravenous access line is necessary if contrast enhancement is to be used.

\section*{Positron Emission Tomography}

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive scanning method that was used in the past primarily to study neurologic dysfunction. More recently, and with increasing frequency, PET has been used to diagnose cardiac dysfunction. PET provides more specific information about myocardial perfusion and viability than does TEE or thallium scanning. For cardiac patients, including those without symptoms, PET helps in planning treatment (eg, coronary artery bypass surgery, angioplasty). PET also helps evaluate the patency of native and previously grafted vessels and the collateral circulation.

During a PET scan, radioisotopes are administered by injection; one compound is used to determine blood flow in the myocardium, and another shows the metabolic function. The PET camera provides detailed three-dimensional images of the distributed compounds. The viability of the myocardium is determined by comparing the extent of glucose metabolism in the myocardium to the degree of blood flow. For example, ischemic but viable tissue would show decreased blood flow and elevated metabolism. For a patient with this finding, revascularization through surgery or angioplasty would be likely to improve heart function. Restrictions of food intake before the test vary among institutions, but, because PET evaluates glucose metabolism, the patient's blood glucose level should be in the normal range. Although PET equipment is costly, it is increasingly valued and available.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Nurses involved in PET and other scanning procedures may instruct the patient to refrain from using tobacco and ingesting caffeine for 4 hours before the procedure. They should also reassure the patient that radiation exposure is at safe and acceptable levels, similar to those of other diagnostic x-ray studies.

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive, painless technique that is used to examine both the physiologic and anatomic properties of the heart. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and computer-generated pictures to image the heart and great vessels. It is valuable in diagnosing diseases of the aorta, heart muscle, and pericardium, as well as congenital heart lesions. The application of this technique to the evaluation of coronary artery anatomy, cardiac blood flow, and myocardial viability in conjunction with pharmacologic stress testing is being investigated.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Because of the strong magnetic field used during MRI, diagnostic centers where these procedures are performed carefully screen patients for contraindications. Standardized questionnaires are commonly used to determine whether the patient has a pacemaker, metal plates, prosthetic joints, or other metallic implants that can become dislodged if exposed to MRI. During an MRI, the patient is positioned supine on a table that is placed into an enclosed imager or tube that contains the magnetic field. People who are claustrophobic may need to receive a mild sedative before undergoing an MRI. As the MRI is performed, there is an intermittent clanking or thumping sound from the magnetic coils that can be annoying to the patient, so patients are offered headsets to listen to music. The scanner is equipped with a microphone so that the patient can communicate with the staff. During the scanning, the patient is instructed to remain still and not move.

NURSING ALERT No metal can be in the MRI room because metal objects can become dangerous projectiles; this includes such items as clipboards, paperclips, oxygen tanks, and monitors.

\section*{CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION}

Cardiac catheterization is an invasive diagnostic procedure in which radiopaque arterial and venous catheters are introduced into selected blood vessels of the right and left sides of the heart. Catheter advancement is guided by fluoroscopy. Most commonly, the catheters are inserted percutaneously through the blood vessels, or via a cutdown procedure if the patient has poor vascular access. Pressures and oxygen saturations in the four heart chambers are measured. Cardiac catheterization is used to diagnose CAD, assess coronary artery patency, and determine the extent of atherosclerosis based on the percentage of coronary artery obstruction. These results determine whether revascularization procedures including PTCA or coronary artery bypass surgery may be of benefit to the patient (see Chap. 28).

During cardiac catheterization, the patient has an intravenous line in place for the administration of sedatives, fluids, heparin, and other medications. Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring that includes BP and multiple ECG tracings is necessary to continuously observe for dysrhythmias or hemodynamic instability. The myocardium can become ischemic and trigger dysrhythmias as catheters are positioned in the coronary arteries or during injection of contrast agents. Resuscitation equipment must be readily available during the procedure. Staff must be prepared to provide advanced cardiac life support measures as necessary.

Radiopaque contrast agents are used to visualize the coronary arteries; some contrast agents contain iodine. The patient is as-
sessed before the procedure for previous reactions to contrast agents or allergies to iodine-containing substances (eg, seafood). If the patient has a suspected or known allergy to the substance, antihistamines or methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) may be administered before the procedure. In addition, the following blood tests are performed to identify abnormalities that may complicate recovery: BUN and creatinine levels, INR or PT, aPTT, hematocrit and hemoglobin values, platelet count, and electrolyte levels.

Diagnostic cardiac catheterizations are commonly performed on an outpatient basis and require 2 to 6 hours of bed rest before ambulation. For most patients, bed rest for 6 hours compared to 2 hours has no advantage with regard to groin bleeding complications (Logemann et al., 1999). However, variations in time to ambulation are most often related to the size of the catheter used during the procedure, the anticoagulation status of the patient, other patient variables (eg, advanced age, obesity, bleeding disorder), the method used for hemostasis of the arterial puncture site after the procedure, and institutional policies. The use of smaller (4 or 6 Fr) catheters, which are more amenable to shorter recovery times, is common in diagnostic cardiac catheterizations. There are several methods available to achieve arterial hemostasis after catheter removal, including manual pressure, mechanical compression devices such as the FemoStop (placed over puncture site for 30 minutes), and percutaneously deployed devices. The latter devices are positioned at the femoral arterial puncture site after completion of the procedure. They deploy collagen (VasoSeal), sutures (Perclose, Techstar), or a combination of both (AngioSeal). Major benefits of these devices include reliable, immediate hemostasis and shorter time on bed rest without a significant increase in bleeding or other complications (Baim et al., 2000). A number of factors determine which hemostatic methods are used and are based on the physician's preference, the patient's condition, cost, and institutional availability of the equipment.

Patients hospitalized for angina or acute MI may also require cardiac catheterization. After the procedure, these patients usually return to their hospital rooms for recovery. In some cardiac catheterization laboratories, an angioplasty may be performed immediately after the catheterization if indicated.

\section*{ANGIOGRAPHY}

Cardiac catheterization is usually performed with angiography, a technique of injecting a contrast agent into the vascular system to outline the heart and blood vessels. When a particular heart chamber or blood vessel is singled out for study, the procedure is known as selective angiography. Angiography makes use of cineangiograms, a series of rapidly changing films on an intensified fluoroscopic screen that record the passage of the contrast agent through the vascular site or sites. The recorded information allows for comparison of data over time. Common sites for selective angiography are the aorta, the coronary arteries, and the right and left sides of the heart.

\section*{Aortography}

An aortogram is a form of angiography that outlines the lumen of the aorta and the major arteries arising from it. In thoracic aortography, a contrast agent is used to study the aortic arch and its major branches. The catheter may be introduced into the aorta using the translumbar or retrograde brachial or femoral artery approach.

\section*{Coronary Arteriography}

In coronary arteriography, the catheter is introduced into the right or left brachial or femoral artery, then passed into the ascending aorta and manipulated into the appropriate coronary artery. Coronary arteriography is used to evaluate the degree of atherosclerosis and to guide the selection of treatment. It is also used to study suspected congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries.

\section*{Right Heart Catheterization}

Right heart catheterization usually precedes left heart catheterization. It involves the passage of a catheter from an antecubital or femoral vein into the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary arterioles. Pressures and oxygen saturations from each of these areas are obtained and recorded.

Although right heart catheterization is considered a relatively safe procedure, potential complications include cardiac dysrhythmias, venous spasm, infection of the insertion site, cardiac perforation, and, rarely, cardiac arrest.

\section*{Left Heart Catheterization}

Left heart catheterization is performed to evaluate the patency of the coronary arteries and the function of the left ventricle and the mitral and aortic valves. Potential complications include dysrhythmias, MI, perforation of the heart or great vessels, and systemic embolization. Left heart catheterization is performed by retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle. In this approach, the physician usually inserts the catheter into the right brachial artery or a femoral artery and advances it into the aorta and left ventricle.

After the procedure, the catheter is carefully withdrawn and arterial hemostasis is achieved using manual pressure or other techniques previously described. If the physician performed an arterial or venous cutdown, the site is sutured and a sterile dressing is applied.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Nursing responsibilities before cardiac catheterization include the following:
- Instruct the patient to fast, usually for 8 to 12 hours, before the procedure. If catheterization is to be performed as an outpatient procedure, explain that a friend, family member, or other responsible person must transport the patient home.
- Prepare the patient for the expected duration of the procedure; indicate that it will involve lying on a hard table for less than 2 hours.
- Reassure the patient that mild sedatives or moderate sedation will be given intravenously.
- Prepare the patient to experience certain sensations during the catheterization. Knowing what to expect can help the patient cope with the experience. Explain that an occasional pounding sensation (palpitation) may be felt in the chest because of extrasystoles that almost always occur, particularly when the catheter tip touches the myocardium. The patient may be asked to cough and to breathe deeply, especially after the injection of contrast agent. Coughing may help to disrupt a dysrhythmia and to clear the contrast agent from the arteries. Breathing deeply and holding the breath helps to lower the diaphragm for better visualization of heart structures. The injection of a contrast agent into either side
of the heart may produce a flushed feeling throughout the body and a sensation similar to the need to void, which subsides in 1 minute or less.
- Encourage the patient to express fears and anxieties. Provide teaching and reassurance to reduce apprehension.
Nursing responsibilities after cardiac catheterization may include the following:
1. Observe the catheter access site for bleeding or hematoma formation, and assess the peripheral pulses in the affected extremity (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in the lower extremity, radial pulse in the upper extremity) every 15 minutes for 1 hour, and then every 1 to 2 hours until the pulses are stable.
2. Evaluate temperature and color of the affected extremity and any patient complaints of pain, numbness, or tingling sensations to determine signs of arterial insufficiency. Report changes promptly.
3. Monitor for dysrhythmias by observing the cardiac monitor or by assessing the apical and peripheral pulses for changes in rate and rhythm. A vasovagal reaction, consisting of bradycardia, hypotension, and nausea, can be precipitated by a distended bladder or by discomfort during removal of the arterial catheter, especially if a femoral site has been used. Prompt intervention is critical; this includes raising the feet and legs above the head, administering intravenous fluids, and administering intravenous atropine.
4. Inform the patient that if the procedure is performed percutaneously through the femoral artery (and without the use of devices such as VasoSeal, Perclose, or Angio-Seal), the patient will remain on bed rest for 2 to 6 hours with the affected leg straight and the head elevated to 30 degrees (Logemann et al., 1999). For comfort, the patient may be turned from side to side with the affected extremity straight. If the cardiologist uses deployed devices, check local nursing care standards, but anticipate that the patient will have less restrictions on elevation of the head of the bed and will be allowed to ambulate in 2 hours or less (Baim et al., 2000). Analgesic medication is administered as prescribed for discomfort.
5. Instruct the patient to report chest pain and bleeding or sudden discomfort from the catheter insertion sites immediately.
6. Encourage fluids to increase urinary output and flush out the dye.
7. Ensure safety by instructing the patient to ask for help when getting out of bed the first time after the procedure, because orthostatic hypotension may occur and the patient may feel dizzy and lightheaded.
For patients being discharged from the hospital on the same day as the procedure, additional instructions are provided. They appear in Chart 26-4.

\section*{ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC TESTING}

The electrophysiology study (EPS) is an invasive procedure that plays a major role in the diagnosis and management of serious dysrhythmias and is used (1) to distinguish atrial from ventricular tachycardias when the determination cannot be made from the 12-lead ECG, (2) to evaluate how readily a life-threatening dysrhythmia (eg, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-193.jpg?height=805&width=864&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=202)
can be induced, (3) to evaluate AV node function, (4) to evaluate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic medications in suppressing the dysrhythmia, and (5) to determine the need for other therapeutic interventions, such as a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or radiofrequency ablation (discussed in Chap. 27). EPS is indicated for patients with syncope and/or palpitations and for survivors of cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation (sudden cardiac death).

The initial study can take up to 4 hours. The patient receives moderate sedation. Catheters with recording and electrical stimulating (pacing) capabilities are inserted into the heart through the femoral and right subclavian veins to record electrical activity in the right and left atrium, bundle of His, and right ventricle. Fluoroscopy guides the positioning of these catheters. Baseline intracardiac recordings are obtained; programmed electrical stimulations of the atrium or ventricle are then administered in an attempt to induce the patient's dysthythmia. If the dysrhythmia is induced, various antiarrhythmic medications are administered intravenously. The study is repeated after each medication to evaluate which medication or combination of medications is most effective in controlling the dysrhythmia.

After the study, the patient receives an equivalent oral antiarrhythmic agent, and subsequent studies may be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of that medication. Results of the study may indicate the need for other therapeutic interventions, such as a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

During EPS, lethal dysrhythmias may be induced; therefore, the procedure must be performed in a controlled environment with resuscitation equipment (eg, defibrillator) readily available. Possible complications include bleeding and hematoma from the catheter insertion sites, pneumothorax (air in the pleural cavity that may collapse portions of the lung), deep vein thrombosis, stroke, and sudden death.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Patients receive nothing to eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure. Antiarrhythmic medications are withheld for at least 24 hours before the initial study, and the patient's cardiac rate
and rhythm are carefully monitored for dysrhythmias. Other medications may be taken with sips of water.

Thorough preparation before EPS will help to minimize patient anxiety. Ensure that the patient understands the reason for the study and is able to describe the common sensations and experiences expected during and after the study. Often the EPS laboratory has relaxation interventions available for patients, such as headsets with music. Also, the patient needs to be aware that the nurses in the EPS laboratory will be monitoring carefully for signs of discomfort and will offer intravenous medications to reduce discomfort or anxiety. Patients should be reminded to request these medications if necessary. Postprocedure interventions include careful monitoring for complications. The nurse takes vital signs, reviews tracings of continuous ECG monitoring, assesses the apical pulse, auscultates for pericardial friction rub (which indicates bleeding into the pericardial sac), and inspects the catheter insertion sites for bleeding or hematoma formation.

In addition, the nurse assists the patient to maintain bed rest with the affected extremity kept straight and the head of the bed elevated to 30 degrees for 4 to 6 hours. The frequency of assessments and the duration of bed rest may vary based on institutional policy and physician preference.

\section*{HEMODYNAMIC MONITORING}

Critically ill patients require continuous assessment of their cardiovascular system to diagnose and manage their complex medical conditions. This is most commonly achieved by the use of direct pressure monitoring systems, often referred to as hemodynamic monitoring. Central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressure, and intra-arterial BP monitoring are common forms of hemodynamic monitoring. Patients requiring hemodynamic monitoring are cared for in specialty critical care units. Some critical care step-down units also admit stable patients with CVP or intra-arterial BP monitoring. Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring is used in some facilities.

To perform invasive monitoring, specialized equipment is necessary and includes the following:
- A CVP, pulmonary artery, or arterial catheter, which is introduced into the appropriate blood vessel or heart chamber
- A flush system composed of intravenous solution (which may include heparin), tubing, stopcocks, and a flush device, which provides for continuous and manual flushing of the system
- A pressure bag placed around the flush solution that is maintained at 300 mm Hg of pressure; the pressurized flush system delivers 3 to 5 mL of solution per hour through the catheter to prevent clotting and backflow of blood into the pressure monitoring system
- A transducer to convert the pressure coming from the artery or heart chamber into an electrical signal
- An amplifier or monitor, which increases the size of the electrical signal for display on an oscilloscope

\section*{Central Venous Pressure Monitoring}

The CVP, the pressure in the vena cava or right atrium, is used to assess right ventricular function and venous blood return to the right side of the heart. The CVP can be continuously measured by connecting either a catheter positioned in the vena cava or the proximal port of a pulmonary artery catheter to a pressure monitoring system. The pulmonary artery catheter, described in greater
detail later, is used for critically ill patients. Patients in general medical-surgical units who require CVP monitoring may have a single-lumen or multilumen catheter placed into the superior vena cava. Intermittent measurement of the CVP can then be obtained with the use of a water manometer.

Because the pressures in the right atrium and right ventricle are equal at the end of diastole ( 0 to 8 mm Hg ), the CVP is also an indirect method of determining right ventricular filling pressure (preload). This makes the CVP a useful hemodynamic parameter to observe when managing an unstable patient's fluid volume status. CVP monitoring is most valuable when pressures are monitored over time and are correlated with the patient's clinical status. A rising pressure may be caused by hypervolemia or by a condition, such as HF, that results in a decrease in myocardial contractility. Pulmonary artery monitoring is preferred for the patient with HF. Decreased CVP indicates reduced right ventricular preload, most often caused by hypovolemia. This diagnosis can be substantiated when a rapid intravenous infusion causes the CVP to rise. (CVP monitoring is not clinically useful in a patient with HF in whom left ventricular failure precedes right ventricular failure, because in these patients an elevated CVP is a very late sign of HF.)

Before insertion of a CVP catheter, the site is prepared by shaving if necessary and by cleansing with an antiseptic solution. A local anesthetic may be used. The physician threads a singlelumen or multilumen catheter through the external jugular, antecubital, or femoral vein into the vena cava just above or within the right atrium.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Once the CVP catheter is inserted, it is secured and a dry, sterile dressing is applied. Catheter placement is confirmed by a chest x-ray, and the site is inspected daily for signs of infection. The dressing and pressure monitoring system or water manometer are changed according to hospital policy. In general, the dressing is to be kept dry and air occlusive. Dressing changes are performed with the use of sterile technique. CVP catheters can be used for infusing intravenous fluids, administering intravenous medications, and drawing blood specimens in addition to monitoring pressure.

To measure the CVP, the transducer (when a pressure monitoring system is used) or the zero mark on the manometer (when a water manometer is used) must be placed at a standard reference point, called the phlebostatic axis (Fig. 26-12). After locating this position, the nurse may make an ink mark on the

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-194.jpg?height=1197&width=1705&top_left_y=1084&top_left_x=149}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 26-12 The phlebostatic axis and the phlebostatic level. (A) The phlebostatic axis is the crossing of two reference lines: (1) a line from the fourth intercostal space at the point where it joins the sternum, drawn out to the side of the body beneath the axilla; and (2) a line midway between the anterior and posterior surfaces of the chest. (B) The phlebostatic level is a horizontal line through the phlebostatic axis. The air-fluid interface of the stopcock of the transducer, or the zero mark on the manometer, must be level with this axis for accurate measurements. When moving from the flat to erect positions, the patient moves the chest and therefore the reference level; the phlebostatic level stays horizontal through the same reference point. (C) Two methods for referencing the pressure system to the phlebostatic axis. The system can be referenced by placing the air-fluid interface of either the in-line stopcock or stopcock on top of the transducer at the phlebostatic level.}
\end{figure}
patient's chest to indicate the location. If the phlebostatic axis is used, CVP can be measured correctly with the patient supine at any backrest position up to 45 degrees. The range for a normal CVP is 0 to 8 mm Hg with a pressure monitoring system or 3 to $8 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ with a water manometer system. The most common complications of CVP monitoring are infection and air embolism.

\section*{Pulmonary Artery Pressure Monitoring}

Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is an important tool used in critical care for assessing left ventricular function, diagnosing the etiology of shock, and evaluating the patient's response to medical interventions (eg, fluid administration, vasoactive medications). Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is achieved by using a pulmonary artery catheter and pressure monitoring system. Catheters vary in their number of lumens and their types of measurement (eg, cardiac output, oxygen saturation) or pacing capabilities. All types require that a balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter be inserted into a large vein (usually the subclavian, jugular, or femoral vein); the catheter is then passed into the vena cava and right atrium. In the right atrium, the balloon tip is inflated, and the catheter is carried rapidly by the flow of blood through the tricuspid valve, into the right ventricle, through the pulmonic valve, and into a branch of the pulmonary artery. When the catheter reaches a small pulmonary artery, the balloon is deflated and the catheter is secured with sutures. Fluoroscopy may be used during insertion to visualize the progression of the catheter through the heart chambers to the pulmonary artery. This procedure can be performed in the operating room or cardiac catheterization laboratory or at the bedside in the critical care unit. During insertion of the pulmonary artery catheter, the bedside monitor is observed for waveform and ECG changes as the catheter is moved
through the heart chambers on the right side and into the pulmonary artery.

After the catheter is correctly positioned, the following pressures can be measured: CVP or right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (Fig. 26-13). If a thermodilution catheter is used, the cardiac output can be measured and systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance can be calculated.

Normal pulmonary artery pressure is $25 / 9 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, with a mean pressure of 15 mm Hg (see Fig. 26-5 for normal ranges). When the balloon tip is inflated, usually with 1 mL of air, the catheter floats farther out into the pulmonary artery until it becomes wedged. This is an occlusive maneuver that impedes blood flow through that segment of the pulmonary artery. A pressure measurement, called pulmonary artery wedge pressure, is taken within seconds after wedging of the pulmonary artery catheter; then the balloon is immediately deflated and blood flow is restored. The nurse who obtains the wedge reading ensures that the catheter has returned to its normal position in the pulmonary artery by evaluating the pulmonary artery pressure waveform. The pulmonary artery diastolic reading and the wedge pressure reflect the pressure in the ventricle at end-diastole and are particularly important to monitor in critically ill patients, because they are used to evaluate left ventricular filling pressures (preload). At end-diastole, when the mitral valve is open, the wedge pressure is the same as the pressure in the left atrium and the left ventricle, unless the patient has mitral valve disease or pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is a mean pressure and is normally 4.5 to 13 mm Hg . Critically ill patients usually require higher left ventricular filling pressures to optimize cardiac output. These patients may need to have their wedge pressure maintained as high as 18 mm Hg .

\end{figure}

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Catheter site care is essentially the same as for a CVP catheter. As in measuring CVP, the transducer must be positioned at the phlebostatic axis to ensure accurate readings (see Fig. 26-12). Complications of pulmonary artery pressure monitoring include infection, pulmonary artery rupture, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary infarction, catheter kinking, dysrhythmias, and air embolism.

\section*{Intra-arterial Blood Pressure Monitoring}

Intra-arterial BP monitoring is used to obtain direct and continuous BP measurements in critically ill patients who have severe hypertension or hypotension (Fig. 26-14). Arterial catheters are also useful when arterial blood gas measurements and blood samples need to be obtained frequently.

Once an arterial site is selected (radial, brachial, femoral, or dorsalis pedis), collateral circulation to the area must be confirmed before the catheter is placed. This is a safety precaution to prevent compromised arterial perfusion to the area distal to the arterial catheter insertion site. If no collateral circulation exists and the cannulated artery became occluded, ischemia and infarction of the area distal to that artery could occur. Collateral circulation to the hand can be checked by the Allen test to evaluate the radial and ulnar arteries or by an ultrasonic Doppler test for any of the arteries. With the Allen test, the nurse compresses the radial and ulnar arteries simultaneously and asks the patient to make a fist, causing the hand to blanch. After the patient opens the fist, the nurse releases the pressure on the ulnar artery while maintaining pressure on the radial artery.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Site preparation and care are the same as for CVP catheters. The catheter flush solution is the same as for pulmonary artery catheters. A transducer is attached, and pressures are measured in millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ). Complications include local obstruction with distal ischemia, external hemorrhage, massive ecchymosis, dissection, air embolism, blood loss, pain, arteriospasm, and infection.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are caring for an elderly man who has had three hospital admissions in 6 months for HF. To plan for his discharge you need to fully understand what is causing these recurrent HF episodes. What medical and nursing history, physical examination, and laboratory data will you need to collect to help you understand the recurrent episodes of HF ? What types of information are necessary to help you formulate his plan for discharge? With what other team members might you consult before completing this plan?
2. While working in a primary care clinic, you notice that many of the patients use tobacco products including cigarettes and chewing tobacco. What are the health risks of tobacco use? The clinic does not have a smoking cessation protocol. You want to help people become tobacco free but have little experience in providing cessation advice. What information and resources will you need to obtain to devise and implement a smoking cessation protocol?
3. While making a home visit, your patient, a 54-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use, tells you she has had overwhelming fatigue and right scapular and shoulder pain going down into her arm for the last 10 hours. Describe your rapid chest pain assessment and management plan for this patient. Discuss the factors that may be contributing to her delay in seeking care for symptoms of acute MI. Compare and contrast symptoms of acute MI and factors contributing to delay in seeking care.

Without a regular rate and rhythm, the heart may not perform efficiently as a pump to circulate oxygenated blood and other life-sustaining nutrients to all the body organs (including itself) and tissues. With an irregular or erratic rhythm, the heart is considered to be dysrhythmic (sometimes called arrhythmic). This has the potential to be a dangerous condition.

\section*{Dysrhythmias}

Dysrhythmias are disorders of the formation or conduction (or both) of the electrical impulse within the heart. These disorders can cause disturbances of the heart rate, the heart rhythm, or both. Dysrhythmias may initially be evidenced by the hemodynamic effect they cause (eg, a change in conduction may change the pumping action of the heart and cause decreased blood pressure). Dysrhythmias are diagnosed by analyzing the electrocardiographic waveform. They are named according to the site of origin of the impulse and the mechanism of formation or conduction involved (Chart 27-1). For example, an impulse that originates in the sinoatrial (SA) node and that has a slow rate is called sinus bradycardia.

\section*{NORMAL ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION}

The electrical impulse that stimulates and paces the cardiac muscle normally originates in the sinus node (SA node), an area located near the superior vena cava in the right atrium. Usually, the electrical impulse occurs at a rate ranging between 60 and 100 times a minute in the adult. The electrical impulse quickly travels from the sinus node through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node (Fig. 27-1). The electrical stimulation of the muscle cells of the atria causes them to contract. The structure of the AV node slows the electrical impulse, which allows time for the atria to contract and fill the ventricles with blood before the electrical impulse

travels very quickly through the bundle of His to the right and left bundle branches and the Purkinje fibers, located in the ventricular muscle. The electrical stimulation of the muscle cells of the ventricles, in turn, causes the mechanical contraction of the ventricles (systole). The cells repolarize and the ventricles then relax (diastole). The process from sinus node electrical impulse generation through ventricular repolarization completes the electromechanical circuit, and the cycle begins again.

Sinus rhythm promotes cardiovascular circulation. The electrical impulse causes (and, therefore, is followed by) the mechanical contraction of the heart muscle. The electrical stimulation is called depolarization; the mechanical contraction is called systole. Electrical relaxation is called repolarization and mechanical relaxation is called diastole. See Chapter 26 for a more complete explanation of cardiac function.

\caption{EIGURE 27-1 Relationship of electrocardiogram (ECG) complex, lead system, and electrical impulse. The heart conducts electrical activity, which the ECG measures and shows. The configurations of electrical activity displayed on the ECG vary depending on the lead (or view) of the ECG and on the rhythm of the heart. Therefore, the configuration of a normal rhythm tracing from lead I will differ from the configuration of a normal rhythm tracing from lead II, lead II will differ from lead III, and so on. The same is true for abnormal rhythms and cardiac disorders. To make an accurate assessment of the heart's electrical activity or to identify where, when, and what abnormalities occur, the ECG needs to be evaluated from every lead, not just from lead II. Here the different areas of electrical activity are identified by color.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Influences on Heart Rate and Contractility}

The heart rate is influenced by the autonomic nervous system, which consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic nerve fibers (also referred to as adrenergic fibers) are attached to the heart and arteries as well as several other areas in the body. Stimulation of the sympathetic system increases heart rate (positive chronotropy), conduction through the AV node (positive dromotropy), and the force of myocardial contraction (positive inotropy). Sympathetic stimulation also constricts peripheral blood vessels, therefore increasing blood pressure. Parasympathetic nerve fibers are also attached to the heart and arteries. Parasympathetic stimulation reduces the heart rate (negative chronotropy), AV conduction (negative dromotropy), and the force of atrial myocardial contraction. The decreased sympathetic stimulation results in dilation of arteries, thereby lowering blood pressure.

Manipulation of the autonomic nervous system may increase or decrease the incidence of dysrhythmias. Increased sympathetic stimulation-caused, for example, by exercise, anxiety, fever, or administration of catecholamines (eg, dopamine [Intropin], aminophylline, dobutamine [Dobutrex])-may increase the incidence of dysrhythmias. Decreased sympathetic stimulation (eg, with rest, anxiety-reduction methods such as therapeutic communication or prayer, administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents) may decrease the incidence of dysrhythmias.

\section*{INTERPRETATION OF THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM}

The electrical impulse that travels through the heart can be viewed by means of electrocardiography, the end product of which is an electrocardiogram (ECG). Each phase of the cardiac cycle is re-
flected by specific waveforms on the screen of a cardiac monitor or on a strip of ECG graph paper.

An ECG is obtained by slightly abrading the skin with a clean dry gauze pad and placing electrodes on the body at specific areas. Electrodes come in various shapes and sizes, but all have two components: (1) an adhesive substance that attaches to the skin to secure the electrode in place and (2) a substance that reduces the skin's electrical impedance and promotes detection of the electrical current.

The number and placement of the electrodes depend on the type of ECG needed. Most continuous monitors use two to five electrodes, usually placed on the limbs and the chest. These electrodes create an imaginary line, called a lead, that serves as a reference point from which the electrical activity is viewed. A lead is like an eye of a camera; it has a narrow peripheral field of vision, looking only at the electrical activity directly in front of it. Therefore, the ECG waveforms that appear on the paper or cardiac monitor represent the electrical current in relation to the lead (see Fig. 27-1). A change in the waveform can be caused by a change in the electrical current (where it originates or how it is conducted) or by a change in the lead.

\section*{Obtaining an Electrocardiogram}

Electrodes are attached to cable wires, which are connected to one of the following:
- An ECG machine placed at the patient's side for an immediate recording (standard 12-lead ECG)
- A cardiac monitor at the patient's bedside for continuous reading; this kind of monitoring, usually called hardwire monitoring, is associated with intensive care units
- A small box that the patient carries and that continuously transmits the ECG information by radio waves to a central monitor located elsewhere (called telemetry)
- A small, lightweight tape recorder-like machine (called a Holter monitor) that the patient wears and that continuously records the ECG on a tape, which is later viewed and analyzed with a scanner
The placement of electrodes for continuous monitoring, telemetry, or Holter monitoring varies with the type of technology that is appropriate and available, the purpose of monitoring, and the standards of the institution. For a standard 12-lead ECG, 10 electrodes (six on the chest and four on the limbs) are placed on the body (Fig. 27-2). To prevent interference from the electrical activity of skeletal muscle, the limb electrodes are usually placed on areas that are not bony and that do not have significant movement. These limb electrodes provide the first six leads: leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL , and aVF . The six chest electrodes are attached to the chest at very specific areas. The chest electrodes provide the $V$ or precordial leads, $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ through $\mathrm{V}_{6}$. To locate the fourth intercostal space and the placement of $\mathrm{V}_{1}$, locate the sternal angle and then the sternal notch, which is about 1 or 2 inches below the sternal angle. When the fingers are moved to the patient's immediate right, the second rib can be palpated. The second intercostal space is the indentation felt just below the second rib.

Locating the specific intercostal space is critical for correct chest electrode placement. Errors in diagnosis can occur if electrodes are incorrectly placed. Sometimes, when the patient is in the hospital and needs to be monitored closely for ECG changes, the chest electrodes are left in place to ensure the same placement for follow-up ECGs.

A standard 12-lead ECG reflects the electrical activity primarily in the left ventricle. Placement of additional electrodes for

other leads may be needed to obtain more complete information. For example, in patients with suspected right-sided heart damage, right-sided precordial leads are required to evaluate the right ventricle (see Fig. 27-2).

\section*{Analysis of the Electrocardiogram}

The ECG waveform represents the function of the heart's conduction system, which normally initiates and conducts the electrical activity, in relation to the lead. When analyzed accurately, the ECG offers important information about the electrical activity
of the heart. ECG waveforms are printed on graph paper that is divided by light and dark vertical and horizontal lines at standard intervals (Fig. 27-3). Time and rate are measured on the horizontal axis of the graph, and amplitude or voltage is measured on the vertical axis. When an ECG waveform moves toward the top of the paper, it is called a positive deflection. When it moves toward the bottom of the paper, it is called a negative deflection. When reviewing an ECG, each waveform should be examined and compared with the others.

\section*{WAVES, COMPLEXES, AND INTERVALS}

The ECG is composed of waveforms (including the P wave, the QRS complex, the $T$ wave, and possibly a $U$ wave) and of segments or intervals (including the PR interval, the ST segment, and the QT interval) (see Fig. 27-3).

The $\mathbf{P}$ wave represents the electrical impulse starting in the sinus node and spreading through the atria. Therefore, the P wave represents atrial muscle depolarization. It is normally 2.5 mm or less in height and 0.11 second or less in duration.

The QRS complex represents ventricular muscle depolarization. Not all QRS complexes have all three waveforms. The first negative deflection after the P wave is the Q wave, which is normally less than 0.04 second in duration and less than $25 \%$ of the $R$ wave amplitude; the first positive deflection after the $P$ wave is the $R$ wave; and the $S$ wave is the first negative deflection after the $R$ wave. When a wave is less than 5 mm in height, small letters ( $\mathrm{q}, \mathrm{r}, \mathrm{s}$ ) are used; when a wave is taller than 5 mm , capital letters ( $\mathrm{Q}, \mathrm{R}, \mathrm{S}$ ) are used. The QRS complex is normally less than 0.12 seconds in duration.

The $\mathbf{T}$ wave represents ventricular muscle repolarization (when the cells regain a negative charge; also called the resting state). It follows the QRS complex and is usually the same direction as the QRS complex.

The $\mathbf{U}$ wave is thought to represent repolarization of the Purkinje fibers, but it sometimes is seen in patients with hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hypertension, or heart disease. If present, the U wave follows the T wave and is usually smaller than the P wave. If tall, it may be mistaken for an extra P wave.

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the $P$ wave to the beginning of the QRS complex and represents the time needed for sinus node stimulation, atrial depolarization, and conduction through the AV node before ventricular depolarization. In adults, the PR interval normally ranges from 0.12 to 0.20 seconds in duration.

The ST segment, which represents early ventricular repolarization, lasts from the end of the QRS complex to the beginning of the T wave. The beginning of the ST segment is usually identified by a change in the thickness or angle of the terminal portion of the QRS complex. The end of the ST segment may be more difficult to identify because it merges into the T wave. The ST segment is normally isoelectric (see discussion of TP interval). It is analyzed to identify whether it is above or below the isoelectric line, which may be, among other signs and symptoms, a sign of cardiac ischemia (see Chap. 28).

The QT interval, which represents the total time for ventricular depolarization and repolarization, is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The QT interval varies with heart rate, gender, and age, and the measured interval needs to be corrected for these variables through a specific calculation. Several ECG interpretation books contain charts of these calculations. The QT interval is usually 0.32 to 0.40 seconds in duration if the heart rate is 65 to 95 beats per minute. If the QT interval becomes prolonged, the patient may be at risk for a lethal ventricular dysrhythmia called torsades de pointes.

The TP interval is measured from the end of the T wave to the beginning of the next P wave, an isoelectric period (see Fig 27-3).

When no electrical activity is detected, the line on the graph remains flat; this is called the isoelectric line. The ST segment is compared with the TP interval to detect changes from the line on the graph during the isoelectric period.

The PP interval is measured from the beginning of one $P$ wave to the beginning of the next. The PP interval is used to determine atrial rhythm and atrial rate. The RR interval is measured from one QRS complex to the next QRS complex. The RR interval is used to determine ventricular rate and rhythm (Fig. 27-4).

\section*{DETERMINING VENTRICULAR HEART RATE FROM THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM}

Heart rate can be obtained from the ECG strip by several methods. A 1 -minute strip contains 300 large boxes and 1500 small boxes. Therefore, an easy and accurate method of determining heart rate with a regular rhythm is to count the number of small boxes within an RR interval and divide 1500 by that number. If, for example, there are 10 small boxes between two R waves, the heart rate is $1500 \div 10$, or 150 ; if there are 25 small boxes, the heart rate is $1500 \div 25$, or 60 (see Fig. 27-4A).

An alternative but less accurate method for estimating heart rate, which is usually used when the rhythm is irregular, is to count the number of RR intervals in 6 seconds and multiply that number by 10 . The top of the ECG paper is usually marked at 3 -second intervals, which is 15 large boxes horizontally (see Fig. $27-4 \mathrm{~B}$ ). The RR intervals are counted, rather than QRS complexes, because a computed heart rate based on the latter might be inaccurately high.

The same methods may be used for determining atrial rate, using the PP interval instead of the RR interval.

\section*{DETERMINING HEART RHYTHM FROM THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM}

The rhythm is often identified at the same time the rate is determined. The RR interval is used to determine ventricular rhythm and the PP interval to determine atrial rhythm. If the intervals are the same or nearly the same throughout the strip, the rhythm is
called regular. If the intervals are different, the rhythm is called irregular.

\section*{ANALYZING THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM RHYTHM STRIP}

The ECG must be analyzed in a systematic manner to determine the patient's cardiac rhythm and to detect dysrhythmias and conduction disorders, as well as evidence of myocardial ischemia, injury, and infarction. Chart 27-2 is an example of a method that can be used to analyze the patient's rhythm.

Once the rhythm has been analyzed, the findings are compared with and matched to the ECG criteria for dysrhythmias to determine a diagnosis. It is important for the nurse to assess the patient to determine the physiologic effect of the dysrhythmia and to identify possible causes. Treatment of dysrhythmias is based on the etiology and the effect of the dysrhythmia, not on its presence alone.

\section*{Normal Sinus Rhythm}

Normal sinus rhythm occurs when the electrical impulse starts at a regular rate and rhythm in the sinus node and travels through the normal conduction pathway. The following are the ECG criteria for normal sinus rhythm (Fig. 27-5):

Ventricular and atrial rate: 60 to 100 in the adult
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Regular
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be regularly abnormal
$P$ wave: Normal and consistent shape; always in front of the QRS PR interval: Consistent interval between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds P: QRS ratio: $1: 1$

\section*{Types of Dysrhythmias}

Dysrhythmias include sinus node, atrial, junctional, and ventricular dysrhythmias and their various subcategories.

\end{figure}

Interpreting Dysrhythmias: Systematic Analysis of the Electrocardiogram

When examining an ECG rhythm strip to learn more about a patient's dysrhythmia, the nurse conducts the following assessment:
1. Determine the ventricular rate.
2. Determine the ventricular rhythm.
3. Determine QRS duration.
4. Determine whether the QRS duration is consistent throughout the strip. If not, identify other duration.
5. Identify QRS shape; if not consistent, then identify other shapes.
6. Identify P waves; is there a P in front of every QRS ?
7. Identify P -wave shape; identify whether it is consistent or not.
8. Determine the atrial rate.
9. Determine the atrial rhythm.
10. Determine each PR interval.
11. Determine if the PR intervals are consistent, irregular but with a pattern to the irregularity, or just irregular.
12. Determine how many P waves for each $\mathrm{QRS}(\mathrm{P}: \mathrm{QRS}$ ratio).

In many cases, the nurse may use a checklist and document the findings next to the appropriate ECG criterion.

\section*{SINUS NODE DYSRHYTHMIAS}

Sinus Bradycardia. Sinus bradycardia occurs when the sinus node creates an impulse at a slower-than-normal rate. Causes include lower metabolic needs (eg, sleep, athletic training, hypothermia, hypothyroidism), vagal stimulation (eg, from vomiting, suctioning, severe pain, extreme emotions), medications (eg, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, beta-blockers), increased intracranial pressure, and myocardial infarction (MI), especially of the inferior wall. The following are characteristics of sinus bradycardia (Fig. 27-6):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Less than 60 in the adult
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Regular
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be regularly abnormal
P wave: Normal and consistent shape; always in front of the QRS
PR interval: Consistent interval between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds
P: QRS ratio: $1: 1$
All characteristics of sinus bradycardia are the same as those of normal sinus rhythm, except for the rate. The patient is assessed to determine the hemodynamic effect and the possible cause of the dysrhythmia. If the decrease in heart rate results from stimulation of the vagus nerve, such as with bearing down during defecation or vomiting, attempts are made to prevent further vagal
stimulation. If the bradycardia is from a medication such as a beta-blocker, the medication may be withheld. If the slow heart rate causes significant hemodynamic changes, resulting in shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, angina, hypotension, ST-segment changes, or premature ventricular complexes, treatment is directed toward increasing the heart rate.

Atropine, 0.5 to 1.0 mg given rapidly as an intravenous (IV) bolus, is the medication of choice in treating sinus bradycardia. It blocks vagal stimulation, thus allowing a normal rate to occur. Rarely, catecholamines and emergency transcutaneous pacing also may be implemented.

Sinus Tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia occurs when the sinus node creates an impulse at a faster-than-normal rate. It may be caused by acute blood loss, anemia, shock, hypervolemia, hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, pain, hypermetabolic states, fever, exercise, anxiety, or sympathomimetic medications. The ECG criteria for sinus tachycardia follow (Fig. 27-7):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Greater than 100 in the adult
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Regular
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be regularly abnormal
$P$ wave: Normal and consistent shape; always in front of the QRS, but may be buried in the preceding T wave
PR interval: Consistent interval between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds
P: QRS ratio: $1: 1$
All aspects of sinus tachycardia are the same as those of normal sinus rhythm, except for the rate. As the heart rate increases, the diastolic filling time decreases, possibly resulting in reduced cardiac output and subsequent symptoms of syncope and low blood pressure. If the rapid rate persists and the heart cannot compensate for the decreased ventricular filling, the patient may develop acute pulmonary edema.

Treatment of sinus tachycardia is usually directed at abolishing its cause. Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers (Table 27-1) may be used to reduce the heart rate quickly.

Sinus Arrhythmia. Sinus arrhythmia occurs when the sinus node creates an impulse at an irregular rhythm; the rate usually increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration. Nonrespiratory causes include heart disease and valvular disease, but these are rarely seen. The ECG criteria for sinus arrhythmia follow (Fig. 27-8):

Ventricular and atrial rate: 60 to 100 in the adult
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Irregular
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be regularly abnormal

Sinus arrhythmia does not cause any significant hemodynamic effect and usually is not treated.

\section*{ATRIAL DYSRHYTHMIAS}

Premature Atrial Complex. A premature atrial complex (PAC) is a single ECG complex that occurs when an electrical impulse starts in the atrium before the next normal impulse of the sinus node. The PAC may be caused by caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, stretched atrial myocardium (as in hypervolemia), anxiety, hypokalemia (low potassium level), hypermetabolic states, or atrial ischemia, injury, or infarction. PACs are often seen with sinus tachycardia. PACs have the following characteristics (Fig. 27-9):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Depends on the underlying rhythm (eg, sinus tachycardia)
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Irregular due to early P waves, creating a PP interval that is shorter than the others. This is sometimes followed by a longer-than-normal PP interval, but one that is less than twice the normal PP interval. This type of interval is called a noncompensatory pause.
QRS shape and duration: The QRS that follows the early P wave is usually normal, but it may be abnormal (aberrantly conducted PAC). It may even be absent (blocked PAC).
$P$ wave: An early and different P wave may be seen or may be hidden in the T wave; other P waves in the strip are consistent.
PR interval: The early P wave has a shorter-than-normal PR interval, but still between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds.
$P$ : QRS ratio: usually $1: 1$

PACs are common in normal hearts. The patient may say, "My heart skipped a beat." A pulse deficit (a difference between the apical and radial pulse rate) may exist.

If PACs are infrequent, no treatment is necessary. If they are frequent (more than 6 per minute), this may herald a worsening disease state or the onset of more serious dysrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. Treatment is directed toward the cause.

Atrial Flutter. Atrial flutter occurs in the atrium and creates impulses at an atrial rate between 250 and 400 times per minute. Because the atrial rate is faster than the AV node can conduct, not all atrial impulses are conducted into the ventricle, causing a therapeutic block at the AV node. This is an important feature of this dysrhythmia. If all atrial impulses were conducted to the ventricle, the ventricular rate would also be 250 to 400 , which would result in ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening dysrhythmia. Causes are similar to that of atrial fibrillation. Atrial flutter is characterized by the following (Fig. 27-10):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Atrial rate ranges between 250 and 400; ventricular rate usually ranges between 75 and 150 .
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: The atrial rhythm is regular; the ventricular rhythm is usually regular but may be irregular because of a change in the AV conduction.
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be abnormal or may be absent
$P$ wave: Saw-toothed shape. These waves are referred to as F waves.
PR interval: Multiple F waves may make it difficult to determine the PR interval.
$P$ : QRS ratio: $2: 1,3: 1$, or $4: 1$
Atrial flutter can cause serious signs and symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and low blood pressure. If the

patient is unstable, electrical cardioversion (discussed later) is usually indicated. If the patient is stable, diltiazem (eg, Cardizem), verapamil (eg, Calan, Isoptin), beta-blockers, or digitalis may be administered intravenously to slow the ventricular rate. These medications can slow conduction through the AV node. Flecainide (Tambocor), ibutilide (Corvert), dofetilide (Tikosyn), quinidine (eg, Cardioquin, Quinaglute), disopyramide (Norpace), or amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone) may be given to promote conversion to sinus rhythm (see Table 27-1). If medication therapy is unsuccessful, electrical cardioversion is often successful. Once conversion has occurred, quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone (Rhythmol), amiodarone, or sotalol (Betapace) may be given to maintain sinus rhythm (see Table 27-1).

Atrial Fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation causes a rapid, disorganized, and uncoordinated twitching of atrial musculature. It is the most common dysrhythmia that causes patients to seek medical attention. It may start and stop suddenly. Atrial fibrillation may occur for a very short time (paroxysmal), or it may be chronic. Atrial fibrillation is usually associated with advanced age, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, hyperthyroidism, pulmonary disease, acute moderate to heavy ingestion of alcohol ("holiday heart" syndrome), or the aftermath of open heart surgery. Sometimes it occurs in people without any underlying pathophysiology (termed lone atrial fibrillation). Atrial fibrillation is characterized by the following (Fig. 27-11):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Atrial rate is 300 to 600 . Ventricular rate is usually 120 to 200 in untreated atrial fibrillation Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Highly irregular
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be abnormal $P$ wave: No discernible P waves; irregular undulating waves are seen and are referred to as fibrillatory or f waves
PR interval: Cannot be measured
$P$ : QRS ratio: many: 1
A rapid ventricular response reduces the time for ventricular filling, resulting in a smaller stroke volume. Because this rhythm causes the atria and ventricles to contract at different times, the atrial kick (the last part of diastole and ventricular filling, which accounts for $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the cardiac output) is also lost. This leads to symptoms of irregular palpitations, fatigue, and malaise. There is usually a pulse deficit, a numerical difference between apical and radial pulse rates. The shorter time in diastole reduces the time available for coronary artery perfusion, thereby increasing the risk for myocardial ischemia. The erratic atrial contraction promotes the formation of a thrombus within the atria, increasing the risk for an embolic event. There is a two- to five-fold increase in the risk of stroke (brain attack).

Treatment of atrial fibrillation depends on its cause and duration and the patient's symptoms, age, and comorbidities. In many patients, atrial fibrillation converts to sinus rhythm within 24 hours and without treatment. Both stable and unstable atrial fibrillation

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
of short duration are treated the same as stable and unstable atrial flutter. Cardioversion may be indicated for atrial fibrillation that has been present for less than 48 hours, a condition termed acuteonset atrial fibrillation. Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation that has lasted longer than 48 hours should be avoided unless the patient has received anticoagulants, due to the high risk for embolization of atrial thrombi.

For atrial fibrillation of acute onset, the medications quinidine, ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, procainamide (Pronestyl), disopyramide, or amiodarone (see Table 27-1) may be given to achieve conversion to sinus rhythm (McNamara et al., 2001). Intravenous adenosine (Adenocard, Adenoscan) has also been used for conversion, as well as to assist in the diagnosis. To prevent recurrence and to maintain sinus rhythm, quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone may be prescribed. Calcium-channel blockers [diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac) and verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan)] and beta blockers (see Table 27-1) are effective in controlling the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation, especially during exercise (McNamara, et al., 2001). Use of digoxin is recommended to control the ventricular rate in those patients with poor cardiac function (ejection fraction less than $40 \%$ ) (Hauptman \& Kelly, 1999). In addition, warfarin is indicated if the patient is at higher risk for a stroke (ie, is elderly or has hypertension, heart failure, or a history of stroke). Aspirin may be substituted for warfarin for those with contraindications to warfarin and those who are at lower risk of stroke. The choice of antithrombotic medication can be guided by transesophageal echocardiography. Pacemaker implantation or surgery is sometimes indicated for patients who are unresponsive to medications.

\section*{JUNCTIONAL DYSRHYTHMIAS}

Premature Junctional Complex. A premature junctional complex is an impulse that starts in the AV nodal area before the next normal sinus impulse reaches the AV node. Premature junctional complexes are less common than PACs. Causes of premature junctional complex include digitalis toxicity, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. The ECG criteria for premature junctional complex are the same as for PACs , except for the P wave and the PR interval. The P wave may be absent, may follow the QRS, or may occur before the QRS but with a PR interval of less than 0.12 seconds. Premature junctional complexes rarely produce significant symptoms. Treatment for frequent premature junctional complexes is the same as for frequent PACs.

Junctional Rhythm. Junctional or idionodal rhythm occurs when the AV node, instead of the sinus node, becomes the pacemaker of the heart. When the sinus node slows (eg, from increased vagal tone) or when the impulse cannot be conducted through the AV node (eg, because of complete heart block), the AV node automatically discharges an impulse. The following are the ECG criteria for junctional rhythm not caused by complete heart block (Fig. 27-12):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Ventricular rate 40 to 60; atrial rate also 40 to 60 if P waves are discernible
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Regular
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be abnormal
$P$ wave: May be absent, after the QRS complex, or before the QRS; may be inverted, especially in lead II

\caption{EIGURE 27-13 AV nodal reentry tachycardia in lead II.}
\end{figure}

PR interval: If P wave is in front of the $\mathrm{QRS}, \mathrm{PR}$ interval is less than 0.12 second.
P: QRS ratio: $1: 1$ or $0: 1$
Junctional rhythm may produce signs and symptoms of reduced cardiac output. If so, the treatment is the same as for sinus bradycardia. Emergency pacing may be needed.

Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia. AV nodal reentry tachycardia occurs when an impulse is conducted to an area in the AV node that causes the impulse to be rerouted back into the same area over and over again at a very fast rate. Each time the impulse is conducted through this area, it is also conducted down into the ventricles, causing a fast ventricular rate. AV nodal reentry tachycardia that has an abrupt onset and an abrupt cessation with a QRS of normal duration had been called paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT). Factors associated with the development of AV nodal reentry tachycardia include caffeine, nicotine, hypoxemia, and stress. Underlying pathologies include coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy. The ECG criteria are as follows (Fig. 27-13):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Atrial rate usually ranges between 150 to 250; ventricular rate usually ranges between 75 to 250
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Regular; sudden onset and termination of the tachycardia
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be abnormal
$P$ wave: Usually very difficult to discern
PR interval: If P wave is in front of the QRS, PR interval is less than 0.12 seconds
$P$ : QRS ratio: $1: 1,2: 1$
The clinical symptoms vary with the rate and duration of the tachycardia and the patient's underlying condition. The tachycardia usually is of short duration, resulting only in palpitations. A fast rate may also reduce cardiac output, resulting in significant signs and symptoms such as restlessness, chest pain, shortness of breath, pallor, hypotension, and loss of consciousness.

Treatment is aimed at breaking the reentry of the impulse. Vagal maneuvers, such as carotid sinus massage (Fig. 27-14), gag reflex, breath holding, and immersing the face in ice water, increase parasympathetic stimulation, causing slower conduction through the AV node and blocking the reentry of the rerouted impulse. Some patients have learned to use some of these methods to terminate the episode on their own. Because of the risk of a cerebral embolic event, carotid sinus massage is
contraindicated in patients with carotid bruits. If the vagal maneuvers are ineffective, the patient may then receive a bolus of adenosine, verapamil, or diltiazem. Cardioversion is the treatment of choice if the patient is unstable or does not respond to the medications.

If $P$ waves cannot be identified, the rhythm may be called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which indicates only that it is not ventricular tachycardia (VT). SVT could be atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or AV nodal reentry tachycardia, among others. Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are used to slow conduction in the AV node to allow visualization of the $P$ waves.

\section*{VENTRICULAR DYSRHYTHMIAS}

Premature Ventricular Complex. Premature ventricular complex (PVC) is an impulse that starts in a ventricle and is conducted through the ventricles before the next normal sinus impulse. PVCs can occur in healthy people, especially with the use of caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol. They are also caused by cardiac ischemia or infarction, increased workload on the heart (eg, exercise, fever, hypervolemia, heart failure, tachycardia), digitalis toxicity, hypoxia, acidosis, or electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia.

In the absence of disease, PVCs are not serious. In the patient with an acute MI, PVCs may indicate the need for more aggressive therapy. PVCs may indicate the possibility of ensuing VT. However, PVCs that are (1) more frequent than 6 per minute,
(2) multifocal or polymorphic (having different shapes), (3) occur two in a row (pair), and (4) occur on the T wave (the vulnerable period of ventricular depolarization) have not been found to be precursors of VT (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial Investigators, 1989). These PVCs are no longer considered as warning or complex PVCs.

In a rhythm called bigeminy, every other complex is a PVC. Trigeminy is a rhythm in which every third complex is a PVC, and quadrigeminy is a rhythm in which every fourth complex is a PVC. PVCs have the following characteristics on the ECG (Fig. 27-15):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Depends on the underlying rhythm (eg, sinus rhythm)
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Irregular due to early QRS, creating one RR interval that is shorter than the others. PP interval may be regular, indicating that the PVC did not depolarize the sinus node.
QRS shape and duration: Duration is 0.12 seconds or longer; shape is bizarre and abnormal
$P$ wave: Visibility of P wave depends on the timing of the PVC; may be absent (hidden in the QRS or T wave) or in front of the QRS . If the P wave follows the QRS , the shape of the P wave may be different.
PR interval: If the P wave is in front of the QRS , the PR interval is less than 0.12 seconds.
$P$ : QRS ratio: $0: 1 ; 1: 1$
The patient may feel nothing or may say that the heart "skipped a beat." The effect of a PVC depends on its timing in the cardiac cycle and how much blood was in the ventricles when they contracted. Initial treatment is aimed at correcting the cause, if possible. Lidocaine (Xylocaine) is the medication most commonly used for immediate, short-term therapy (see Table 27-1). Long-term pharmacotherapy for only PVCs is not indicated.

Ventricular Tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defined as three or more PVCs in a row, occurring at a rate exceeding 100 beats per minute. The causes are similar to those for PVC. VT is usually associated with coronary artery disease and may precede ventricular fibrillation. VT is an emergency because the patient is usually (although not always) unresponsive and pulseless. VT has the following characteristics (Fig. 27-16):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Ventricular rate is 100 to 200 beats per minute; atrial rate depends on the underlying rhythm (eg, sinus rhythm)
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Usually regular; atrial rhythm may also be regular.
QRS shape and duration: Duration is 0.12 seconds or more; bizarre, abnormal shape
$P$ wave: Very difficult to detect, so atrial rate and rhythm may be indeterminable
PR interval: Very irregular, if P waves seen.
$P$ : $Q R S$ ratio: Difficult to determine, but if P waves are apparent, there are usually more QRS complexes than P waves.
The patient's tolerance or lack of tolerance for this rapid rhythm depends on the ventricular rate and underlying disease. If the patient is stable, continuing the assessment, especially obtaining a 12-lead ECG, may be the only action necessary. Cardioversion may be the treatment of choice, especially if the patient is unstable. Several factors determine the initial medication used for treatment, including the following: identifying the rhythm as monomorphic (having a consistent QRS shape and rate) or polymorphic (having varying QRS shapes and rates); determining the existence of a prolonged QT interval before the initiation of VT; and ascertaining the patient's heart function (normal or decreased). VT in a patient who is unconscious and without a pulse is treated in the same manner as ventricular fibrillation: immediate defibrillation is the action of choice.

Ventricular Fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a rapid but disorganized ventricular rhythm that causes ineffective quivering of the ventricles. There is no atrial activity seen on the ECG. Causes of ventricular fibrillation are the same as for VT; it may also result from untreated or unsuccessfully treated VT. Other causes include electrical shock and Brugada syndrome, in which the patient (frequently of Asian descent) has a structurally normal heart, few or no risk factors for coronary artery disease, and a family history of sudden cardiac death. Ventricular fibrillation has the following characteristics (Fig. 27-17):

Ventricular rate: Greater than 300 per minute
Ventricular rhythm: Extremely irregular, without specific pattern
QRS shape and duration: Irregular, undulating waves without recognizable QRS complexes
This dysrhythmia is always characterized by the absence of an audible heartbeat, a palpable pulse, and respirations. Because there is no coordinated cardiac activity, cardiac arrest and death are imminent if ventricular fibrillation is not corrected. Treatment of choice is immediate defibrillation and activation of emergency services. The importance of defibrillation is evident in one of the recent changes in basic life support (American Heart Association, 2000): placing a call for emergency assistance and calling for a defibrillator takes precedence over initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the adult victim. Also, application of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) is included in basic life support classes. After defibrillation, eradicating causes and administering vasoactive and antiarrhythmic medications alternating with defibril-

lation are treatments used to try to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm.

Idioventricular Rhythm. Idioventricular rhythm, also called ventricular escape rhythm, occurs when the impulse starts in the conduction system below the AV node. When the sinus node fails to create an impulse (eg, from increased vagal tone), or when the impulse is created but cannot be conducted through the AV node (eg, due to complete AV block), the Purkinje fibers automatically discharge an impulse. The following are the ECG criteria when idioventricular rhythm is not caused by AV block (Fig. 27-18):

Ventricular rate: Ranges between 20 and 40; if the rate exceeds 40, the rhythm is known as accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR).
Ventricular rhythm: Regular
QRS shape and duration: Bizarre, abnormal shape; duration is 0.12 seconds or more

Idioventricular rhythm commonly causes the patient to lose consciousness and experience other signs and symptoms of reduced cardiac output. In such cases, the treatment is the same as for pulseless electrical activity if the patient is in cardiac arrest or for bradycardia if the patient is not in cardiac arrest. Interventions may include identifying the underlying cause, administering intravenous atropine and vasopressor medications, and initiating emergency transcutaneous pacing. In some cases, idioventricular rhythm may cause no symptoms of reduced cardiac output. However, bed rest is prescribed so as not to increase the cardiac workload.

Ventricular Asystole. Commonly called flatline, ventricular asystole (Fig. 27-19) is characterized by absent QRS complexes, although P waves may be apparent for a short duration in two
different leads. There is no heartbeat, no palpable pulse, and no respiration. Without immediate treatment, ventricular asystole is fatal. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency services are necessary to keep the patient alive. The guidelines for advanced cardiac life support (American Heart Association, 2000) state that the key to successful treatment is rapid assessment to identify a possible cause, which may be hypoxia, acidosis, severe electrolyte imbalance, drug overdose, or hypothermia. Intubation and establishment of intravenous access are the first recommended actions. Transcutaneous pacing may be attempted. A bolus of intravenous epinephrine should be administered and repeated at 3- to $5-$ minute intervals, followed by $1-\mathrm{mg}$ boluses of atropine at $3-$ to 5 -minute intervals. Because of the poor prognosis associated with asystole, if the patient does not respond to these actions and others aimed at correcting underlying causes, resuscitation efforts are usually ended ("the code is called") unless special circumstances (eg, hypothermia) exist.

\section*{CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES}

When assessing the rhythm strip, the nurse takes care first to identify the underlying rhythm (eg, sinus rhythm, sinus arrhythmia). Then the PR interval is assessed for the possibility of an AV block. AV blocks occur when the conduction of the impulse through the AV nodal area is decreased or stopped. These blocks can be caused by medications (eg, digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers), myocardial ischemia and infarction, valvular disorders, or myocarditis. If the AV block is caused by increased vagal tone (eg, suctioning, pressure above the eyes or on large vessels, anal stimulation), it is commonly accompanied by sinus bradycardia.

The clinical signs and symptoms of a heart block vary with the resulting ventricular rate and the severity of any underlying dis-

\end{figure}
ease processes. Whereas first-degree AV block rarely causes any hemodynamic effect, the other blocks may result in decreased heart rate, causing a decrease in perfusion to vital organs, such as the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and skin. A patient with third-degree AV block caused by digitalis toxicity may be stable; another patient with the same rhythm caused by acute MI may be unstable. Health care providers must always keep in mind the need to treat the patient, not the rhythm. The treatment is based on the hemodynamic effect of the rhythm.

First-Degree Atrioventricular Block. First-degree heart block occurs when all the atrial impulses are conducted through the AV node into the ventricles at a rate slower than normal. This conduction disorder has the following characteristics (Fig. 27-20):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Depends on the underlying rhythm
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: Depends on the underlying rhythm
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be abnormal
$P$ wave: In front of the QRS complex; shows sinus rhythm, regular shape
PR interval: Greater than 0.20 seconds; PR interval measurement is constant.
P: QRS ratio: $1: 1$
Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block, Type I. Second-degree, type I heart block occurs when all but one of the atrial impulses are conducted through the AV node into the ventricles. Each atrial impulse takes a longer time for conduction than the one before, until one impulse is fully blocked. Because the AV node is
not depolarized by the blocked atrial impulse, the AV node has time to fully repolarize, so that the next atrial impulse can be conducted within the shortest amount of time. Second-degree AV block, type I has the following characteristics (Fig. 27-21):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Depends on the underlying rhythm
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: The PP interval is regular if the patient has an underlying normal sinus rhythm; the RR interval characteristically reflects a pattern of change. Starting from the RR that is the longest, the RR interval gradually shortens until there is another long RR interval.
QRS shape and duration: Usually normal, but may be abnormal
$P$ wave: In front of the QRS complex; shape depends on underlying rhythm
$P R$ interval: PR interval becomes longer with each succeeding ECG complex until there is a P wave not followed by a QRS. The changes in the PR interval are repeated between each "dropped" QRS, creating a pattern in the irregular PR interval measurements.
P: QRS ratio: $3: 2,4: 3,5: 4$, and so forth
Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block, Type II. Second-degree, type II heart block occurs when only some of the atrial impulses are conducted through the AV node into the ventricles. Seconddegree AV block, type II has the following characteristics (Fig. 27-22):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Depends on the underlying rhythm Ventricular and atrial rhythm: The PP interval is regular if the patient has an underlying normal sinus rhythm. The RR

interval is usually regular but may be irregular, depending on the P : QRS ratio.
QRS shape and duration: Usually abnormal, but may be normal
$P$ wave: In front of the QRS complex; shape depends on underlying rhythm.
PR interval: PR interval is constant for those P waves just before QRS complexes.
$P$ : QRS ratio: $2: 1,3: 1,4: 1,5: 1$, and so forth
Third-Degree Atrioventricular Block. Third-degree heart block occurs when no atrial impulse is conducted through the AV node into the ventricles. In third-degree heart block, two impulses stimulate the heart: one stimulates the ventricles (eg, junctional or ventricular escape rhythm), represented by the QRS complex, and one stimulates the atria (eg, sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation), represented by the $P$ wave. $P$ waves may be seen, but the atrial electrical activity is not conducted down into the ventricles to cause the QRS complex, the ventricular electrical activity. This is called AV dissociation. Complete block (third-degree AV block) has the following characteristics (Fig. 27-23):

Ventricular and atrial rate: Depends on the escape and underlying atrial rhythm
Ventricular and atrial rhythm: The PP interval is regular and the RR interval is regular; however, the PP interval is not equal to the RR interval.
QRS shape and duration: Depends on the escape rhythm; in junctional escape, QRS shape and duration are usually normal, and in ventricular escape, QRS shape and duration are usually abnormal.
$P$ wave: Depends on underlying rhythm
PR interval: Very irregular
$P$ : QRS ratio: More P waves than QRS complexes
Based on the cause of the AV block and the stability of the patient, treatment is directed toward increasing the heart rate to maintain a normal cardiac output. If the patient is stable and has no symptoms, no treatment is indicated other than decreasing or eradicating the cause (eg, withholding the medication or treatment). If the patient is short of breath, complains of chest pain or lightheadedness, or has low blood pressure, an intravenous bolus of atropine is the initial treatment of choice. If the patient does not respond to atropine or has an acute MI, transcutaneous pacing should be started. A permanent pacemaker may be necessary if the block persists.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A DYSRHYTHMIA}

\section*{Assessment}

Major areas of assessment include possible causes of the dysrhythmia and the dysrhythmia's effect on the heart's ability to pump an adequate blood volume. When cardiac output is reduced, the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues and vital organs is diminished. This diminished oxygenation produces the signs and symptoms associated with dysrhythmias. If these signs and symptoms are severe or if they occur frequently, the patient may experience significant distress and disruption of daily life.

A health history is obtained to identify any previous occurrences of decreased cardiac output, such as syncope (fainting), lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, chest discomfort, and palpitations. Coexisting conditions that could be a possible cause of the dysrhythmia (eg, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may also be identified. All medications, prescribed and over-the-counter (including herbs and nutritional supplements), are reviewed. Some medications (eg, digoxin) can cause dysrhythmias. A thorough psychosocial assessment is performed to identify the possible effects of the dysrhythmia and to determine whether anxiety is a significant contributing factor.

The nurse conducts a physical assessment to confirm the data obtained from the history and to observe for signs of diminished cardiac output during the dysrhythmic event, especially changes in level of consciousness. The nurse directs attention to the skin, which may be pale and cool. Signs of fluid retention, such as neck vein distention and crackles and wheezes auscultated in the lungs, may be detected. The rate and rhythm of apical and peripheral pulses are also assessed, and any pulse deficit is noted. The nurse auscultates for extra heart sounds (especially $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ ) and for heart murmurs, measures blood pressure, and determines pulse pressures. A declining pulse pressure indicates reduced cardiac output. Just one assessment may not disclose significant changes in cardiac output; therefore, the nurse compares multiple assessment findings over time, especially those that occur with and without the dysrhythmia.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on assessment data, major nursing diagnoses of the patient may include:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-214.jpg?height=517&width=1783&top_left_y=2016&top_left_x=109}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 27-23 Sinus rhythm with third-degree AV block and idioventricular rhythm in lead $\mathrm{V}_{1}$; note irregular PR intervals.}
\end{figure}
- Decreased cardiac output
- Anxiety related to fear of the unknown
- Deficient knowledge about the dysrhythmia and its treatment

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

In addition to cardiac arrest, a potential complication that may develop over time is heart failure. Another potential complication, especially with atrial fibrillation, is a thromboembolic event. If the dysrhythmia necessitates treatment with medication, the beneficial and detrimental effects must be assessed.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include eradicating or decreasing the incidence of the dysrhythmia (by decreasing contributory factors) to maintain cardiac output, minimizing anxiety, and acquiring knowledge about the dysrhythmia and its treatment.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING THE DYSRHYTHMIA}

The nurse regularly evaluates blood pressure, pulse rate and rhythm, rate and depth of respirations, and breath sounds to determine the dysrhythmia's hemodynamic effect. The nurse also asks patients about episodes of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting as part of the ongoing assessment. If a patient with a dysrhythmia is hospitalized, the nurse may obtain a 12 -lead ECG, continuously monitor the patient, and analyze rhythm strips to track the dysrhythmia.

Control of the incidence or the effect of the dysrhythmia, or both, is often achieved by the use of antiarrhythmic medications. The nurse assesses and observes for the beneficial and adverse effects of each of the medications. The nurse also manages medication administration carefully so that a constant serum blood level of the medication is maintained at all times.

In addition to medication, the nurse assesses for factors that contribute to the dysrhythmia (eg, caffeine, stress, nonadherence to the medication regimen) and assists the patient in developing a plan to make lifestyle changes that eliminate or reduce these factors.

\section*{MINIMIZING ANXIETY}

When the patient experiences episodes of dysrhythmia, the nurse maintains a calm and reassuring attitude. This demeanor fosters a trusting relationship with the patient and assists in reducing anxiety (reducing the sympathetic response). Successes are emphasized with the patient to promote a sense of confidence in living with a dysrhythmia. For example, if a patient is experiencing episodes of dysrhythmia and a medication is administered that begins to reduce the incidence of the dysrhythmia, the nurse communicates that information to the patient. The nursing goal is to maximize the patient's control and to make the unknown less threatening.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

When teaching patients about dysrhythmias, the nurse presents the information in terms that are understandable and in a manner that is not frightening or threatening. The nurse explains the importance of maintaining therapeutic serum levels of anti-
arrhythmic medications so that the patient understands why medications should be taken regularly each day. In addition, the relationship between a dysrhythmia and cardiac output is explained so that the patient understands the rationale for the medical regimen. If the patient has a potentially lethal dysrhythmia, it is also important to establish with the patient and family a plan of action to take in case of an emergency. This allows the patient and family to feel in control and prepared for possible events.

A referral for home care usually is not necessary for the patient with a dysrhythmia unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable and has significant symptoms of decreased cardiac output. Home care is also warranted if the patient has significant comorbidities, socioeconomic issues, or limited self-management skills that could potentiate the risk for nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Maintains cardiac output
a. Demonstrates heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and level of consciousness within normal ranges
b. Demonstrates no or decreased episodes of dysrhythmia
2. Experiences reduced anxiety
a. Expresses a positive attitude about living with the dysrhythmia
b. Expresses confidence in ability to take appropriate actions in an emergency
3. Expresses understanding of the dysrhythmia and its treatment
a. Explains the dysrhythmia and its effects
b. Describes the medication regimen and its rationale
c. Explains the need for therapeutic serum level of the medication
d. Describes a plan to eradicate or limit factors that contribute to the occurrence of the dysrhythmia
e. States actions to take in the event of an emergency

\section*{Adjunctive Modalities and Management}

Dysrhythmia treatments depend on whether the disorder is acute or chronic as well as on the cause of the dysrhythmia and its actual or potential hemodynamic effects.

Acute dysrhythmias may be treated with medications or with external electrical therapy. Many antiarrhythmic medications are used to treat atrial and ventricular tachydysrhythmias. These medications are summarized in Table 27-1. The choice of medication depends on the specific dysrhythmia, presence of cardiac failure and other diseases, and the patient's response to previous treatment. The nurse is responsible for monitoring and documenting the patient's responses to the medication and for making sure that the patient has the knowledge and ability to manage the medication regimen.

If medications alone are ineffective in eradicating or decreasing the dysrhythmia, certain adjunctive mechanical therapies are available. The most common are pacemakers for bradycardias and tachycardias, elective cardioversion and defibrillation for acute tachydysrhythmia, and implantable devices for chronic tachydysrhythmia. Surgical treatments, although less common, are also available.

\section*{PACEMAKER THERAPY}

A pacemaker is an electronic device that provides electrical stimuli to the heart muscle. Pacemakers are usually used when a patient has a slower-than-normal impulse formation or a conduction disturbance that causes symptoms. They may also be used to control some tachydysrhythmias that do not respond to medication therapy. Biventricular (both ventricles) pacing may be used to treat advanced heart failure that does not respond to medication therapy.

Pacemakers can be permanent or temporary. Permanent pacemakers are used most commonly for irreversible complete heart block. Temporary pacemakers are used (eg, after MI, after open heart surgery) to support patients until they improve or receive a permanent pacemaker.

\section*{Pacemaker Design and Types}

Pacemakers consist of two components: an electronic pulse generator and pacemaker electrodes, which are located on leads or wires. The generator contains the circuitry and batteries that generate the rate (measured in beats per minute) and the strength (measured in milliamperes [ mA ]) of the electrical stimulus delivered to the heart. The pacemaker electrodes convey the heart's electrical activity through a lead to the generator; the generator's electrical response to the information received is then transmitted to the heart.

Leads can be threaded through a major vein into the right ventricle (endocardial leads), or they can be lightly sutured onto the outside of the heart and brought through the chest wall during open heart surgery (epicardial wires). The epicardial wires are always temporary and are removed by a gentle tug within a few days after surgery. The endocardial leads may be temporarily placed with catheters through the femoral, antecubital, brachial, or jugular vein (transvenous wires), usually guided by fluoroscopy. The endocardial and epicardial wires are connected to a temporary generator, which is about the size of a small paperback book. The energy source for a temporary generator is a common household battery; monitoring for pacemaker malfunctioning and battery failure is a nursing responsibility. This type of pacemaker therapy necessitates hospitalization of the patient.

The endocardial leads also may be placed permanently, usually through the external jugular vein, and connected to a permanent generator, which is usually implanted underneath the skin in a subcutaneous pocket in the pectoral region or below the clavicle (Fig. 27-24). Sometimes an abdominal site is selected. This procedure is usually performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory with the patient receiving a local anesthetic. Permanent pacemaker generators are insulated to protect against body moisture and warmth. There are several different energy sources for permanent generators: mercury-zinc batteries (which last 3 to 4 years), lithium cell units (up to 10 years), and nuclear-powered sources such as plutonium 238 (up to 20 years). Some of the batteries are rechargeable. If the battery is not rechargeable and failure is impending, the old generator is removed and the new one is connected to the existing leads and reimplanted in the already existing subcutaneous pocket. This procedure is usually performed with the patient receiving a local anesthetic. Hospitalization of the patient is needed for implantation or battery replacement.

If a patient suddenly develops a bradycardia, emergency pacing may be started with transcutaneous pacing, which most defibrillators are now equipped to perform. AEDs are not able to do transcutaneous pacing (see later discussion). Large pacing ECG electrodes (sometimes the same conductive pads that are used for

\end{figure}
cardioversion and defibrillation) are placed on the patient's chest and back. The electrodes are connected to the defibrillator, which is the temporary pacemaker generator (Fig. 27-25). Because the impulse must travel through the patient's skin and tissue before reaching the heart, transcutaneous pacing can cause significant discomfort and is intended to be used only in emergencies. This type of pacing necessitates hospitalization. If the patient is alert, the use of sedation and analgesia should be discussed with the physician.

\section*{Pacemaker Generator Functions}

Because of the sophistication and wide use of pacemakers, a universal code has been adopted to provide a means of safe communication about their function. The coding is referred to as the NASPE-BPEG code because it is sanctioned by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology and the British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group. The complete code consists of five letters, but only the first three are commonly used.

The first letter of the code identifies the chamber or chambers being paced-that is, the chamber containing a pacing electrode. The letter characters for this code are A (atrium), V (ventricle), or D (dual, meaning both A and V ).

The second letter describes the chamber or chambers being sensed by the pacemaker generator. Information from the electrode within the chamber is sent to the generator for interpretation and action by the generator. The possible letter characters are A (atrium), V (ventricle), D (dual), and O (indicating that the sensing function is turned off).

The third letter of the code describes the type of response by the pacemaker to what is sensed. The possible letter characters used to describe this response are I (inhibited), T (triggered), D (dual, inhibited and triggered), and O (none). Inhibited response means that the response of the pacemaker is controlled by the activity of the patient's heart; that is, the pacemaker will not func-

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 27-25 Transcutaneous pacemaker with electrode pads connected to the anterior and posterior chest walls.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-217.jpg?height=666&width=1085&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=889}
\end{figure}
tion when the patient's heart beats but will pace if no beat is sensed. In contrast, triggered response means that the pacemaker will provide a response (pace the heart) when it senses intrinsic heart activity.

The fourth and fifth letters are used only with permanent pacemaker generators. The fourth letter of the code is related to a permanent generator's ability to be programmed or reset. The possible letters are O (none), P (simple programmability), M (multiprogrammability; ability to change at least three factors, such as the rate at which pacing is initiated, the rate of pacing, and the amount of energy delivered), C (communicative or telemetry ability; information about the generator may be obtained [read or interrogated] with a hand-held device placed above the chest), and R (rate responsive capabilities; the ability of the pacemaker to change the rate from moment to moment based on parameters such as physical activity, acid-base changes, temperature, rate and depth of respirations, and oxygen saturation). A pacemaker with rate responsive ability will be capable of improving cardiac output during times of increased cardiac demand, such as with exercise.

The fifth letter of the code indicates that the permanent generator has antitachycardia and/or defibrillation capability. The possible letters are $P$ (antitachycardia pacing), $S$ (shock; defibrillation), D (dual-antitachycardia pacing and shock), and O (none). Antitachycardia pacing is used to terminate tachycardias caused by a conduction disturbance called reentry, which is repetitive restimulation of the heart by the same impulse. An impulse or series of impulses is delivered to the heart by the pacemaker at a fast rate to collide with and stop the heart's reentry conduction impulses, and therefore to stop the tachycardia.

An example of a NASPE-BPEG code is DVI:
D: Both the atrium and the ventricle have a pacing electrode in place.
V: The pacemaker is sensing the activity of the ventricle only.
I: The pacemaker's stimulating effect is inhibited by ventricular activity-in other words, it does not create an impulse when the patient's ventricle is active. The pacemaker paces the atrium and then the ventricle when no ventricular activity is sensed for a period of time (the time is individually programmed into the pacemaker for each patient).

The type of generator and its selected settings depend on the patient's dysrhythmia, underlying cardiac function, and age. A straight vertical line usually can be seen on the ECG when pacing is initiated. The line that represents pacing is called a pace-
maker spike. The appropriate ECG complex should immediately follow the pacing spike; therefore, a P wave should follow an atrial pacing spike and a QRS complex should follow a ventricular pacing spike. Because the impulse starts in a different place than the patient's normal rhythm, the QRS complex or P wave that responds to pacing looks different from the patient's normal ECG complex. Capture is a term used to denote that the appropriate complex followed the pacing spike.

Pacemakers are generally set to sense and respond to intrinsic activity, which is called on-demand pacing (Fig. 27-26). If the pacemaker is set to pace but not to sense, it is called a fixed or asynchronous pacemaker (Fig. 27-27); this is written in code as AOO or VOO. The pacemaker will pace at a constant rate, independent of the patient's intrinsic rhythm. Because AOO pacing stimulates only the atrium, it may be used in a patient who has undergone open heart surgery and develops sinus bradycardia. AOO pacing ensures synchrony between atrial stimulation and ventricular stimulation (and therefore contraction), as long as the patient has no conduction disturbances in the AV node. VOO is rare because of the risk that the pacemaker may deliver an impulse during the vulnerable repolarization phase, leading to VT.

\section*{Complications of Pacemaker Use}

Complications associated with pacemakers relate to their presence within the body, and improper functioning. The following complications may arise from a pacemaker:
- Local infection at the entry site of the leads for temporary pacing, or at the subcutaneous site for permanent generator placement
- Bleeding and hematoma at the lead entry sites for temporary pacing, or at the subcutaneous site for permanent generator placement
- Hemothorax from puncture of the subclavian vein or internal mammary artery
- Ventricular ectopy and tachycardia from irritation of the ventricular wall by the endocardial electrode
- Movement or dislocation of the lead placed transvenously (perforation of the myocardium)
- Phrenic nerve, diaphragmatic (hiccuping may be a sign of this), or skeletal muscle stimulation if the lead is dislocated or if the delivered energy ( mA ) is set high
- Rarely, cardiac tamponade from bleeding resulting from removal of epicardial wires used for temporary pacing

\end{figure}

In the initial hours after a temporary or permanent pacemaker is inserted, the most common complication is dislodgment of the pacing electrode. Minimizing patient activity can help to prevent this complication. If a temporary electrode is in place, the extremity through which the catheter has been advanced is immobilized. With a permanent pacemaker, the patient is instructed initially to restrict activity on the side of the implantation.

The ECG is monitored very carefully to detect pacemaker malfunction. Improper pacemaker function, which can arise from failure in one or more components of the pacing system, is outlined in Table 27-2. The following data should be noted on the patient's record: model of pacemaker, type of generator, date and time of insertion, location of pulse generator, stimulation threshold, pacer settings (eg, rate, energy output [mA], and duration between atrial and ventricular impulses [AV delay]). This information is important for identifying normal pacemaker function and diagnosing pacemaker malfunction.

A patient experiencing pacemaker malfunction may develop signs and symptoms of decreased cardiac output. The degree to which these symptoms become apparent depends on the severity of the malfunction, the patient's level of dependency on the pacemaker, and the patient's underlying condition. Pacemaker malfunction is diagnosed by analyzing the ECG. Manipulating the electrodes, changing the generator's settings, or replacing the pacemaker generator or leads (or both) may be necessary.

Inhibition of permanent pacemakers can occur with exposure to strong electromagnetic fields (electromagnetic interference). However, recent pacemaker technology allows patients to safely use
most household electronic appliances and devices (eg, microwave ovens, electric tools) as long as they are not held close to the pacemaker generator. Gas-powered engines should be turned off before working on them. Objects that contain magnets (eg, the earpiece of a standard phone; large stereo speakers; magnet therapy products such as mattresses, jewelry, and wraps) should not be near the generator for longer than a few seconds. Patients are advised to use digital cellular phones on the side opposite the pacemaker generator. Large electromagnetic fields, such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radio and TV transmitter towers and lines, transmission power lines (these are different from the distribution lines that bring electricity into a home), and electrical substations may cause electromagnetic interference. Patients should be cautioned to avoid such situations or to simply move farther away from the area if they experience dizziness or a feeling of rapid or irregular heartbeats (palpitations). Welding and use of a chain saw should be avoided. If such tools are used, precautionary steps such as limiting the welding current to a 60 - to 130 -ampere range or using electric rather than gasoline-powered chain saws are advised.

The metal of the pacemaker generator may trigger some store and airport security alarms, but these alarm systems will not interfere with the pacemaker function. However, the handheld screening devices used in airports may interfere with the pacemaker. Patients should be advised to request a hand search instead of the handheld screening device. Patients also should be instructed to wear or carry medical identification to alert personnel to the presence of the pacemaker.

\section*{Pacemaker Surveillance}

Pacemaker clinics have been established to monitor patients and to test pulse generators for impending pacemaker battery failure. Several other factors, such as lead fracture, muscle inhibition, and insulation disruption, are assessed depending on the type of pacemaker and the equipment available. If indicated, the pacemaker is turned off for a few seconds, using a magnet or a programmer, while the ECG is recorded to assess the patient's underlying cardiac rhythm.

Another follow-up method is transtelephonic transmission of the generator's pulse rate. Special equipment is used to transmit information about the patient's pacemaker over the telephone to a receiving system at a pacemaker clinic. The information is converted into tones, which equipment at the clinic converts to an electronic signal and records on an ECG strip. The pacemaker rate and other data concerning pacemaker function are obtained and evaluated by a cardiologist. This simplifies the diagnosis of a failing generator, reassures the patient, and improves management when the patient is physically remote from pacemaker testing facilities.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A PACEMAKER}

\section*{Assessment}

After a temporary or a permanent pacemaker is inserted, the patient's heart rate and rhythm are monitored by ECG. The pacemaker's settings are noted and compared with the ECG recordings to assess pacemaker function. Pacemaker malfunction is detected by examining the pacemaker spike and its relationship to the surrounding ECG complexes (Fig. 27-28). In addition, cardiac output and hemodynamic stability are assessed to identify the patient's response to pacing and the adequacy of pacing. The ap-
pearance or increasing frequency of dysrhythmia is observed and reported to the physician.

The incision site where the pulse generator was implanted (or the entry site for the pacing electrode, if the pacemaker is a temporary transvenous pacemaker) is observed for bleeding, hematoma formation, or infection, which may be evidenced by swelling, unusual tenderness, unusual drainage, and increased heat. The patient may complain of continuous throbbing or pain. These symptoms are reported to the physician.

The patient with a temporary pacemaker is also assessed for electrical interference and the development of microshock. The nurse observes for potential sources of electrical hazards. All electrical equipment used in the vicinity of the patient should be grounded. Improperly grounded equipment can generate leakage of current capable of producing ventricular fibrillation. Exposed wires must be carefully covered with nonconductive material to prevent accidental ventricular fibrillation from stray currents. The nurse, working with a biomedical engineer or electrician, should make certain that the patient is in an electrically safe environment.

Patients, especially those receiving a permanent pacemaker, should be assessed for anxiety. In addition, for those receiving permanent pacemakers, the level of knowledge and learning needs of the patient and the family and the history of adherence to the therapeutic regimen should be identified.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on assessment data, major nursing diagnoses of the patient may include the following:
- Risk for infection related to pacemaker lead or generator insertion
- Risk for ineffective coping
- Deficient knowledge regarding self-care program

COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/
POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS
Based on the assessment findings, potential complications that may develop include decreased cardiac output related to pacemaker malfunction.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include absence of infection, adherence to a self-care program, effective coping, and maintenance of pacemaker function.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

The nurse changes the dressing regularly and inspects the insertion site for redness, swelling, soreness, or any unusual drainage. An increase in temperature should be reported to the physician. Changes in wound appearance are also reported to the physician.

\section*{PROMOTING EFFECTIVE COPING}

The patient treated with a pacemaker experiences not only lifestyle and physical changes but also emotional changes. At different times during the healing process, the patient may feel angry, depressed, fearful, anxious, or a combination of these emotions. Although each patient uses individual coping strategies (eg, humor, prayer, communication with a significant other) to manage emotional distress, some strategies may work better than others. Signs that may indicate ineffective coping include social isolation, increased or prolonged irritability or depression, and difficulty in relationships.

To promote effective coping strategies, the nurse must recognize the patient's emotional state and assist the patient to explore his or her feelings. The nurse may help the patient to identify per-
ceived changes (eg, loss of ability to participate in contact sports), the emotional response to the change (eg, anger), and how the patient responded to that emotion (eg, quickly became angry when talking with spouse). The nurse reassures the patient that the responses are normal, then assists the patient to identify realistic goals (eg, develop interest in another activity) and to develop a plan to attain those goals. The nurse may also teach the patient easy-to-use stress reduction techniques (eg, deep-breathing exercises) to facilitate coping. Education (Chart 27-3) may assist a patient to cope with changes that occur with pacemaker treatment.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

After pacemaker insertion, the patient's hospital stay may be less than 1 day, and follow-up in an outpatient clinic or office is common. The patient's anxiety and feelings of vulnerability may interfere with the ability to learn information provided. Nurses often need to include home caregivers in the teaching and provide printed materials for use by the patient and caregiver. Priorities for learning are established with the patient and caregiver. Teaching may include the importance of periodic pacemaker monitoring, promoting safety, avoiding infection, and sources of electromagnetic interference (see Chart 27-3).

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Remains free of infection
a. Has normal temperature
b. Has white blood cell count within normal range ( 5,000 to $10,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ )

\section*{CARDIOVERSION AND DEFIBRILLATION}

Cardioversion and defibrillation are treatments for tachydysrhythmias. They are used to deliver an electrical current to depolarize a critical mass of myocardial cells. When the cells repolarize, the sinus node is usually able to recapture its role as the heart's pacemaker. One major difference between cardioversion and defibrillation has to do with the timing of the delivery of electrical current. Another major difference concerns the circumstance: defibrillation is usually performed as an emergency treatment, whereas cardioversion is usually, but not always, a planned procedure.

Electrical current may be delivered through paddles or conductor pads. Both paddles may be placed on the front of the chest (Fig. 27-29), which is the standard paddle placement, or
one paddle may be placed on the front of the chest and the other connected to an adapter with a long handle and placed under the patient's back, which is called an anteroposterior placement (Fig. 27-30).

NURSING ALERT When using paddles, apply the appropriate conductant between the paddles and the patient's skin. Do not substitute any other type of conductant, such as ultrasound gel.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 27-30 Anteroposterior paddle placement for defibrillation.}
\end{figure}

Instead of paddles, defibrillator multifunction conductor pads may be used (Fig. 27-31). The pads, which contain a conductive medium, are placed in the same position as the paddles. They are connected to the defibrillator and allow for hands-off defibrillation. This method reduces the risks of touching the patient during the procedure and increases electrical safety. AEDs use this type of delivery for the electrical current.

Whether using pads or paddles, the nurse must observe two safety measures. First, maintain good contact between the pads or paddles (with a conductive medium) and the patient's skin to prevent electrical current from leaking into the air (arcing) when the defibrillator is discharged. Second, ensure that no one is in contact with the patient or with anything that is touching the patient when the defibrillator is discharged, to minimize the chance that electrical current will be conducted to anyone other than the patient.

When performing defibrillation or cardioversion, the nurse should remember these key points:
- Use multifunction conductor pads or paddles with a conducting agent between the paddles and the skin (the conducting agent is available as a sheet, gel, or paste).
- Place paddles or pads so that they do not touch the patient's clothing or bed linen and are not near medication patches or direct oxygen flow.
- If cardioverting, ensure that the monitor leads are attached to the patient and that the defibrillator is in sync mode. If
defibrillating, ensure that the defibrillator is not in sync mode (most machines default to the "not-sync" mode).
- Do not charge the device until ready to shock; then keep thumbs and fingers off the discharge buttons until paddles or pads are on the chest and ready to deliver the electrical charge.
- Exert 20 to 25 pounds of pressure on the paddles to ensure good skin contact.
- Before pressing the discharge button, call "Clear!" three times: As "Clear" is called the first time, ensure that you are not touching the patient, bed or equipment; as "Clear" is called the second time, ensure that no one is touching the bed, the patient, or equipment, including the endotracheal tube or adjuncts; and as "Clear" is called the third time, perform a final visual check to ensure you and everyone else are clear of the patient and anything touching the patient.
- Record the delivered energy and the results (cardiac rhythm, pulse).
- After the event is complete, inspect the skin under the pads or paddles for burns; if any are detected, consult with the physician or a wound care nurse about treatment.

\section*{Cardioversion}

Cardioversion involves the delivery of a "timed" electrical current to terminate a tachydysrhythmia. In cardioversion, the defibrillator is set to synchronize with the ECG on a cardiac monitor so that the electrical impulse discharges during ventricular depolarization (QRS complex). Because there may be a short delay until recognition of the QRS, the discharge buttons must be held down until the shock has been delivered. The synchronization prevents the discharge from occurring during the vulnerable period of repolarization ( T wave), which could result in VT or ventricular fibrillation. When the synchronizer is on, no electrical current will be delivered if the defibrillator does not discern a QRS complex. Sometimes the lead and the electrodes must be changed for the monitor to recognize the patient's QRS complex.

If the cardioversion is elective, anticoagulation for a few weeks before cardioversion may be indicated. Digoxin is usually withheld for 48 hours before cardioversion to ensure the resumption of sinus rhythm with normal conduction. The patient is instructed not to eat or drink for at least 8 hours before the procedure. Gel-covered paddles or conductor pads are positioned front and back (anteroposteriorly) for cardioversion. Before cardio-

\end{figure}
version, the patient receives intravenous sedation as well as an analgesic medication or anesthesia. Respiration is then supported with supplemental oxygen delivered by a bag-mask-valve device with suction equipment readily available. Although patients rarely require intubation, equipment is nearby if it is needed. The amount of voltage used varies from 25 to 360 joules, depending on the defibrillator's technology and the type of dysrhythmia. If ventricular fibrillation occurs after cardioversion, the defibrillator is used to defibrillate the patient (sync mode is not used).

Indications of a successful response are conversion to sinus rhythm, adequate peripheral pulses, and adequate blood pressure. Because of the sedation, airway patency must be maintained and the patient's state of consciousness assessed. Vital signs and oxygen saturation are monitored and recorded until the patient is stable and recovered from sedation and the effects of analgesic medications or anesthesia. ECG monitoring is required during and after cardioversion.

\section*{Defibrillation}

Defibrillation is used in emergency situations as the treatment of choice for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless VT. Defibrillation depolarizes a critical mass of myocardial cells at once; when they repolarize, the sinus node usually recaptures its role as the pacemaker. The electrical voltage required to defibrillate the heart is usually greater than that required for cardioversion. If three defibrillations of increasing voltage have been unsuccessful, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated and advanced life support treatments are begun.

The use of epinephrine or vasopressin may make it easier to convert the dysrhythmia to a normal rhythm with defibrillation. These drugs may also increase cerebral and coronary artery blood flow. After the medication is administered and 1 minute of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed, defibrillation is again administered. Antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), lidocaine (Xylocaine), magnesium, or procainamide (Pronestyl) are given if ventricular dysrhythmia persists (see Table 27-1). This treatment continues until a stable rhythm resumes or until it is determined that the patient cannot be revived.

\section*{IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR}

The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device that detects and terminates life-threatening episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation in high-risk patients. Patients at high risk are those who have survived sudden cardiac death syndrome, usually caused by ventricular fibrillation, or have experienced symptomatic VT (syncope secondary to VT). In addition, an ICD may be indicated for patients who have survived an MI but are at high risk for cardiac arrest.

An ICD consists of a generator and at least one lead that can sense intrinsic electrical activity and deliver an electrical impulse. The device is usually implanted much like a pacemaker (Fig. 27-32). ICDs are designed to respond to two criteria: a rate that exceeds a predetermined level, and a change in the isoelectric line segments. When a dysrhythmia occurs, rate sensors take 5 to 10 seconds to sense the dysrhythmia. Then the device takes several seconds to charge and deliver the programmed charge through the lead to the heart. Battery life is about 5 years but varies depending on use of the ICD over time. The battery is checked during follow-up visits.

Antiarrhythmic medication usually is administered with this technology to minimize the occurrence of the tachydysrhythmia and to reduce the frequency of ICD discharge.

The first defibrillator, which was implanted in 1980 at Johns Hopkins University, simply defibrillated the heart. Today, however, several devices are available, and many are programmed for multiple treatments (Atlee \& Bernstein, 2001). Each device offers a different delivery sequence, but all are capable of delivering high-energy (high-intensity) defibrillation to treat a tachycardia (atrial or ventricular). The device may deliver up to six shocks if necessary. Some ICDs can respond with antitachycardia pacing, in which the device delivers electrical impulses at a fast rate in an attempt to disrupt the tachycardia, by low-energy (low-intensity) cardioversion, by defibrillation, or all three (Atlee \& Bernstein, 2001). Some also have pacemaker capability if the patient develops bradycardia, which sometimes occurs after treatment of the tachycardia. Usually the mode is VVI (V, paces the ventricle; V, senses ventricular activity; $I$, paces only if the ventricles do not depolarize) (Atlee \& Bernstein, 2001). Some ICDs also deliver lowenergy cardioversion, and some also treat atrial fibrillation (Bubien \& Sanchez, 2001; Daoud et al., 2000). Which device is used and how it is programmed depends on the patient's dysrhythmia.

Complications are similar to those associated with pacemaker insertion. The primary complication associated with the ICD is surgery-related infection. There are a few complications associated with the technical aspects of the equipment, such as premature battery depletion and dislodged or fractured leads. Despite the possible complications, the consensus among clinicians is that the benefits of ICD therapy exceed the risks.

Nursing interventions for the patient with an ICD are provided throughout the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative phases. In addition to providing the patient and family with explanations regarding implantation of the ICD in the preoperative phase, the nurse may need to manage acute episodes of lifethreatening dysrhythmias. In the perioperative and postoperative phases, the nurse carefully observes the patient's responses to the ICD and provides the patient and family with further teaching as needed (White, 2000) (Chart 27-4). The nurse can also assist the patient and family in making lifestyle changes necessitated by the dysrhythmia and resulting ICD implantation (Dougherty, Benoliel, \& Bellin, 2000).

\section*{Home Care Checklist The Patient With an ICD}

At the completion of the home care instruction, the patient or caregiver will be able to:
Patient Caregiver
Avoid infection at the ICD insertion site.
- Observe incision site daily for redness, swelling, and heat.
- Take temperature; report any increase.
- Avoid tight restrictive clothing that may cause friction over the insertion site.

Adhere to activity restrictions.
- Movement of arm may continue to be restricted until incision heals if the ICD was implanted in pectoral region.
- Avoid heavy lifting.
- Discuss safety of activities (eg, driving) with physician.
- Avoid contact sports.

Electromagnetic interference: Understand the importance of the following:
- Avoid large magnetic fields such as those created by magnetic resonance imaging, large motors, arc welding, electrical substations, and so forth. Magnetic fields may deactivate the ICD, negating any effect on a dysrhythmia.
- At security gates at airports, government buildings, or other secured areas, show identification card and request a hand search.
- Some electrical and small motor devices, as well as cellular phones, may interfere with the functioning of the ICD if placed very close to the ICD. Avoid leaning directly over devices, or ensure contact is of brief duration; place cellular phone on opposite side of ICD.
- Household appliances (eg, microwave ovens) should not cause any concern.

Promote safety.
- Describe what to do if symptoms occur and notify physician if any discharges seem unusual.
- Maintain a log that records discharges. Record events that precipitate the sensation of shock. This provides important data for the physician to use in readjusting the medical regimen.
- Encourage family members to attend a CPR class.
- Call 911 for emergency assistance if feeling of dizziness occurs.
- Wear medical identification (eg, Medic-Alert) that includes physician information.
- Avoid frightening family or friends with unexpected shocks, which will not harm them. Inform family and friends that in the event they are in contact with the patient when a shock is delivered, they may also feel the shock. It is especially important to warn sexual partners that this may occur.
- Discuss psychological responses to the ICD implantation, such as changes in self-image, depression due to loss of mobility secondary to driving restrictions, fear of shocks, increased anxiety, concerns that sexual activity may trigger the ICD, and changes in partner relationship.
Follow-up care
- Adhere to appointments that are scheduled to test electronic performance of ICD. Remember to take log of discharges to review with physician.
- Attend an ICD support group within the area.

\section*{ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC STUDIES}

An electrophysiology (EP) study is used to evaluate and treat various dysrhythmias that have caused cardiac arrest or significant symptoms. It also is indicated for patients with symptoms that suggest a dysrhythmia that has gone undetected and undiagnosed by other methods. An EP study is used to
- Identify the impulse formation and propagation through the cardiac electrical conduction system
- Assess the function or dysfunction of the SA and AV nodal areas
- Identify the location (called mapping) and mechanism dysrhythmogenic foci
- Assess the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic medications and devices for the patient with a dysrhythmia
- Treat certain dysrhythmias through the destruction of the causative cells (ablation)

An EP procedure is a type of cardiac catheterization that is performed in a specially equipped cardiac catheterization laboratory. The patient is awake but lightly sedated. Usually a catheter with multiple electrodes is inserted through the femoral vein, threaded through the inferior vena cava, and advanced into the heart. The electrodes are positioned within the heart at specific locations-for instance, in the right atrium near the sinus node, in the coronary sinus, near the tricuspid valve, and at the apex of the right ventricle. The number and placement of electrodes depend on the type of study being conducted. These electrodes allow the electrical signal to be recorded from within the heart (intracardiogram).

The electrodes also allow the clinician to introduce a pacing stimulus to the intracardiac area at a precisely timed interval and rate, thereby stimulating the area (programmed stimulation). An area of the heart may be paced at a rate much faster than the normal rate of automaticity, the rate at which impulses are spon-
taneously formed (eg, in the sinus node). This allows the pacemaker to become an artificial focus of automaticity and to assume control (overdrive suppression). Then the pacemaker is stopped suddenly, and the time it takes for the sinus node to resume control is assessed. A prolonged time indicates dysfunction of the sinus node.

One of the main purposes of programmed stimulation is to assess the ability of the area surrounding the electrode to cause a reentry dysrhythmia. One or a series of premature impulses is delivered to an area in an attempt to cause the tachydysrhythmia. Because the precise location of the suspected area and the specific timing of the pacing needed are unknown, the electrophysiologist uses several different techniques to cause the dysrhythmia during the study. If the dysrhythmia can be reproduced by programmed stimulation, it is called inducible. Once a dysrhythmia is induced, a treatment plan is determined and implemented. If, on the follow-up EP study, the tachydysrhythmia cannot be induced, then the treatment is determined to be effective. Different medications may be administered and combined with electrical devices (pacemaker, ICD) to determine the most effective treatment to suppress the dysrhythmia.

Complications of an EP study are the same as those that can occur with cardiac catheterization. Because an artery is not always used, there is a lower incidence of vascular complications than with other catheterization procedures. Cardiac arrest may occur, but the incidence is low (less than $1 \%$ ).

Patients who are to undergo an EP study may be anxious about the procedure and about its outcome. A detailed discussion involving the patient, the family, and the electrophysiologist usually occurs to ensure that the patient is able to give informed consent and to reduce anxiety about the procedure. Before the procedure, patients should receive instructions about the procedure and its usual duration, the environment where the procedure is performed, and what to expect. Although an EP study is not painful, it does cause discomfort and can be tiring. It may also cause feelings that were experienced when the dysrhythmia occurred in the past. In addition, patients also are taught what will be expected of them (eg, lying very still during the procedure, reporting symptoms or concerns).

Patients need to know that the dysrhythmia may occur during the procedure, but under very controlled circumstances. It often stops on its own; if it does not, treatment is given to restore the patient's normal rhythm. During the procedure, patients benefit from a calm, reassuring approach.

Postprocedural care includes restriction of activity to promote hemostasis at the insertion site. To identify any complications and to ensure healing, the patient's vital signs and the appearance of the insertion site are assessed frequently.

\section*{CARDIAC CONDUCTION SURGERY}

Atrial tachycardias and ventricular tachycardias that do not respond to medications and are not suitable for antitachycardia pacing may be treated by methods other than medications and devices. Such methods include endocardial isolation, endocardial resection, and ablation. An ICD may be used with these surgical interventions.

\section*{Endocardial Isolation}

Endocardial isolation involves making an incision into the endocardium that separates the area where the dysrhythmia originates from the surrounding endocardium. The edges of the incision are then sutured together. The incision and its resulting scar tissue prevent the dysrhythmia from affecting the whole heart.

\section*{Endocardial Resection}

In endocardial resection, the origin of the dysrhythmia is identified, and that area of the endocardium is peeled away. No reconstruction or repair is necessary.

\section*{Catheter Ablation Therapy}

Catheter ablation destroys specific cells that are the cause or central conduction method of a tachydysrhythmia. It is performed with or after an EP study. Usual indications for ablation are AV nodal reentry tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or VT unresponsive to previous therapy (or for which the therapy produced significant side effects).

Ablation is also indicated to eliminate accessory AV pathways or bypass tracts that exist in the hearts of patients with preexcitation syndromes such as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. During normal embryonic development, all connections between the atrium and ventricles disappear, except for that between the AV node and the bundle of His. In some people, embryonic connections of normal heart muscle between the atrium and ventricles remain, providing an accessory pathway or a tract through which the electrical impulse can bypass the AV node. These pathways can be located in several different areas. If the patient develops atrial fibrillation, the impulse may be conducted into the ventricle at a rate of 300 times per minute or more, which can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Preexcitation syndromes are identified by specific ECG findings. For example, in WPW syndrome there is a shortened PR interval, slurring (called a delta wave) of the initial QRS deflection, and prolonged QRS duration (Fig. 27-33).

Ablation may be accomplished by three different methods: radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or electrical ablation. The most often used method is radiofrequency, which involves placing a special catheter at or near the origin of the dysrhythmia. High-frequency, low-energy sound waves are passed through the catheter, causing thermal injury and cellular changes that result in localized destruction and scarring. The tissue damage is more specific to the dysrhythmic tissue, with less trauma to the surrounding cardiac tissue than occurs with cryoablation or electrical ablation.

Cryoablation involves placing a special probe, cooled to a temperature of $-60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(-76^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, on the endocardium at the site of the dysrhythmia's origin for 2 minutes. The tissue freezes and is later replaced by scar tissue, eliminating the origin of the dysrhythmia.

In electrical ablation, a catheter is placed at or near the origin of the dysrhythmia, and one to four shocks of 100 to 300 joules are administered through the catheter directly to the endocardium and surrounding tissue. The cardiac tissue burns and scars, thus eliminating the source of the dysrhythmia.

During the ablation procedure, defibrillation pads, an automatic blood pressure cuff, and a pulse oximeter are used on the patient, and an indwelling urinary catheter is inserted. The patient is given light sedation. An EP study is performed and attempts to induce the dysrhythmia are made. The ablation catheter is placed at the origin of the dysrhythmia, and the ablation procedure is performed. Multiple ablations may be necessary. Successful ablation is achieved when the dysrhythmia can no longer be induced. The patient is monitored for another 30 to 60 minutes and then retested to ensure that the dysrhythmia will not recur.

Postprocedural care is similar to that for an EP study, except that the patient is monitored more closely, depending on the time needed for recovery from sedation.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are caring for a 40 year-old male physician who had experienced a cardiac arrest at home, witnessed by his 9-yearold son and 15-year-old daughter. After having an ICD implanted, he appears sullen and withdrawn. On inquiry about how he feels, he replies, "I don't know if this device is a blessing or a punishment!" How would you respond? What other factors are important to assess? Discuss the impact that his children may have on his perception of the device. How would you alter your plan of care to address this patient's psychosocial concerns because he is a physician? How would the plan of care change if, instead of appearing sullen and withdrawn, he appeared irritable and confrontational?
2. Your patient is an active 80 -year-old woman who has heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation. She is taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a diuretic, and digoxin. During your assessment, she tells you that she felt very dizzy this morning. How would you focus your assessment, and why? Identify some of the key assessment factors. What nursing interventions are needed? How would you modify your assessment and interventions if your patient also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal insufficiency?

\section*{Management of Patients With Coronary Vascular Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of coronary atherosclerosis.
2. Describe the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of angina pectoris.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with angina pectoris.
4. Describe the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of myocardial infarction.

6. Describe the nursing care of a patient who has had an invasive interventional procedure for treatment of coronary artery disease.
7. Describe coronary artery revascularization procedures.
8. Describe the nursing care of the patient treated with cardiac surgery.

$I_{n}$the past, identification and treatment of heart disease focused on white, middle-aged men. However, later studies showed that other segments of the population were also seriously affected by cardiac conditions. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women of all racial and ethnic groups, and more women die of cardiovascular disease than all types of cancers combined (American Heart Association, 2001).

\section*{Coronary Artery Disease}

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent type of cardiovascular disease. For this reason, it is important for nurses to become familiar with the various types of coronary artery conditions and the methods for assessing, preventing, and treating these disorders medically and surgically.

\section*{CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS}

The most common heart disease in the United States is atherosclerosis, which is an abnormal accumulation of lipid, or fatty, substances and fibrous tissue in the vessel wall. These substances create blockages or narrow the vessel in a way that reduces blood flow to the myocardium. Studies (Mehta et al., 1998) indicate that atherosclerosis involves a repetitious inflammatory response to artery wall injury and an alteration in the biophysical and biochemical properties of the arterial walls. An association between an infection (eg, gingivitis) and the later development of heart disease is being explored, as is the administration of antibiotics to prevent heart disease. Although authorities disagree about how atherosclerosis begins, they agree that atherosclerosis is a progressive disease that can be curtailed and, in some cases, reversed.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Atherosclerosis begins as fatty streaks, lipids that are deposited in the intima of the arterial wall. Although they are thought to be the precursors of atherosclerosis, fatty streaks are common, even in childhood. Moreover, not all develop into more advanced lesions. The reason why some fatty streaks continue to develop is unknown, although genetic and environmental factors are involved. The continued development of atherosclerosis involves an inflammatory response. T lymphocytes and monocytes (that become macrophages) infiltrate the area to ingest the lipids and then die; this causes smooth muscle cells within the vessel to proliferate and form a fibrous cap over the dead fatty core. These deposits, called atheromas or plaques, protrude into the lumen of the vessel, narrowing it and obstructing blood flow (Fig. 28-1). If the fibrous cap of the plaque is thick and the lipid pool remains relatively stable, it can resist the stress from blood flow and vessel movement. If the cap is thin, the lipid core may grow, causing it to rupture and hemorrhage into the plaque, allowing a thrombus to develop. The thrombus may obstruct blood flow, leading to sudden cardiac death or an acute myocardial infarction (MI), which is the death of heart tissue.

The anatomic structure of the coronary arteries makes them particularly susceptible to the mechanisms of atherosclerosis. As Figure 28-2 shows, they twist and turn as they supply blood to the heart, creating sites susceptible to atheroma development. Although heart disease is most often caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, other phenomena decrease blood flow to the heart. Examples include vasospasm (sudden constriction or narrowing) of a coronary artery, myocardial trauma from internal or external forces, structural disease, congenital anomalies, decreased oxygen supply (eg, from acute blood loss, anemia, or low

blood pressure), and increased demand for oxygen (eg, from rapid heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, or ingestion of cocaine).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Coronary atherosclerosis produces symptoms and complications according to the location and degree of narrowing of the arterial lumen, thrombus formation, and obstruction of blood flow to the myocardium. This impediment to blood flow is usually progressive, causing an inadequate blood supply that deprives the muscle cells of oxygen needed for their survival. The condition is known as ischemia. Angina pectoris refers to chest pain that is brought about by myocardial ischemia. Angina pectoris usually is caused by significant coronary atherosclerosis. If the decrease in blood supply is great enough, of long enough duration, or both, irreversible damage and death of myocardial cells, or MI, may result. Over time, irreversibly damaged myocardium undergoes degener-

ation and is replaced by scar tissue, causing various degrees of myocardial dysfunction. Significant myocardial damage may cause inadequate cardiac output, and the heart cannot support the body's needs for blood, which is called heart failure (HF). A decrease in blood supply from CAD may even cause the heart to stop abruptly, an event that is called sudden cardiac death.

The most common manifestation of myocardial ischemia is acute onset of chest pain. However, an epidemiologic study of the people in Framingham, Massachusetts, showed that nearly $15 \%$ of men and women who had MIs were totally asymptomatic (Kannel, 1986). Another study found that $33 \%$ of those diagnosed with MI did not present to the emergency room with chest pain (Canto et al., 2000; Ishihara et al., 2000). Those without chest pain tend to be older or women, or to have diabetes or a history of heart failure. Women have been found to have more atypical symptoms of myocardial ischemia (eg, shortness of breath, nausea, unusual fatigue) than men (Meischke et al., 1999). The incidence of prodromal angina (ie, angina a few hours to days before the MI) was found to be significantly lower in patients older than 70 years of age (Ishihara et al., 2000). Other clinical manifestations of CAD may be abnormalities signaled by changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG), high levels of cardiac enzymes, dysrhythmias, and sudden death.

\section*{Risk Factors}

Epidemiologic studies point to several factors that increase the probability that heart disease will develop. Major risk factors include use of tobacco, hypertension, elevated blood lipid levels, family history of premature cardiovascular disease (first-degree relative with cardiovascular disease at age 55 or younger for men and at age 65 or younger for women) and age ( $>45$ years for men; $>55$ years for women). The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III [ATP III]; 2001) represents the updated clinical guidelines for cholesterol testing and management. ATP III addresses primary prevention (preventing the occurrence of CAD) and secondary prevention (preventing the progression of CAD).

ATP III is the standard for cholesterol management. ATP III continues to identify elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol as the primary target of cholesterol-lowering therapy. Those at highest risk for having a cardiac event within 10 years are those with existing CAD or those with diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, or carotid artery disease. The latter diseases are called CAD risk equivalents, because patients with these diseases have the same risk for a cardiac event as patients with CAD (Chart 28-1). The possibility of having a cardiac event within 10 years is also determined by points given to several factors, such as age, level of total cholesterol, level of LDL, level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), systolic blood pressure, and tobacco use. If the total points add up to more than 15 for men or 23 for women, the person has a greater than $20 \%$ risk for a cardiac event within 10 years. A composite of lipid and nonlipid risk factors of metabolic origin, called metabolic syndrome, is another risk factor for CAD. Metabolic syndrome includes abdominal obesity, an elevated triglyceride level, low HDL level, elevated blood pressure, and impaired function of insulin.

Measurement of other emerging risk factors, such as elevations of Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], remnant lipoproteins, small LDL, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and impaired fasting plasma glucose ( $110-125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), is optional and are not routinely recommended (ATP III, 2001). For example, the Homocysteine Studies Collaboration (2002) found that lower levels of homocysteine, an amino acid, were modestly associated with reduced risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. The results of these retrospective studies suggest that homocysteine may promote atherosclerosis. A meta-analysis of prospective studies was done that showed a significant association between homocysteine levels and ischemic heart disease as well as between homocysteine and stroke (Wald, Law, \& Morris, 2002). The authors recommend a daily intake of approximately 0.8 mg of folic acid to decrease blood homocysteine levels and reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease and CVA (brain attack, stroke). The American Heart Association has stated that until the results of large-scale randomized trials become available, routine testing of homocysteine concentrations cannot be justified (Malinow, Bostom, \& Krauss, 1999).

\section*{Prevention}

Four modifiable risk factors-cholesterol abnormalities, cigarette smoking (tobacco use), hypertension, and diabetes mellitushave been cited as major risk factors for CAD and its consequent complications. As a result, they receive much attention in health promotion programs (Chart 28-2).

\section*{Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease}

A modifiable risk factor is one over which individuals may exercise control, such as by changing a lifestyle or personal habit or by using medication. A nonmodifiable risk factor is a circumstance over which individuals have no control, such as age or heredity. A risk factor may operate independently or in tandem with other risk factors. The more risk factors individuals have, the greater the likelihood of coronary artery disease. Those at risk are advised to seek regular medical examinations and to engage in "heart-healthy" behavior (a deliberate effort to reduce the number and extent of risks).
Nonmodifiable Risk Factors
Family history of coronary heart disease
Increasing age

Race (higher incidence of heart disease in African Americans than in Caucasians)
Modifiable Risk Factors
High blood cholesterol level
Cigarette smoking, tobacco use

\section*{CONTROLLING CHOLESTEROL ABNORMALITIES}

The association of a high blood cholesterol level with heart disease is well established and accepted. The metabolism of fats is important in understanding the development of heart disease.

Fats, which are insoluble in water, are encased in water-soluble lipoproteins to allow them to be transported within a circulatory system that is water-based. Four elements of fat metabolism-total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides—are primary factors affecting the development of heart disease (Fig. 28-3). Cholesterol and the lipoproteins are synthesized by the liver or ingested as part of the diet. All adults 20 years of age or older should have a fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride) performed at least once every 5 years and more often if the profile is abnormal. Patients who have had an acute event (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) require assessment of the LDL-cholesterol level within 60 to 365 days after the event (LDL levels may be low immediately after the acute event). Subsequently, lipids should be monitored every 6 weeks until the desired level is achieved and then every 4 to 6 months (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001).

LDL exerts a harmful effect on the arterial wall and accelerates atherosclerosis. In contrast, HDL promotes the use of total cholesterol by transporting LDL to the liver, where it is biodegraded and then excreted. The desired goal is to have low LDL values and high HDL values. The desired level of LDL depends on the patient:
- Less than $160 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for patients with one or no risk factors
- Less than $130 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for patients with two or more risk factors
- Less than $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for patients with CAD or a CAD risk equivalent

\caption{FIGURE 28-3 Types of lipids. Elevated levels of cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, and triglycerides, and low levels of HDL are risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic arterial disease, such as coronary artery disease. (VLDL, very low density lipoproteins; LDL, low density lipoproteins; HDL, high density lipoproteins.)}
\end{figure}

Serum cholesterol and LDL levels can usually be controlled by diet and physical activity. Depending on the patient's LDL level and risk of coronary heart disease, medication therapy may also be prescribed.

The level of HDL should exceed $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and should ideally be more than $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. A high HDL level is a strong negative risk factor (is protective) for heart disease.

Triglyceride is another fatty substance, made up of fatty acids, that is transported through the blood by a lipoprotein. Although an elevated triglyceride level ( $>200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) may be genetic in origin, it also can be caused by obesity, physical inactiv-
ity, excessive alcohol intake, high-carbohydrate diets, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and certain medications, such as birth control pills, corticosteroids, and beta-adrenergic blockers when given in higher doses. Management of elevated triglyceride focuses on weight reduction and increased physical activity. Medications such as nicotinic acid and fibric acids (eg, fenofibrate [Tricor], clofibrate [Atromid-S]) may also be prescribed, especially if the triglyceride level is above $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001).

Lipoprotein(a), or $\mathrm{Lp}(\mathrm{a})$, is a component of LDL and is attached to a special protein called apo(a). The level of $\mathrm{Lp}(\mathrm{a})$ is primarily determined by genetics. An elevated level of $\operatorname{Lp}(\mathrm{a})$ has been associated with a higher risk of CAD. However, clinical trials have not yet identified methods that lower the level of $\operatorname{Lp}(\mathrm{a})$ and have not demonstrated that lower levels of $\mathrm{Lp}(\mathrm{a})$ reduce the risk of CAD; therefore Lp(a) is not routinely monitored (Danesh, et al., 2000; Gibbons et al., 1999).

Dietary Measures. Table 28-1 provides recommendations of the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001). However, these recommendations may need to be adjusted to match the individual patient who has other nutritional needs, such as the requirements for pregnancy or diabetes. To assist in following the appropriate TLC diet, the patient should be referred to a registered dietitian. Other TLC recommendations are weight loss, cessation of tobacco use, and increased physical activity.

Soluble dietary fiber may also help lower cholesterol levels. Soluble fibers, which are found in fresh fruit, cereal grains, vegetables, and legumes, enhance the excretion of metabolized cholesterol. The ability of fiber to reduce serum cholesterol continues to be investigated. Intake of at least 20 to 30 grams of fiber each day is recommended (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001).

Many resources are available to assist people who are attempting to control their cholesterol levels. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and its National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), the American Heart Association, and the

American Diabetic Association, as well as CAD support groups and reliable Internet sources, are a few examples of the available resources. Cookbooks and recipes that include the nutritional breakdown of foods can be included as resources for patients. Dietary control has been made easier because food manufacturers are required to provide comprehensive nutritional data on product labels. The label information of interest to a person attempting to eat a heart-healthy diet is as follows:
- Serving size, expressed in household measures
- Amount of total fat per serving
- Amount of saturated fat per serving
- Amount of cholesterol per serving
- Amount of fiber per serving

Physical Activity. Regular, moderate physical activity increases HDL levels and reduces triglyceride levels. The goal for the average person is a total of 30 minutes of exercise, three to four times per week. The nurse helps patients set realistic goals for physical activity. For example, the inactive patient should start with activity that lasts 3 minutes, such as parking farther from a building to increase the walking time. For sustained activity, patients should begin with a 5 -minute warm-up period to stretch and prepare the body for the exercise. They should end the exercise with a 5-minute cool-down period in which they gradually reduce the intensity of the activity to prevent a sudden decrease in cardiac output. Patients should be instructed to engage in an activity or variety of activities that interest them, to maintain motivation. They should also be taught to exercise to an intensity that does not preclude their ability to talk; if they cannot have a conversation, they should slow down or switch to a less intensive activity. When the weather is hot and humid, the patient should be advised to exercise during the early morning or indoors and wear loose-fitting clothing. When the weather is cold, the patient should be instructed to layer clothing and to wear a hat. The nurse can also advise the patient to avoid adverse weather conditions by participating in local community programs, such as those held at shopping malls. The nurse should inform patients to stop any activity if they develop chest pain, unusual shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea.

Medications. Medications (Table 28-2) are used in some instances to control cholesterol levels. If diet alone cannot normalize serum cholesterol levels, several medications have a synergistic effect with the prescribed diet. Lipid-lowering medications can reduce CAD mortality in patients with elevated lipid levels and in those with normal lipid levels. The lipid-lowering agents affect the different lipid components and are usually grouped into four types:
- 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins (eg, lovastatin [Mevacor], pravastatin [Pravachol], simvastatin [Zocor]; see Table 28-2) block cholesterol synthesis, lower LDL and triglyceride levels, and increase HDL levels. These medications are frequently the initial medication therapy for significantly elevated cholesterol and LDL levels. Because of their effect on the liver, results of hepatic function tests are monitored.
- Nicotinic acids (niacin [Niacor, Niaspan]; see Table 28-2) decrease lipoprotein synthesis, lower LDL and triglyceride levels, and increase HDL levels. The dose of niacin needs to be titrated weekly to achieve therapeutic dosage. Niacin is the medication most often used for minimally elevated cholesterol and LDL levels or as an adjunct to a statin when the lipid goal has not been achieved and the triglycerides are
elevated. Side effects include gastrointestinal upset, gout, and flushing. Because of its effect on the liver, hepatic function is monitored.
- Fibric acid or fibrates (eg, clofibrate [Atromid-S], fenofibrate [Ticor]; see Table 28-2) decrease the synthesis of cholesterol, reduce triglyceride levels, and increase HDL levels. Because they have the potential to increase LDLs, fibrates are the medications of choice for patients with triglyceride levels above $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Because of the risk of myopathy and acute renal failure, fibrates should be used with caution in patients who are also taking a statin.
- Bile acid sequestrants or resins (eg, cholestyramine [LoCholest, Questran, Prevalite]; see Table 28-2) bind cholesterol in the intestine, increase its breakdown, and lower LDL levels with minimal effect on HDLs and no effect (or minimal increase) on triglyceride levels. These medications are more often used as adjunct therapy when statins alone have not been effective in controlling lipid levels and the triglyceride levels are less than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Significant side effects, such as gastric distention and constipation, can occur from using these medications.
Medication therapy is reserved for at-risk patients and is not regarded as a substitute for dietary modification. All of these medications have been shown to reduce major coronary events (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001). Some of these may be used in combination to achieve synergistic effects. For example, LDL cholesterol can be lowered more effectively by adding a low dose of resin to a dose of niacin or statins, or both, than a maximum dose of an individual agent.

Patients with elevated cholesterol levels should be monitored for adherence to the medical plan, the effect of cholesterol-lowering medications, and the development of side effects from cholesterollowering medications. Lipid levels are obtained and adjustments made to the diet and medication every 6 weeks until the lipid goal or maximum dose is achieved and then every 6 months thereafter.

\section*{PROMOTING CESSATION OF TOBACCO USE}

Cigarette smoking contributes to the development and severity of CAD in three ways. First, the inhalation of smoke increases the blood carbon monoxide level, causing hemoglobin, the oxygencarrying component of blood, to combine more readily with carbon monoxide than with oxygen. A decreased amount of available oxygen may decrease the heart's ability to pump.

Second, the nicotinic acid in tobacco triggers the release of catecholamines, which raise the heart rate and blood pressure. Nicotinic acid can also cause the coronary arteries to constrict. Smokers have a tenfold increase in risk for sudden cardiac death. The increase in catecholamines may be a factor in the increased incidence of sudden cardiac death.

Third, use of tobacco causes a detrimental vascular response and increases platelet adhesion, leading to a higher probability of thrombus formation. A person with increased risk for heart disease is encouraged to stop tobacco use through any means possible: counseling, consistent motivation and reinforcement messages, support groups, and medications. Some people have found complementary therapies (eg, acupuncture, guided imagery, hypnosis) to be helpful. People who stop smoking reduce their risk of heart disease by $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ within the first year, and the risk continues to decline as long as they refrain from smoking.

Exposure to other smokers' smoke (passive or second-hand smoke) is believed to cause heart disease in nonsmokers. Oral contraceptive use by women who smoke is inadvisable because

these medications significantly increase the risk of CAD and sudden cardiac death.

Cessation of tobacco use results in a lower rate of cardiac events. Patients should be advised to participate in an educational class, support group, or behavioral program. Use of medications such as the nicotine patch (Nicotrol, Nicoderm CQ, Habitrol) or bupropion (Zyban) may assist with stopping use of tobacco, but do have the same systemic effects: catecholamine release (increasing heart rate and blood pressure) and increased platelet adhesion. These medications should be used for the shortest time and at the lowest effective doses.

\section*{MANAGING HYPERTENSION}

Hypertension is defined as blood pressure measurements that repeatedly exceed $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Long-standing elevated blood pressure may result in increased stiffness of the vessel walls, leading to vessel injury and a resulting inflammatory response within
the intima. Hypertension can also increase the work of the left ventricle, which must pump harder to eject blood into the arteries. Over time, the increased workload causes the heart to enlarge and thicken (ie, hypertrophy), a condition that may eventually lead to cardiac failure.

Early detection of high blood pressure and adherence to a therapeutic regimen can prevent the serious consequences associated with untreated elevated blood pressure. Hypertension is discussed in detail in Chapter 32.

\section*{CONTROLLING DIABETES MELLITUS}

The relationship between diabetes mellitus and heart disease has been substantiated. For $65 \%$ to $75 \%$ of patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease is listed as the cause of death (Braunwald et al., 2001; Grundy et al., 1999). Hyperglycemia fosters dyslipidemia, increased platelet aggregation, and altered red blood cell function, which can lead to thrombus formation. It has been suggested that
these metabolic alterations impair endothelial cell-dependent vasodilation and smooth muscle function; treatment with insulin (eg, Humalog, Humulin, Novolin) and metformin (Glucophage) has demonstrated improvement in endothelial function: improved endothelial-dependent dilation (Gaenzer et al., 2002). Diabetes is considered equivalent to existing CAD in its risk of a cardiac event within 10 years (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001). Diabetes is discussed in detail in Chapter 41.

\section*{Gender and Estrogen Level}

Because heart disease had been considered to primarily affect white men, the disease was not as readily recognized and treated in women. However, in 1999 in the United States, 512,904 women died because of cardiovascular disease whereas 42,144 women died from breast cancer and 246,006 women died from any form of cancer (American Heart Association, 2002). Women tend to have a higher incidence of complications from CAD (American Heart Association, 2002). African-American women have a mortality rate nearly twice that of Caucasian women (Office for Social Environment and Health Research at West Virginia University, 2001). Women tend not to recognize the symptoms as early as men and to wait longer to report their symptoms and seek medical assistance (Meischke et al., 1999; Penque et al., 1998). In the past, women were less likely than men to be referred for coronary artery diagnostic procedures, to receive medical therapy (eg, thrombolytic therapy to break down the blood clots that cause acute MI, or nitroglycerin), and to be treated with invasive interventions, eg, angioplasty (Sheifer et al., 2000). It is anticipated that with better education of the general public and health care professionals, gender and racial differences will have less influence on the diagnosis, treatment, and incidence of complications of heart disease in the future.

In women younger than age 55, the incidence of CAD is significantly lower than in men. However, after age 55, the incidence in women is approximately equal to that in men. The age difference of the incidence of CAD in women may be related to estrogen. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal women had been promoted as prevention for CAD, research studies do not support HRT as an effective means of CAD prevention (Hulley et al., 1998; Mosca, 2000). HRT has decreased postmenopausal symptoms and the risk for osteoporosisrelated bone fractures, but HRT also has been associated with an increased risk for CAD, breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA, brain attack, stroke), and pulmonary embolism. The Women's Health Initiative (Gebbie, 2002) demonstrated that long-term HRT may have more risks than benefits, and that HRT should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CAD.

\section*{Behavior Patterns}

Most clinicians believe that stress and certain behaviors contribute to the pathogenesis of CAD and a cardiac event, especially in women. Psychological and epidemiologic studies describe behaviors that characterize people who are prone to heart disease: excessive competitiveness, a sense of time urgency or impatience, aggressiveness, and hostility (Dembroski et al., 1989; Friedman
\& Rosenman, 1959; Krantz et al., 2000). A person with these behaviors is classified as type A coronary-prone.

The type A coronary-prone classification may not be as significant as was once thought; evidence of its precise role remains inconclusive (Rozanski et al., 1999). To be on the safer side, however, such a person may be wise to alter behaviors and responses to triggering events and to reduce other risk factors. Nurses can assist these people by teaching them cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques. Because people who are depressed have worse outcomes, these patients should be assessed for signs and symptoms of depression and, if diagnosed, appropriately treated.

\section*{ANGINA PECTORIS}

Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome usually characterized by episodes or paroxysms of pain or pressure in the anterior chest. The cause is usually insufficient coronary blood flow. The insufficient flow results in a decreased oxygen supply to meet an increased myocardial demand for oxygen in response to physical exertion or emotional stress. In other words, the need for oxygen exceeds the supply. The severity of angina is based on the precipitating activity and its effect on the activities of daily living (Table 28-3).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Angina is usually caused by atherosclerotic disease. Almost invariably, angina is associated with a significant obstruction of a major coronary artery. The characteristics of the various types of angina are listed in Chart 28-3. Identifying angina requires obtaining a thorough history. Effective treatment begins with reducing the demands placed on the heart and teaching the patient about the condition. Several factors are associated with typical anginal pain:
- Physical exertion, which can precipitate an attack by increasing myocardial oxygen demand
- Exposure to cold, which can cause vasoconstriction and an elevated blood pressure, with increased oxygen demand
- Eating a heavy meal, which increases the blood flow to the mesenteric area for digestion, thereby reducing the blood supply available to the heart muscle (In a severely compromised heart, shunting of blood for digestion can be sufficient to induce anginal pain.)
- Stress or any emotion-provoking situation, causing the release of adrenaline and increasing blood pressure, which may accelerate the heart rate and increase the myocardial workload

Atypical angina is not associated with the listed factors. It may occur at rest.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Ischemia of the heart muscle may produce pain or other symptoms, varying in severity from a feeling of indigestion to a choking or heavy sensation in the upper chest that ranges from discomfort to agonizing pain accompanied by severe apprehension and a feeling of impending death. The pain is often felt deep in the chest behind the upper or middle third of the sternum (retrosternal area). Typically, the pain or discomfort is poorly localized and may radiate to the neck, jaw, shoulders, and inner aspects of the upper arms, usually the left arm. The patient often feels tightness or a heavy, choking, or strangling sensation that has a viselike, insistent quality. The patient with diabetes mellitus may not have severe pain with angina because the neuropathy that accompanies diabetes can interfere with neuroreceptors, dulling the patient's perception of pain.

A feeling of weakness or numbness in the arms, wrists, and hands may accompany the pain, as may shortness of breath, pallor, diaphoresis, dizziness or lightheadedness, and nausea and vomiting. These symptoms may also appear alone and still represent myocardial ischemia. When these symptoms appear alone, they are called angina-like symptoms. Anxiety may accompany angina. An important characteristic of angina is that it abates or subsides with rest or nitroglycerin.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The elderly person with angina may not exhibit the typical pain profile because of the diminished responses of neurotransmitters that occur in the aging process. Often, the presenting symptom in the elderly is dyspnea. If they do have pain, it is atypical pain that radiates to both arms rather than just the left arm. Sometimes, there are no symptoms ("silent" CAD), making recognition and diagnosis a clinical challenge. Elderly patients should be encouraged to recognize their chest pain-like symptom (eg, weakness) as an indication that they should rest or take prescribed medications. Noninvasive stress testing used to diagnose CAD may not be as useful in elderly patients because of other conditions (eg,
peripheral vascular disease, arthritis, degenerative disk disease, physical disability, foot problems) that limit the patient's ability to exercise.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of angina is often made by evaluating the clinical manifestations of ischemia and the patient's history. A 12-lead ECG and blood laboratory values help in making the diagnosis. The patient may undergo an exercise or pharmacologic stress test in which the heart is monitored by ECG, echocardiogram, or both. The patient may also be referred for an echocardiogram, nuclear scan, or invasive procedures (cardiac catheterization and coronary artery angiography).

CAD is believed to result from inflammation of the arterial endothelium. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker for inflammation of vascular endothelium. High blood levels of CRP have been associated with increased coronary artery calcification and risk of an acute cardiovascular event (eg, MI) in seemingly healthy individuals (Ridker et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002). There is interest in using CRP blood levels as an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease in clinical use and research, but the clinical value of CRP levels has not been fully established. The ability of CRP to predict cardiovascular disease when adjusted for other risk factors, how CRP levels can guide patient management, and if patient outcomes improve when using CRP levels must be established before CRP levels are used routinely for patient care (Mosca, 2002).

An elevated blood level of homocysteine, an amino acid, has also been proposed as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, studies have not supported the relationship between mild to moderate elevations of homocysteine and atherosclerosis (Homocysteine Studies Collaboration, 2002). No study has yet shown that reducing homocysteine levels reduces the risk of CAD.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of the medical management of angina are to decrease the oxygen demand of the myocardium and to increase the oxygen supply. Medically, these objectives are met through pharmacologic therapy and control of risk factors.

Revascularization procedures to restore the blood supply to the myocardium include percutaneous coronary interventional (PCI) procedures (eg, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA], intracoronary stents, and atherectomy), CABG, and percutaneous transluminal myocardial revascularization (PTMR).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Among medications used to control angina are nitroglycerin, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, and antiplatelet agents.

Nitroglycerin. Nitrates remain the mainstay for treatment of angina pectoris. A vasoactive agent, nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, Nitrol, Nitrobid IV) is administered to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, which decreases ischemia and relieves pain. Nitroglycerin dilates primarily the veins and, in higher doses, also dilates the arteries. It helps to increase coronary blood flow by
preventing vasospasm and increasing perfusion through the collateral vessels.

Dilation of the veins causes venous pooling of blood throughout the body. As a result, less blood returns to the heart, and filling pressure (preload) is reduced. If the patient is hypovolemic (does not have adequate circulating blood volume), the decrease in filling pressure can cause a significant decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure.

Nitrates in higher doses also relax the systemic arteriolar bed and lower blood pressure (decreased afterload). Nitrates may increase blood flow to diseased coronary arteries and through collateral coronary arteries, arteries that have been underused until the body recognizes poorly perfused areas. These effects decrease myocardial oxygen requirements and increase oxygen supply, bringing about a more favorable balance between supply and demand.

Nitroglycerin may be given by several routes: sublingual tablet or spray, topical agent, and intravenous administration. Sublingual nitroglycerin is generally placed under the tongue or in the cheek (buccal pouch) and alleviates the pain of ischemia within 3 minutes. Topical nitroglycerin is also fast acting and is a convenient way to administer the medication. Both routes are suitable for patients who self-administer the medication. Chart 28-4 provides more information.

A continuous or intermittent intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin may be administered to the hospitalized patient with recurring signs and symptoms of ischemia or after a revascularization procedure. The amount of nitroglycerin administered is based on the patient's symptoms while avoiding side effects such as hypotension. It usually is not given if the systolic blood pressure is 90 mm Hg or less. Generally, after the patient is symptom free, the
nitroglycerin may be switched to a topical preparation within 24 hours.

Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents. Beta-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol), and atenolol (Tenormin) appear to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by blocking the beta-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation to the heart. The result is a reduction in heart rate, slowed conduction of an impulse through the heart, decreased blood pressure, and reduced myocardial contractility (force of contraction) that establishes a more favorable balance between myocardial oxygen needs (demands) and the amount of oxygen available (supply). This helps to control chest pain and delays the onset of ischemia during work or exercise. Beta-blockers reduce the incidence of recurrent angina, infarction, and cardiac mortality. The dose can be titrated to achieve a resting heart rate of 50 to 60 beats per minute.

Cardiac side effects and possible contraindications include hypotension, bradycardia, advanced atrioventricular block, and decompensated heart failure. If a beta-blocker is given intravenously for an acute cardiac event, the ECG, blood pressure, and heart rate are monitored closely after the medication has been administered. Because some beta-blockers also affect the beta-adrenergic receptors in the bronchioles, causing bronchoconstriction, they are contraindicated in patients with significant pulmonary constrictive diseases, such as asthma. Other side effects include worsening of hyperlipidemia, depression, fatigue, decreased libido, and masking of symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients taking beta-blockers are cautioned not to stop taking them abruptly, because angina may worsen and MI may develop. Beta-blocker therapy needs to

Most patients with angina pectoris must self-administer nitroglycerin on an as-needed basis. A key nursing role in such cases is educating patients about the medication and how to take it. Sublingual nitroglycerin comes in tablet and spray forms.

\section*{Teaching About Sublingual Nitroglycerin}
- Instruct the patient to make sure the mouth is moist, the tongue is still, and saliva is not swallowed until the nitroglycerin tablet dissolves. If the pain is severe, the patient can crush the tablet between the teeth to hasten sublingual absorption.
- Advise the patient to carry the medication at all times as a precaution. However, because nitroglycerin is very unstable, it should be carried securely in its original container (eg, capped dark glass bottle); tablets should never be removed and stored in metal or plastic pillboxes.
- Explain that nitroglycerin is volatile and is inactivated by heat, moisture, air, light, and time. Instruct the patient to renew the nitroglycerin supply every 6 months.
- Inform the patient that the medication should be taken in anticipation of any activity that may produce pain. Because nitroglycerin increases tolerance for exercise and stress when taken prophylactically (ie, before angina-producing activity, such as exercise, stair-climbing, or sexual intercourse), it is best taken before pain develops.
- Recommend that the patient note how long it takes for the nitroglycerin to relieve the discomfort. Advise the patient that if pain persists after taking three sublingual tablets at 5-minute intervals, emergency medical services should be called.
- Discuss possible side effects of nitroglycerin, including flushing, throbbing headache, hypotension, and tachycardia.

\section*{Teaching About Topical Nitroglycerin}

Nitroglycerin is also available in a lanolin-petrolatum base that is applied to the skin as a paste or a patch. Patients who use topical nitroglycerin need additional instruction.
- Advise the patient to read the instructions that accompany the product, because instructions vary according to the preparation. Also remind the patient to rotate the site of application to avoid skin irritation.
- Explain that the area of application needs to be an area that is well perfused for absorption to occur. Therefore, the medication should not be applied to areas with extensive body hair or scar tissue.
- Recommend that the patient protect clothing from the oil base in the paste.
- Explain that a long-term equally spaced dosing schedule of application of topical nitroglycerin is generally avoided to prevent tolerance (when the body does not respond as well to the same amount of medication). Most physicians prescribe application of topical nitroglycerin paste three or four times daily or every 6 hours (excluding the mid-night dose), and application of the nitroglycerin patch every morning and removed at 10 PM . This dosing regimen allows for a 6 - to 8 -hour nitrate-free period to prevent the body's development of tolerance.
be decreased gradually over several days before discontinuing it. Patients with diabetes who take beta-blockers are instructed to assess their blood glucose levels more often and to observe for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

Calcium Channel Blocking Agents. Calcium channel blockers (calcium ion antagonists) have different effects. Some decrease sinoatrial node automaticity and atrioventricular node conduction, resulting in a slower heart rate and a decrease in the strength of the heart muscle contraction (negative inotropic effect). These effects decrease the workload of the heart. Calcium channel blockers also relax the blood vessels, causing a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in coronary artery perfusion. Calcium channel blockers increase myocardial oxygen supply by dilating the smooth muscle wall of the coronary arterioles; they decrease myocardial oxygen demand by reducing systemic arterial pressure and the workload of the left ventricle.

The calcium channel blockers most commonly used are amlodipine (Norvasc), verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan), and diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac). They may be used by patients who cannot take beta-blockers, who develop significant side effects from beta-blockers or nitrates, or who still have pain despite betablocker and nitroglycerin therapy. Calcium channel blockers are used to prevent and treat vasospasm, which commonly occurs after an invasive interventional procedure. Use of short-acting nifedipine (Procardia) was found to be poorly tolerated and to increase the risk of MI in patients with hypertension and the risk of death in patients with acute coronary syndrome (Braunwald et al., 2000; Furberg et al., 1996; Ryan et al., 1999).

First-generation calcium channel blockers should be avoided or used with great caution in people with heart failure, because they decrease myocardial contractility. Amlodipine (Norvasc) and felodipine (Plendil) are the calcium channel blockers of choice for patients with heart failure. Hypotension may occur after the intravenous administration of any of the calcium channel blockers. Other side effects that may occur include atrioventricular blocks, bradycardia, constipation, and gastric distress.

Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Medications. Antiplatelet medications are administered to prevent platelet aggregation, which impedes blood flow.

Aspirin. Aspirin prevents platelet activation and reduces the incidence of MI and death in patients with CAD. A 160 - to $325-\mathrm{mg}$ dose of aspirin should be given to the patient with angina as soon as the diagnosis is made (eg, in the emergency room or physician's office) and then continued with 81 to 325 mg daily. Although it may be one of the most important medications in the treatment of CAD, aspirin may be overlooked because of its low cost and common use. Patients should be advised to continue aspirin even if concurrently taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other analgesics. Because aspirin may cause gastrointestinal upset and bleeding, treatment of Helicobacter pylori and the use of H 2 -blockers (eg, cimetidine [Tagamet], famotidine [Mylanta AR, Pepcid], ranitidine [Zantac]) or misoprostol (Cytotec) should be considered to allow continued aspirin therapy.

Clopidogrel and Ticlopidine. Clopidogrel (Plavix) or ticlopidine (Ticlid) is given to patients who are allergic to aspirin or given in addition to aspirin in patients at high risk for MI. Unlike aspirin, these medications take a few days to achieve their antiplatelet effect. They also cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and they decrease the neutrophil level.

Heparin. Unfractionated heparin prevents the formation of new blood clots. Use of heparin alone in treating patients with unstable angina reduces the occurrence of MI. If the patient's signs and symptoms indicate a significant risk for a cardiac event, the patient is hospitalized and may be given an intravenous bolus of heparin and started on a continuous infusion or given an intravenous bolus every 4 to 6 hours. The amount of heparin administered is based on the results of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Heparin therapy is usually considered therapeutic when the aPTT is 1.5 to 2 times the normal aPTT value.

A subcutaneous injection of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; enoxaparin [Lovenox] or dalteparin [Fragmin]) may be used instead of intravenous unfractionated heparin to treat patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation MIs. LMWH provides more effective and stable anticoagulation, potentially reducing the risk of rebound ischemic events, and it eliminates the need to monitor aPTT results (Cohen, 2001). LMWH may be beneficial before and during PCIs and for STsegment elevation MIs.

Because unfractionated heparin and LMWH increase the risk of bleeding, the patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of external and internal bleeding, such as low blood pressure, an increased heart rate, and a decrease in serum hemoglobin and hematocrit values. The patient receiving heparin is placed on bleeding precautions, which include:
- Applying pressure to the site of any needle puncture for a longer time than usual
- Avoiding intramuscular injections
- Avoiding tissue injury and bruising from trauma or use of constrictive devices (eg, continuous use of an automatic blood pressure cuff)

A decrease in platelet count or skin lesions at heparin injection sites may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an antibody-mediated reaction to heparin that may result in thrombosis (Hirsh et al., 2001). Patients who have received heparin within the past 3 months and those who have been receiving unfractionated heparin for 5 to 15 days are at high risk for HIT.

GPIIb/IIIa Agents. Intravenous GPIIb/IIIa agents (abciximab [ReoPro], tirofiban [Aggrastat], eptifibatide [Integrelin]) are indicated for hospitalized patients with unstable angina and as adjunct therapy for PCI. These agents prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet, preventing adhesion of fibrinogen and other factors that crosslink platelets to each other and thereby allow platelets to form a thrombus (clot). As with heparin, bleeding is the major side effect, and bleeding precautions should be initiated.

Oxygen Administration. Oxygen therapy is usually initiated at the onset of chest pain in an attempt to increase the amount of oxygen delivered to the myocardium and to decrease pain. Oxygen inhaled directly increases the amount of oxygen in the blood. The therapeutic effectiveness of oxygen is determined by observing the rate and rhythm of respirations. Blood oxygen saturation is monitored by pulse oximetry; the normal oxygen saturation $\left(\mathrm{SpO}_{2}\right)$ level is greater than $93 \%$. Studies are being conducted to assess the use of oxygen in patients without respiratory distress and its effect on outcome.

\section*{ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES}

Researchers have reported significant improvement in the exercise endurance of patients with angina who were treated with
acupuncture as well as with an intravenous infusion of a combination of ginseng (Panax quinquefolium), astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus), and angelica (Angelica sinensis) (Ballegaard et al., 1991; Reichter et al., 1991). Coenzyme Q10 was advocated for preventing the occurrence and progression of heart failure (Khatta et al., 2000). However, there have not been large, randomized, placebocontrolled studies that identify the direct beneficial effect from these therapies.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH ANGINA PECTORIS}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse gathers information about the patient's symptoms and activities, especially those that precede and precipitate attacks of angina pectoris. Appropriate questions are identified in Table 28-4, using a PQRST format. Other helpful questions may be asked. How long does the angina usually last? Does nitroglycerin relieve the angina? If so, how many tablets or sprays are needed to achieve relief? How long does it takes for relief to occur?

The answers to these questions form a basis for designing a logical program of treatment and prevention. In addition to assessing angina pectoris or its equivalent, the nurse also assesses the patient's risk factors for CAD , the patient's response to angina, the patient's and family's understanding of the diagnosis, and adherence to the current treatment plan.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include:
- Ineffective myocardial tissue perfusion secondary to CAD, as evidenced by chest pain or equivalent symptoms
- Anxiety related to fear of death
- Deficient knowledge about the underlying disease and methods for avoiding complications
- Noncompliance, ineffective management of therapeutic regimen related to failure to accept necessary lifestyle changes

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications that may develop include the following, which are discussed in the chapters indicated:
- Acute pulmonary edema (see Chap. 30)
- Congestive heart failure (see Chap. 30)
- Cardiogenic shock (see Chap. 30)
- Dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest (see Chaps. 27 and 30)
- MI (described later in this chapter)
- Myocardial rupture (see Chap. 30)
- Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade (see Chap. 30)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major patient goals include immediate and appropriate treatment when angina occurs, prevention of angina, reduction of anxiety, awareness of the disease process and understanding of the prescribed care, adherence to the self-care program, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{TREATING ANGINA}

If the patient reports pain (or the individual's equivalent to pain), the nurse takes immediate action. When a patient experiences angina, the nurse should direct the patient to stop all activities and sit or rest in bed in a semi-Fowler position to reduce the oxygen requirements of the ischemic myocardium. The nurse assesses the patient's angina, asking questions to determine whether the angina is the same as the patient typically experiences. A difference may indicate a worsening of the disease or a different cause. The nurse then continues to assess the patient, measuring vital signs and observing for signs of respiratory distress. If the patient is in the hospital, a 12-lead ECG is usually obtained and scrutinized for ST -segment and T -wave changes. If the patient has been placed on cardiac monitoring with continuous ST-segment monitoring, the ST segment is assessed for changes.

Nitroglycerin is administered sublingually, and the patient's response is assessed (relief of chest pain and effect on blood pressure and heart rate). If the chest pain is unchanged or is lessened but still present, nitroglycerin administration is repeated up to three doses.

Each time, blood pressure, heart rate, and the ST segment (if the patient is on a monitor with ST segment monitoring capability) are assessed. The nurse administers oxygen therapy if the patient's respiratory rate is increased or the oxygen saturation level is decreased. Although there is no documentation of its effect on outcome, oxygen is usually administered at $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ by nasal cannula, even without evidence of respiratory distress. If the pain is significant and continues after these interventions, the patient is usually transferred to a higher-acuity nursing unit.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Patients with angina often fear loss of their roles within society and the family. They may also be fearful that the pain may lead to an MI or death. Exploring the implications that the diagnosis has for the patient and providing information about the illness, its treatment, and methods of preventing its progression are important nursing interventions. Various stress reduction methods should be explored with the patient. For example, music therapy, in which patients are given the opportunity to listen to selected music through headphones for a predetermined duration, has been shown to reduce anxiety in patients who are in a coronary care unit and may serve as an adjunct to therapeutic communication (Chlan \& Tracy, 1999; Evans, 2002). Addressing the spiritual needs of the patient and family may also assist in allaying anxieties and fears.

\section*{PREVENTING PAIN}

The nurse reviews the assessment findings, identifies the level of activity that causes the patient's pain, and plans the patient's activities accordingly. If the patient has pain frequently or with minimal activity, the nurse alternates the patient's activities with rest periods. Balance of activity and rest is an important aspect of the educational plan for the patient and family.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Learning about the modifiable risk factors that contribute to the continued development of CAD and resulting angina is essential. Exploring with the patient and
family what they see as their priority in managing the disease and developing a plan based on their priorities can assist with patient adherence to the therapeutic regimen. It is important to explore with the patient methods to avoid, modify, or adapt the triggers for anginal pain. The teaching program for the patient with angina is designed so that the patient and family can explain the illness, identify the symptoms of myocardial ischemia, state the actions to take when symptoms develop, and discuss methods to prevent chest pain and the advancement of CAD. The goals of the educational program are to reduce the frequency and severity of anginal attacks, to delay the progress of the underlying disease, if possible, and to prevent any complications. The factors outlined in the accompanying checklist Chart 28-5 are important in educating the patient with angina pectoris.

The self-care program is prepared in collaboration with the patient and family or friends. Activities should be planned to minimize the occurrence of angina episodes. The patient needs to understand that any pain unrelieved within 15 minutes by the usual methods (see Chart 28-4) should be treated at the closest emergency center; the patient should call 911 for assistance.

\section*{MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

MI refers to the process by which areas of myocardial cells in the heart are permanently destroyed. Like unstable angina, MI is usually caused by reduced blood flow in a coronary artery due to atherosclerosis and occlusion of an artery by an embolus or thrombus. Because unstable angina and acute MI are considered to be the same process but different points along a continuum, the term acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may be used for these diagnoses. Other causes of an MI include vasospasm (sudden constriction or narrowing) of a coronary artery; decreased oxygen supply (eg, from acute blood loss, anemia, or low blood pressure); and increased demand for oxygen (eg, from a rapid heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, or ingestion of cocaine). In each case, a profound imbalance exists between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.

Coronary occlusion, heart attack, and MI are terms used synonymously, but the preferred term is MI. The area of infarction takes time to develop. As the cells are deprived of oxygen, ischemia develops, cellular injury occurs, and over time, the lack of oxygen results in infarction, or the death of cells. The expression "time is muscle" reflects the urgency of appropriate treatment to improve patient outcomes. Each year in the United States, nearly 1 million people have acute MIs; one fourth of these people die of MI (American Heart Association, 2001; Ryan et al., 1999). One half of those who die never reach a hospital.

Various descriptions are used to further identify an MI: the location of the injury to the left ventricular wall (anterior, inferior, posterior, or lateral wall) or to the right ventricle and the point in time within the process of infarction (acute, evolving, or old).

The ECG usually identifies the location, and the ECG and patient history identify the timing. Regardless of the location of the infarction of cardiac muscle, the goal of medical therapy is to prevent or minimize myocardial tissue death and to prevent complications. The pathophysiology of heart disease and the risk factors involved are discussed earlier in this chapter.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Chest pain that occurs suddenly and continues despite rest and medication is the presenting symptom in most patients with an MI (Chart 28-6). One study showed that $2 \%$ of patients who eventually were diagnosed with an acute MI were incorrectly discharged and sent home from the emergency department (Pope et al., 2000). Most of these patients presented with atypical symptoms such as shortness of breath; they also tended to be female, younger than 55 years of age, of a minority group, and have normal ECGs. The Framingham Heart Study revealed that $50 \%$ of the men and $63 \%$ of the women who died suddenly of cardiovascular disease had no previous symptoms (Kannel, 1986). Patients may also be anxious and restless. They may have cool, pale, and moist skin. Their heart rate and respiratory rate may be faster than normal. These signs and symptoms, which are caused by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, may be present only for a short time or may not be present, or only some of them

\section*{Chart 28-6 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Signs and Symptoms of an Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) or Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)}

\section*{Cardiovascular}

Chest pain or discomfort, palpitations. Heart sounds may include $\mathrm{S}_{3}, \mathrm{~S}_{4}$, and new onset of a murmur. Increased jugular venous distention may be seen if the MI has caused heart failure. Blood pressure may be elevated because of sympathetic stimulation or decreased because of decreased contractility, impending cardiogenic shock, or medications. Pulse deficit may indicate atrial fibrillation. In addition to ST-segment and T-wave changes, ECG may show tachycardia, bradycardia, and dysrhythmias.

\section*{Respiratory}

Shortness of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, and crackles if MI has caused pulmonary congestion. Pulmonary edema may be present.

\section*{Gastrointestinal}

Nausea and vomiting.

\section*{Genitourinary}

Decreased urinary output may indicate cardiogenic shock.

\section*{Skin}

Cool, clammy, diaphoretic, and pale appearance due to sympathetic stimulation from loss of contractility may indicate cardiogenic shock. Dependent edema may also be present due to poor contractility.

\section*{Neurologic}

Anxiety, restlessness, light-headedness may indicate increased sympathetic stimulation or a decrease in contractility and cerebral oxygenation. The same symptoms may also herald cardiogenic shock. Headache, visual disturbances, altered speech, altered motor function, and further changes in level of consciousness may indicate cerebral bleeding if patient is receiving thrombolytics.

\section*{Psychological}

Fear with feeling of impending doom, or patient may deny that anything is wrong.
may occur. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of MI cannot be distinguished from those of unstable angina.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis of MI is generally based on the presenting symptoms, the ECG, and laboratory test results (eg, serial serum enzyme values). The prognosis depends on the severity of coronary artery obstruction and the extent of myocardial damage. Physical examination is always conducted, but the examination alone is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis.

\section*{PATIENT HISTORY}

The patient history has two parts: the description of the presenting symptom (eg, pain) and the history of previous illnesses and family health history, particularly of heart disease. Previous history should also include information about the patient's risk factors for heart disease.

\section*{ELECTROCARDIOGRAM}

The ECG provides information that assists in diagnosing acute MI. It should be obtained within 10 minutes from the time a patient reports pain or arrives in the emergency department. By monitoring the ECG over time, the location, evolution, and resolution of an MI can be identified and monitored.

The ECG changes that occur with an MI are seen in the leads that view the involved surface of the heart. The classic ECG changes are T -wave inversion, ST -segment elevation, and development of an abnormal Q wave (Fig. 28-4). Because infarction evolves over time, the ECG also changes over time. The first ECG signs of an acute MI are from myocardial ischemia and injury. Myocardial injury causes the T wave to become enlarged and symmetric. As the area of injury becomes ischemic, myocardial repolarization is altered and delayed, causing the T wave to invert. The ischemic region may remain depolarized while adjacent areas of the myocardium return to the resting state. Myocardial injury also causes ST-segment changes. The injured myocardial cells depolarize normally but repolarize more rapidly than normal cells, causing the ST segment to rise at least 1 mm above the isoelectric line (area between the T wave and the next P wave is used as the reference for the isoelectric line) when measured 0.08 seconds after the end of the QRS . If the myocardial injury is on the endocardial surface, the ST segment is depressed 1 mm or more for at least 0.08 seconds. The ST-segment depression is usually horizontal or has a downward slope (Wagner, 2001).

MI is classified as a Q-wave or non-Q-wave infarction. With Q-wave infarction, abnormal Q waves develop within 1 to 3 days because there is no depolarization current conducted from necrotic tissue (Wagner, 2001). The lead system then views the flow of current from other parts of the heart. An abnormal Q wave is 0.04 seconds or longer, $25 \%$ of the R -wave depth (provided the R wave exceeds a depth of 5 mm ), or one that did not exist before the event (Wagner, 2001). An acute MI may cause a significant decrease in the height of the R wave. During an acute MI, injury and ischemic changes are also present. An abnormal Q wave may be present without ST-segment and T-wave changes, which indicates an old, not acute, MI. Patients with non-Q-wave MIs do not develop a Q wave on the ECG after the ST-segment and T -wave changes, but symptoms and cardiac enzyme analysis confirm the diagnosis of an MI.

During recovery from an MI, the ST segment often is the first to return to normal ( 1 to 6 weeks). The $T$ wave becomes large and
symmetric for 24 hours, and it then inverts within 1 to 3 days for 1 to 2 weeks. Q-wave alterations are usually permanent. An old Qwave MI is usually indicated by an abnormal Q wave or decreased height of the R wave without ST-segment and T-wave changes.

\section*{ECHOCARDIOGRAM}

The echocardiogram is used to evaluate ventricular function. It may be used to assist in diagnosing an MI, especially when the ECG is nondiagnostic. The echocardiogram can detect hypokinetic and akinetic wall motion and can determine the ejection fraction (see Chap. 26).

\section*{LABORATORY TESTS}

Historically, laboratory tests used to diagnose an MI included creatine kinase (CK), with evaluation of isoenzymes and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Newer laboratory tests with faster results, resulting in earlier diagnosis, include myoglobin and troponin analysis. These tests are based on the release of cellular contents into the circulation when myocardial cells die. Table 28-5 shows the time courses of cardiac enzymes. An LDH test is now infrequently ordered because it is not useful in identifying cardiac events (Braunwald et al., 2000).

Creatine Kinase and Its Isoenzymes. There are three CK isoenzymes: CK-MM (skeletal muscle), CK-MB (heart muscle), and CK-BB (brain tissue). CK-MB is the cardiac-specific isoenzyme; CK-MB is found mainly in cardiac cells and therefore rises only when there has been damage to these cells. CK-MB assessed by mass assay is the most specific index for the diagnosis of acute MI (Braunwald et al., 2001). The level starts to increase within a few hours and peaks within 24 hours of an MI. If the area is reperfused (eg, due to thrombolytic therapy or PTCA), it peaks earlier.

Myoglobin. Myoglobin is a heme protein that helps to transport oxygen. Like CK-MB enzyme, myoglobin is found in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The myoglobin level starts to increase within 1 to 3 hours and peaks within 12 hours after the onset of symptoms.

The test takes only a few minutes to run. An increase in myoglobin is not very specific in indicating an acute cardiac event; however, negative results are an excellent parameter for ruling out an acute MI. If the first myoglobin test results are negative, the test may be repeated 3 hours later. Another negative test result confirms that the patient did not have an MI.

Troponin. Troponin, a protein found in the myocardium, regulates the myocardial contractile process. There are three isomers of troponin ( $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{I}$, and T ). Because of the smaller size of this protein and the increased specificity of the troponins I and T for cardiac muscle, these tests are used more frequently to identify myocardial injury (unstable angina or acute MI). The increase in the level of troponin in the serum starts and peaks at approximately the same time as CK-MB. However, it remains elevated for a longer period, often up to 3 weeks, and it therefore cannot be used to identify subsequent extension or expansion of an MI.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of medical management is to minimize myocardial damage, preserve myocardial function, and prevent complications. These goals are achieved by reperfusing the area with the emergency use of thrombolytic medications or PTCA. Minimizing myocardial damage is also accomplished by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and increasing oxygen supply with medications, oxygen administration, and bed rest. The resolution of pain and ECG changes are the primary clinical indicators that demand and supply are in equilibrium; they may also indicate reperfusion. Visualization of blood flow through an open vessel in the catheterization laboratory is evidence of reperfusion.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

The patient with an acute MI receives the same medications as the patient with unstable angina, with the possible additions of thrombolytics, analgesics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients should receive a beta-blocker initially, throughout the hospitalization, and a prescription to continue its use after hospital discharge.

Thrombolytics. Thrombolytics are medications that are usually administered intravenously, although some may also be given directly into the coronary artery in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (Chart 28-7). The purpose of thrombolytics is to dissolve and lyse the thrombus in a coronary artery (thrombolysis), allowing blood to flow through the coronary artery again (reperfusion), minimizing the size of the infarction, and preserving ventricular function. Even though thrombolytics may dissolve the thrombus, they do not affect the underlying atherosclerotic lesion. The patient may be referred for a cardiac catheterization and other invasive interventions.

Thrombolytics dissolve all clots, not just the one in the coronary artery. They should not be used if the patient has formed a protective clot, such as after major surgery or hemorrhagic stroke. Because thrombolytics reduce the patient's ability to form a stabilizing clot, the patient is at risk for bleeding. Thrombolytics should not be used if the patient is bleeding or has a bleeding disorder. All patients who receive thrombolytic therapy are placed on bleeding precautions to minimize the risk for bleeding. This means minimizing the number of punctures for inserting intravenous lines, avoiding intramuscular injections, preventing tissue trauma, and applying pressure for longer than usual after any puncture.

Administration of Thrombolytic Therapy
Indications
- Chest pain for longer than 20 minutes, unrelieved by nitroglycerin
- ST-segment elevation in at least two leads that face the same area of the heart
- Less than 24 hours from onset of pain

Absolute Contraindications
- Active bleeding
- Known bleeding disorder
- History of hemorrhagic stroke
- History of intracranial vessel malformation
- Recent major surgery or trauma
- Uncontrolled hypertension
- Pregnancy

Nursing Considerations
- Minimize the number of times the patient's skin is punctured.
- Avoid intramuscular injections.
- Draw blood for laboratory tests when starting the IV line.
- Start IV lines before thrombolytic therapy; designate one line to use for blood draws.
- Avoid continual use of noninvasive blood pressure cuff.
- Monitor for acute dysrhythmias, hypotension, and allergic reaction.
- Monitor for reperfusion: resolution of angina or acute ST-segment changes.
- Check for signs and symptoms of bleeding: decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin values, decrease in blood pressure, increase in heart rate, oozing or bulging at invasive procedure sites, back pain, muscle weakness, changes in level of consciousness, complaints of headache
- Treat major bleeding by discontinuing thrombolytic therapy and any anticoagulants; apply direct pressure and notify the physician immediately.
- Treat minor bleeding by applying direct pressure if accessible and appropriate; continue to monitor.

To be effective, thrombolytics must be administered as early as possible after the onset of symptoms that indicate an acute MI. They are not given to patients with unstable angina. Hospitals monitor their ability to administer these medications within 30 minutes from the time the patient arrives in the emergency department. This is called door-to-needle time (Ryan et al., 1999). The thrombolytic agents used most often are streptokinase (Kabikinase, Streptase), alteplase (Activase), and reteplase (r-PA, TNKase). Anistreplase (Eminase) is another thrombolytic agent that may be used.

Streptokinase increases the amount of plasminogen activator, which then increases the amount of circulating and clot-bound plasmin. Because streptokinase is made from a bacterium, its use also entails a risk of an allergic reaction. Vasculitis has occurred up to 9 days after administration. Streptokinase is not used if the patient has been exposed to a recent Streptococcus infection or has received streptokinase in the past 6 to 12 months.

Alteplase is a type of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). In contrast to streptokinase, alteplase activates the plasminogen on the clot more than the circulating plasminogen. Because it does not decrease the clotting factors as much as streptokinase, unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin is used with t-PA to prevent another clot from forming at the same lesion site. Because $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$ is a naturally occurring enzyme, allergic reactions are minimized, but t-PA costs considerably more than streptokinase.

Reteplase is structurally very similar to alteplase and has similar effects. Anistreplase is similar to streptokinase and has similar effects.

Analgesics. The analgesic of choice for acute MI is morphine sulfate (Duramorph, Astramorph) administered in intravenous boluses. Morphine reduces pain and anxiety. It reduces preload, which decreases the workload of the heart. Morphine also relaxes bronchioles to enhance oxygenation. The cardiovascular response to morphine is monitored carefully, particularly the blood pressure, which can be lowered, and the respiratory rate, which can be depressed. Because morphine decreases sensation of pain, STsegment monitoring may be a better indicator of subsequent ischemia than assessment of pain.

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I). Angiotensin I is formed when the kidneys release renin in response to decreased blood flow. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by ACE, a substance found in the lumen of all blood vessels, especially the pulmonary vasculature. Angiotensin II causes the blood vessels to constrict and the kidneys to retain sodium and fluid while excreting potassium. These actions increase circulating fluid and raise the pressure against which the heart must pump, resulting in significantly increased cardiac workload. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) prevent the conversion of angiotensin from I to II. In the absence of angiotensin II, the blood pressure decreases and the kidneys excrete sodium and fluid (diuresis), decreasing the oxygen demand of the heart. Use of ACE inhibitors in patients after MI decreases the mortality rate and prevents the onset of heart failure. It is important to ensure that the patient is not hypotensive, hyponatremic, hypovolemic, or hyperkalemic before ACE-I administration. Blood pressure, urine output, and serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels need to be monitored closely.

\section*{EMERGENT PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI)}

The patient in whom an acute $M I$ is suspected may be referred for an immediate PCI. PCI may be used to open the occluded coronary artery in an acute MI and promote reperfusion to the area that has been deprived of oxygen. PCI treats the underlying atherosclerotic lesion. Because the duration of oxygen deprivation is directly related to the number of cells that die, the time from the patient's
arrival in the emergency department to the time PCI is performed should be less than 60 minutes (time is muscle). This is frequently referred to as door-to-balloon time (Smith et al., 2001). To perform an emergent PCI within this short time, a cardiac catheterization laboratory and staff must be available.

\section*{Cardiac Rehabilitation}

After the MI patient is free of symptoms, an active rehabilitation program is initiated. Cardiac rehabilitation is a program that targets risk reduction by means of education, individual and group support, and physical activity. Most insurance programs, including Medicare, cover the cost of a cardiac rehabilitation program. However, some studies indicate that only $8 \%$ to $39 \%$ of patients who are candidates for cardiac rehabilitation services typically participate in these programs (Wenger et al., 1995; Williams et al., 2002).

The goals of rehabilitation for the patient with an MI are to extend and improve the quality of life. The immediate objectives are to limit the effects and progression of atherosclerosis, return the patient to work and a pre-illness lifestyle, enhance the psychosocial and vocational status of the patient, and prevent another cardiac event. These objectives are accomplished by encouraging physical activity and physical conditioning, educating patient and family, and providing counseling and behavioral interventions.

Throughout all phases of rehabilitation, the goals of activity and exercise tolerance are achieved through gradual physical conditioning, aimed at improving cardiac efficiency over time. Cardiac efficiency is achieved when work and activities of daily living can be performed at a lower heart rate and lower blood pressure, thereby reducing the heart's oxygen requirements and reducing cardiac workload.

Physical conditioning is achieved gradually over time. It is not unusual for patients to "overdo it" in an attempt to achieve their goals too rapidly. Patients are observed for chest pain, dyspnea, weakness, fatigue, and palpitations and are instructed to stop exercise if any of the symptoms develop. In a monitored program, they are also monitored for an increase in heart rate above the target heart rate, an increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure more than 20 mm Hg , a decrease in systolic blood pressure, onset or worsening of dysrhythmias, or ST-segment changes on the ECG.

The target heart rate in phase I is an increase of less than 10\% from the resting heart rate, or 120 beats per minute. In phase II, the target heart rate is based on the results of the patient's stress test (usually $60 \%$ to $85 \%$ of the heart rate at which symptoms occurred), medications, and underlying condition. Oxygen saturation may also be assessed to ensure that it remains higher than $93 \%$. If signs or symptoms occur, the patient is instructed to slow down or stop exercising. If the patient is exercising in an unmonitored program, he or she is cautioned to cease activity immediately if signs or symptoms occur and to seek appropriate medical attention. Table 28-6 identifies conditions in which an unmonitored home exercise program is not recommended.

Patients who are able to walk at 3 to 4 miles per hour are usually able to resume sexual activities. The nurse recommends that the patient be well rested and in a familiar setting; wait at least 1 hour after eating or drinking alcohol; and use a comfortable position. The patient is cautioned against anal sex. Sexual dysfunction or cardiac symptoms should be reported to the health care provider.

\section*{PHASES OF CARDIAC REHABILITATION}

Cardiac rehabilitation occurs along the continuum of the disease and is typically categorized in three phases. Phase I may begin with the diagnosis of atherosclerosis, which may occur when the

patient is admitted to the hospital for ACS (unstable angina, acute MI). It consists of low-level activities and initial education for the patient and family. Because of the brief hospital stay, mobilization occurs earlier, and patient teaching is prioritized to the essentials of self-care, rather than instituting behavioral changes for risk reduction. Priorities for in-hospital education include the signs and symptoms that indicate the need to call 911 (seek emergency assistance), the medication regimen, rest-activity balance, and follow-up appointments with the physician. The nurse needs to reassure the patient that, although CAD is a lifelong disease and must be treated as such, most patients can resume a normal life after an MI. This positive approach while in the hospital helps to motivate and teach the patient to continue the education and lifestyle changes that are usually needed after discharge. The amount of activity recommended at discharge depends on the age of the patient, his or her condition before the cardiac event, the extent of the disease, the course of the hospital stay, and the development of any complications.

Phase II occurs after the patient has been discharged. It usually lasts for 4 to 6 weeks but may last up to 6 months. This outpatient program consists of supervised, often ECG-monitored, exercise training that is individualized based on the results of an exercise stress test. Support and guidance related to the treatment of the disease and education and counseling related to lifestyle modification for risk factor reduction are a significant part of this phase. Short-term and long-range goals are collaboratively determined based on the patient's needs. At each session, the patient is assessed for the effectiveness of and adherence to the current medical plan. To prevent complications and another hospitalization, the cardiac rehabilitation staff alerts the referring physician to any problems. Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs are designed to encourage patients and families to support each other. Many programs offer support sessions for spouses and significant others while the patients exercise. The programs involve group educational sessions for both patients and families that are given by cardiologists, exercise physiologists, dietitians, nurses, and other health care professionals. These sessions may take place outside a traditional classroom setting. For instance, a dietitian may take a group of patients and their families to a grocery store to examine labels and meat selections or to a restaurant to discuss menu offerings for a "heart-healthy" diet.

Phase III focuses on maintaining cardiovascular stability and long-term conditioning. The patient is usually self-directed during this phase and does not require a supervised program, although it may be offered. The goals of each phase build on the accomplishments of the previous phase.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION}

\section*{Assessment}

One of the most important aspects of care of the patient with an MI is the assessment. It establishes the baseline for the patient so that any deviations may be identified, systematically identifies the patient's needs, and helps determine the priority of those needs. Systematic assessment includes a careful history, particularly as it relates to symptoms: chest pain or discomfort, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), palpitations, unusual fatigue, faintness (syncope), or sweating (diaphoresis). Each symptom must be evaluated with regard to time, duration, the factors that precipitate the symptom and relieve it, and comparison with previous symptoms. A precise and complete physical assessment is critical to detect complications and any change in patient status. Chart 28-6 identifies important assessments and possible findings.

Intravenous sites are examined frequently. At least one and possibly two intravenous lines are placed for any patient with ACS to ensure that access is available for administering emergency medications. Medications are administered intravenously to achieve rapid onset and to allow for timely adjustment. Intramuscular medications are avoided because of unpredictable absorption, delayed effect, and the risk of causing elevated serum enzyme levels by injuring muscle cells with an injection. After the patient's condition stabilizes, the intravenous line may be changed into a saline lock to maintain intravenous access.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the clinical manifestations, history, and diagnostic assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include:
- Ineffective cardiopulmonary tissue perfusion related to reduced coronary blood flow from coronary thrombus and atherosclerotic plaque
- Potential impaired gas exchange related to fluid overload from left ventricular dysfunction
- Potential altered peripheral tissue perfusion related to decreased cardiac output from left ventricular dysfunction
- Anxiety related to fear of death
- Deficient knowledge about post-MI self-care

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Acute pulmonary edema (see Chap. 30)
- Heart failure (see Chap. 30)
- Cardiogenic shock (see Chap. 30)
- Dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest (see Chaps. 27 and 30)
- Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade (see Chap. 30)
- Myocardial rupture (see Chap. 30)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals of the patient include relief of pain or ischemic signs and symptoms (eg, ST-segment changes), prevention of further myocardial damage, absence of respiratory dysfunction, maintenance or attainment of adequate tissue perfusion by decreasing the heart's workload, reduced anxiety, adherence to the self-care program, and absence or early recognition of complications. Care of the patient with an uncomplicated MI is summarized in the Plan of Nursing Care on pages 731-733.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND OTHER SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ISCHEMIA}

Balancing the cardiac oxygen supply with its oxygen demand (eg, as evidenced by the relief of chest pain) is the top priority for the patient with an acute MI. Although medication therapy is required to accomplish this goal, nursing interventions are also important. Collaboration among the patient, nurse, and physician is critical in assessing the patient's response to therapy and in altering the interventions accordingly.

The accepted method for relieving symptoms associated with MI is revascularization with thrombolytic therapy or emergent PCI for patients who present to the health care facility immediately and who have no major contraindications. These therapies are important because, in addition to relieving symptoms, they aid in minimizing or avoiding permanent injury to the myocardium. With or without revascularization, administration of aspirin, intravenous beta-blocker, and nitroglycerin is indicated. Use of a GPIIb/IIIa agent or heparin may also be indicated. The nurse administers morphine for relief of pain and other symptoms, anxiety, and reduction of preload.

Oxygen should be administered along with medication therapy to assist with relief of symptoms. Administration of oxygen even in low doses raises the circulating level of oxygen to reduce pain associated with low levels of myocardial oxygen. The route of administration, usually by nasal cannula, and the oxygen flow rate are documented. A flow rate of 2 to $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ is usually adequate to maintain oxygen saturation levels of $96 \%$ to $100 \%$ if no other disease is present.

Vital signs are assessed frequently as long as the patient is experiencing pain and other signs or symptoms of acute ischemia. Physical rest in bed with the backrest elevated or in a cardiac chair helps to decrease chest discomfort and dyspnea. Elevation of the head is beneficial for the following reasons:
- Tidal volume improves because of reduced pressure from abdominal contents on the diaphragm and better lung expansion and gas exchange.
- Drainage of the upper lung lobes improves.
- Venous return to the heart (preload) decreases, which reduces the work of the heart.

\section*{IMPROVING RESPIRATORY FUNCTION}

Regular and careful assessment of respiratory function can help the nurse detect early signs of pulmonary complications. Scrupulous attention to fluid volume status prevents overloading the heart and lungs. Encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and change position frequently helps keep fluid from pooling in the bases of the lungs.

\section*{PROMOTING ADEQUATE TISSUE PERFUSION}

Limiting the patient to bed or chair rest during the initial phase of treatment is particularly helpful in reducing myocardial oxygen consumption ( $\mathrm{m} \dot{\mathrm{V}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ ). This limitation should remain until the patient is pain-free and hemodynamically stable. Checking skin temperature and peripheral pulses frequently is important to ensure adequate tissue perfusion. Oxygen may be administered to enrich the supply of circulating oxygen.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Alleviating anxiety and fears is an important nursing function to reduce the sympathetic stress response. Decreased sympathetic stimulation decreases the workload of the heart, which may relieve pain and other signs and symptoms of ischemia.

Developing a trusting and caring relationship with the patient is critical in reducing anxiety. Providing information to the patient and family in an honest and supportive manner invites the patient to be a partner in care and greatly assists in developing a positive relationship. Ensuring a quiet environment, preventing interruptions that disturb sleep, using a caring and appropriate touch, teaching the patient the relaxation response, using humor and assisting the patient to laugh, and providing the appropriate prayer book and assisting the patient to pray if consistent with the patient's beliefs are other nursing interventions that can be used to reduce anxiety. Frequent opportunities are provided for the patient to privately share concerns and fears. An atmosphere of acceptance helps the patient to know that these concerns and fears are both realistic and normal. Music therapy, in which the patient listens to selected music for a predetermined duration and at a set time, has been found to be an effective method for reducing anxiety and managing stress (Chlan \& Tracy, 1999; Evans, 2002). Pet therapy, in which animals are brought to the patient, appears to provide emotional support and reduce anxiety. Administrative and infectious control practitioners are usually involved in developing standards for the animals, animal handlers, and patients who are eligible for pet therapy.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Complications that can occur after acute MI are caused by the damage that occurs to the myocardium and to the conduction system as a result of the reduced coronary blood flow. Because these complications can be lethal, close monitoring for and early identification of the signs and symptoms is critical (see Plan of Nursing Care, pp. 731-733).

The nurse monitors the patient closely for changes in cardiac rate and rhythm, heart sounds, blood pressure, chest pain, respiratory status, urinary output, skin color and temperature, sensorium, ECG changes, and laboratory values. Any changes in the patient's condition are reported promptly to the physician, and emergency measures are instituted when necessary.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The most effective way to increase the probability the patient will implement a self-care regimen after discharge is to identify the

Nursing Interventions
Rationale
Expected Outcomes
Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective cardiopulmonary tissue perfusion related to reduced coronary blood flow
Goal: Relief of chest pain/discomfort
1. Initially assess, document, and report to the physician the following:
a. The patient's description of chest discomfort, including location, intensity, radiation, duration, and factors that affect it. Other symptoms such as nausea, diaphoresis, or complaints of unusual fatigue.
b. The effect of chest discomfort on cardiovascular perfusion-to the heart (eg, change in blood pressure, heart sounds), to the brain (eg, changes in LOC), to the kidneys (eg, decrease in urine output), and to the skin (eg, color, temperature).
2. Obtain a 12-lead ECG recording during the symptomatic event, as prescribed, to determine extension of infarction.
3. Administer oxygen as prescribed.
4. Administer medication therapy as prescribed and evaluate the patient's response continuously.
5. Ensure physical rest: use of the bedside commode with assistance; backrest elevated to promote comfort; diet as tolerated; arms supported during upper extremity activity; use of stool softener to prevent straining at stool. Provide a restful environment, and allay fears and anxiety by being supportive, calm, and competent. Individualized visitation, based on patient response.
1. These data assist in determining the cause and effect of the chest discomfort and provide a baseline with which post-therapy symptoms can be compared.
a. There are many conditions associated with chest discomfort. There are characteristic clinical findings of ischemic pain and symptoms.
b. MI decreases myocardial contractility and ventricular compliance and may produce dysrhythmias. Cardiac output is reduced, resulting in reduced blood pressure and decreased organ perfusion. The heart rate may increase as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output.
2. An ECG during symptoms may be useful in the diagnosis of an extension of MI.
3. Oxygen therapy may increase the oxygen supply to the myocardium if actual oxygen saturation is less than normal.
4. Medication therapy is the first line of defense in preserving myocardial tissue. The side effects of these medications can be hazardous and the patient's status must be assessed.
5. Physical rest reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Fear and anxiety precipitate the stress response; this results in increased levels of endogenous catecholamines, which increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Also, with increased epinephrine, the pain threshold is decreased, and pain increases myocardial oxygen consumption.

Nursing Diagnosis: Potential ineffective air exchange related to fluid overload
Goal: Absence of respiratory difficulties
1. Initially, every 4 hours, and with chest discomfort or symptoms, assess, document, and report to the physician abnormal heart sounds (particularly $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ gallops and the holosystolic murmur of left ventricular papillary muscle dysfunction), abnormal breath sounds (particularly crackles), and patient intolerance to specific activities.
1. These data are useful in diagnosing left ventricular failure. Diastolic filling sounds ( $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ gallop) result from decreased left ventricular compliance associated with MI. Papillary muscle dysfunction (from infarction of the papillary muscle) can result in mitral regurgitation and a reduction in stroke volume, leading to left ventricular failure. The presence of crackles (usually at the lung bases) may indicate pulmonary

1. Initially, every 4 hours, and with chest discomfort, assess, document, and report to the physician the following:
a. Hypotension
b. Tachycardia and other dysrhythmia
c. Activity intolerance
d. Mentation changes (use family input)
e. Reduced urine output (less than 200 mL per 8 hours)
f. Cool, moist, cyanotic extremities
1. These data are useful in determining a low cardiac output state. An ECG with pain may be useful in the diagnosis of an extension of myocardial ischemia, injury, and infarction, and of variant angina.
- Blood pressure within the patient's normal range
- Ideally, normal sinus rhythm without dysrhythmia is maintained, or patient's baseline rhythm is maintained between 60 and 100 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ without further dysrhythmia.
- No complaints of fatigue with prescribed activity

- Extremities warm and dry with normal color

Nursing Diagnosis: Anxiety related to fear of death, change in health status
Goal: Reduction of anxiety
1. Assess, document, and report to the physician the patient's and family's level of anxiety and coping mechanisms.
1. These data provide information about the psychological well-being and a baseline so that post-therapy symptoms can be compared. Causes of anxiety are variable and individual, and may include acute illness, hospitalization, pain, disruption of activities of daily living at home and at work, changes in role and self-image due to chronic illness, and lack of financial support. Because anxious family members can transmit anxiety to the patient, the nurse must also identify strategies to reduce the family's fear and anxiety.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
2. Assess the need for spiritual counseling and refer as appropriate.
3. Allow patient (and family) to express anxiety and fear:
a. By showing genuine interest and concern
b. By facilitating communication (listening, reflecting, guiding)
c. By answering questions
4. Use of flexible visiting hours allows the presence of a supportive family to assist in reducing the patient's level of anxiety.
5. Encourage active participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program.
6. Teach stress reduction techniques.

\section*{Rationale}
2. If a patient finds support in a religion, religious counseling may assist in reducing anxiety and fear.
3. Unresolved anxiety (the stress response) increases myocardial oxygen consumption.
4. The presence of supportive family members may reduce both patient's and family's anxiety.
5. Prescribed cardiac rehabilitation may help to eliminate fear of death, reduce anxiety, and enhance feelings of wellbeing.
6. Stress reduction may help to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and may enhance feelings of well-being.

\section*{Invasive Coronary Artery Procedures}

\section*{INVASIVE INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES}

Angina pectoris may persist for many years in a stable form with brief attacks. However, unstable angina is a serious condition that can progress to MI or sudden cardiac death (ACS). Invasive interventional procedures to treat angina and CAD are PTCA, intracoronary stent implantation, atherectomy, brachytherapy, and transmyocardial laser revascularization. All of these procedures are classified as percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs).

\section*{Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA)}

PTCA may be used to treat patients who do not experience angina but are at high risk for a cardiac event as identified by noninvasive testing, with recurrent chest pain that is unresponsive to medical therapy, with a significant amount of myocardium at risk but are poor surgical candidates, or with an acute MI (as an alternate to thrombolysis and after thrombolysis) (Smith et al., 2001). The procedure is attempted when the cardiologist believes that PTCA can improve blood flow to the myocardium. PTCA alone is seldom attempted in the patient with occlusions of the left main coronary artery that do not demonstrate collateral circulation to the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries. The purpose of PTCA is to improve blood flow within a coronary artery by "cracking" the atheroma.

This invasive interventional procedure is carried out in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The coronary arteries are examined by angiography, as they are during the diagnostic cardiac catheterization, and the location, extent, and calcification of the atheroma are verified. Hollow catheters, called sheaths, are inserted, usually in the femoral vein or artery (or both), providing a conduit for other catheters. After the presence of atheroma is verified, a balloon-tipped dilation catheter is passed through the sheath along a guide catheter and positioned over the lesion. The physician determines the catheter position by examining markers on the balloon that can be seen with fluoroscopy. When the catheter is properly positioned, the balloon is inflated with a radiopaque contrast agent (commonly called dye) to visualize the

To extend and improve the quality of life, a patient who has had an MI must learn to adjust his or her lifestyle to promote heart-healthy living. With this in mind, the nurse and patient develop a program to help the patient achieve desired outcomes.

\section*{Changing Lifestyle During Convalescence and Healing}

Adaptation to a heart attack is an ongoing process and usually requires some modification of lifestyle. Some specific modifications include:
- Avoiding any activity that produces chest pain, extreme dyspnea, or undue fatigue
- Avoiding extremes of heat and cold and walking against the wind
- Losing weight, if indicated
- Stopping smoking and use of tobacco; avoiding second-hand smoke
- Using personal strengths to support lifestyle changes
- Developing heart-healthy eating patterns and avoiding large meals and hurrying while eating
- Modifying meals to align with the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) or the Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) diet
- Adhering to medical regimen, especially in taking medications
- Following recommendations that ensure blood pressure and blood glucose are in control
- Pursuing activities that relieve and reduce stress

\section*{Adopting an Activity Program}

Additionally, the patient needs to undertake an orderly program of increasing activity and exercise for long-term rehabilitation as follows:
- Engaging in a regimen of physical conditioning with a gradual increase in activity duration and then a gradual increase in activity intensity
- Walking daily, increasing distance and time as prescribed
- Monitoring pulse rate during physical activity until the maximum level of activity is attained
- Avoiding activities that tense the muscles: isometric exercise, weight-lifting, any activity that requires sudden bursts of energy
- Avoiding physical exercise immediately after a meal
- Alternating activity with rest periods (some fatigue is normal and expected during convalescence)
- Participating in a daily program of exercise that develops into a program of regular exercise for a lifetime

\section*{Managing Symptoms}

The patient must learn to recognize and take appropriate action for possible recurrences of symptoms as follows:
- Call 911 if chest pressure or pain (or anginal equivalent) is not relieved in 15 minutes by nitroglycerin
- Contacting the physician if any of the following occur: shortness of breath, fainting, slow or rapid heartbeat, swelling of feet and ankles
blood vessel and to provide a steady or oscillating pressure within the balloon. The balloon is inflated to a certain pressure for several seconds and then deflated. The pressure "cracks" and possibly compresses the atheroma (Fig. 28-5). The coronary artery's media and adventitia are also stretched.

Several inflations and several balloon sizes may be required to achieve the desired goal, usually defined as an improvement in blood flow and a residual stenosis of less than $20 \%$. Other gauges of the success of a PTCA are an increase in the artery's lumen, a difference of less than 20 mm Hg in blood pressure from one side

of the lesion to the other, and no clinically obvious arterial trauma. Because the blood supply to the coronary artery decreases while the balloon is inflated, the patient may complain of chest pain (often called stretch pain), and the ECG may display significant ST-segment changes (Jeremias et al., 1998).

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

Possible complications during the PTCA procedure include dissection, perforation, abrupt closure, or vasospasm of the coronary artery, acute MI, acute dysrhythmias (eg, ventricular tachycardia), and cardiac arrest. These may require emergency surgical treatment. Complications after the procedure may include abrupt closure and vascular complications, such as bleeding at the insertion site, retroperitoneal bleeding, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, or arterial thrombosis and distal embolization (Table 28-7).

\section*{POSTPROCEDURE CARE}

Patient care is similar to that for a cardiac catheterization (see Chapter 26). Many patients are admitted to the hospital the day of the PTCA. Those with no complications go home the next day. During the PTCA, patients receive large amounts of heparin and are monitored closely for signs of bleeding. Most patients also receive intravenous nitroglycerin for a period after the procedure to prevent arterial spasm.

Hemostasis is usually achieved and sheaths are pulled immediately at the end of the procedure by using a vascular closure device (eg, Angio-Seal, VasoSeal, Duett, Syvek patch) or a device that sutures the vessels (Prostar, Perclose). Hemostasis after sheath removal may also be achieved by direct manual pressure, a mechanical compression device (eg, C-shaped clamp), or a pneumatic compression device (eg, FemStop).

The patient may return to the nursing unit with the large peripheral vascular access sheaths in place. The sheaths are removed
after blood studies (eg, activated clotting time) indicate that the clotting time is within an acceptable range. This usually takes a few hours, depending on the amount of heparin given during the procedure. The patient must remain flat in bed and keep the affected leg straight until the sheaths are removed and then for a few hours after to maintain hemostasis. Because the immobility and bed rest usually cause the patient significant discomfort, treatment includes analgesics and sedation.

Several nursing interventions frequently used as part of the standard of care, such as applying a sandbag to the sheath insertion site, have not been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of bleeding (Christensen et al., 1998; Juran et al., 1999). The method used to achieve hemostasis determines the length of time needed to achieve hemostasis, the duration of bed rest, and the risk of complications (Brachmann et al., 1998; Lehmann et al., 1999; Walker et al., 2001). Sheath removal and the application of pressure on the vessel insertion site may cause the heart rate to slow and the blood pressure to decrease (vasovagal response). An intravenous bolus of atropine is usually used to treat these side effects.

Some patients with unstable lesions and at high risk for abrupt vessel closure are restarted on heparin after sheath removal, or they receive an intravenous infusion of a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor. These patients are monitored more closely and progressed more slowly.

After hemostasis is achieved, patients usually can be weaned from the intravenous medications, resume self-care, and ambulate unassisted within 1 to 12 hours of the procedure. The duration of immobilization depends on the size of the sheath inserted, the amount of anticoagulant administered, the method of hemostasis, the patient's underlying condition, and the physician's preference. The nurse teaches the patient to monitor the site for bleeding or development of a hard lump that is larger than a walnut. Most patients can return to their usual activities of daily living.

\section*{Coronary Artery Stent}

After PTCA, a portion of the plaque that was not removed may block the artery. The coronary artery may recoil (constrict) and the tissue remodels, increasing the risk for restenosis (Apple \& Lindsay, 2000). A coronary artery stent is placed to overcome these risks. A stent is a woven mesh that provides structural support to a vessel at risk of acute closure. The stent is placed over the angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the mesh expands and presses against the vessel wall, holding the artery open. The balloon is withdrawn, but the stent is left permanently in place within the artery (Fig. 286). Eventually, endothelium covers the stent and it is incorporated into the vessel wall. Because of the risk of thrombus formation in the stent, the patient receives antiplatelet medications (eg, clopidogrel [Plavix] therapy for 2 weeks and lifetime use of aspirin). Some stents have medication which may minimize the formation of thrombi or excessive scar tissue. It is estimated that $50 \%$ to $80 \%$ of all PCIs involve implanting at least one stent (Braunwald et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2001). Stents may be used in conjunction with PTCA or independently as a PCI. Use of stents without PTCA may decrease procedure time, use of the potentially nephrotoxic contrast agent, radiation exposure, and cost (Apple \& Lindsay, 2000). Care of the patient after coronary artery stent placement is the same as for a patient after PTCA.

\section*{Atherectomy}

Atherectomy is an invasive interventional procedure that involves the removal of the atheroma, or plaque, from a coronary artery (Smith et al., 2001). Directional (DCA) and transluminal extraction (TEC) coronary atherectomy procedures involve the use of a catheter that removes the lesion and its fragments. Rotational atherectomy uses a catheter with diamond chips impregnated on the tip (called a burr) that rotates like a dentist's drill at 130,000 to $180,000 \mathrm{rpm}$, pulverizing the lesion (Braunwald et al., 2001). Usually, several passes of these catheters are needed to achieve satisfactory results. Postprocedural patient care is the same as for a patient after PTCA.

\section*{Brachytherapy}

PTCA and stent implantation cause a cellular reaction in the coronary artery that promotes proliferation of the intima of the
artery, which also increases the possibility of arterial obstruction. Brachytherapy reduces the recurrence of obstruction, preventing vessel restenosis by inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation (Leon et al., 2001). Brachytherapy (from the Greek word, brachys, meaning short) involves the delivery of gamma or beta radiation by placing a radioisotope close to the lesion (Teirstein \& Kuntz, 2001). The radioisotope may be delivered by a catheter or implanted with the stent. Long-term studies are needed to identify if the beneficial effects of radiation therapy are sustained and to determine the optimal dose and type of isotope to use for brachytherapy.

\section*{Transmyocardial Revascularization}

Patients who have cardiac ischemia and who are not candidates for CABG may benefit from transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) (Burkhoff et al., 1999). The procedure may be performed percutaneously in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (percutaneous transmyocardial revascularization [PTMR]) or through a midsternal or thoracotomy incision in the operating room (Acorda et al., 2000). The tip of a fiberoptic catheter is held firmly against the ischemic area of the heart while a laser burns a channel into but not through the muscle. If the procedure is percutaneous, the catheter is positioned inside the ventricle. If the procedure is surgical, the catheter is positioned on the outer surface of the ventricle. Each procedure usually involves making 20 to 40 channels. It is thought that some blood flows into the channels, decreasing the ischemia directly. Within the next few days to months, the channels close as a result of the body's inflammatory process of healing a wound (Platek \& Atzori, 1999). The long-term result is the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) during the inflammatory process that follows the laser burns (Anderson, 2000; Braunwald et al., 2001; Fuster et al., 2001; Hayden, 1998; Platek, \& Atzori, 1999). The new blood vessels provide enough blood to decrease the symptoms of cardiac ischemia. Nursing care before, during, and after the procedure depends on the approach: if the approach was percutaneous, the patient care is the same as following a PTCA; if the approach was surgical, the patient care is the same as following CABG.

\section*{SURGICAL PROCEDURES}

\section*{Coronary Artery Revascularization}

Advances in diagnostics, medical management, surgical and anesthesia techniques, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), as well as the care provided in critical care and surgical units, home care, and rehabilitation programs, have helped make surgery a viable treatment option for patients with cardiac disease. CAD has been treated by some form of myocardial revascularization since the 1960s; the most common CABG techniques have been performed for approximately 35 years. CABG is a surgical procedure in which a blood vessel from another part of the body is grafted to the occluded coronary artery so that blood can flow beyond the occlusion; it is also called a bypass graft.

Candidates for CABG are usually patients with the following conditions (Eagle et al., 1999):
- Angina that cannot be controlled by medical therapies
- Unstable angina
- A positive exercise tolerance test and lesions or blockage that cannot be treated by PCI
- A left main coronary artery lesion or blockage of more than 60\%
- Blockage of two or three coronary arteries, one of which is the proximal left anterior descending artery
- Left ventricular dysfunction with blockages in two or more coronary arteries
- Complications from or unsuccessful PCIs

For a patient to be considered for CABG, the coronary arteries to be bypassed must have at least a $70 \%$ occlusion ( $60 \%$ if it is the left main coronary artery). If the lesion involves less than $70 \%$ of the artery, enough blood can flow through the blocked artery to prevent adequate blood flow through the bypass graft. As a result, the graft would clot, effectively negating the surgery.

The vessel most commonly used for CABG is the greater saphenous vein, followed by the lesser saphenous vein (Fig. 28-7). Cephalic and basilic veins are used also. The vein is removed from the leg (or arm) and grafted to the ascending aorta and to the coronary artery distal to the lesion. The saphenous veins are used in emergency CABG procedures because they can be obtained by one surgical team while another team performs the chest surgery. One side effect of using a large vein is edema, which may develop in the extremity from which it was taken. The degree of edema varies and may diminish over time. Approximately 5 to 10 years after CABG, symptomatic atherosclerotic changes develop in saphenous veins used for grafting. In arm veins, the same changes develop more quickly, approximately 3 to 6 years after the surgery.

The right and left internal mammary arteries and, occasionally, radial arteries are also used for CABG. Arterial grafts are preferred to vein grafts because they do not develop atherosclerotic changes as quickly and remain patent longer. In general, the surgeon leaves the proximal end of the mammary artery intact and detaches the distal end of the artery from the chest wall. This distal end of the artery is then grafted to the coronary artery distal to the occlusion. Disadvantages of using the internal mammary arteries are that they may not be long enough or wide enough for the bypass and ulnar nerve damage may result.

The gastroepiploic artery (located along the greater curvature of the stomach) may also be used, although it does not respond as well when used as a graft. It has a more extensive blood supply to its wall than the internal mammary arteries, making dissection from the stomach difficult and increasing the potential for injury

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
and ischemia of the graft. Use of the gastroepiploic artery requires the surgeon to extend the chest incision to the abdomen, thereby exposing the patient to the additional risks of an abdominal incision and infection at the surgical site from contamination by the gastrointestinal tract.

\section*{TRADITIONAL CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT}

The traditional CABG procedure is performed with the patient under general anesthesia. Usually, the surgeon makes a median sternotomy incision and connects the patient to the CPB machine. Next, a blood vessel from another part of the patient's body (eg, saphenous vein, left internal mammary artery) is grafted distal to the coronary artery lesion, bypassing the obstruction (Fig. 28-8). CPB is then discontinued and the incision is closed. The patient then is admitted to a critical care unit.

Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB). Many cardiac surgical procedures are possible because of CPB (ie, extracorporeal circulation). The procedure mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. CPB uses a heartlung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field.

CPB, a common but complex technique, is accomplished by placing a cannula in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-254.jpg?height=947&width=872&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=106}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 28-8 Three coronary artery bypass grafts. One or more procedures may be performed using various veins and arteries. (A) Left internal mammary artery, popular because of its functional longevity. (B) Saphenous vein, the most frequently constructed bypass. (C) Right gastroepiploic artery, rarely used because this artery has a more extensive blood supply to its wall (increasing the risk of bleeding and necrosis of the artery) and because of the risk of gastrointestinal tract contamination of the abdominal or mediastinal wound.}
\end{figure}
to withdraw blood from the body. The cannula is connected to tubing filled with an isotonic crystalloid solution (usually $5 \%$ dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution). Venous blood removed from the body by the cannula is filtered, oxygenated, cooled or warmed, and then returned to the body. The cannula used to return the oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery (Fig. 28-9).

The patient receives heparin, an anticoagulant, to prevent thrombus formation and possible embolization that may occur when blood contacts the foreign surfaces of the CPB circuit and is pumped into the body by a mechanical pump (not the normal blood vessels and heart). After the patient is disconnected from the bypass machine, protamine sulfate is administered to reverse the effects of heparin.

During the procedure, hypothermia is maintained, usually $28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(82.4^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right.$ to $\left.89.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, thereby decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood. When the surgical procedure is completed, the blood is rewarmed as it passes through the CPB circuit. Urine output, blood pressure, arterial blood gas measurements, electrolytes, coagulation studies, and the ECG are monitored to assess the patient's status during CPB.

\section*{MINIMALLY INVASIVE DIRECT CABG (MIDCAB)}

For patients with single coronary artery blockages who cannot be treated by PTCA or with contraindications for CPB, an alternative to traditional CABG is minimally invasive direct CABG (MIDCAB). With the patient under general anesthesia, the surgeon makes one or more 2 - to 4 -inch ( 5 - to 10 - cm ) incisions in

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-254.jpg?height=1114&width=1246&top_left_y=1501&top_left_x=224}

\caption{FIGURE 28-9 The cardiopulmonary bypass system, in which cannulae are placed through the right atrium into the superior and inferior vena cavae to divert blood from the body and into the bypass system. The pump system creates a vacuum, pulling blood into the venous reservoir. The blood is cleared of air bubbles, clots, and particulates by the filter, and then is passed through the oxygenator, releasing carbon dioxide and obtaining oxygen. Next, the blood is pulled to the pump and pushed out to the heat exchanger, where its temperature is regulated. The blood is then returned to the body via the ascending aorta.}
\end{figure}
the chest wall for a left or right anterior thoracotomy or for a midsternal or midline upper laparotomy. The graft is prepared for the bypass (see previous graft selection description). The surgeon identifies the location of the coronary artery for the CAB , and a special instrument, a myocardial stabilizer, is put around the site. The stabilizer holds the graft site still for the surgeon while the heart continues to beat. Other techniques to minimize movement of the beating heart are to temporarily collapse the lung on the side of the chest where the surgery is being performed, decrease the respiratory rate and the volume of each breath, and give medications to cause bradycardia or up to 20 seconds of asystole.

Patients treated with MIDCAB may recover from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and then be admitted to a telemetry unit for 1 to 3 days. Nursing care is often directed toward routine postoperative pulmonary interventions (especially if a lung was collapsed during the MIDCAB) and incisional pain management (especially if a thoracotomy incision was made).

\section*{PORT ACCESS CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT}

Port access CABG is another alternative to traditional CABG. With the patient under general anesthesia, the surgeon makes three or more incisions (ports) to perform the CABG. One 0.5to 1 -inch ( 1.3 - to $2.5-\mathrm{cm}$ ) incision in the groin provides access to a femoral artery and vein. The femoral artery is used for a multipurpose catheter threaded retrograde through the aorta to the ascending aorta. The catheter is used to return blood from CPB to the patient, to occlude the aorta by inflating a balloon near the end of the catheter, to provide a cardioplegia solution to the coronary arteries, and to vent air from the aortic root during the surgical procedure. The femoral vein is used for a catheter threaded through the vena cava to the right atrium to drain blood from the patient for CPB. Another 0.5 - to 1 -inch ( $1.3-$ to $2.5-\mathrm{cm}$ ) incision in the neck provides access to the jugular vein for two catheters. One catheter is threaded into the pulmonary artery to remove air, fluid, and blood that may enter the right heart during surgery. The other catheter is threaded into the right atrium and the tip positioned in the coronary sinus for retrograde infusion of the cardioplegia solution. One or more thoracotomy incisions, usually 2 to 3.5 inches ( 5 to 9 cm ) long, are made for insertion of the surgical instruments. One of the thoracotomy ports may be used for video-assisted imaging equipment.

CPB is begun when the equipment is in place through the groin, neck, and thoracotomy incisions. The balloon on the aortic catheter is inflated, and the cardioplegia solution is injected into the coronary arteries. Cardioplegia solution is a crystalloid and electrolyte liquid used to stop the heart and protect the myocardium during cardiac surgical procedures. One lung may be temporarily collapsed to assist with exposing the surgical site. The CABG is performed through a thoracotomy incision. When the CABG is complete, air is vented from the pulmonary artery and aorta. The balloon on the aortic catheter is deflated, and CPB is discontinued. The surgical instruments and the catheters are removed. The incisions are closed. The patient's postoperative care is similar to that after traditional CABG.

\section*{COMBINATION PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY AND CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT}

Patients who have blockages in the left anterior descending and at least one other coronary artery who are not candidates for traditional CABG or prefer less invasive procedures may be treated with both MIDCAB and PTCA. Because patients need their blood to
be able to clot after MIDCAB, but require anticoagulation after PTCA, the sequence and timing of providing both treatments to the same patient are being investigated.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

CABG may result in complications such as MI, dysrhythmias, and hemorrhage (see Table 28-2; these complications are discussed in depth in this chapter, in Chapter 27, and in Chapters 20 and 71). The patient's underlying heart disease remains, and angina, exercise intolerance, or other symptoms experienced before CABG may develop again. Medications required before surgery may need to be continued. Lifestyle modifications recommended before surgery remain important to treat the underlying CAD and for the continued viability of the newly implanted grafts (see Plan of Nursing Care, pp. 740-745).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT AWAITING CARDIAC SURGERY}

The cardiac surgery patient has many of the same needs and requires the same perioperative care as other surgical patients (see Chaps. 18 through 20). The patient and family are experiencing a major life crisis. The association of the heart with life and death intensifies their emotional and psychological needs. Patients frequently are admitted the same day as the procedure. For these patients, the nurse must prioritize needs carefully; in the time allowed, the nurse focuses on the needs that have the highest priority.

Before surgery, physical and psychological assessments establish the baselines for future reference. The patient's understanding of the surgical procedure, informed consent, and adherence to treatment protocols are evaluated. Helping the patient to cope, understand the procedure, and maintain dignity are nursing responsibilities.

The preoperative phase of cardiac surgery begins before hospitalization. The nurse assesses the patient for other disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and hematologic diseases, and documents their treatment.

The nurse clarifies how the medication regimen is to be altered before surgery, such as tapering corticosteroids and digoxin, decreasing or discontinuing anticoagulants, and maintaining medications for treatment of blood pressure, angina, diabetes, and dysrhythmias. The nurse also clarifies the need to maintain activity patterns, a healthy diet, healthful sleep habits, and cessation of smoking to minimize the risks of surgery.

\section*{Assessment}

Patients with nonacute heart disease may be admitted to the hospital the day of or the day before the surgery. Most of the preoperative evaluation is completed before the patient enters the hospital. Many surgeons' offices or hospitals mail an information packet to the patient's home.

A history and physical examination are performed by nursing and medical personnel. A chest x-ray, ECG, laboratory tests, blood typing and crossmatching, and autologous blood donation (patient's own blood) may also be performed. The health assessment focuses on obtaining baseline physiologic, psychological, and social information. The patient's and family's learning needs are identified and addressed as necessary. Of particular importance are the patient's usual functional level, coping mechanisms, and support systems. These are important because the support of the family or

\section*{Care of the Patient After Cardiac Surgery}

Nursing Diagnosis: Decreased cardiac output related to blood loss and compromised myocardial function
Goal: Restoration of cardiac output to maintain/attain desired lifestyle
1. Monitor cardiovascular status. Serial readings of blood pressures (arterial, left atrial, pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP], central venous pressure [CVP]), cardiac output/index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac rhythm and rate are obtained, recorded, and correlated with the patient's condition. a. Assess arterial blood pressure every 15 minutes until stable; then arterial or cuff blood pressure every $1-4$ hours $\times$ 24 hours; then every 8-12 hours until hospital discharge; then every visit.
b. Auscultate for heart sounds and rhythm.
c. Assess peripheral pulses (pedal, tibial, radial, carotid).
d. Measure left atrial pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic (PAD) pressure, and PAWP to determine left ventricular end-diastolic volume and to assess cardiac output.
e. Monitor PAWP, PAD, left atrial pressure, and CVP to assess blood volume, vascular tone, and pumping effectiveness of the heart. Remember: Trends are more important than isolated readings. Mechanical ventilation may elevate CVP.
f. Monitor ECG pattern for cardiac dysrhythmias (see Chap. 27 for discussion of dysrhythmias).
g. Assess cardiac enzyme test results when available.
h. Measure urine output every $1 / 2$ hour to 1 hour at first, then with vital signs.
i. Observe buccal mucosa, nailbeds, lips, earlobes, and extremities.
j. Assess skin; note temperature and color.
1. Effectiveness of cardiac output is determined by hemodynamic monitoring.
a. Blood pressure is one of the most important physiologic parameters to follow; vasoconstriction after cardiopulmonary bypass may make auscultatory blood pressure unobtainable.
b. Auscultation provides evidence of cardiac tamponade (muffled distant heart sounds), pericarditis (precordial rub), dysrhythmias.
c. Presence or absence and quality of pulses provide data about cardiac output as well as obstructive lesions.
d. Rising pressures may indicate congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.
e. High PAWP, PAD, left atrial pressure, or CVP may result from hypervolemia, heart failure, cardiac tamponade. If blood pressure drop is due to low blood volume, PAWP, PAD, left atrial pressure, and CVP will show corresponding drop.
f. Dysrhythmias may occur with coronary ischemia, hypoxia, alterations in serum potassium, edema, bleeding, acid-base or electrolyte disturbances, digitalis toxicity, cardiac failure. STsegment changes may indicate myocardial ischemia or coronary artery spasm. Pacemaker capture and antiarrhythmic medication effects are used to maintain a heart rate and rhythm to support stable blood pressures.
g. Elevations may indicate myocardial infarction.
h. Urine output less than $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ indicates decreased renal perfusion and may reflect decreased cardiac output.
i. Duskiness and cyanosis may indicate decreased cardiac output.
j. Cool moist skin indicates vasoconstriction and decreased cardiac output.

The following parameters are within the patient's normal ranges:
- Arterial pressure
- Left atrial pressures
- PAWP
- Pulmonary artery pressures
- CVP
- Heart sounds
- Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance
- Cardiac output and cardiac index
- Peripheral pulses
- Cardiac rate and rhythm
- Cardiac enzymes
- Urine output
- Skin and mucosal color
- Skin temperature

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Impaired gas exchange related to trauma of extensive chest surgery}

\section*{Goal: Adequate gas exchange}
1. Maintain mechanical ventilation until the patient is able to breathe independently.
2. Monitor arterial blood gases, tidal volumes, peak inspiratory pressures, and extubation parameters.
3. Auscultate chest for breath sounds.
4. Sedate patient adequately, as prescribed, and monitor respiratory rate and depth if ventilations are not "controlled."
5. Promote deep breathing, forced expiratory technique (FET, coughing), and turning. Encourage use of the incentive spirometer and compliance with breathing treatments. Teach incisional splinting with a "cough pillow" to decrease discomfort during deep breathing and FET (coughing).
6. Suction tracheobronchial secretions as needed, using strict aseptic technique.
7. Assist in weaning and endotracheal tube removal.
1. Ventilatory support may be used to decrease work of the heart, to maintain effective ventilation, and to provide an airway in the event of cardiac arrest.
2. ABGs and tidal volume indicate effectiveness of ventilator and changes that need to be made to improve gas exchange.
3. Crackles indicate pulmonary congestion; decreased or absent breath sounds may indicate pneumothorax or hemothorax.
4. Sedation helps the patient to tolerate the endotracheal tube and to cope with ventilatory sensations; sedatives can depress respiratory rate and depth.
5. Aids in keeping airway patent, preventing atelectasis, and facilitating lung expansion.
6. Retention of secretions leads to hypoxia and possible cardiac arrest; retained secretions promote infection.
7. Decreased risk of pulmonary infections and enhanced ability of patient to communicate without an endotracheal tube.
- Airway patent
- ABGs within normal range
- Endotracheal tube correctly placed, as evidenced by x-ray
- Breath sounds clear
- Ventilator synchronous with respirations
- Breath sounds clear after suctioning/FET
- Nailbeds and mucous membranes pink
- Mental acuity consistent with amount of sedatives and analgesics received
- Oriented to person; able to respond yes and no appropriately

Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for deficient fluid volume and electrolyte imbalance related to alterations in blood volume
Goal: Fluid and electrolyte balance
1. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.
a. Keep intake and output flow sheets; record urine volume every $1 / 2$ hour to 4 hours while in critical care unit; then every 8 to 12 hours while hospitalized.
b. Assess the following parameters: pulmonary artery pressures, left atrial pressures, blood pressure, CVP, PAWP, weight, electrolyte levels, hematocrit, jugular venous pressure, tissue turgor, liver size, breath sounds, urinary output, and nasogastric tube drainage.
c. Measure postoperative chest drainage (should not exceed $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ for first 4 to 6 hours); cessation of drainage may indicate kinked or blocked chest tube. Ensure patency and integrity of the drainage system. Maintain autotransfusion system if in use.
d. Weigh daily once patient is ambulatory.
2. Be alert to changes in serum electrolyte levels.
a. Hypokalemia (low potassium) Effects: dysrhythmias, digitalis toxicity, metabolic alkalosis, weakened myocardium, cardiac arrest

Observe for specific ECG changes. Administer IV potassium replacement as directed.
b. Hyperkalemia (high potassium) Effects: mental confusion, restlessness, nausea, weakness, paresthesias of extremities

Be prepared to administer an ionexchange resin (sodium polystyrene sulfonate [Kayexalate]); IV sodium bicarbonate, or IV insulin and glucose.
c. Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium) Effects: paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, muscle cramps, tetany, irritability, tremors, hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, disorientation, depression, seizures, hypotension, dysrhythmias, prolonged PR and QT intervals, broad flat T waves.
1. Adequate circulating blood volume is necessary for optimal cellular activity; metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalance can occur after use of cardiopulmonary bypass.
a. Provides a method to determine positive or negative fluid balance and fluid requirements.
b. Provides information about state of hydration.
c. Excessive blood loss from chest cavity can cause hypovolemia.
d. Indicator of fluid balance.
2. A specific concentration of electrolytes is necessary in both extracellular and intracellular body fluids to sustain life.
a. Causes: inadequate intake, diuretics, vomiting, excessive nasogastric drainage, stress from surgery
b. Causes: increased intake, hemolysis from cardiopulmonary bypass/mechanical assist devices, acidosis, renal insufficiency, tissue necrosis, adrenal cortical insufficiency.

The resin binds potassium and promotes intestinal excretion of it.

IV sodium bicarbonate drives potassium into the cells from extracellular fluid.

Insulin assists the cells with glucose absorption. The glucose provides the energy to activate the sodium-potassium pumps, which pull potassium into the cell while pumping sodium out.
c. Causes: decreased intake (chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, starvation), impaired absorption (malabsorption syndromes, excess intake of calcium) and increased excretion normal for 24 hours after major surgery, diuretic loss of intestinal fluids, diabetic ketoacidosis, primary aldosteronism, primary hyperparathyroidism.
- Fluid intake and output balanced
- Hemodynamic assessment parameters negative for fluid overload and dehydration
- Normal blood pressure with position changes
- Absence of dysrhythmia
- Stable weight
- Notify physician if weight gain of 2 lb or more in 1 day or 5 lb or more in 1 week.
- Blood pH 7.35 to 7.45
- Serum potassium 3.5 to $5.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( 3.5 to $5.0 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ )
- Serum magnesium 1.5 to $2.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( 0.75 to $1.25 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ )
- Serum sodium 135 to $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (135 to $145 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ )
- Serum calcium 8.8 to $10.3 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}$ ( 2.20 to $2.58 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ )

f. Causes: alkalosis, multiple blood transfusions of citrated blood products
g. Cause: prolonged immobility

Nursing Diagnosis: Disturbed sensory perception related to excessive environmental stimulation, sleep deprivation, electrolyte imbalance
Goal: Reduction of symptoms of sensory perceptual imbalance; prevention of postcardiotomy psychosis
1. Use measures to prevent postcardiotomy psychosis:
a. Explain all procedures and the need for patient cooperation.
b. Plan nursing care to provide for periods of uninterrupted sleep with patient's normal day-night pattern.
c. Decrease sleep-preventing environmental stimuli as much as possible.
d. Promote continuity of care from nurse to nurse.
e. Orient to time and place frequently. Encourage family to visit at regular times.

significant others will affect the patient's postoperative course and rehabilitation. Discharge plans are influenced by the lifestyle demands of the home situation and the physical environment of the home.

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

The preoperative history and health assessment should be thorough and well documented because they provide a basis for postoperative comparison. A systematic assessment of all systems is performed, with emphasis on cardiovascular functioning.

Functional status of the cardiovascular system is determined by reviewing the patient's symptoms, including past and present experiences with chest pain, hypertension, palpitations, cyanosis, breathing difficulty (dyspnea), leg pain that occurs with walking (intermittent claudication), orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema. Because alterations in cardiac output can affect renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, integumentary, hematologic, and neurologic functioning, a history of
these systems is also reviewed. The patient's history of major illnesses, previous surgeries, medication therapies, and use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco is also obtained.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

A complete physical examination is performed, with special emphasis on the following:
- General appearance and behavior
- Vital signs
- Nutritional and fluid status, weight, and height
- Inspection and palpation of the heart, noting the point of maximal impulse, abnormal pulsations, and thrills
- Auscultation of the heart, noting pulse rate, rhythm, and quality; $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$, snaps, clicks, murmurs, and friction rub
- Jugular venous pressure
- Peripheral pulses
- Peripheral edema

\section*{PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT}

The psychosocial assessment and the assessment of the patient's and family's learning needs are as important as the physical examination. Anticipation of cardiac surgery is a source of great stress to the patient and family. They will be anxious and fearful and often have many unanswered questions. Their anxiety usually increases with the patient's admission to the hospital and the immediacy of surgery. An assessment of the level of anxiety is important. If it is low, it may indicate denial. If it is extremely high, it may interfere with the use of effective coping mechanisms and with preoperative teaching. Questions may be asked to obtain the following information:
- Meaning of the surgery to the patient and family
- Coping mechanisms that are being used
- Measures used in the past to deal with stress
- Anticipated changes in lifestyle
- Support systems in effect
- Fears regarding the present and the future
- Knowledge and understanding of the surgical procedure, postoperative course, and long-term rehabilitation
The nurse allows adequate time for the patient and family to express their fears. The fears most often expressed are fear of the unknown, fear of pain, fear of body image change, and fear of dying. During the assessment, the nurse determines how much the patient and family know about the impending surgery and the expected postoperative events. They are encouraged to ask questions and to indicate how much information they wish to receive. Some patients prefer not to have detailed information, whereas others want to know as much as possible. Patients are approached as unique individuals with their own specific learning needs, learning styles, and levels of understanding.

Patients requiring emergency heart surgery may have cardiac catheterization and surgery within several hours of admission. The nurse will have little opportunity to assess and meet their emotional and learning needs before surgery. As a result, patients will need extra help after surgery to adjust to the situation.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

The nursing diagnoses for patients awaiting cardiac surgery vary according to each patient's cardiac disease and symptoms. Most patients have a nursing diagnosis of decreased cardiac output (see Cardiac Failure in Chap. 30). Preoperative nursing diagnoses for most patients may include:
- Fear related to the surgical procedure, its uncertain outcome, and the threat to well-being
- Deficient knowledge regarding the surgical procedure and the postoperative course

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The stress of impending cardiac surgery may precipitate complications that require collaborative management with the physician. Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Angina or anginal pain equivalent
- Severe anxiety requiring an anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) medication
- Cardiac arrest

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals of the patient may include reducing fear, learning about the surgical procedure and postoperative course, and avoiding complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

During the preoperative phase of cardiac surgery, the nurse develops a plan of care that includes emotional support and teaching for the patient and family. Establishing rapport, answering questions, listening to fears and concerns, clarifying misconceptions, and providing information about what to expect are interventions the nurse uses to prepare the patient and family emotionally for the surgery and for the postoperative events.

\section*{REDUCING FEAR}

The patient and family are provided time and opportunities to express their fears. If there is fear of the unknown, other surgical experiences that the patient has had can be compared with the impending surgery. It is often helpful to describe to the patient the sensations that are expected. If the patient has already had a cardiac catheterization, the similarities and differences between that procedure and the surgery may be compared. The patient is encouraged to talk about any concerns related to previous experiences.

A discussion of the patient's fears about pain is initiated. A comparison is made between the pain experienced with cardiac surgery and other pain experiences. The preoperative sedation, the anesthetic, and the postoperative pain medications are described. The nurse reassures the patient that the fear of pain is normal, that some pain will be experienced, that medication to relieve pain will be provided, and that the patient will be closely observed. The patient is encouraged to take pain medication before the pain becomes severe. Positioning and relaxation will make the pain more tolerable. Patients who have a fear of scarring from surgery are encouraged to discuss this concern, and misconceptions are corrected. It may be helpful to indicate that the health care team members will keep the patient informed about the healing process.

The patient and family are encouraged to talk about their fear of the patient dying. They should be reassured that this fear is normal. For those who only hint about this concern despite efforts to encourage them to talk about their fear, coaching may be helpful (eg, "Are you worrying about not making it through surgery? Most people who have heart surgery at least think about the possibility of dying."). After the fear is expressed, the patient and family can be helped to explore their feelings.

By alleviating undue anxiety and fear, preparing the patient emotionally for surgery decreases the chance of preoperative problems, promotes smooth anesthesia induction, and enhances the patient's involvement in care and recovery after surgery. Preparing the family for the events to come helps them to cope, be supportive to the patient, and participate in postoperative and rehabilitative care (Chart 28-9).

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Angina may occur because of increased stress and anxiety related to the forthcoming surgery. The patient who develops angina usually responds to normal angina therapy, most commonly nitroglycerin. Some patients require oxygen and intravenous nitroglycerin drips (see the Angina Pectoris section).

\section*{Chart 28-9 Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{When Is Withholding or Withdrawing Life Support Discussed with Patients and Families?}

\section*{Situation}

Life support includes the use of intraaortic balloon pumps and ventricular assist devices, ventilators, vasoactive infusions, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and antibiotics. Patients who receive these treatments include those who are acutely, chronically, and terminally ill. When dependent on life support, a patient may be unable to make decisions about his or her own care, and the patient's family may be asked to participate in decision making for the patient. At what point is the sensitive issue of withholding or withdrawing life support discussed?

\section*{Dilemma}

A patient is unresponsive and utilizing life support in the critical care unit. The consulting cardiologist has written a progress note stating, "Patient is terminal. Further treatment is futile." The patient does not have a living will or a durable power of attorney for health care. The oldest child does not want the patient to suffer but states, "If there is any hope, I want everything done." The other child states that the patient "would not want to live like this."

Does the statement by the second child support the principle of autonomy? Does the statement by the oldest child provide precedence for the principles of sanctity of life, beneficence, or nonmaleficence? If you determined that the statement by the second child supported the principle of autonomy, should sanctity of life, beneficence, or nonmaleficence be used in decision making in this situation?

\section*{Discussion}

What arguments would you offer to support the view that discussions about the extent of life-supporting treatments desired should occur before an individual experiences a life-threatening event?

What arguments would you offer to support the view that discussions about the extent of life-supporting treatment should occur only when certain circumstances arise?

For patients with extreme anxiety or fear and for whom emotional support and education are not successful, medication therapy may be helpful. The anxiolytic agents most commonly used before cardiac surgery are lorazepam (Ativan) and diazepam (Valium).

If cardiac arrest occurs in the preoperative period, advanced cardiac life support is provided (see Chap. 27).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patient and family teaching is based on assessed learning needs. Teaching usually includes information about hospitalization, surgery (eg, preoperative and postoperative care, length of surgery, pain and discomfort that can be expected, visiting hours, and procedures in the critical care unit), the recovery phase (eg, length of hospitalization, what to expect from home care and rehabilitation, when normal activities such as housework, shopping, and work can be resumed), and ongoing lifestyle habits. Any changes made in medical therapy and preoperative preparations need to be explained and reinforced.

The patient is informed that physical preparation usually involves several showers or scrubs with an antiseptic solution. A sedative may be prescribed the night before and the morning of
surgery. Most cardiac surgical teams use prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and the antibiotic therapy is initiated before surgery.

If no preadmission teaching has been done and the preoperative hospitalization period is very short, teaching the patient and family together may be most effective. Anxiety often increases with the admission process and impending surgery. Teaching the patient and family together capitalizes on their established support relationship. Teaching in this phase should be directed primarily by the patient's and family's questions. Too much detail may only increase anxiety.

The patient may be offered a tour of the critical care unit, the postanesthesia care unit, or both. (In some hospitals, the patient initially goes to the postanesthesia care unit.) The patient recovering from anesthesia may be reassured by having already seen the surroundings and having met someone from the unit. The patient and family are informed about the equipment, tubes, and lines that will be present after surgery and their purposes. They should know to expect monitors, several intravenous lines, chest tubes, and a urinary catheter. Explaining the purpose and the approximate time that these devices will be in place helps to reassure the patient. Most patients will remain intubated and on mechanical ventilation for 2 to 24 hours after surgery. They need to be aware that this prevents them from talking, and they should be reassured that the staff will be able to assist them with other means of communication.

The nurse takes care to answer the patient's questions about postoperative care and procedures. Deep breathing and huffing (or coughing), use of the incentive spirometer, and foot exercises are explained and practiced by the patient before surgery. The family's questions at this time usually focus on the length of the surgery, who will discuss the results of the procedure with them after surgery and when this may occur, where to wait during the surgery, the visiting procedures for the critical care unit, and how they can support the patient before surgery and in the critical care unit.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Demonstrates reduced fear
a. Identifies fears
b. Discusses fears with family
c. Uses past experiences as a focus for comparison
d. Expresses positive attitude about outcome of surgery
e. Expresses confidence in measures to be used to relieve pain
2. Learns about the surgical procedure and postoperative course
a. Identifies the purposes of the preoperative preparation procedure
b. Tours the critical care unit, if desired
c. Identifies limitations expected after surgery
d. Discusses expected immediate postoperative environment (eg, tubes, machines, nursing surveillance)
e. Demonstrates expected activities after surgery (eg, deep breathing, huffing [coughing], foot exercises)
3. Shows no evidence of complications
a. Reports anginal pain is relieved with medications and rest
b. Takes medications as prescribed

\section*{INTRAOPERATIVE NURSING MANAGEMENT}

The perioperative nurse performs an assessment and prepares the patient for the operating room and recovery experience. Any changes in the patient's status and the need for changes in therapy are identified. Procedures are explained before they are performed, such as the application of electrodes and use of continuous monitoring, indwelling catheters, and an $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ probe. Intravenous lines are inserted to administer fluids, medications, and blood products. The patient will receive general anesthesia, be intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. In addition to assisting with the surgical procedures, perioperative nurses are responsible for the comfort and safety of the patient. Some of the areas of intervention include positioning, skin care, wound care, and emotional support of the patient and family.

Before the chest incision is closed, chest tubes are positioned to evacuate air and drainage from the mediastinum and the thorax. Epicardial pacemaker electrodes are implanted on the surface of the right atrium and the right ventricle. These epicardial electrodes can be used to pace the heart and to monitor it for dysrhythmias through the atrial leads.

Possible intraoperative complications include dysrhythmias, hemorrhage, MI, CVA (stroke, brain attack), embolization, and organ failure from shock, embolus, or adverse drug reactions. Astute intraoperative patient assessment is critical in preventing these complications and for detecting symptoms and initiating prompt therapy.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WHO HAS HAD CARDIAC SURGERY}

Initial postoperative care focuses on achieving or maintaining hemodynamic stability and recovery from general anesthesia. Care may be provided in the postanesthesia care unit or intensive care unit. After hemodynamic stability and recovery from general anesthesia have been achieved, the patient is transferred to a surgical stepdown unit with telemetry. Care focuses on wound care, progressive activity, and nutrition. Education about medications and risk factor modification is emphasized (see Plan of Nursing Care: Care of the Patient After Cardiac Surgery). Discharge from the hospital usually occurs 3 to 5 days after CABG or 1 to 3 days after MIDCAB. Patients can expect fewer symptoms from CAD and an improved quality of life. CABG has been shown to increase the life span of high-risk patients-those with left main artery blockages, left ventricular dysfunction with multivessel blockages, three-vessel blockages with one being the left anterior descending artery, and diabetes (Eagle et al., 1999).

The immediate postoperative period for the patient who has undergone cardiac surgery presents many challenges to the health care team. All efforts are made to facilitate the transition from the operating room to the critical care unit or PACU with minimal risk. Specific information about the operation and important factors about postoperative management are communicated by the surgical team and anesthesia personnel to the critical care nurse, who then assumes responsibility for the patient's care. Figure $28-10$ presents a graphic overview of the many aspects of postoperative care for the cardiac surgical patient.

\section*{Assessment}

When the patient is admitted to the critical care unit or PACU and for at least every 12 hours thereafter, a complete assessment of all systems is performed to determine the postoperative status
of the patient compared with the preoperative baseline and to identify anticipated changes since surgery. The following parameters are assessed:

Neurologic status: level of responsiveness, pupil size and reaction to light, reflexes, facial symmetry, movement of extremities, and hand grip strength
Cardiac status: heart rate and rhythm, heart sounds, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), left atrial pressure, waveforms from the invasive blood pressure lines, cardiac output or index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary artery oxygen saturation $\left(\mathrm{SvO}_{2}\right)$ if available, mediastinal chest tube drainage, and pacemaker status and function
Respiratory status: chest movement, breath sounds, ventilator settings (eg, rate, tidal volume, oxygen concentration, mode such as synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure, pressure support), respiratory rate, ventilatory pressure, arterial oxygen saturation ( $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ ), percutaneous oxygen saturation ( $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ ), end-tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, pleural chest tube drainage, arterial blood gases
Peripheral vascular status: peripheral pulses; color of skin, nailbeds, mucosa, lips, and earlobes; skin temperature; edema; condition of dressings and invasive lines
Renal function: urinary output; urine specific gravity and osmolality may be assessed
Fluid and electrolyte status: intake, output from all drainage tubes, all cardiac output parameters, and the following indications of electrolyte imbalance:
- Hypokalemia: digitalis toxicity, dysrhythmias, ECG changes (U wave, atrioventricular block, flat or inverted T waves)
- Hyperkalemia: mental confusion, restlessness, nausea, weakness, paresthesias of extremities, dysrhythmias, ECG changes (tall, peaked T waves; increased amplitude, widening QRS complex; prolonged QT interval)
- Hypomagnesemia: paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, muscle cramps, tetany, irritability, tremors, hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, cardiac dysrhythmias, ECG changes (prolonged PR and QT intervals; broad, flat T waves), disorientation, depression, hypotension, seizures
- Hypermagnesemia: vasodilation, hypotension, hyporeflexia, slow gastrointestinal motility (hypoactive bowel sounds), lethargy, respiratory depression, coma, apnea, cardiac arrest
- Hyponatremia: weakness, fatigue, confusion, seizures, coma
- Hypocalcemia: paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, muscle cramps, tetany
- Hypercalcemia: digitalis toxicity, asystole

Pain: nature, type, location, duration (incisional pain must be differentiated from anginal pain); apprehension; response to analgesics
Some patients who have had a MIDCAB using a midsternal incision or an internal mammary artery CABG experience ulnar nerve paresthesia on the same side of the body as the graft. The paresthesia may be temporary or permanent. Patients who have had CABG using the gastroepiploic artery may experience an ileus for a longer period after surgery and have abdominal pain at the site of the incision and pain at the site of the chest incision.

Assessment also includes observing all equipment and tubes to determine whether they are functioning properly: endotracheal tube, ventilator, end-tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ monitor, $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ monitor, pul-

monary artery catheter, $S_{\bar{v}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ monitor, arterial and intravenous lines, intravenous infusion devices and tubing, cardiac monitor, pacemaker, chest tubes, and urinary drainage system.

As the patient regains consciousness and progresses through the postoperative period, the nurse expands the assessment to include parameters indicative of psychological and emotional status. The patient may exhibit behavior that reflects denial or depression or may experience postcardiotomy psychosis. Characteristic signs of psychosis include transient perceptual illusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and paranoid delusions.

The family's needs also should be assessed. The nurse ascertains how they are coping with the situation; determines their psychological, emotional, and spiritual needs; and finds out whether they are receiving adequate information about the patient's condition.

\section*{ASSESSING FOR COMPLICATIONS}

The patient is continuously assessed for indications of impending complications (Table 28-8). The nurse and the surgeon function collaboratively to identify early signs and symptoms of complications and to institute measures to reverse their progression.

\hline Persistent bleeding & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Cardiopulmonary bypass procedure, which may cause platelet malfunction (blood clots abnormally) and hypothermia, which alters clotting mechanisms \\
- Surgical trauma causing tissues and blood vessels to ooze bloody drainage \\
- Anticoagulant (heparin) therapy
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Accurate measurement of wound bleeding and drainage tube blood is essential. Bloody drainage should not exceed $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ for the first 4 to 6 hours. Drainage should decrease and stop within a few days, while progressing from sanguineous to serosanguineous and serous drainage. \\
- Protamine sulfate may be administered to neutralize unfractionated heparin; vitamin K and blood products may be used to treat hematologic deficiencies. \\
- If bleeding persists, the patient may return to the operating room for corrective surgery.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Cardiac tamponade (may decrease preload to the heart by preventing available blood from entering the heart) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, which compresses the heart, preventing blood from filling the ventricles. \\
- Signs and symptoms include arterial hypotension, tachycardia, muffled heart sounds, decreasing urine output and equalizing of the PAWP, CVP, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressures. Additional signs and symptoms: arterial and pulmonary artery pressure waveforms demonstrating a pulsus paradoxus (decrease of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration) and decreased chest tube drainage (suggesting that the drainage is trapped or clotted in the mediastinum).
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Equipment is checked to eliminate possible kinks or obstructions in the tubing. \\
- Drainage system patency may be reestablished by milking the tubing (taking care not to strip the tubing, creating massive negative pressure within the chest, which may harm the surgical repair or trigger a dysrhythmia). \\
- Chest x-ray may show a widening mediastinum. \\
- Emergency medical management is required; may include pericardiocentesis or return to surgery.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Fluid overload & - High PAWP, CVP, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressures as well as crackles indicate fluid overload. & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Diuretics are usually prescribed and the rate of IV fluid administration is reduced. \\
- Fluid restriction may be prescribed. Alternative treatments include continuous renal replacement therapy, dialysis, and phlebotomy.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Afterload Alterations (The force that the ventricle must overcome to move blood forward. Vascular resistance may be calculated to assess afterload and the effects of any vasoactive treatments.

\hline Hypothermia & - Blood vessel constriction, which increases afterload. (Blood vessel dilation from fever or other hyperthermic condition decreases afterload.) & - Patient is rewarmed gradually, although vasodilators may be required if the resistance is too great to wait for rewarming.

\hline Tachydysrhythmias & - May or may not result from preload or afterload alterations & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Rhythms are assessed to establish that they are not the result of preload or afterload alterations. \\
- If a tachydysrhythmia is the primary symptom, the heart rhythm is assessed and medications (eg, adenosine [Adenocard, Adenoscan], digoxin [Lanoxin], diltiazem [Cardizem], esmolol [Brevibloc], lidocaine [Xylocaine], procainamide [Procanbid, Pronestyl], propranolol [Inderal], quinidine [Cardioquin, Quinaglute, Quinidex], verapamil [Calan, Corvera, Isoptin, Verelan]) are prescribed. (Patients may be prescribed antiarrhythmics before CABG to minimize the risk of postoperative tachydysrhythmias.) \\
- Carotid massage may be performed by a physician to assist with diagnosing or treating the dysrhythmia. \\
- Cardioversion and defibrillation are alternatives for symptomatic tachydysrhythmias.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Bradycardias & - Decreased heart rate & - Many postoperative patients will have temporary pacer wires that can be attached to a pulse generator (pacemaker) to stimulate the heart to beat faster. Less commonly, atropine, epinephrine or isoproterenol may be used to increase heart rate. \\
\hline Dysrhythmias (may or may not affect cardiac output) & - Abnormal heart rates & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Treatment may include medication (Table 27-1), pacemakers (antibradycardiac, antitachycardiac), carotid massage, cardioversion, or defibrillation. Goal of treatment is to return the heart to a normal sinus rhythm. \\
- For patients who cannot attain normal sinus rhythm, an alternate goal may be to establish a stable rhythm that produces a sufficient cardiac output.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline & - Possible when the heart fails as a pump and the chambers cannot adequately empty & \begin{tabular}{l}
- The nurse observes for and reports falling mean arterial pressure; rising PAWP, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and CVP; increasing tachycardia; restlessness and agitation; peripheral cyanosis; venous distention; labored respirations; and edema. \\
- Medical management includes diuretics and digoxin.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Myocardial infarction (may occur intraoperatively or postoperatively) & - Portion of the cardiac muscle dies, therefore contractility decreases. Until the infarcted area becomes edematous, the ventricular wall moves paradoxically during contractions, further decreasing cardiac output. Symptoms may be masked by the postoperative surgical discomfort or the anesthesia-analgesia regimen. & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Careful assessment to determine the type of pain the patient is experiencing; MI suspected if the mean blood pressure is low with normal preload. The systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and heart rate may be elevated to compensate for poor contractility. \\
- Serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes assist in making the diagnosis (alterations may be due to the surgical intervention). Analgesics are prescribed in small amounts while the patient's blood pressure and respiratory rate are monitored (because vasodilation secondary to analgesics or decreasing pain may occur and compound the hypotension). \\

- Compression of a bleeding vessel is another treatment of hemorrhage. Lungs may be used to compress bleeding mediastinal blood vessels; lung volume and pressure are increased by adding PEEP to the ventilator settings of an intubated patient. The lungs slow or stop the bleeding by pushing in on the mediastinum and creating pressure on the bleeding vessels of the pericardium, coronary arteries, and bypass grafts.

\hline Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium level, $<1.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $0.75 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), although symptoms usually develop with $<1.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Normal magnesium level ranges from $1.5-2.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $0.75- 1.25 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Can be caused by decreased intake, impaired absorption or increased excretion, and surgery, which causes the kidneys to excrete higher amounts of magnesium for 24 hours. Other causes may be decreased intake due to chronic alcoholism, malnutrition or starvation. Impaired absorption may be related to malabsorption syndromes (such as sprue, steatorrhea, or bowel resections) and excess intake of calcium. Increased excretion may result from diuretic use, loss of intestinal fluids (especially fistulas), diabetic ketoacidosis, primary aldosteronism, and primary hyperparathyroidism. Magnesium is important for the function of the neuromuscular system, so the signs and symptoms most often seen are neuromuscular. \\
- Signs and symptoms: paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, muscle cramps, tetany, irritability, tremors, hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, disorientation, depression, and seizures. Also, hypotension, dysrhythmias (atrial and ventricular), prolonged PR and QT intervals and broad flat T waves.
\end{tabular} & - Treatment is to correct the cause. If necessary, magnesium supplements may be given. The oral route is preferred to intramuscular injections, which are painful, and the IV route, which carries a significant risk for respiratory depression and hypotension. If the IV route is chosen for magnesium supplements, the nurse needs to assess the patient at least every 15 min for respiratory rate less than 16 , hypotension, flushing, and diaphoresis. Loss of the patellar reflex may occur. If symptoms occur, the nurse slows or stops the infusion and notifies the physician. \\
\hline Hypermagnesemia (high serum magnesium level, usually $>3.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Possibly caused by renal failure or intake of large amounts of medications with magnesium, such as some antacids and cathartics. \\

- Both may occur after cardiac surgery, but hyponatremia is more common. \\
- Hyponatremia may result from reduced total body sodium or from increased water intake, which causes a dilution of body sodium. \\

\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
- The patient must be observed for sodium values that vary from the normal ranges \\
- When there is a true loss of sodium from the body, sodium replacement may be necessary. \\

- May result from alkalosis, which reduces the amount of calcium in the extracellular fluid, or from transfusions of large amounts of citrated blood products—packed red blood cells or whole blood. Citrate binds with calcium, reducing the amount of circulating ionized calcium. After 5-6 units of packed cells or whole blood from the blood bank, calcium binding may become a concern. \\
- Signs and symptoms: numbness and tingling in the fingertips, toes, ears, and nose; carpopedal spasm; and muscle cramps and tetany
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}

\end{tabular} \\
\hline Hypercalcemia (high calcium level) & - Signs and symptoms: dysrhythmias that imitate those caused by digitalis toxicity (calcium can potentiate, or enhance, the action of digitalis) & - The nurse assesses the patient for signs of digitalis toxicity and reports these immediately so that the physician can institute treatment to prevent asystole and death. \\

\section*{Decreased Cardiac Output}

A decrease in cardiac output is always a threat to the patient who has had cardiac surgery. It can have a variety of causes:

Preload alterations: too little or too much blood volume returning to the heart because of hypovolemia, persistent bleeding, cardiac tamponade, or fluid overload
Afterload alteration: hypertension and arterioles that are too constricted or too dilated because of alterations in body temperature or use of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators
Heart rate alterations: too fast, too slow, or dysrhythmias
Contractility alterations: cardiac failure, MI, electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia

\section*{Fluid Volume and Electrolyte Imbalance}

The risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalance may occur after cardiac surgery. Nursing assessment for these complications includes monitoring of intake and output, weight, PAWP, left atrial pressure and CVP readings, hematocrit levels, distention of neck veins, edema, liver size, breath sounds (eg, fine crackles, wheezing), and electrolyte levels. Changes in serum electrolytes are reported promptly so that treatment can be instituted. Especially important are dangerously high or dangerously low levels of potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium.

\section*{Impaired Gas Exchange}

Impaired gas exchange is another possible complication after cardiac surgery. All body tissues require an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients for survival. To achieve this after surgery, an endotracheal tube with ventilator assistance may be used for 24 or more hours. The assisted ventilation is continued until the patient's blood gas measurements are acceptable and the patient demonstrates the ability to breathe independently. Patients who are stable after surgery may be extubated as early as 2 to 4 hours
after surgery, which reduces their anxiety regarding their limited ability to communicate.

The patient is continuously assessed for signs of impaired gas exchange: restlessness, anxiety, cyanosis of mucous membranes and peripheral tissues, tachycardia, and fighting the ventilator. Breath sounds are assessed often to detect fluid in the lungs and monitor lung expansion. Arterial blood gas values are monitored. Arterial blood gases, $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}, \mathrm{SaO}_{2}$, and end-tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are assessed for decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide.

\section*{Impaired Cerebral Circulation}

Brain function depends on a continuous supply of oxygenated blood. The brain does not have the capacity to store oxygen and must rely on adequate continuous perfusion by the heart. It is important to observe the patient for any symptoms of hypoxia: restlessness, headache, confusion, dyspnea, hypotension, and cyanosis. An assessment of the patient's neurologic status includes level of consciousness, response to verbal commands and painful stimuli, pupil size and reaction to light, facial symmetry, movement of extremities, hand grip strength, presence of pedal and popliteal pulses, and temperature and color of extremities. Any indication of a changing status is documented, and abnormal findings are reported to the surgeon because they may signal the beginning of a complication. Hypoperfusion or microemboli may produce central nervous system injury after cardiac surgery.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data and the type of surgical procedure performed, major nursing diagnoses of the patient may include:
- Decreased cardiac output related to blood loss, compromised myocardial function, and dysrhythmias
- Impaired gas exchange related to trauma of extensive chest surgery
- Risk for deficient fluid volume (and electrolyte imbalance) related to alteration in circulating blood volume
- Disturbed sensory perception (visual or auditory) related to excessive environmental stimuli (critical care environment, surgical experience), insufficient sleep, psychological stress, altered sensory integration, and electrolyte imbalances
- Acute pain related to surgical trauma and pleural irritation caused by chest tubes
- Ineffective tissue perfusion (renal, cerebral, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, peripheral) related to decreased cardiac output, hemolysis, vasopressor drug therapy, venous stasis, embolization, underlying atherosclerotic disease, effects of vasopressors, or coagulation problems
- Ineffective thermoregulation related to infection or postpericardiotomy syndrome
- Deficient knowledge about self-care activities

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Cardiac complications: heart failure, MI, stunned myocardium, dysrhythmias, tamponade, cardiac arrest
- Pulmonary complications: pulmonary edema, pulmonary emboli, pleural effusions, pneumothorax or hemothorax, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Hemorrhage
- Neurologic complications: CVA (brain attack, stroke), air emboli
- Renal failure, acute or chronic
- Electrolyte imbalances
- Hepatic failure
- Coagulopathies
- Infection, sepsis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include restoration of cardiac output, adequate gas exchange, maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, reduction of symptoms of sensory-perception alterations, relief of pain, maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion, maintenance of normal body temperature, learning self-care activities, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RESTORING CARDIAC OUTPUT}

Nursing management of the patient involves continuously observing the patient's cardiac status and notifying the surgeon of any changes that indicate decreased cardiac output. The nurse and the surgeon then work collaboratively to correct the problem.

In evaluating the patient's cardiac status, the nurse primarily determines the effectiveness of cardiac output through clinical observations and routine measurements: serial readings of blood pressure, heart rate, CVP, arterial pressure, and left atrial or pulmonary artery pressure.

Renal function is related to cardiac function, as blood pressure and heart rate drive glomerular filtration; therefore, urinary output is measured and recorded. Urine output of less than $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ may indicate a decrease in cardiac output. Urine specific gravity may also be assessed (normal: 1.010 to 1.025), as may urine osmolality. Inadequate fluid volume may be manifested by low urinary out-
put and high specific gravity, whereas overhydration is manifested by high urine output with low specific gravity.

The growth and function of body cells depend on adequate cardiac output to provide a continuous supply of oxygenated blood to meet the changing demands of the organs and body systems. Because the buccal mucosa, nailbeds, lips, and earlobes are sites with rich capillary beds, they should be observed for cyanosis or duskiness as possible signs of reduced heart action. Moist or dry skin may indicate vasodilation or vasoconstriction, respectively. Distention of the neck veins or of the dorsal surface of the hand raised to heart level may signal a changing demand or diminishing capacity of the heart. If cardiac output has fallen, the skin becomes cool, moist, and cyanotic or mottled.

Dysrhythmias, which may arise when poor perfusion of the heart exists, also serve as important indicators of cardiac function. The most common dysrhythmias encountered during the postoperative period are atrial fibrillation, bradycardias, tachycardias, and ectopic beats. Continuous observation of the cardiac monitor for various dysrhythmias is an essential part of patient care and management.

Any indications of decreased cardiac output are reported promptly to the physician. These assessment data and results of diagnostic tests are used by the physician to determine the cause of the problem. After a diagnosis has been made, the physician and the nurse work collaboratively to restore cardiac output and prevent further complications. When indicated, the physician prescribes blood components, fluids, digitalis or other antidysrhythmics, diuretics, vasodilators, or vasopressors. When additional surgery is necessary, the patient and family are prepared for the procedure.

\section*{PROMOTING ADEQUATE GAS EXCHANGE}

To ensure adequate gas exchange, the nurse assesses and maintains the patency of the endotracheal tube. The patient is suctioned when wheezes, coarse crackles, or rhonchi are present. Suctioning may be performed with an in-line suction catheter; the nurse and respiratory therapist determine if the ventilator's fractional inspired oxygen ( $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}$ ) should be increased for three or more breaths before the patient is suctioned. Alternatively, $100 \%$ oxygen is delivered to the patient by a manual resuscitation bag (eg, Ambu-Bag) before and after suctioning to minimize the risk of hypoxia that can result from the suctioning procedure. Arterial blood gas determinations are compared with baseline data, and changes are reported to the physician promptly.

Because a patent airway is essential for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, the endotracheal tube must be secured to prevent it from slipping into the right mainstem bronchus and occluding the left bronchus. When the patient's condition stabilizes, body position is changed every 1 to 2 hours. Frequent changes of patient position provide for optimal pulmonary ventilation and perfusion by allowing the lungs to expand more fully. The nurse assesses breath sounds to detect crackles, wheezes, and fluid in the lungs.

The patient is usually weaned from the ventilator and extubated within 24 hours of CABG. Physical assessment and arterial blood gas results guide the process. Before being extubated, the patient should have cough and gag reflexes and stable vital signs; be able to lift the head off the bed or give firm hand grasps; have adequate vital capacity, negative inspiratory force, and minute volume appropriate for body size; and have acceptable arterial blood gas levels while breathing warmed humidified oxygen without the assistance of the ventilator.

Extubation has been performed within these parameters without any adverse effects on the patient's condition or prognosis.

During this time, the nurse assists with the weaning process and eventually with removal of the endotracheal tube. Deep breathing and forced expiration technique (FET, huffing) or coughing are encouraged at least every 1 to 2 hours after extubation to open the alveolar sacs and provide for increased perfusion. FET is the rapid exhalation of a deep breath using the diaphragm and abdominal muscles to force air out through an open mouth and glottis (the glottis is not held closed then suddenly opened, as in a cough). Patients may experience less pain with FET than coughing, which may increase the frequency with which a patient performs the exercises. The patient should be taught and assisted to splint the chest incision before and during FET or coughing to minimize discomfort.

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}

To promote fluid and electrolyte balance, the nurse carefully assesses intake and output. Flow sheets are used to determine positive or negative fluid balance. All fluid intake is recorded, including intravenous, nasogastric tube, and oral fluids. All output is recorded, including urine, nasogastric drainage, and chest drainage.

Hemodynamic parameters (ie, blood pressure, pulmonary wedge and left atrial pressures, and CVP) are correlated with intake, output, and weight to determine the adequacy of hydration and cardiac output. Serum electrolytes are monitored, and the patient is observed for signs of potassium, magnesium, sodium, or calcium imbalance (ie, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, or hypocalcemia).

Any indications of dehydration, fluid overload, or electrolyte imbalance are reported promptly, and the physician and nurse work collaboratively to restore fluid and electrolyte balance. The patient's response is monitored.

\section*{MINIMIZING SENSORY-PERCEPTION IMBALANCE}

A large number of patients experience abnormal behaviors that occur with varying intensity and duration. In the early years of cardiac surgery, this phenomenon occurred more frequently than it does today. At that time, it was attributed to inadequate cerebral perfusion during surgery, microemboli, and the length of time that the patient remained on the CPB machine. Advances in surgical techniques have significantly decreased these factors. Today, when it occurs, it is thought to be caused by anxiety, sleep deprivation, increased sensory input, and disorientation to night and day when the patient loses track of time (Arrowsmith et al., 1999; Braunwald et al., 2001; Fuster et al., 2001). An important finding is that patients who do not or cannot express anxiety before surgery and those who are not able to sleep postoperatively are more prone to develop psychosis in the postoperative period. Psychosis may appear after a 2- to 5-day lucid interval.

Basic comfort measures used in conjunction with prescribed analgesics potentiate the effects of the analgesics and promote rest. The patient is assisted in changing positions every 1 to 2 hours and is positioned in such a way to avoid strain on incisions and chest tubes. Nursing care is scheduled as much as possible to provide undisturbed periods of rest. As the patient's condition stabilizes and the patient is disturbed less frequently for monitoring and therapeutic procedures, rest periods can be extended. As much uninterrupted sleep as possible is provided, especially during the patient's normal hours of sleep.

The nurse monitors the patient for signs of denial and provides an opportunity for emotional expression during the preoperative period. Careful explanations of all procedures and of the need for cooperation help to keep the patient oriented throughout the postoperative course. Continuity of care is desirable; a familiar face
and a nursing staff with a consistent approach promote the delivery of quality nursing care. A well-designed and individualized plan of nursing care can assist the nursing team in coordinating their efforts for the emotional well-being of the patient.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Deep pain may not be reflected in the immediate area of injury but occur in a broader, more diffuse area. Patients who have had cardiac surgery experience pain caused by the interruption of intercostal nerves along the incision route and irritation of the pleura by the chest catheters. Incisional pain may also be experienced from peripheral vein or artery graft harvest sites.

It is essential to observe and listen to the patient for verbal and nonverbal clues about pain. The nurse accurately records the nature, type, location, and duration of the pain. (Chest incisional pain must be differentiated from anginal pain.) The patient is encouraged to use patient-controlled analgesia or accept medication as often as it is prescribed to reduce the amount of pain. Physical support of the incision during deep breathing and FET (or coughing) also helps to minimize pain. The patient should then be able to participate in respiratory exercises and to increase self-care progressively.

Pain produces tension, which may stimulate the central nervous system to release adrenaline, which results in constriction of the arterioles and increased heart rate. This can cause increased afterload and decreased cardiac output. Opioids alleviate anxiety and pain and induce sleep, which reduces the metabolic rate and oxygen demands. After the administration of opioids, any observations indicating relief of apprehension and pain are documented in the patient's record. The patient is observed for any respiratory depressant effects of the analgesic. If respiratory depression occurs, an opioid antagonist (eg, naloxone [Narcan]) is used to counteract the effect.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE TISSUE PERFUSION}

Peripheral pulses (eg, pedal, tibial, popliteal, femoral, radial, brachial) are routinely palpated to assess for arterial obstruction. If a pulse is absent in any extremity, the cause may be prior catheterization of that extremity. The newly identified absence of any pulse is immediately reported to the physician.

Thrombus formation and resulting embolus formation also can result from injury to the intima of the blood vessels, dislodging a clot from a damaged valve, loosening of mural thrombi, and coagulation problems. Air embolism may occur as a result of CPB or central venous cannulation. Symptoms of embolization vary according to site. The usual embolic sites are the lungs, coronary arteries, mesentery, spleen, extremities, kidneys, and brain. The patient is observed for:
- Chest pain and respiratory distress with pulmonary embolus or MI
- Midabdominal or midback pain
- Pain, cessation of pulses, blanching, numbness, or coldness in an extremity
- Decreased urine output
- One-sided weakness and pupillary changes, as occur in CVAs (brain attacks, strokes)

All such symptoms are promptly reported to the physician.
After surgery, the following measures are taken to prevent venous stasis, which can cause thrombus formation and subsequent embolization:
- Applying elastic compression stockings or elastic bandage wrap and pneumatic antiembolic stockings
- Discouraging crossing of legs
- Avoiding use of the knee gatch on the bed
- Omitting pillows in the popliteal space
- Instituting passive exercises followed by active exercises to promote circulation and prevent loss of muscle tone (patients need to ambulate as early as possible)

Inadequate renal perfusion can occur as a complication of cardiac surgery. One possible cause is low cardiac output. Trauma to blood cells during CPB can cause hemolysis of red blood cells, which then occlude the renal glomeruli. Use of vasopressor agents to increase blood pressure may constrict the renal arterioles and reduce blood flow to the kidneys.

Nursing management includes accurate measurement of urine output. An output of less than $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ may indicate hypovolemia. Urine specific gravity can be monitored to determine the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine in the renal tubules. Rapidacting diuretics or inotropic medications (eg, digoxin [Lanoxin], isoproterenol [Isuprel]) may be prescribed to increase cardiac output and renal blood flow. The nurse should be aware of the patient's blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urine and serum electrolyte levels. Abnormal levels are reported promptly because it may be necessary to adjust fluids and the dose or type of medication administered. If efforts to maintain renal perfusion are not effective, the patient may require dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (see Chap. 44).

\section*{MAINTAINING NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE}

Patients are usually hypothermic when admitted to the critical care unit from the cardiac surgical procedure. The patient must be gradually warmed to a normal temperature. This is accomplished partially by the patient's own basal metabolic processes and often with the assistance of warmed ventilator air, warm air or warm cotton blankets, or heat lamps. While the patient is hypothermic, the clotting process is less efficient, the heart is prone to dysrhythmias, and oxygen does not readily transfer from the hemoglobin to the tissues. Because anesthesia and hypothermia suppress the basal metabolism, oxygen supply usually meets the cellular demand.

After cardiac surgery, the patient is at risk for developing elevated body temperature caused by infection or postpericardiotomy syndrome. The resultant increase in metabolic rate increases tissue oxygen demands and increases cardiac workload. Measures are taken to prevent this sequence of events or to halt it as soon as it is recognized.

Sites of infection include the lungs, urinary tract, incisions, and intravascular catheters. Meticulous care is used to prevent contamination at the sites of catheter and tube insertions. Aseptic technique is used when changing dressings and when providing endotracheal tube and catheter care. Clearance of pulmonary secretions is accomplished by frequent repositioning of the patient, suctioning, and chest physical therapy, as well as teaching and encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and use FET (or cough). Closed systems are used to maintain all intravenous and arterial lines. All invasive equipment is discontinued as soon as possible after surgery.

Postpericardiotomy syndrome occurs in approximately $10 \%$ to $40 \%$ of patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Although the precise cause is unknown, a common factor appears to be trauma, with residual blood in the pericardial sac after surgery. The syndrome is characterized by fever, pericardial pain, pleural pain, dyspnea, pericardial effusion, pericardial friction rub, and arthralgia. There may be a combination of these signs and symptoms.

Leukocytosis occurs, along with elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These symptoms frequently appear after the patient is discharged from the hospital.

The syndrome must be differentiated from other postoperative complications (eg, infection, incisional pain, MI, pulmonary embolus, bacterial endocarditis, pneumonia, atelectasis). Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms. Bed rest and antiinflammatory agents, such as salicylates and corticosteroids, produce a dramatic improvement in symptoms.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Depending on the type of surgery and postoperative progress, the patient may be discharged from the hospital as early as 1 day after MIDCAB and 3 days after other surgery. Although the patient may be anxious to return home, the patient and family usually have apprehensions about this transition. The family members often express the fear that they are not capable of caring for the patient at home. They often are concerned that complications will occur that they are unprepared to handle.

The nurse helps the patient and family to set realistic, achievable goals. A teaching plan that meets the patient's individual needs is developed with the patient and family. This is done before admission and reviewed each shift through the hospitalization or with each home care and rehabilitation contact. Specific instructions are provided about incision care; signs and symptoms of infection; diet; activity progression and exercise; deep breathing, FET (or coughing), incentive spirometry; and smoking cessation; weight and temperature monitoring; the medication regimen; and follow-up visits with home care nurses, the rehabilitation personnel, the surgeon, and the cardiologist or internist.

Some patients may have difficulty learning and retaining information after cardiac surgery. Studies have documented that many patients have difficulties in cognitive function after cardiac surgery that do not occur after other types of major surgery (Arrowsmith et al., 1999; Roach et al., 1996). The patient may experience recent memory loss, short attention span, difficulty with simple math, poor handwriting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these difficulties often become frustrated when they try to resume normal activities and learn how to care for themselves at home. The patient and family are reassured that the difficulty is temporary and will subside, usually in 6 to 8 weeks. In the meantime, instructions are given to the patient at a much slower pace than normal, and a family member assumes responsibility for making sure that the prescribed regimen is followed. All information is provided in writing in the patient's primary language.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Arrangements are made for a home care nurse to provide care when appropriate. Since the length of time that the patient remains in the hospital is relatively short, it is particularly important for the nurse to assess the patient's and family's ability to manage care in the home. The education plan is continued by the home care nurse. Vital signs and incisions are monitored, the patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of complications, and support for the patient and family is provided. Additional interventions may include dressing changes, intravenous antibiotic administration, diet counseling, and tobacco use cessation strategies. Patients and families need to know that cardiac surgery did not cure the patient's underlying heart disease. Lifestyle changes for risk factor reduction must be made, and medications taken preoperatively may be prescribed postoperatively.

Weaver, L. A., \& Doran, K. A. (2001). Telephone follow-up after cardiac surgery. American Journal of Nursing, 101(5), $24 \mathrm{OO}-24 \mathrm{WW}$.

\section*{Purpose}

Hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients after cardiac surgery may be 3 or 4 days. Formal patient/family education programs describing how to care for the patient at home are often provided during the hospitalization. These researchers identified that no health care professionals were contacting or seeing patients for 2 to 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital. The researchers implemented a telephone follow-up program. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the telephone followup program for patients who had undergone cardiac surgery.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A convenience sample of heart surgery patients was selected, 46 of whom received usual care (control patients) and 44 of whom received usual care and postdischarge follow-up telephone calls (intervention patients). Patients in the intervention group were called by a cardiovascular stepdown unit registered nurse within 2 days after discharge, and then once a week for 1 month. At the end of this period, each participant was mailed a questionnaire to measure patient satisfaction, depression, recidivism, and complications. Patient satisfaction was measured with a modified four-question survey, the Continuity and Transition Dimensions, Picker Institute Survey. Depression was measured with a modified 15-question survey, the Geriatric Depression Scale. Recidivism was measured by the number of emergency department visits and hospital admissions during the 30 days after discharge from the hospital for cardiac surgery. Complications were self-reported by the participants.

\section*{Findings}

Patient satisfaction in the intervention group was at least $10 \%$ higher than in the control group for three of four variables, but the
results were not statistically significant. Twenty-two percent of the control group and $18 \%$ of the intervention group were readmitted or made emergency department visits during the first 30 days after discharge (recidivism); this difference in incidence was not statistically significant. There were no differences in the rate of depression or complications between the groups. The nurses who conducted the follow-up telephone program reported that they provided reassurance and support in each phone call. They provided reinforcement and clarification of postoperative education regarding leg swelling ( $31 \%$ ), pain medication ( $23 \%$ ), weight-taking and knowing when to call a health care provider ( $16 \%$ ), and medication teaching ( $100 \%$ ). The nurses also made referrals (to physicians, cardiac rehabilitation programs, dietitians, tobacco intervention programs $[7 \%])$ and coached patients with questions they wanted to ask their physicians ( $12 \%$ ).

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Telephone calls by step-down unit registered nurses to cardiac surgery patients after hospital discharge increase patient satisfaction (although not to statistical significance) and provide opportunities for reassurance and patient education. Development and use of scripts (algorithms, decision tree standards) may be helpful to the nurse making the telephone calls and facilitate consistency in the information provided to the patient. Script topics suggested by this study include incision care, leg swelling, fever, weight measurements and when to call a health care provider, pain management, medications (especially warfarin [Coumadin]), dysrhythmias, fluid status, constipation, nutrition, sleep, and depression.

Patient teaching does not end at the time of discharge from home health. The patient is encouraged to maintain telephone contact with the surgeon, cardiologist, and nurses. This provides the patient and family with reassurance that questions can be answered and problems can be resolved if they arise. Many hospitals provide family support sessions that help family members cope with their own stress related to the patient's home health care management. The patient is expected to have a follow-up visit with the surgeon.

Many patients and families benefit from supportive programs such as the postcardiac surgery rehabilitation programs offered by many medical centers. These programs provide exercise monitoring; instructions about diet and stress reduction; information about resuming exercise, work, driving, and sexual activity; assistance with tobacco use cessation; and support groups for patients and families. The American Heart Association sponsors the Mended Hearts Club, which provides information as well as an opportunity for families to share experiences.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

\section*{Expected patient outcomes may include the following:}
1. Maintains adequate cardiac output
2. Maintains adequate gas exchange
3. Maintains fluid (and electrolyte) balance
4. Experiences decreased symptoms of sensory-perception disturbances
5. Experiences relief of pain
6. Maintains adequate tissue perfusion
7. Maintains normal body temperature
8. Performs self-care activities

A typical plan of postoperative nursing care and more-detailed expected outcomes for the cardiac surgery patient are presented in the Plan of Nursing Care, on pages 740-745.

\section*{?critical thinking Exercises}
1. You are caring for a patient who has undergone a PTCA with stent placement. The patient suddenly develops chest discomfort. In addition to the characteristics of the chest discomfort, identify the key factors that need to be assessed. Describe the actions that you would take and state why.
2. You are caring for a patient who is scheduled to have MIDCAB surgery. He appears quite anxious and states that he is afraid he will need to have traditional CABG surgery as discussed in obtaining informed consent. He states he does not want to have his "whole sternum cut open." His wife tends to minimize the significance of his concerns, commenting that, as the surgeon explained it, the possibility of having a traditional CABG is very small. How would you respond to
this patient and his wife? How might your response differ if the wife shares her husband's concerns?
3. You are caring for a patient who underwent traditional CABG surgery 2 days ago and is progressing well. After ambulating in the corridor with his daughter, he returns to his room and notices that the dressing on his saphenous vein site is stained with bright red blood. His daughter is visibly upset. Explain what your first action will be and why. If your initial actions do not achieve the desired outcome, how would you proceed? How would you explain the episode to the daughter to help her understand the bleeding?
4. You are caring for two patients, both of whom were hospitalized for acute MI. One patient lives in his home with a supportive family, the other patient is homeless and living on the street. How does your plan of care and patient teaching differ for these patients?

\title{
Management of Patients With Structural, Infectious, and Inflammatory Cardiac Disorders
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Define valvular disorders of the heart and describe the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of patients with mitral and aortic disorders.
2. Describe types of cardiac valve repair and replacement procedures used to treat valvular problems and the care needed by patients who undergo these procedures.
3. Describe the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of patients with cardiomyopathies.
4. Describe the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of patients with infections of the heart.
5. Describe the rationale for prophylactic antibiotic therapy for patients with mitral valve prolapse, valvular heart disease, rheumatic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, and myocarditis.
tructural disorders of the heart present many challenges for the patient, family, and health care team, as do the conduction and vascular disorders discussed in Chapters 27 and 28. Problems with the heart valves, holes in the intracardiac septum, cardiomyopathies, and infectious diseases of the heart muscle alter cardiac output. Treatments for these diagnoses may be noninvasive, such as medication therapy and activity and dietary modification. Invasive treatments, such as valve repair or replacement, septal repair, ventricular assist devices, total artificial hearts, cardiac transplantation, and other procedures may also be used. Nurses have an integral role in the care of patients with structural, infectious, and inflammatory cardiac conditions.

\section*{Acquired Valvular Disorders}

The valves of the heart control the flow of blood through the heart into the pulmonary artery and aorta by opening and closing in response to the blood pressure changes as the heart contracts and relaxes through the cardiac cycle.

The atrioventricular valves separate the atria from the ventricles and include the tricuspid valve, which separates the right atrium from the right ventricle, and the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium from the left ventricle. The tricuspid valve has three leaflets; the mitral valve has two. Both valves have chordae tendineae that anchor the valve leaflets to the papillary muscles and ventricular wall.

The semilunar valves are located between the ventricles and their corresponding arteries. The pulmonic valve lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery; the aortic valve lies between the left ventricle and the aorta. Figure 29-1 shows valves in the closed position.

When any of the heart valves do not close or open properly, blood flow is affected. When valves do not close completely, blood flows backward through the valve in a process called regurgitation. When valves do not open completely, a condition called stenosis, the flow of blood through the valve is reduced.

Disorders of the mitral valve fall into the following categories: mitral valve prolapse (ie, stretching of the valve leaflet into the
atrium during systole), mitral regurgitation, and mitral stenosis. Disorders of the aortic valve are categorized as aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis. These valvular disorders lead to various symptoms that, depending on their severity, may require surgical repair or replacement of the valve to correct the problem (Fig. 29-2). Tricuspid and pulmonic valve disorders also occur, usually with fewer symptoms and complications. Regurgitation and stenosis may occur at the same time in the same or different valves.

\section*{MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE}

Mitral valve prolapse, formerly known as mitral prolapse syndrome, is a deformity that usually produces no symptoms. Rarely, it progresses and can result in sudden death. Mitral valve prolapse occurs more frequently in women than in men. In recent years, this disorder has been diagnosed more frequently, probably as a result of improved diagnostic methods.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In mitral valve prolapse, a portion of a mitral valve leaflet balloons back into the atrium during systole. Rarely, the ballooning stretches the leaflet to the point that the valve does not remain closed during systole (ie, ventricular contraction). Blood then regurgitates from the left ventricle back into the left atrium (Braunwald et al., 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many people have a ballooned leaflet but no symptoms. Others have symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, light-headedness, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, chest pain, and anxiety (Braunwald et al., 2001; Freed et al., 1999; Fuster et al., 2001).

Fatigue may occur regardless of the person's activity level and amount of rest or sleep. Shortness of breath is not correlated with activity levels or pulmonary function. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias may produce the sensation of palpitations, but palpi-

tations have been reported while the heart has been beating normally. Another puzzling symptom is chest pain, which is often localized to the chest and may last for days.

Anxiety may be a response to the symptoms experienced by the patient; however, some patients report anxiety as the only
symptom. Some clinicians speculate that the symptoms may be explained by dysautonomia, a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, although no consensus exists about the cause of the symptoms experienced by some patients with mitral valve prolapse.

\end{figure}

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Often, the first and only sign of mitral valve prolapse is identified when a physical examination of the heart discloses an extra heart sound, referred to as a mitral click. The systolic click is an early sign that a valve leaflet is ballooning into the left atrium. In addition to the mitral click, a murmur of mitral regurgitation may be heard if progressive valve leaflet stretching and regurgitation have occurred. A small number of patients experience signs and symptoms of heart failure if mitral regurgitation exists.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical management is directed at controlling symptoms. If dysrhythmias are documented and cause symptoms, the patient is advised to eliminate caffeine and alcohol from the diet and to stop smoking; antiarrhythmic medications may be prescribed.

Chest pain that does not respond to nitrates may respond to calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers. Heart failure is treated the same as it would be for any other patient with heart failure (see Chap. 30). In advanced stages of disease, mitral valve repair or replacement may be necessary.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse educates patients about the diagnosis and the possibility that the condition is hereditary. Because most patients with mitral valve prolapse are asymptomatic, the nurse explains the need to inform the health care provider about any symptoms that may develop. The nurse also instructs patients about the need for prophylactic antibiotic therapy before undergoing invasive procedures (eg, dental work, genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures) that may introduce infectious agents systemically. This therapy is prescribed for symptomatic patients and for asymptomatic patients who have both a systolic click and murmur or mitral regurgitation. If in doubt about risk factors and the need for antibiotics, patients should consult their physicians.

To minimize symptoms, the nurse teaches patients to avoid caffeine and alcohol. The nurse encourages patients to read product labels, particularly in over-the-counter products such as cough medicine, because these products may contain alcohol, caffeine, ephedrine, and epinephrine, which may produce dysrhythmias and other symptoms. Dysrhythmias, chest pain, heart failure, or other complications of mitral valve prolapse are treated as described in Chapter 30. The nurse also explores with patients possible diet, activity, sleep, and other lifestyle factors that may correlate with symptoms experienced.

\section*{MITRAL REGURGITATION}

Mitral regurgitation involves blood flowing back from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole. Often, the margins of the mitral valve cannot close during systole.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Mitral regurgitation may be caused by problems with one or more of the leaflets, the chordae tendineae, the annulus, or the papillary muscles. A mitral valve leaflet may shorten or tear. The chordae tendineae may elongate, shorten, or tear. The annulus may be stretched by heart enlargement or deformed by calcification. The papillary muscle may rupture, stretch, or be pulled out of position by changes in the ventricular wall (eg, scar from a

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 29-1 \\ Mitral Valwe Prolapse Support Group}

Scordo, K. A. B. (2001). Factors associated with participating in a mitral valve prolapse support group. Heart Lung, 30(2), 128-137.

\section*{Purpose}

The purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence a patient's attendance at mitral valve prolapse support groups.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Questionnaires were used for this descriptive study of mitral valve support group leaders, current and former support group participants, and nonparticipants, all of whom had a diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse. A total of 376 questionnaires were analyzed.

\section*{Findings}

People with mitral valve prolapse were more likely to participate in support groups if they were older than 50 years of age and participated in other self-help groups. The reason for attending was to obtain more information about mitral valve prolapse, information not usually available from family, friends, and physicians. No relationship was found between participation in a support group and patient gender, education level, marital status, age when first diagnosed, age when symptoms were first experienced, perceived social support, any symptoms experienced, or travel time or distance required to participate in the support group.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses need to be aware that patients with mitral valve prolapse desire information about the condition, and not just at the time of diagnosis or development of symptoms. Nurses can provide education and facilitate support groups. Patients older than 50 years of age and those who participate in other self-help groups may be particularly interested in mitral valve prolapse support groups.
myocardial infarction or ventricular dilation). The papillary muscle may be unable to contract because of ischemia. Regardless of the cause, blood regurgitates back into the atrium during systole.

With each beat of the left ventricle, some of the blood is forced back into the left atrium. Because this blood is added to the blood that is beginning to flow in from the lungs, the left atrium must stretch. It eventually hypertrophies and dilates. The backward flow of blood from the ventricle diminishes the volume of blood flowing into the atrium from the lungs. As a result, the lungs become congested, eventually adding extra strain on the right ventricle. Mitral regurgitation ultimately involves the lungs and the right ventricle.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Chronic mitral regurgitation is often asymptomatic, but acute mitral regurgitation (eg, that resulting from a myocardial infarction) usually manifests as severe congestive heart failure. Dyspnea, fatigue, and weakness are the most common symptoms. Palpitations, shortness of breath on exertion, and cough from pulmonary congestion also occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A systolic murmur is heard as a high-pitched, blowing sound at the apex. The pulse may be regular and of good volume, or it may be irregular as a result of extrasystolic beats or atrial fibrillation.

Echocardiography is used to diagnose and monitor the progression of mitral regurgitation.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of mitral regurgitation is the same as that for congestive heart failure. Surgical intervention consists of mitral valve replacement or valvuloplasty (ie, surgical repair of the heart valve).

\section*{MITRAL STENOSIS}

Mitral stenosis is an obstruction of blood flowing from the left atrium into the left ventricle. It is most often caused by rheumatic endocarditis, which progressively thickens the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae. The leaflets often fuse together. Eventually, the mitral valve orifice narrows and progressively obstructs blood flow into the ventricle.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Normally, the mitral valve opening is as wide as the diameter of three fingers. In cases of marked stenosis, the opening narrows to the width of a pencil. The left atrium has great difficulty moving blood into the ventricle because of the increased resistance of the narrowed orifice; it dilates (stretches) and hypertrophies (thickens) because of the increased blood volume it holds. Because there is no valve to protect the pulmonary veins from the backward flow of blood from the atrium, the pulmonary circulation becomes congested. As a result, the right ventricle must contract against an abnormally high pulmonary arterial pressure and is subjected to excessive strain. Eventually, the right ventricle fails.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The first symptom of mitral stenosis is often breathing difficulty (ie, dyspnea) on exertion as a result of pulmonary venous hypertension. Patients with mitral stenosis are likely to show progressive fatigue as a result of low cardiac output. They may expectorate blood (ie, hemoptysis), cough, and experience repeated respiratory infections.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The pulse is weak and often irregular because of atrial fibrillation (caused by the strain on the atrium). A low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur is heard at the apex. As a result of the increased blood volume and pressure, the atrium dilates, hypertrophies, and becomes electrically unstable, and the patient experiences atrial dysrhythmias. Echocardiography is used to diagnose mitral stenosis. Electrocardiography (ECG) and cardiac catheterization with angiography are used to determine the severity of the mitral stenosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Antibiotic prophylaxis therapy is instituted to prevent recurrence of infections. Congestive heart failure is treated as described in Chapter 30. Patients with mitral stenosis may benefit from anticoagulants to decrease the risk for developing atrial thrombus. They may also require treatment for anemia.

Surgical intervention consists of valvuloplasty, usually a commissurotomy to open or rupture the fused commissures of the mitral valve. Percutaneous transluminal valvuloplasty or mitral valve replacement may be performed.

\section*{AORTIC REGURGITATION}

Aortic regurgitation is the flow of blood back into the left ventricle from the aorta during diastole. It may be caused by inflammatory lesions that deform the leaflets of the aortic valve, preventing them from completely closing the aortic valve orifice. This valvular defect also may result from endocarditis, congenital abnormalities, diseases such as syphilis, a dissecting aneurysm that causes dilation or tearing of the ascending aorta, or deterioration of an aortic valve replacement.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In aortic regurgitation, blood from the aorta returns to the left ventricle during diastole in addition to the blood normally delivered by the left atrium. The left ventricle dilates, trying to accommodate the increased volume of blood. It also hypertrophies, trying to increase muscle strength to expel more blood with abovenormal force-raising systolic blood pressure. The arteries attempt to compensate for the higher pressures by reflex vasodilation; the peripheral arterioles relax, reducing peripheral resistance and diastolic blood pressure.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Aortic insufficiency develops without symptoms in most patients. Some patients are aware of a forceful heartbeat, especially in the head or neck. There may be marked arterial pulsations that are visible or palpable at the carotid or temporal arteries. This is a result of the increased force and volume of the blood ejected from the hypertrophied left ventricle. Exertional dyspnea and fatigue follow. Progressive signs and symptoms of left ventricular failure include breathing difficulties (eg, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), especially at night.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A diastolic murmur is heard as a high-pitched, blowing sound at the third or fourth intercostal space at the left sternal border. The pulse pressure (ie, difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) is considerably widened in patients with aortic regurgitation. One characteristic sign of the disease is the water-hammer pulse, in which the pulse strikes the palpating finger with a quick, sharp stroke and then suddenly collapses. Diagnosis may be confirmed by echocardiogram, radionuclide imaging, ECG, magnetic resonance imaging, and cardiac catheterization.

\section*{Medical Management}

Before the patient undergoes invasive or dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis is needed to prevent endocarditis. Heart failure and dysrhythmias are treated as described in Chapters 27 and 30. Aortic valvuloplasty or valve replacement is the treatment of choice, preferably performed before left ventricular failure. Surgery is recommended for any patient with left ventricular hypertrophy, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms.

\section*{AORTIC STENOSIS}

Aortic valve stenosis is narrowing of the orifice between the left ventricle and the aorta. In adults, the stenosis may involve congenital leaflet malformations or an abnormal number of leaflets (ie, one or two rather than three), or it may result from rheumatic
endocarditis or cusp calcification of unknown cause. The leaflets of the aortic valve may fuse.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

There is progressive narrowing of the valve orifice, usually over a period of several years to several decades. The left ventricle overcomes the obstruction to circulation by contracting more slowly but with greater energy than normal, forcibly squeezing the blood through the very small orifice. The obstruction to left ventricular outflow increases pressure on the left ventricle, which results in thickening of the muscle wall. The heart muscle hypertrophies. When these compensatory mechanisms of the heart begin to fail, clinical signs and symptoms develop.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many patients with aortic stenosis are asymptomatic. After symptoms develop, patients usually first have exertional dyspnea, caused by left ventricular failure. Other signs are dizziness and syncope because of reduced blood flow to the brain. Angina pectoris is a frequent symptom that results from the increased oxygen demands of the hypertrophied left ventricle, the decreased time in diastole for myocardial perfusion, and the decreased blood flow into the coronary arteries. Blood pressure can be low but is usually normal; there may be a low pulse pressure ( 30 mm Hg or less) because of diminished blood flow.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

On physical examination, a loud, rough systolic murmur may be heard over the aortic area. The sound to listen for is a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur, which may radiate into the carotid arteries and to the apex of the left ventricle. The murmur is low-pitched, rough, rasping, and vibrating. If the examiner rests a hand over the base of the heart, a vibration may be felt. The vibration is caused by turbulent blood flow across the narrowed valve orifice. Evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy may be seen on a 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram.

Echocardiography is used to diagnose and monitor the progression of aortic stenosis. After the stenosis progresses to the point that surgical intervention is considered, left-sided heart catheterization is necessary to measure the severity of the valvular abnormality and evaluate the coronary arteries. Pressure tracings are taken from the left ventricle and the base of the aorta. The systolic pressure in the left ventricle is considerably higher than that in the aorta during systole.

\section*{Medical Management}

Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis is essential for anyone with aortic stenosis. After left ventricular failure or dysrhythmias occur, medications are prescribed. Definitive treatment for aortic stenosis is surgical replacement of the aortic valve. Patients who are symptomatic and are not surgical candidates may benefit from one- or two-balloon percutaneous valvuloplasty procedures.

\section*{VALVULAR HEART DISORDERS: NURSING MANAGEMENT}

The nurse teaches all patients with valvular heart disease about the diagnosis, the progressive nature of valvular heart disease, and the treatment plan. The patient is taught to report any new symp-
toms or changes in symptoms to the health care provider. The nurse emphasizes the need for prophylactic antibiotic therapy before any invasive procedure (eg, dental work, genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedure) that may introduce infectious agents to the patient's bloodstream. The patient is taught that the infectious agent, usually a bacterium, is able to adhere to the diseased heart valve more readily than to a normal valve. Once attached to the valve, the infectious agent multiplies, resulting in endocarditis and further damage to the valve.

The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are measured and compared with previous data for any changes. Heart and lung sounds are auscultated and peripheral pulses palpated. The nurse assesses patients with valvular heart disease for signs and symptoms of heart failure: fatigue, dyspnea with exertion, an increase in coughing, hemoptysis, multiple respiratory infections, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (see Chap. 30). The nurse assesses for dysrhythmias by palpating the patient's pulse for strength and rhythm (ie, regular or irregular) and asks if the patient has experienced palpitations or felt forceful heartbeats (see Chap. 27). The nurse also assesses for dizziness, syncope, increased weakness, or angina pectoris (see Chap. 28).

The nurse collaborates with the patient to develop a medication schedule and teaches about the name, dosage, actions, side effects, and any drug-drug or drug-food interactions of the prescribed medications for heart failure, dysrhythmias, angina pectoris, or other symptoms. The nurse teaches the patient to weigh daily and report the gain of 2 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 1 week to the health care provider. The nurse may assist the patient with planning activity and rest periods to achieve a lifestyle acceptable to the patient. If the patient is to have surgical valve replacement or valvuloplasty, the nurse teaches the patient about the procedure and anticipated recovery.

\section*{Valve Repair and Replacement Procedures}
\section*{VALVULOPLASTY}

The repair, rather than replacement, of a cardiac valve is referred to as valvuloplasty. The type of valvuloplasty depends on the cause and type of valve dysfunction. Repair may be made to the commissures between the leaflets in a procedure known as commissurotomy, to the annulus of the valve by annuloplasty, to the leaflets, or to the chordae by chordoplasty.

Most valvuloplasty procedures require general anesthesia and often require cardiopulmonary bypass. Some procedures, however, can be performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory; these procedures do not always require general anesthesia or cardiopulmonary bypass. Percutaneous partial cardiopulmonary bypass is used in some cardiac catheterization laboratories. The cardiopulmonary bypass is achieved by inserting a large catheter (ie, cannula) into two peripheral blood vessels, usually a femoral vein and an artery. Blood is diverted from the body through the venous catheter to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine (see Chap. 28) and returned to the patient through the arterial catheter.

The patient is usually managed in a critical care unit for the first 24 to 72 hours after surgery. Care focuses on hemodynamic stabilization and recovery from anesthesia. Vital signs are assessed every 5 to 15 minutes and as needed until the patient recovers from anesthesia or sedation and then every 2 to 4 hours and as needed. Intravenous medications to increase or decrease blood pressure and to treat dysrhythmias or altered heart rates are administered, and their effects are monitored. The intravenous medications are gradually decreased until they are no longer re-
quired or the patient takes needed medication by another route (eg, oral, topical). Patient assessments are conducted every 1 to 4 hours and as needed, with particular attention to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular assessments.

After the patient has recovered from anesthesia and sedation, is hemodynamically stable without intravenous medications, and assessments are stable, the patient is usually transferred to a telemetry or surgical unit for continued postsurgical care and teaching. The nurse provides wound care and patient teaching regarding diet, activity, medications, and self-care. Patients are discharged from the hospital in 1 to 7 days. In general, valves that have undergone valvuloplasty function longer than replacement valves, and the patients do not require continuous anticoagulation.

\section*{Commissurotomy}

The most common valvuloplasty procedure is commissurotomy. Each valve has leaflets; the site where the leaflets meet is called the commissure. The leaflets may adhere to one another and close the commissure (ie, stenosis). Less commonly, the leaflets fuse in such a way that, in addition to stenosis, the leaflets are also prevented from closing completely, resulting in a backward flow of blood (ie, regurgitation). A commissurotomy is the procedure performed to separate the fused leaflets.

\section*{CLOSED COMMISSUROTOMY}

Closed commissurotomies do not require cardiopulmonary bypass. The valve is not directly visualized. The patient receives a general anesthetic, a midsternal incision is made, a small hole is cut into the heart, and the surgeon's finger or a dilator is used to break open the commissure. This type of commissurotomy has been performed for mitral, aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonary valve disease.

Balloon Valvuloplasty. Balloon valvuloplasty (Fig. 29-3) is another type of closed commissurotomy beneficial for mitral valve stenosis in younger patients, for aortic valve stenosis in elderly patients, and for patients with complex medical conditions that place them at high risk for the complications of more extensive surgical procedures. Most commonly used for mitral and aortic valve stenosis, balloon valvuloplasty also has been used for tricuspid and pulmonic valve stenosis. The procedure is performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and the patient may receive a local anesthetic. Patients remain in the hospital 24 to 48 hours after the procedure.

Mitral valvuloplasty is contraindicated for patients with left atrial or ventricular thrombus, severe aortic root dilation, significant mitral valve regurgitation, thoracolumbar scoliosis, rotation of the great vessels, and other cardiac conditions that require open heart surgery.

Mitral balloon valvuloplasty involves advancing one or two catheters into the right atrium, through the atrial septum into the left atrium, across the mitral valve into the left ventricle, and out into the aorta. A guide wire is placed through each catheter, and the original catheter is removed. A large balloon catheter is then placed over the guide wire and positioned with the balloon across the mitral valve. The balloon is then inflated with a dilute angiographic solution. When two balloons are used, they are inflated simultaneously. The advantage of two balloons is that they are each smaller than the one large balloon often used, making smaller atrial septal defects. As the balloons are inflated, they usually do not completely occlude the mitral valve, thereby permitting some forward flow of blood during the inflation period.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

All patients have some degree of mitral regurgitation after the procedure. Other possible complications include bleeding from the catheter insertion sites, emboli resulting in complications such as strokes, and rarely, left-to-right atrial shunts through an atrial septal defect caused by the procedure.

Aortic balloon valvuloplasty also may be performed by passing the balloon or balloons through the atrial septum, but it is performed more commonly by introducing a catheter through the aorta, across the aortic valve, and into the left ventricle. The oneballoon or the two-balloon technique can be used for treating aortic stenosis. The aortic procedure is not as effective as the procedure for the mitral valve, and the rate of restenosis is nearly $50 \%$ in the first 12 to 15 months after the procedure (Braunwald et al., 2001). Possible complications include aortic regurgitation, emboli, ventricular perforation, rupture of the aortic valve annulus, ventricular dysrhythmias, mitral valve damage, and bleeding from the catheter insertion sites.

\section*{OPEN COMMISSUROTOMY}

Open commissurotomies are performed with direct visualization of the valve. The patient is under general anesthesia, and a median sternotomy or left thoracic incision is made. Cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated, and an incision is made into the heart. A finger, scalpel, balloon, or dilator may be used to open the commissures. An added advantage of direct visualization of the valve is that thrombus may be identified and removed, calcifications can be seen, and if the valve has chordae or papillary muscles, they may be surgically repaired (chordoplasty is discussed later in this chapter).

\section*{Annuloplasty}

Annuloplasty is the repair of the valve annulus (ie, junction of the valve leaflets and the muscular heart wall). General anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass are required for all annuloplasties. The procedure narrows the diameter of the valve's orifice and is useful for the treatment of valvular regurgitation.

There are two annuloplasty techniques. One technique uses an annuloplasty ring (Fig. 29-4). The leaflets of the valve are sutured to a ring, creating an annulus of the desired size. When the ring is in place, the tension created by the moving blood and contracting heart is borne by the ring rather than by the valve or a suture line, and progressive regurgitation is prevented by the repair. The other technique involves tacking the valve leaflets to the atrium with sutures or taking tucks to tighten the annulus. Because the valve's leaflets and the suture lines are subjected to the direct forces of the blood and heart muscle movement, the repair may degenerate more quickly than with the annuloplasty ring technique.

\section*{Leaflet Repair}

Damage to cardiac valve leaflets may result from stretching, shortening, or tearing. Leaflet repair for elongated, ballooning, or other excess tissue leaflets is removal of the extra tissue. The elongated tissue may be folded over onto itself (ie, tucked) and sutured (ie, leaflet plication). A wedge of tissue may be cut from the middle of the leaflet and the gap sutured closed (ie., leaflet resection) (Fig. 29-5). Short leaflets are most often repaired by chordoplasty. After the short chordae are released, the leaflets often unfurl and can resume their normal function of closing the valve during systole. A piece of pericardium may also be sutured to extend the leaflet. A pericardial patch may be used to repair holes in the leaflets.

\section*{Chordoplasty}

Chordoplasty is the repair of the chordae tendineae. The mitral valve is involved with chordoplasty (because it has the chordae tendineae); seldom is chordoplasty required for the tricuspid valve.

Regurgitation may be caused by stretched, torn, or shortened chordae tendineae. Stretched chordae tendineae can be shortened, torn ones can be reattached to the leaflet, and shortened ones can be elongated. Regurgitation may also be caused by stretched papillary muscles, which can be shortened.

\section*{VALVE REPLACEMENT}

Prosthetic valve replacement began in the 1960s. When valvuloplasty or valve repair is not a viable alternative, such as when the annulus or leaflets of the valve are immobilized by calcifications, valve replacement is performed. General anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass are used for all valve replacements. Most procedures are performed through a median sternotomy (ie, incision through the sternum), although the mitral valve may be approached through a right thoracotomy incision.

After the valve is visualized, the leaflets and other valve structures, such as the chordae and papillary muscles, are removed. Some surgeons leave the posterior mitral valve leaflet, its chordae, and papillary muscles in place to help maintain the shape and function of the left ventricle after mitral valve replacement. Sutures are placed around the annulus and then into the valve prosthesis. The replacement valve is slid down the suture into position and tied into place (Fig. 29-6). The incision is closed, and the surgeon evaluates the function of the heart and the quality of the prosthetic repair. The patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, and surgery is completed.

Before surgery, the heart gradually adjusted to the pathology, but the surgery abruptly "corrects" the way blood flows through the heart. Complications unique to valve replacement are related to the sudden changes in intracardiac blood pressures. All prosthetic valve replacements create a degree of stenosis when they are implanted in the heart. Usually, the stenosis is mild and does not effect heart function. If valve replacement was for a stenotic valve, blood flow through the heart is often improved. The signs and symptoms of the backward heart failure resolve in a few hours or days. If valve replacement was for a regurgitant valve, it may take months for the chamber into which blood had been regurgitat-

ing to achieve its optimal postoperative function. The signs and symptoms of heart failure resolve gradually as the heart function improves. The patient is at risk for many postoperative complications, such as bleeding, thromboembolism, infection, congestive heart failure, hypertension, dysrhythmias, hemolysis, and mechanical obstruction of the valve.

\section*{Types of Valve Prostheses}

Two types of valve prostheses may be used: mechanical and tissue (ie, biologic) valves. Figure 29-7 shows mechanical and tissue valves.

\section*{MECHANICAL VALVES}

The mechanical valves are of the ball-and-cage or disk design. Mechanical valves are thought to be more durable than tissue
prosthetic valves and often are used for younger patients. Mechanical valves are used if the patient has renal failure, hypercalcemia, endocarditis, or sepsis and requires valve replacement. The mechanical valves do not deteriorate or become infected as easily as the tissue valves used for patients with these conditions. Thromboemboli are significant complications associated with mechanical valves, and long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is required.

\section*{TISSUE OR BIOLOGIC VALVES}

Tissue (ie, biologic) valves are of three types: xenografts, homografts, and autografts. Tissue valves are less likely to generate thromboemboli, and long-term anticoagulation is not required. Tissue valves are not as durable as mechanical valves and require replacement more frequently.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 29-6 Valve replacement. (A) The native valve is excised and the prosthetic valve is sutured in place. (B) Once all sutures are placed through the ring, the surgeon slides the prosthetic valve down the sutures and into the natural orifice. The sutures are then tied off and trimmed.}

\end{figure}

Xenografts. Xenografts are tissue valves (eg, bioprostheses, heterografts); most are from pigs (porcine), but valves from cows (bovine) may also be used. Their viability is 7 to 10 years. They do not generate thrombi, thereby eliminating the need for longterm anticoagulation. They are used for women of childbearing age because the potential complications of long-term anticoagulation associated with menses, placental transfer to a fetus, and delivery of a child do not exist. Xenografts also are used for patients older than 70 years of age, patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, and others who cannot tolerate long-term anticoagulation. Xenografts are used for all tricuspid valve replacements.

Homografts. Homografts, or allografts (ie, human valves), are obtained from cadaver tissue donations. The aortic valve and a portion of the aorta or the pulmonic valve and a portion of the pulmonary artery are harvested and stored cryogenically. Homografts are not always available and are very expensive. Homografts last for about 10 to 15 years, somewhat longer than xenografts. Homografts are not thrombogenic and are resistant to subacute bacterial endocarditis. They are used for aortic and pulmonic valve replacement.

Autografts. Autografts (ie, autologous valves) are obtained by excising the patient's own pulmonic valve and a portion of the pulmonary artery for use as the aortic valve. Anticoagulation is unnecessary because the valve is the patient's own tissue and is not thrombogenic. The autograft is an alternative for children (it may grow as the child grows), women of childbearing age, young adults, patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, and those who cannot tolerate anticoagulation. Aortic valve autografts have remained viable for more than 20 years.

Most aortic valve autograft procedures are double valvereplacement procedures, because a homograft also is performed for pulmonic valve replacement. If pulmonary vascular pressures are normal, some surgeons elect not to replace the pulmonic valve. The patient can recover without a valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.

\section*{VALVULOPLASTY AND REPLACEMENT: NURSING MANAGEMENT}

Patients who have had valvuloplasty or valve replacements are admitted to the intensive care unit; care focuses on recovery from anesthesia and hemodynamic stability. Vital signs are assessed every 5 to 15 minutes and as needed until the patient recovers from anesthesia or sedation and then assessed every 2 to 4 hours and as needed. Intravenous medications to increase or decrease blood pressure and to treat dysrhythmias or altered heart rates are administered and their effects monitored. The intravenous medications are gradually decreased until they are no longer required or the patient takes needed medication by another route (eg, oral, topical). Patient assessments are conducted every 1 to 4 hours and as needed, with particular attention to neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. (See Plan of Nursing Care 28-2: Care of the Patient After Cardiac Surgery, in Chap. 28).

After the patient has recovered from anesthesia and sedation, is hemodynamically stable without intravenous medications, and assessment values are stable, the patient is usually transferred to a telemetry unit, typically within 24 to 72 hours after surgery. Nursing care continues as for most postoperative patients, including wound care and patient teaching regarding diet, activity, medications, and self-care.

The nurse educates the patient about long-term anticoagulant therapy, explaining the need for frequent follow-up appointments and blood laboratory studies, and provides teaching about any prescribed medication: the name of the medication, dosage, its actions, prescribed schedule, potential side effects, and any drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Patients with a mechanical valve prosthesis require education to prevent bacterial endocarditis with antibiotic prophylaxis, which is prescribed before all dental and surgical interventions. Patients are discharged from the hospital in 3 to 7 days. Home care and office or clinic nurses reinforce all new information and self-care instructions with the patient and family for 4 to 8 weeks after the procedure.

\section*{Septal Repair}

The atrial or ventricular septum may have an abnormal opening between the right and left sides of the heart (ie, septal defect). Although most septal defects are congenital and are repaired during infancy or childhood, adults may not have undergone early repair or may develop septal defects as a result of myocardial infarctions or diagnostic and treatment procedures.

Repair of septal defects requires general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. The heart is opened, and a pericardial or synthetic (usually polyester or Dacron) patch is used to close the opening. Atrial septal defect repairs have low morbidity and mortality rates. When the mitral or tricuspid valve is involved, however, the procedure is more complicated because valve repair or replacement may be required and the heart failure may be more severe. Generally, ventricular septal repairs are uncomplicated, but the proximity of the defect to the intraventricular conduction system and the valves may make this repair more complex. (See Chapter 28, Plan of Nursing Care: Care of the Patient After Cardiac Surgery.)

\section*{Cardiomyopathies}

Cardiomyopathy is a heart muscle disease associated with cardiac dysfunction. It is classified according to the structural and functional abnormalities of the heart muscle: dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive or constrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), and unclassified cardiomyopathy (Richardson et al., 1996). Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a term frequently used to describe an enlarged heart caused by coronary artery disease, which is usually accompanied by heart failure (see Chap. 30). Regardless of the category and the cause, cardiomyopathy may lead to severe heart failure, lethal dysrhythmias, and death. Cardiomyopathy causes more than 27,000 deaths each year in the United States (American Heart Association, 2001). The mortality rate is highest for African Americans and the elderly (American Heart Association, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The pathophysiology of all cardiomyopathies is a series of progressive events that culminate in impaired cardiac output. Decreased stroke volume stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone response, resulting in increased systemic vascular resistance and increased sodium and fluid retention, which places an increased workload on the heart. These alterations can lead to heart failure (see Chap. 30).

\section*{DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY}

DCM is the most common form of cardiomyopathy, with an incidence of 5 to 8 cases per 100,000 people per year and increasing (Braunwald et al., 2001). DCM occurs more often in men and African Americans, who also experience higher mortality rates (Braunwald et al., 2001). DCM is distinguished by significant dilation of the ventricles (Fig. 29-8) without significant concomitant hypertrophy (ie, increased muscle wall thickness) and systolic dysfunction. DCM was formerly named congestive cardiomyopathy, but DCM may exist without signs and symptoms of congestion.

Microscopic examination of the muscle tissue shows diminished contractile elements of the muscle fibers and diffuse necrosis of myocardial cells. The result is poor systolic function. These structural changes decrease the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle with systole, increasing the amount of blood remaining in the ventricle after contraction. Less blood is then able to enter the ventricle during diastole, increasing end-diastolic pressure and eventually increasing pulmonary pressures. Altered valve function can result from the enlarged stretched ventricle, usually resulting in regurgitation. Embolic events caused by ventricular and atrial thrombi as a result of the poor blood flow through the ventricle may also occur. More than 75 conditions and diseases may cause DCM, including pregnancy, heavy alcohol intake, and viral infection (eg, influenza). When the causative factor cannot be identified, the term used is idiopathic DCM. Idiopathic DCM accounts for approximately $25 \%$ of all heart failure cases (Braunwald et al., 2001). Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent or delay significant symptoms and sudden death from DCM. Echocardiography and ECG are used to diagnose DCM and should be conducted for all first-degree relatives (eg, parents, siblings, children) of patients with DCM (Braunwald et al., 2001).

\section*{HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY}

In HCM, the heart muscle increases in size and mass, especially along the septum (see Fig. 29-8). The increased thickness of the heart muscle reduces the size of the ventricular cavities and causes the ventricles to take a longer time to relax, making it more difficult for the ventricles to fill with blood during the first part of diastole and making them more dependent on atrial contraction for

EIGURE 29-8 Cardiomyopathies that lead to congestive heart failure. Ao, aorta; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle. With permission from Braunwald, E., et al. (Eds.) (2001). Heart disease: A textbook of cardiovascular medicine (6th ed.). Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders.
filling. The increased septal size may misalign the papillary muscles so that the septum and mitral valve obstruct the flow of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta during ventricular contraction. Hence, HCM may be obstructive or nonobstructive. Because of the structural changes, HCM had also been called idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) or asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH). Structural changes may also result in a smaller than normal ventricular cavity and a higher velocity flow of blood out of the left ventricle into the aorta, which may be detected by echocardiography (Braunwald et al., 2001). HCM may cause significant diastolic dysfunction, but systolic function can be normal or high, resulting in a higher than normal ejection fraction.

Because HCM is a genetic disease, family members are observed closely for signs and symptoms indicating development of the disease (Fuster et al., 2001). HCM is rare, occurring in men, women, and children (often detected after puberty) (Oakley, 1997) with an estimated prevalence rate of $0.05 \%$ to $0.2 \%$ (Berul \& Zevitz, 2002). It may also be idiopathic (ie, no cause can be found).

\section*{RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY}

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterized by diastolic dysfunction caused by rigid ventricular walls that impair ventricular stretch and diastolic filling (see Fig. 29-8). Systolic function is usually normal. Because RCM is the least common cardiomyopathy, representing approximately 5\% of pediatric cardiomyopathies, its pathogenesis is the least understood (Shaddy, 2001). Restrictive cardiomyopathy can be associated with amyloidosis (in which amyloid, a protein substance, is deposited within the
cells) and other such infiltrative diseases. However, the cause is unknown in most cases (ie, idiopathic).

\section*{ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT}

\section*{VENTRICULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY}

ARVC occurs when the myocardium of the right ventricle is progressively infiltrated and replaced by fibrous scar and adipose tissue. Initially, only localized areas of the right ventricle are affected, but as the disease progresses, the entire heart is affected. Eventually, the right ventricle dilates and develops poor contractility, right ventricular wall abnormalities, and dysrhythmias. The prevalence of ARVC is unknown because many cases are not recognized. ARVC should be suspected in patients with ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricle (ie, a left bundle branch block configuration on ECG) or sudden death, especially among previously symptom-free athletes (McRae et al., 2001). The disease may be genetic (ie, autosomal dominant) (Richardson et al., 1996). Family members should be screened for the disease with a 12-lead ECG, Holter monitor, and echocardiography.

\section*{UNCLASSIFIED CARDIOMYOPATHIES}

Unclassified cardiomyopathies are different from or have characteristics of more than one of the previously described cardiomyopathies. Examples of unclassified cardiomyopathies include fibroelastosis, noncompacted myocardium, systolic dysfunction with minimal dilation, and mitochondrial involvement (Richardson et al., 1996).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient may have cardiomyopathy but remain stable and without symptoms for many years. As the disease progresses, so do symptoms. Frequently, dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy are first diagnosed when the patient presents with signs and symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue). Patients with cardiomyopathy may also report paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, cough (especially with exertion), and orthopnea, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of bronchitis or pneumonia. Other symptoms include fluid retention, peripheral edema, and nausea, which is caused by poor perfusion of the gastrointestinal system. The patient may experience chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, nausea, and syncope with exertion. However, with HCM, cardiac arrest (ie, sudden cardiac death) may be the initial manifestation in young people, including athletes (Spirito et al., 2000).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Physical examination in the early stage may reveal tachycardia and extra heart sounds. With disease progression, examination also reveals signs and symptoms of heart failure (eg, crackles on pulmonary auscultation, jugular vein distention, pitting edema of dependent body parts, enlarged liver).

Diagnosis is usually made from findings disclosed by the patient history and by ruling out other causes of heart failure, such as myocardial infarction. The echocardiogram is one of the most helpful diagnostic tools because the structure and function of the ventricles can be observed easily. ECG demonstrates dysrhythmias and changes consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy. The chest x-ray film reveals heart enlargement and possibly pulmonary congestion. Cardiac catheterization is sometimes used to rule out coronary artery disease as a causative factor. An endomyocardial biopsy may be performed to analyze myocardial tissue cells.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical management is directed toward determining and managing possible underlying or precipitating causes; correcting the heart failure with medications, a low-sodium diet, and an exerciserest regimen (see Chap. 30); and controlling dysrhythmias with antiarrhythmic medications and possibly with an implanted electronic device, such as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (see Chap. 27). If patients exhibit signs and symptoms of congestion, their fluid intake may be limited to 2 liters each day. The person with HCM may also have to limit physical activity to avoid a life-threatening dysrhythmia. A pacemaker may be implanted to alter the electrical stimulation of the muscle and prevent the forceful hyperdynamic contractions that occur with HCM.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

When heart failure progresses and medical treatment is no longer effective, surgical intervention, including heart transplantation, is considered. However, because of the limited number of organ donors, many patients die waiting for transplantation. In some cases, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is implanted to support the failing heart until a suitable donor heart becomes available (mechanical assist devices and total artificial hearts are discussed later in this chapter).

Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Surgery. When a patient with HCM becomes symptomatic despite medical therapy and a difference in pressure of 50 mm Hg or more exists between the left ventricle and the aorta, surgery is considered. The most common procedure is a myectomy (sometimes referred to as a myotomymyectomy), in which some of the heart tissue is excised. Septal tissue approximately 1 cm wide and deep is cut from the enlarged septum below the aortic valve. The length of septum removed depends on the degree of obstruction caused by the hypertrophied muscle.

Instead of a septal myectomy, the surgeon may open the left ventricular outflow tract to the aortic valve by removing the mitral valve, chordae, and papillary muscles. The mitral valve then is replaced with a low-profile disk valve. The space taken up by the mitral valve is substantially reduced by the prosthetic valve compared with the patient's own valve, chordae, and papillary muscles, allowing blood to move around the enlarged septum to the aortic valve in the area that the mitral valve once occupied. The primary complication of both procedures is dysrhythmia; additional complications are postoperative surgical complications such as pain, ineffective airway clearance, deep vein thrombosis, risk for infection, and delayed surgical recovery.

Heart Transplantation. The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed in 1967. Since then, transplant procedures, equipment, and medications have continued to improve. Since 1983, when cyclosporine became available, heart transplantation has become a therapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart disease. Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune, SangCya) is an immunosuppressant that greatly decreases the body's rejection of foreign proteins, such as transplanted organs. Unfortunately, cyclosporine also decreases the body's ability to resist infections, and a satisfactory balance must be achieved between suppressing rejection and avoiding infection.

Cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, rejection of previously transplanted hearts, and congenital heart disease are the most common indications for transplantation (Becker \& Petlin, 1999; Rourke et al., 1999). A typical candidate
has severe symptoms uncontrolled by medical therapy, no other surgical options, and a prognosis of less than 12 months to live. A multidisciplinary team screens the candidate before recommending the transplantation procedure. The person's age, pulmonary status, other chronic health conditions, psychosocial status, family support, infections, history of other transplantations, compliance, and current health status are considered in the screening.

When a donor heart becomes available, a computer generates a list of potential recipients on the basis of ABO blood group compatibility, the sizes of the donor and the potential recipient, and the geographic locations of the donor and potential recipient; distance is a variable because postoperative function depends on the heart being implanted within 6 hours of harvest from the donor. Some patients are candidates for more than one organ transplant: heart-lung, heart-pancreas, heart-kidney, heart-liver.

Transplantation Techniques. Orthotopic transplantation is the most common surgical procedure for cardiac transplantation (Fig. 29-9). The recipient's heart is removed, and the donor heart is implanted at the vena cava and pulmonary veins. Some surgeons still prefer to remove the recipient's heart leaving a portion of the recipient's atria (with the vena cava and pulmonary veins) in place. The donor heart, which usually has been preserved in ice, is prepared for implant by cutting away a small section of the atria that corresponds with the sections of the recipient's heart that were left in place. The donor heart is implanted by suturing the donor atria to the residual atrial tissue of the recipient's heart. Both techniques then connect the recipient's pulmonary artery and aorta to those of the donor heart.

Heterotopic transplantation is less commonly performed (Fig. 29-10). The donor heart is placed to the right and slightly anterior to the recipient's heart; the recipient's heart is not removed. Initially, it was thought that the original heart might provide some protection for the patient in the event that the transplanted heart was rejected. Although the protective effect has not been proved, other reasons for retaining the original heart have been identified: a small donor heart or pulmonary hypertension (Becker \& Petlin, 1999; Kadner et al., 2000).

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 29-10 Heterotopic method of heart transplantation.}
\end{figure}

The transplanted heart has no nerve connections with the recipient's body (ie, denervated heart), and the sympathetic and vagus nerves do not affect the transplanted heart. The resting rate of the transplanted heart is approximately 70 to 90 beats per minute, but it increases gradually if catecholamines are in the circulation. Patients must gradually increase and decrease their exercise (ie, extended warm-up and cool-down periods), because 20 to 30 minutes may be required to achieve the desired heart rate. Atropine does not increase the heart rate of these patients.

Postoperative Course. Heart transplant patients are constantly balancing the risk of rejection with the risk of infection. They must comply with a complex regimen of diet, medications, activity, follow-up laboratory studies, biopsies (to diagnose rejection), and clinic visits. Most commonly, patients receive cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), azathioprine (Imuran) or mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), and corticosteroids (ie, prednisone) to minimize rejection.

In addition to rejection and infection, complications may include accelerated atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (ie, cardiac allograft vasculopathy [CAV]or accelerated graft atherosclerosis [AGA]). Although the cause is unknown, the disease is believed to be immunologically mediated (Augustine, 2000; Rourke et al., 1999). Hypertension may be experienced by patients taking cyclosporine or tacrolimus; the cause has not been identified. Osteoporosis frequently occurs as a side effect of the anti-rejection medications and pretransplantation dietary insufficiency and medications. Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease and cancer of the skin and lips are the most common malignancies after transplantation, possibly caused by immunosuppression. Weight gain, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemias (eg, hypercholesterolemia), hypotension, renal failure, and central nervous system, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disturbances may be caused by the corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants. Other complications are immunosuppressant medication toxicities and responses to the psychosocial stresses imposed by organ transplantation. Patients may experience guilt that someone died for them to live, have anxiety about the new heart, experience depression or fear when rejection is identified, or have difficulty with family role changes before and after transplantation (Augustine, 2000; Becker \&

Petlin, 1999; Braunwald et al., 2001; Fuster et al., 2001; Rourke et al., 1999).

The 1 -year survival rate for patients with transplanted hearts is approximately $80 \%$ to $90 \%$; the 5 -year survival rate is approximately $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ (Augustine, 2000; Becker \& Petlin, 1999; Braunwald et al., 2001; Fuster et al., 2001; Rourke et al., 1999).

Mechanical Assist Devices and Total Artificial Hearts. The use of cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiovascular surgery and the possibility of performing heart transplantation for end-stage cardiac disease have increased the need for mechanical assist devices. Patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass or patients in cardiogenic shock may benefit from a period of mechanical heart assistance. The most commonly used device is the intra-aortic balloon pump (see Chap. 30). This pump decreases the work of the heart during contraction but does not perform the actual work of the heart.

Ventricular Assist Devices. More complex devices that actually perform some or all of the pumping function for the heart also are being used. These more sophisticated ventricular assist devices (VADs) (Fig. 29-11) can circulate as much blood per minute as the patient's heart, if not more. Each ventricular assist device is used to support one ventricle. Some ventricular assist devices can be combined with an oxygenator; the combination is called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The oxygenatorventricular assist device combination is used for the patient whose heart cannot pump adequate blood through the lungs or the body.

There are three basic types of devices: centrifugal, pneumatic, and electric or electromagnetic. Centrifugal VADs are external, nonpulsatile, cone-shaped devices with internal mechanisms that spin rapidly, creating a vortex (tornado-like action) that pulls blood from a large vein into the pump and then pushes it back into a large artery. Pneumatic VADs are external or implanted pulsatile devices with a flexible reservoir housed in a rigid exte-

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 29-11 Left ventricular assist device.}
\end{figure}
rior. The reservoir usually fills with blood drained from the patient's atrium or ventricle. The VAD then forces pressurized air into the rigid housing, compressing the reservoir and returning the blood to the patient's circulation, usually into the aorta. Electric or electromagnetic VADs are similar to the pneumatic VADs, but instead of pressurized air, one or more flat metal plates are pushed against the reservoir to return the blood to the patient's circulation.

Total Artificial Hearts. Total artificial hearts are designed to replace both ventricles. Some require the removal of the patient's heart to implant the total artificial heart; others do not. All of these devices are experimental. Although there has been some short-term success, the long-term results have been disappointing. Researchers hope to develop a device that can be permanently implanted and that will eliminate the need for donated human heart transplantation for the treatment of end-stage cardiac disease (Braunwald et al., 2001; Chillcott et al., 1998; Fuster et al., 2001; Rose et al., 1999; Schakenbach, 2001).

Most VADs and total artificial hearts are temporary treatments while the patient's own heart recovers or until a donor heart becomes available for transplantation (ie, "bridge to transplant"). Some devices are being investigated for permanent use. Bleeding disorders, hemorrhage, thrombus, emboli, hemolysis, infection, renal failure, right heart failure, multisystem failure, and mechanical failure are some of the complications of VADs and total artificial hearts (Braunwald et al., 2001; Duke \& Perna, 1999; Schakenbach, 2001; Scherr et al., 1999). The nursing care for these patients focuses on assessing for and minimizing these complications and involves providing emotional support and education about the mechanical assist device.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH CARDIOMYOPATHY}

\section*{Assessment}

Nursing assessment for the patient with cardiomyopathy begins with a detailed history of the presenting signs and symptoms. The nurse identifies possible etiologic factors, such as heavy alcohol intake, recent illness or pregnancy, or history of the disease in immediate family members. If the patient complains of chest pain, a thorough review of the pain, including its precipitating factors, should be performed. The review of systems includes the presence of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and syncope or dyspnea with exertion. The number of pillows that are needed to sleep, usual weight, any weight change, and limitation to activities of daily living also are assessed. The New York Heart Association Classification for heart failure is determined. The patient's usual diet is evaluated to determine if alterations are needed to reduce sodium intake.

Because of the chronicity of cardiomyopathy, the nurse compiles a careful psychosocial history exploring the impact of the disease on the patient's role within the family and community. Identification of all perceived stressors helps the patient and the health care team to implement activities to relieve anxiety related to changes in health status. Very early on, the patient's support systems are identified, and members are involved in the patient's care and therapeutic regimen. The assessment addresses the effect the diagnosis has had on the patient and members of his or her support system and the patient's emotional status. Depression is not uncommon in patients with cardiomyopathy who have developed heart failure.

The physical assessment focuses on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. The baseline assessment includes such key components as:
- Vital signs
- Calculation of pulse pressure and identification of pulsus paradoxus
- Current weight; determination of weight gain or loss
- Detection by palpation of the point of maximal impulse, often shifted to the left
- Cardiac auscultation for a systolic murmur and third and fourth heart sounds
- Pulmonary auscultation for crackles
- Measurement of jugular vein distention
- Identification of presence and severity of edema

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include:
- Decreased cardiac output related to structural disorders caused by cardiomyopathy or to dysrhythmia from the disease process and medical treatments
- Ineffective cardiopulmonary, cerebral, peripheral, and renal tissue perfusion related to decreased peripheral blood flow (resulting from decreased cardiac output)
- Impaired gas exchange related to pulmonary congestion caused by myocardial failure (decreased cardiac output)
- Activity intolerance related to decreased cardiac output or excessive fluid volume, or both
- Anxiety related to the change in health status and in role functioning
- Powerlessness related to disease process
- Noncompliance with medication and diet therapies

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications include:
- Congestive heart failure
- Ventricular dysrhythmias
- Atrial dysrhythmias
- Cardiac conduction defects
- Pulmonary or cerebral embolism
- Valvular dysfunction

These complications are discussed earlier in this chapter and in Chapters 27 and 30.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include improved or maintained cardiac output, increased activity tolerance, reduction of anxiety, adherence to the self-care program, increased sense of power with decision making, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING CARDIAC OUTPUT}

During a symptomatic episode, rest is indicated. Many patients with DCM find that sitting up with their legs down is more comfortable than lying down in a bed. This position is helpful in pooling venous blood in the periphery and reducing preload. As-
sessing the patient's oxygen saturation at rest and during activity may assist with determining a need for supplemental oxygen. Oxygen is usually given through nasal cannula when indicated.

Ensuring that medications are taken as prescribed is important to preserving adequate cardiac output. It is important to ensure that patients with HCM avoid diuretics and that patients with DCM avoid verapamil (Calan, Isoptin) to maintain contractility. The nurse may assist the patient with planning a schedule for taking medications and identifying methods to remember to follow it, such as associating the time to take a medication with an activity (eg, eating a meal, brushing teeth). Ensuring that the patient receives or chooses food selections that are appropriate for the low-sodium diet is also important. Determining the patient's weight every day and identifying any significant change is one way to monitor the patient's response to treatment. Assessing if the patient experiences shortness of breath after more or less activity than before treatment is another indication of the effect of treatment. Patients with low cardiac output may need assistance keeping warm and frequently changing position to stimulate circulation and reduce the possibility of skin breakdown.

\section*{INCREASING ACTIVITY TOLERANCE}

The nurse plans the patient's activities so that they occur in cycles, alternating rest with activity periods. This benefits the patient's physiologic status, and it helps to teach the patient about the need for planned cycles of rest and activity. For example, after taking a bath or shower, the patient should plan to sit and read the paper or pay bills. Suggesting that patients sit while chopping vegetables, drying their hair, or shaving helps them to identify methods to balance rest with activity. The nurse can also make sure that the patient recognizes the symptoms that indicate the need for rest and the actions to take when the symptoms occur. Patients with HCM need to avoid strenuous activity and sports.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Spiritual, psychological, and emotional support may be indicated for the patient, family, and significant others. Interventions are directed toward eradicating or alleviating perceived stressors. The patient is provided with appropriate information about cardiomyopathy and self-management activities. An atmosphere in which the patient feels free to verbalize concerns is provided, as is assurance that these concerns are legitimate. If the patient is facing death or awaiting transplantation, time must be provided to discuss these issues. Providing the patient with realistic hope helps to reduce anxiety while the patient awaits a donor heart. Nurses help the patient, family, and significant others with anticipatory grieving. Accomplishing a goal, no matter how small, also promotes the patient's sense of well-being.

\section*{DECREASING THE SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS}

Patients need to recognize that they go through a grieving process when given a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. They are assisted in identifying the things in their life that they have lost (eg, foods that they have enjoyed eating but are high in sodium, ability to engage in constant active lifestyle, ability to play sports, ability to lift grandchildren). They also are assisted in identifying their emotional responses to the loss (eg, anger, depression). The nurse then assists patients in identifying the amount of control that they have in their lives, such as making food choices, managing their medications, and working with their provider to achieve the best possible outcomes. The use of patient tools that track behaviors with the resulting symptoms may be helpful. For example, a diary in which the patient records his or her food selections and
weight may assist the patient with understanding the relationship between sodium intake and weight gain. Some patients are able to manage a self-titrating diuretic regimen, in which the patient is able to adjust the dose of diuretic to his or her symptoms.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Teaching patients about the medication regimen, symptom monitoring, and symptom management is a key part of the plan of nursing care. The nurse is integral to the learning process as patients learn to balance their lifestyle and work while accomplishing their therapeutic activities. Helping patients cope with their disease status assists them in adjusting their lifestyles and implementing a self-care program at home.

Continuing Care. The nurse reinforces previous teaching and performs ongoing assessment of the patient's symptoms and progress. The nurse also assists the patient and family to adjust to lifestyle changes. Teaching patients to read nutritional labels, to maintain a record of daily weights and symptoms, and to organize daily activities to increase activity tolerance can be helpful. The patient's responses to diet and fluid restrictions and to the medication regimen are assessed, and explanations about symptoms that should be reported to the physician are emphasized. Because of the risk of dysrhythmia, the patient's family may be taught cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Women are often advised to avoid pregnancy; each case is assessed individually. The nurse assesses the psychosocial needs of the patient and family on an ongoing basis. There may be concerns and fears about the prognosis, changes in lifestyle, effects of medications, and the possibility of others in the family having the same condition that increase the patient's anxiety and interfere with effective coping strategies. Establishing trust is vital to the relationship with these chronically ill patients and their families. This is particularly significant when the nurse is involved with the patient and family in discussions about end-of-life decisions. Patients who have significant symptoms of heart failure or other complications of cardiomyopathy may need a home care referral.

\section*{CardiacTumor and Trauma Surgery}

\section*{TUMOR EXCISION}

Tumors of the heart are rare; most ( $75 \%$ to $88 \%$ ) are benign (Braunwald et al., 2001; Kamiya et al., 2001). Primary tumors occur in less than $1 \%$ of the population; metastatic tumors have been reported in $1.5 \%$ to $35 \%$ of oncology patients (Braunwald et al., 2001; Reynan, 1996; Shapiro, 2001). Tumors may be sites for thrombus formation and therefore create a risk of embolism. Dysrhythmias may occur as the myocardium or conduction system is affected.

Surgical excision is performed to prevent obstruction of a chamber or valve. Cardiopulmonary bypass is used, except for epicardial tumors, which can be excised without entering the heart and without stopping the heart from beating. The tumor location may necessitate valve replacement, myocardial patching, or pacemaker implantation. The nursing care is the same as that for patients undergoing other forms of cardiac surgery (see Chap. 28).

\section*{TRAUMA REPAIR}

Patients who have sustained nonpenetrating (ie, blunt force) injury or penetrating injury (eg, gunshot wound, stabbing) causing cardiac trauma often do not survive to treatment (Flynn \& Bonini, 1999; Thourani et al., 1999). Patients who do survive to treatment often require surgical treatment (Thourani et al., 1999; Wall et al., 1997). The repairs are typically to the valves or septum in blunt force injuries and to the ventricular and atrial walls in penetrating injuries. The wound is débrided and closed surgically when possible, but valve repair and replacement or patch grafts of the septum and atrial or ventricular walls may be required. The surgery is usually an emergency procedure, and the risk of complications from the injury and surgery is high. The nursing care is the same as that for patients undergoing other forms of cardiac surgery (See Chap. 28).

\section*{Infectious Diseases of the Heart}

Among the most common infections of the heart are infective endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. The ideal management is prevention.

\section*{RHEUMATIC ENDOCARDITIS}

Acute rheumatic fever, which occurs most often in school-age children, follows $0.3 \%$ to $3 \%$ of cases of group $A$ beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (Chin, 2001). Prompt treatment of strep throat with antibiotics can prevent the development of rheumatic fever (Chart 29-1). The Streptococcus is spread by direct contact with oral or respiratory secretions. Although the bacteria are the causative agents, malnutrition, overcrowding, and lower socioeconomic status may predispose individuals to rheumatic fever (Beers et al., 1999). The incidence of rheumatic fever in the United States and other developed countries is believed to have steadily decreased, but the exact incidence is difficult to deter-

\section*{Chart 29-1 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Recognizing and Preventing}

\section*{Rheumatic Fever}

Rheumatic fever is a preventable disease. Eradicating rheumatic fever would eliminate rheumatic heart disease. Penicillin therapy in patients with streptococcal infections can prevent almost all primary attacks of rheumatic fever. A throat culture is the only method by which an accurate diagnosis can be determined.

The signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis are the following:
- Fever $\left(38.9^{\circ}\right.$ to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left[101^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.\left.104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right]\right)$
- Chills
- Sore throat (sudden in onset)
- Diffuse redness of throat with exudate on oropharynx (may not appear until after the first day)
- Enlarged and tender lymph nodes
- Abdominal pain (more common in children)
- Acute sinusitis and acute otitis media (if due to streptococci)
mine because the infection may go unrecognized and patients may not seek treatment (Braunwald et al., 2001; Beers et al., 1999). As many as $39 \%$ of patients with rheumatic fever develop various degrees of rheumatic heart disease associated with valvular insufficiency, heart failure, and death (Chin, 2001). The disease also affects all bony joints, producing polyarthritis. The prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is difficult to determine because clinical diagnostic criteria are not standardized and autopsies are not routinely performed. Except for rare outbreaks, the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in the United States is believed to be less than 0.05 cases per 1000 people (Chin, 2001). The number of U.S. citizens who die from rheumatic heart disease declined from approximately 15,000 in 1950 to about 4,000 in 2001 (AHA, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The heart damage and the joint lesions of rheumatic endocarditis are not infectious in the sense that these tissues are not invaded and directly damaged by destructive organisms; rather, they represent a sensitivity phenomenon or reaction occurring in response to hemolytic streptococci. Leukocytes accumulate in the affected tissues and form nodules, which eventually are replaced by scar tissue. The myocardium is certain to be involved in this inflammatory process; rheumatic myocarditis develops, which temporarily weakens the contractile power of the heart. The pericardium also is affected, and rheumatic pericarditis occurs during the acute illness. These myocardial and pericardial complications usually occur without serious sequelae. Rheumatic endocarditis, however, results in permanent and often crippling side effects.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Rheumatic endocarditis anatomically manifests first by tiny translucent vegetations or growths, which resemble pinhead-sized beads arranged in a row along the free margins of the valve flaps. These tiny beads look harmless enough and may disappear without injuring the valve leaflets. More often, however, they have serious effects. They are the starting point of a process that gradually thickens the leaflets, rendering them shorter and thicker than normal and preventing them from closing completely. The
result is leakage, a condition called valvular regurgitation. The most common site of valvular regurgitation is the mitral valve. In some patients, the inflamed margins of the valve leaflets become adherent, resulting in valvular stenosis, a narrowed or stenotic valvular orifice. Regurgitation and stenosis may occur in the same valve.

A few patients with rheumatic fever become critically ill with intractable heart failure, serious dysrhythmias, and pneumonia. These patients are treated in an intensive care unit. Most patients recover quickly. However, although the patient is free of symptoms, certain permanent residual effects remain that often lead to progressive valvular deformities. The extent of cardiac damage, or even its existence, might not have been apparent in clinical examinations during the acute phase of the disease. Eventually, however, the heart murmurs that are characteristic of valvular stenosis, regurgitation, or both become audible on auscultation and, in some patients, even detectable as thrills on palpation. Usually, the myocardium can compensate for these valvular defects very well for a time. As long as the myocardium can compensate, the patient remains in apparently good health. With continued valvular alterations, the myocardium is unable to compensate (see Fig. 29-2), as evidenced by signs and symptoms of heart failure, as described in Chapter 30.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

During assessment, the nurse should keep in mind that the symptoms depend on which side of the heart is involved. The mitral valve is most often affected, producing symptoms of left-sided heart failure: shortness of breath with crackles and wheezes in the lungs (see Chap. 30 for a discussion of left-sided versus rightsided failure). The severity of the symptoms depends on the size and location of the lesion. The systemic symptoms that are present are proportionate to the virulence of the invading organism. When a new murmur is detected in a patient with a systemic infection, infectious endocarditis should be suspected. The patient is also at risk for embolic phenomena of the lung (eg, recurrent pneumonia, pulmonary abscesses), kidney (eg, hematuria, renal failure), spleen (eg, left upper quadrant pain), heart (eg, myocardial infarction), brain (eg, stroke), or peripheral vessels.

\section*{Prevention}

Rheumatic endocarditis is prevented through early and adequate treatment of streptococcal infections. A first-line approach in preventing initial attacks of rheumatic endocarditis is to recognize streptococcal infections, treat them adequately, and control epidemics in the community. Every nurse should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis: high fever $\left(38.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ [ $101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ]), chills, sore throat, redness of the throat with exudate, enlarged lymph nodes, abdominal pain, and acute rhinitis.

> NURSING ALERT A throat culture is the only method by which an accurate diagnosis of streptococcal infection of the throat can be made.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of medical management are to eradicate the causative organism and prevent additional complications, such as a thromboembolic event. Long-term antibiotic therapy is the
recommended treatment, and penicillin administered parenterally remains the medication of choice.

The patient who has rheumatic endocarditis and whose valvular dysfunction is mild may require no further treatment. Nevertheless, the danger exists for recurrent attacks of acute rheumatic fever, bacterial endocarditis, embolism from vegetations or mural thrombi in the heart, and eventual cardiac failure.

\section*{Nursing Management}

A key nursing role in rheumatic endocarditis is teaching patients about the disease, its treatment, and the preventive steps needed to avoid potential complications. After acute treatment with antibiotics, patients need to learn about the need to take prophylactic antibiotics before invasive procedures (see Prevention in the Infective Endocarditis section).

\section*{INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS}

Infective endocarditis is an infection of the valves and endothelial surface of the heart. Endocarditis usually develops in people with cardiac structural defects (eg, valve disorders). Infective endocarditis is more common in older people, probably because of decreased immunologic response to infection and the metabolic alterations associated with aging. There is a high incidence of staphylococcal endocarditis among IV/injection drug users who most commonly have infections of the right heart valves (Bayer et al., 1998; Braunwald, 2001).

The incidence of infective endocarditis remained steady at about 4.2 cases per 100,000 patients in the years from 1950 to the mid-1980s (Braunwald et al., 2001). The incidence then increased, partially attributed to increased IV/injection drug abuse (Braunwald et al., 2001). In 1998, a total of 2212 deaths were attributed to infective endocarditis (American Heart Association, 2001). Invasive procedures, particularly those involving mucosal surfaces, can cause a bacteremia. The bacteremia rarely lasts for more than 15 minutes (Dajani et al., 1997). If a person has some anatomic cardiac defect, bacteremia can cause bacterial endocarditis (Dajani et al., 1997). The combination of the invasive procedure, the particular bacteria introduced into the bloodstream, and the cardiac defect may result in infective endocarditis.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Infective endocarditis is most often caused by direct invasion of the endocardium by a microbe (eg, streptococci, enterococci, pneumococci, staphylococci). The infection usually causes deformity of the valve leaflets, but it may affect other cardiac structures such as the chordae tendineae. Other causative microorganisms include fungi and rickettsiae. Patients at higher risk for infective endocarditis are those with prosthetic heart valves, a history of endocarditis, complex cyanotic congenital malformations, and systemic or pulmonary shunts or conduits that were surgically constructed (eg, saphenous vein grafts, internal mammary artery grafts). At high risk are patients with rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolapse and those who have prosthetic heart valves (Chart 29-2).

Hospital-acquired endocarditis occurs most often in patients with debilitating disease, those with indwelling catheters, and those receiving prolonged intravenous or antibiotic therapy. Patients receiving immunosuppressive medications or corticosteroids may develop fungal endocarditis.

\section*{Risk Factors for Infective Endocarditis}

High Risk
Prosthetic cardiac valves
History of bacterial endocarditis (even without heart disease)
Complex cyanotic congenital malformations
Surgically constructed systemic or pulmonary shunts or conduits
Moderate Risk
Mitral valve prolapse with valvular regurgitation or thickened leaflets
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Acquired valvular dysfunction
Most congenital cardiac malformations (other than those listed above and surgical repair of atrial and ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus)

A diagnosis of acute infective endocarditis is made when the onset of infection and resulting valvular destruction is rapid, occurring within days to weeks. The onset of infection may take 2 weeks to months, diagnosed as subacute infective endocarditis (Braunwald et al., 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Usually, the onset of infective endocarditis is insidious. The signs and symptoms develop from the toxic effect of the infection, from destruction of the heart valves, and from embolization of fragments of vegetative growths on the heart. The occurrence of peripheral emboli is not experienced by patients with right heart valve infective endocarditis (Bayer et al., 1998; Braunwald, 2001). The patient exhibits signs and symptoms similar to those described in rheumatic endocarditis (see previous discussion).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The general manifestations, which may be mistaken for influenza, include vague complaints of malaise, anorexia, weight loss, cough, and back and joint pain. Fever is intermittent and may be absent in patients who are receiving antibiotics or corticosteroids or in those who are elderly or have heart failure or renal failure. Splinter hemorrhages (ie, reddish-brown lines and streaks) may be seen under the fingernails and toenails, and petechiae may appear in the conjunctiva and mucous membranes. Small, painful nodules (Osler's nodes) may be present in the pads of fingers or toes. Hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth's spots) that may be seen in the fundi of the eyes are caused by emboli in the nerve fiber layer of the eye.

The cardiac manifestations include heart murmurs, which may be absent initially. Progressive changes in murmurs over time may be encountered and indicate valvular damage from vegetations or perforation of the valve or the chordae tendineae. Enlargement of the heart or evidence of heart failure is also found.

The central nervous system manifestations include headache, temporary or transient cerebral ischemia, and strokes, which may be caused by emboli to the cerebral arteries. Embolization may be a presenting symptom; it may occur at any time and may involve other organ systems. Embolic phenomena may occur, as discussed in the previous section on rheumatic endocarditis.

Although the described characteristics may indicate infective endocarditis, the signs and symptoms may indicate other diseases
as well. A definitive diagnosis is made when a microorganism is found in two separate blood cultures, in a vegetation, or in an abscess. Three sets of blood cultures (with each set including one aerobic and one anaerobic culture) should be obtained before administration of any antimicrobial agents. Negative blood cultures do not totally rule out the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. An echocardiogram may assist in the diagnosis by demonstrating a moving mass on the valve, prosthetic valve, or supporting structures and by identification of vegetations, abscesses, new prosthetic valve dehiscence, or new regurgitation (Braunwald et al., 2001). An echocardiogram may also demonstrate the development of heart failure.

\section*{Prevention}

Although rare, bacterial endocarditis may be life-threatening. A key strategy is primary prevention in high-risk patients (ie, those with rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, or prosthetic heart valves). Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for highrisk patients immediately before and sometimes after the following procedures:
- Dental procedures that induce gingival or mucosal bleeding, including professional cleaning and placement of orthodontic bands (not brackets)
- Tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy
- Surgical procedures that involve intestinal or respiratory mucosa
- Bronchoscopy with a rigid bronchoscope
- Sclerotherapy for esophageal varices
- Esophageal dilation
- Gallbladder surgery
- Cystoscopy
- Urethral dilation
- Urethral catheterization if urinary tract infection is present
- Urinary tract surgery if urinary tract infection is present
- Prostatic surgery
- Incision and drainage of infected tissue
- Vaginal hysterectomy
- Vaginal delivery

The type of antibiotic used for prophylaxis varies with the type of procedure and the degree of risk. The patient is usually instructed to take 2 g of amoxicillin (Amoxil) 1 hour before dental, oral, respiratory, or esophageal procedures. If the patient is allergic to penicillin (eg, ampicillin [Omnipen, Polycillin], carbenicillin [Geocillin], cloxacillin [Cloxapen], methicillin [Staphcillin], nafcillin [Nafcil, Unipen], oxacillin [Prostaphlin, Bactocill], penicillin G [Bicillin, Permapen]), clindamycin (Cleocin), cephalexin (Keflex), cefadroxil (Duricef), azithromycin (Zithromax), or clarithromycin (Biaxin) may be used. Recommendations for gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures are ampicillin and gentamicin (Garamycin) for high-risk patients, amoxicillin or ampicillin for moderate-risk patients, and substituting vancomycin (Vancocin) only for patients allergic to ampicillin or amoxicillin.

The severity of oral inflammation and infection is a significant factor in the incidence and degree of bacteremia. Poor dental hygiene can lead to bacteremia, particularly in the setting of a dental procedure. Regular personal and professional oral health care and rinsing with an antiseptic mouthwash for 30 seconds before dental procedures may assist in reducing the risk of bacteremia. Increased vigilance is also needed in patients with intravenous catheters. To minimize the risk of infection, nurses must ensure that meticulous hand hygiene, site preparation, and the use of
aseptic technique occur during the insertion and maintenance procedures (Schmid, 2000). All catheters are removed as soon as they are no longer needed or no longer function.

\section*{Complications}

Even if the patient responds to the therapy, endocarditis can be destructive to the heart and other organs. Heart failure and cerebral vascular complications, such as stroke, may occur before, during, or after therapy. The development of heart failure, which may result from perforation of a valve leaflet, rupture of chordae, blood flow obstruction due to vegetations, or intracardiac shunts from dehiscence of prosthetic valves, indicates a poor prognosis with medical therapy alone and a higher surgical risk (Braunwald et al., 2001). Valvular stenosis or regurgitation, myocardial damage, and mycotic (fungal) aneurysms are potential heart complications. Many other organ complications can result from septic or nonseptic emboli, immunologic responses, abscess of the spleen, mycotic aneurysms, and hemodynamic deterioration.

\section*{Medical Management}

The causative organism may be identified by serial blood cultures. The objective of treatment is to eradicate the invading organism through adequate doses of an appropriate antimicrobial agent.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Antibiotic therapy is usually administered parenterally in a continuous intravenous infusion for 2 to 6 weeks. Parenteral therapy is administered in doses that achieve a high serum concentration and for a significant duration to ensure eradication of the dormant bacteria within the dense vegetations. This therapy is often delivered in the patient's home and is monitored by a home care nurse. Serum levels of the selected antibiotic are monitored. If the serum does not demonstrate bactericidal activity, increased dosages of the antibiotic are prescribed, or a different antibiotic is used. Numerous antimicrobial regimens are in use, but penicillin is usually the medication of choice. Blood cultures are taken periodically to monitor the effect of therapy. In fungal endocarditis, an antifungal agent, such as amphotericin B (Abelect, Amphocin, Fungizone), is the usual treatment.

The patient's temperature is monitored at regular intervals because the course of the fever is one indication of the effectiveness of treatment. However, febrile reactions also may occur as a result of medication. After adequate antimicrobial therapy is initiated, the infective organism usually disappears. The patient should begin to feel better, regain an appetite, and have less fatigue. During this time, patients require psychosocial support because, although they feel well, they may find themselves confined to the hospital or home with restrictive intravenous therapy.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

After the patient recovers from the infectious process, seriously damaged valves may need to be replaced. Surgical valve replacement greatly improves the prognosis for patients with severe symptoms from damaged heart valves. Aortic or mitral valve excision and replacement are required for patients who develop congestive heart failure despite adequate medical treatment, patients who have more than one serious systemic embolic episode, and patients with uncontrolled infection, recurrent infection, or fungal endocarditis. Many patients who have prosthetic valve endocarditis (ie, infected prostheses) require valve replacement.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse monitors the patient's temperature; the patient may have fever for weeks. Heart sounds are assessed; a new murmur may indicate involvement of the valve leaflets. The nurse monitors for signs and symptoms of systemic embolization, or for patients with right heart endocarditis, the nurse monitors for signs and symptoms of pulmonary infarction and infiltrates. The nurse assesses signs and symptoms of organ damage such as stroke (ie, cerebrovascular accident or brain attack), meningitis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, glomerulonephritis, and splenomegaly.

Patient care is directed toward management of infection. The patient is started on antibiotics as soon as blood cultures have been obtained. All invasive lines and wounds should be assessed daily for redness, tenderness, warmth, swelling, drainage, or other signs of infection. Patients and their families are instructed about any activity restrictions, medications, and signs and symptoms of infection. The nurse should instruct the patient and family about the need for prophylactic antibiotics before, and possibly after, dental, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary procedures. Home care nurses supervise and monitor intravenous antibiotic therapy delivered in the home setting and educate the patient and family about prevention and health promotion. The nurse provides the patient and family with emotional support and facilitates coping strategies during the prolonged course of the infection and antibiotic treatment required. If the patient received surgical treatment, the nurse provides postoperative care and instruction.

\section*{MYOCARDITIS}

Myocarditis is an inflammatory process involving the myocardium. Myocarditis can cause heart dilation, thrombi on the heart wall (mural thrombi), infiltration of circulating blood cells around the coronary vessels and between the muscle fibers, and degeneration of the muscle fibers themselves. The incidence of myocarditis is estimated to be 1 to 10 cases per 100,000 persons. The rate may be higher because the variety of clinical presentations may cause underreporting (Tang, 2001). Mortality varies with the severity of symptoms. Most patients with mild symptoms recover completely. Other patients may develop cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Patients with symptomatic heart failure and an ejection fraction of less than $45 \%$ had a 1-year mortality rate of 20\% and a 4-year mortality rate of 56\% (Tang, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Myocarditis usually results from a viral, bacterial, mycotic, parasitic, protozoal, or spirochetal infection. It also may occur in patients after acute systemic infections such as rheumatic fever, in those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, or in those with infective endocarditis. Myocarditis may result from an allergic reaction to pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of other diseases. It may begin in one small area and then spread throughout the myocardium. The degree of myocardial involvement determines the degree of hemodynamic effect and resulting signs and symptoms. It is theorized that dilated cardiomyopathy is a latent manifestation of myocarditis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms of acute myocarditis depend on the type of infection, the degree of myocardial damage, and the capacity of the myocardium to recover. The patient may be asymptomatic, and
the infection resolves on its own. The patient may develop mild to moderate symptoms and seek medical attention. The patient may also sustain sudden cardiac death or quickly develop severe congestive heart failure. The patient with mild to moderate symptoms often complains of fatigue and dyspnea, palpitations, and occasional discomfort in the chest and upper abdomen.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment of the patient may reveal no abnormalities; as a result, the entire illness goes unrecognized. The patient may complain of chest pain (with a subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrating normal coronary arteries). The patient without any abnormal heart structure (at least initially) may suddenly develop dysrhythmias. If the patient has developed structural abnormalities (eg, systolic dysfunction), the clinical assessment may disclose cardiac enlargement, faint heart sounds, gallop rhythm, and a systolic murmur.

\section*{Prevention}

Prevention of infectious diseases by means of appropriate immunizations (eg, influenza, hepatitis) and early treatment appears to be important in decreasing the incidence of myocarditis (Braunwald et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

The patient receives specific treatment for the underlying cause if it is known (eg, penicillin for hemolytic streptococci) and is placed on bed rest to decrease the cardiac workload. Bed rest also helps to decrease myocardial damage and the complications of myocarditis. Activities, especially sports in young patients with myocarditis, should be limited for a 6 -month period or at least until heart size and function have returned to normal. Physical activity is increased slowly, and the patient is instructed to report any symptoms that occur with increasing activity, such as a rapidly beating heart. The use of corticosteroids in treating myocarditis remains controversial (Braunwald et al., 2001). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen are not to be used during the acute phase or if the patient develops heart failure, because these medications can cause further myocardial damage. If the patient develops heart failure, management is essentially the same as for all causes of heart failure (see Chap. 30).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse assesses the patient's temperature to determine whether the disease is subsiding. The cardiovascular assessment focuses on signs and symptoms of heart failure and dysrhythmia. The patient experiencing dysrhythmias should receive continuous cardiac monitoring with personnel and equipment readily available to treat life-threatening dysrhythmias.

NURSING ALERT Patients with myocarditis are sensitive to digitalis. They must be closely monitored for digitalis toxicity, which is evidenced by dysrhythmia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, and malaise (see Chap. 30).

Elastic compression stockings and passive and active exercises should be used, because embolization from venous thrombosis and mural thrombi can occur.

\section*{PERICARDITIS}

Pericarditis refers to an inflammation of the pericardium, the membranous sac enveloping the heart. It may be a primary illness, or it may develop in the course of a variety of medical and surgical disorders. The incidence of pericarditis varies with the cause. For example, pericarditis occurs after pericardectomy (opening of the pericardium) in 5\% to 30\% of patients after cardiac surgery (Beers et al., 1999). Pericarditis that occurs within 10 days to 2 months after acute myocardial infarction (Dressler's syndrome) causes 1\% to 3\% of all cases of pericarditis (Beers et al., 1999). Pericarditis may be acute or chronic. It may be classified by the layers of the pericardium becoming attached to each other (adhesive) or by what accumulates in the pericardial sac: serum (serous), pus (purulent), calcium deposits (calcific), clotting proteins (fibrinous), or blood (sanguinous).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The following are some of the causes underlying or associated with pericarditis:
- Idiopathic or nonspecific causes
- Infection: usually viral (eg, Coxsackie, influenza); rarely bacterial (eg, streptococci, staphylococci, meningococci, gonococci); and mycotic (fungal)
- Disorders of connective tissue: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis
- Hypersensitivity states: immune reactions, medication reactions, serum sickness
- Disorders of adjacent structures: myocardial infarction, dissecting aneurysm, pleural and pulmonary disease (pneumonia)
- Neoplastic disease: caused by metastasis from lung cancer or breast cancer, leukemia, and primary (mesothelioma) neoplasms
- Radiation therapy
- Trauma: chest injury, cardiac surgery, cardiac catheterization, pacemaker implantation
- Renal failure and uremia
- Tuberculosis

Pericarditis can lead to an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac (pericardial effusion) and increased pressure on the heart, leading to cardiac tamponade (see Chap. 30). Frequent or prolonged episodes of pericarditis may also lead to thickening and decreased elasticity that restrict the heart's ability to fill properly with blood (constrictive pericarditis). The pericardium may become calcified, further restricting ventricular expansion during ventricular filling (diastole). With less filling, the ventricles pump out less blood, leading to decreased cardiac output and signs and symptoms of heart failure. Restricted diastolic filling may result in increased systemic venous pressure, causing peripheral edema and hepatic failure.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The most characteristic symptom of pericarditis is chest pain, although pain also may be located beneath the clavicle, in the neck, or in the left scapula region. The pain or discomfort usually remains fairly constant, but it may worsen with deep inspiration and when lying down or turning. It may be relieved with a forwardleaning or sitting position. The most characteristic sign of pericarditis is a friction rub. Other signs may include mild fever,
increased white blood cell count, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Dyspnea and other signs and symptoms of heart failure may occur as the result of pericardial compression due to constrictive pericarditis or cardiac tamponade.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is most often made on the basis of the patient's history, signs, and symptoms. An echocardiogram may detect inflammation and fluid build-up, as well as indications of heart failure, and help to confirm the diagnosis. Because the pericardial sac surrounds the heart, a 12 -lead ECG detects ST changes in many, if not all, leads.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of management are to determine the cause, administer therapy, and be alert for cardiac tamponade. When cardiac output is impaired, the patient is placed on bed rest until the fever, chest pain, and friction rub have subsided.

Analgesics and NSAIDs such as aspirin or ibuprofen may be prescribed for pain relief during the acute phase. They also hasten the reabsorption of fluid in the patient with rheumatic pericarditis. Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) may be prescribed if the pericarditis is severe or if the patient does not respond to NSAIDs. Colchicine may also be used as an alternative medication.

Pericardiocentesis, a procedure in which some of the pericardial fluid is removed, may be performed to assist in the identification of the causative agent. It may also relieve symptoms, especially if there are signs and symptoms of heart failure. A pericardial window, a small opening made in the pericardium, may be performed to allow continuous drainage into the chest cavity. Surgical removal of the tough encasing pericardium (pericardiectomy) may be necessary to release both ventricles from the constrictive and restrictive inflammation.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse caring for the patient with pericarditis must be alert to the possibility of cardiac tamponade.

> NURSING ALERT Nursing assessment skills are key to anticipating and identifying the triad of symptoms of cardiac tamponade: falling arterial pressure, rising venous pressure, and distant heart sounds.

Patients with acute pericarditis require pain management with analgesics, positioning, and psychological support. Patients experiencing chest pain often benefit from education and reassurance that the pain is not a heart attack. To minimize complications, the nurse educates and assists the patient with activity restrictions until the pain and fever subside. As the patient's condition improves, the nurse encourages gradual increases of activity. If pain, fever, or friction rub reappear, however, activity restrictions must be resumed. The nurse educates the patient and family about a healthy lifestyle to enhance the patient's immune system.

The nurse monitors the patient for heart failure. A patient who is hemodynamically unstable or experiencing congestion is treated the same as a patient with acute heart failure (see Chap. 30).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH PERICARDITIS}

\section*{Assessment}

The primary symptom of the patient with pericarditis is pain, which is assessed by observing and evaluating the patient in various positions. While observing the patient, the nurse tries to discover whether the pain is influenced by respiratory movements, with or without the actual passage of air; by flexion, extension, or rotation of the spine, including the neck; by movements of the shoulders and arms; by coughing; or by swallowing. Recognizing the events that precipitate or intensify pain may help establish a diagnosis and differentiate the pain of pericarditis from the pain of myocardial infarction.

A pericardial friction rub occurs when the pericardial surfaces lose their lubricating fluid because of inflammation. The rub is audible on auscultation and is synchronous with the heartbeat. However, it may be elusive and difficult to detect.

\section*{NURSING ALERT A pericardial friction rub is diagnostic of peri-}
carditis. The nurse should search diligently for the rub by placing the diaphragm of the stethoscope tightly against the thorax and auscultating the left sternal edge in the fourth intercostal space, the site where the pericardium comes into contact with the left chest wall. A pericardial friction rub has a scratching or leathery sound. The rub is louder at the end of exhalation and may be heard best with the patient sitting and leaning forward.

If there is difficulty in distinguishing a pericardial friction rub from a pleural friction rub, patients are asked to hold their breath; a pericardial friction rub will continue.

The patient's temperature is monitored frequently. Pericarditis may cause an abrupt onset of fever in a patient who has been afebrile.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnosis of the patient may include:
- Acute pain related to inflammation of the pericardium

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Pericardial effusion
- Cardiac tamponade

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The patient's major goals may include relief of pain and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Relief of pain is achieved by having the patient rest. Because sitting upright and leaning forward is the posture that tends to relieve pain, chair rest may be more comfortable. It is important to instruct the patient to restrict activity until the pain subsides. As the chest pain and friction rub abate, activities of daily living may
resume gradually. If the patient is receiving medications such as analgesics, antibiotics, or corticosteroids for the pericarditis, his or her responses are monitored and recorded. If chest pain and friction rub recur, bed or chair rest resumes.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Pericardial Effusion. If the patient does not respond to medical management, fluid may accumulate between the pericardial linings or in the sac. This condition is called pericardial effusion (see Chap. 30). Fluid in the pericardial sac can constrict the myocardium and interrupt its ability to pump. Cardiac output declines with each contraction. Failure to identify and treat this problem can lead to the development of cardiac tamponade and the possibility of sudden death.

Cardiac Tamponade. The signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade begin with falling arterial pressure. Usually, the systolic pressure falls while the diastolic pressure remains stable; hence, the pulse pressure narrows. Heart sounds may progress from sounding distant to being imperceptible. Neck vein distention and other signs of rising central venous pressure are observed. These signs and symptoms occur because, as the fluid-filled pericardial sac compresses the myocardium, blood continues to return to the heart from the periphery but cannot flow into the heart to be pumped back into the circulation.

In such situations, the nurse notifies the physician immediately and prepares to assist with pericardiocentesis (see Chap. 30). The nurse stays with the patient and continues to assess and record signs and symptoms while intervening to decrease the patient's anxiety.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Is free of pain
a. Performs activities of daily living without pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath
b. Temperature returns to normal range
c. Exhibits no pericardial friction rub
2. Absence of complications
a. Sustains blood pressure in normal range
b. Has heart sounds that are strong and can be auscultated
c. Shows absence of neck vein distention

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. One of your neighbors has been diagnosed with mitral regurgitation and does not understand why antibiotics need to be taken before undergoing any dental work, including routine checkups. How would you explain the rationale for these instructions?
2. Plans for discharge from the hospital are being made for a 26-year-old man with cardiomyopathy. His 24-year-old wife says she is prepared to care for him at home; she expects that he will be unable to participate extensively in his care. Based on your knowledge about developmental tasks of 24to 26-year-olds, how would you explain the husband's emo-
tional and physical needs to the wife and the ways she can address these needs, as well as her own? The cardiologist has requested a consult with the transplant services; how will your plan of care change?
3. A patient recovering from heart transplantation has a short attention span, has a poor short-term memory, and cannot sleep well. The family reports the patient is speaking more rapidly than usual and is excessively excited and happy. The surgeon states the high doses of steroids are most likely the reason and expects the symptoms to diminish as the steroids are tapered. Another patient who has undergone the same surgical procedure cries frequently and has reported being overwhelmed by the variety and schedule of medications. The family has not been in to visit the patient for 2 days. How would you explain the different reactions, and how would your teaching strategies for these two patients differ?
4. You are caring for a man with pericarditis. His systolic blood pressure begins to fall, and heart sounds cannot be heard. Describe the actions you would take and why.

\title{
Management of Patients With Complications From Heart Disease
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the management of patients with chronic heart failure.
2. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with heart failure.
3. Describe the management of patients with acute heart failure.

Tododay, the patient with heart disease can be assisted to live longer and achieve a higher quality life than even a decade ago. Through advancements in diagnostic procedures that allow earlier and more accurate diagnoses, treatment can begin well before significant debilitation occurs. Newer treatments, technologies, and pharmacotherapies are being developed rapidly. However, heart disease remains a chronic condition, and complications may develop. This chapter presents the complications most often resulting from heart diseases and the treatments provided by the health care team for these complications.

\section*{Cardiac Hemodynamics}

The basic function of the heart is to pump blood. The heart's ability to pump is measured by cardiac output (CO), the amount of blood pumped in 1 minute. CO is determined by measuring the heart rate (HR) and multiplying it by the stroke volume (SV), which is the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricle with each contraction. CO usually is calculated using the equation $\mathrm{CO}=\mathrm{HR} \times \mathrm{SV}$.

One of the factors controlling HR is the autonomic nervous system. When SV falls, the nervous system is stimulated to increase HR and thereby maintain adequate CO. SV depends on three factors: preload, afterload, and contractility.

Preload is the amount of myocardial stretch just before systole caused by the pressure created by the volume of blood within the ventricle. Like a rubber band, the ventricular muscle fibers need to be stretched (by the blood) to produce optimal ejection of blood. Too little or too much muscle fiber stretch decreases the volume of blood ejected. The major factor that determines preload is venous return, the volume of blood that enters the ventri-
cle during diastole. Another factor that determines preload is ventricular compliance, which is the elasticity or amount of "give" when blood enters the ventricle. Elasticity is decreased when the muscle thickens, as in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see Chap. 29) or when there is increased fibrotic tissue within the ventricle. Fibrotic tissue replaces dead cells, such as after a myocardial infarction (see Chap. 28). Fibrotic tissue has little compliance, making the ventricle stiff. Given the same volume of blood, a noncompliant ventricle has a higher intraventricular pressure than a compliant one. The higher pressure increases the workload of the heart and can lead to heart failure (HF).

Afterload refers to the amount of resistance to the ejection of blood from the ventricle. To eject blood, the ventricle must overcome this resistance. Afterload is inversely related to SV. The major factors that determine afterload are the diameter and distensibility of the great vessels (aorta and pulmonary artery) and the opening and competence of the semilunar valves (pulmonic and aortic valves). The more open the valves, the lower the resistance. If the patient has significant vasoconstriction, hypertension, or a narrowed opening from a stenotic valve, resistance (afterload) increases. When afterload increases, the workload of the heart must increase to overcome the resistance and eject blood.

Contractility, which refers to the force of contraction, is related to the number and status of myocardial cells. Catecholamines, released by sympathetic stimulation such as exercise or from administration of positive inotropic medications, can increase contractility and stroke volume. MI causes necrosis of some myocardial cells, shifting the workload to the remaining cells. Significant loss of myocardial cells can decrease contractility and cause HF. Afterload must be reduced by stress reduction techniques or medications to match the lower contractility.
afterload: the amount of resistance to ejection of blood from a ventricle
anuria: urine output of less than 50 mL per 24 hours
cardiac failure: heart failure
cardiac output (CO): the amount of blood pumped out of the heart in 1 minute
compliance: the elasticity or amount of "give" when blood enters the ventricle
congestive heart failure (CHF): a fluid overload condition (congestion) that may or may not be caused by HF; often an acute presentation of HF with increased amount of fluid in the blood vessels
contractility: the force of ventricular contraction; related to the number and state of myocardial cells
diastolic heart failure: the inability of the heart to pump sufficiently because of an alteration in the ability of the heart to fill; current term used to describe a type of HF
dyspnea on exertion (DOE): shortness of breath that occurs with exertion
ejection fraction (EF): percent of blood volume in the ventricles at the end of diastole that is ejected during systole; a measurement of contractility
heart failure (HF): the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet the needs
of the tissues for oxygen and nutrients; signs and symptoms of pulmonary and systemic congestion may or may not be present
left-sided heart failure (left ventricular failure): inability of the left ventricle to fill or pump (empty) sufficient blood to meet the needs of the tissues for oxygen and nutrients; traditional term used to describe patient's HF symptoms
oliguria: diminished urine output; less than 400 mL per 24 hours
orthopnea: shortness of breath when lying flat
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND): shortness of breath that occurs suddenly during sleep
pericardiocentesis: procedure that involves surgically opening the pericardial sac
pericardiotomy: surgically created opening of the pericardium
preload: the amount of myocardial stretch just before systole caused by the pressure created by the volume of blood within a ventricle
pulmonary edema: abnormal accumulation of fluid occurring in the interstitial spaces or in the alveoli of the lungs
pulseless electrical activity (PEA): condition in which electrical activity is present
but there is not an adequate pulse or blood pressure because of ineffective cardiac contraction or circulating blood volume
pulsus paradoxus: systolic blood pressure that is more than 10 mm Hg higher during exhalation than during inspiration; difference is normally less than 10 mm Hg
right-sided heart failure (right ventricular failure): inability of the right ventricle to fill or pump (empty) sufficient blood to the pulmonary circulation
stroke volume (SV): amount of blood pumped out of the ventricle with each contraction
systolic heart failure: inability of the heart to pump sufficiently because of an alteration in the ability of the heart to contract; current term used to describe a type of HF
thermodilution: method of determining cardiac output that involves injecting fluid into the pulmonary artery catheter. A thermistor measures the difference between the temperature of the fluid and the temperature of the blood ejected from the ventricle. Cardiac output is calculated from the change in temperature.

\section*{NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF CARDIAC HEMODYNAMICS}

Several noninvasive assessment findings can indicate cardiac hemodynamic status, although the findings do not directly correlate to preload, afterload, or contractility. Right ventricular preload may be estimated by measuring jugular venous distention. Elevated left ventricular preload may be identified by a positive hepatojugular test. Mean arterial blood pressure is a rough indicator of left ventricular afterload. Activity tolerance may be used as an indicator of overall cardiac functioning. These assessments are described in more detail later in the chapter.

Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for continuous calculation of SV, CO, systemic vascular resistance, ventricular contractility, and fluid status (Turner, 2000). Electrodes are placed on the patient's chest. The electrodes are connected to a device that transmits a very small amount of alternating electric current through the chest and measures the resistance (Z) to the flow (conduction) of the current. Because the current seeks the path of least resistance and fluid is an excellent conductor, the current flows through the blood. ICG measures the volume of blood flow.

The cardiac cycle produces normal changes in blood flow volume; for example, there is more blood flow volume during systole and less blood flow volume during diastole. The changes in blood flow volume change the resistance to flow of the current, which is called electrical impedance (dZ). During systole, the higher blood flow volume causes the red blood cells to be aligned in a more parallel pattern, which makes the flow of current faster and reduces impedance. During diastole, the lower blood flow volume causes the red blood cells to be more randomly arranged, which makes the flow of current slower and increases impedance. Stroke volume is determined by comparing dZ to the changes in time (dt) (Von Rueden \& Turner, 1999). The preejection period (PEP) and ventricular ejection times (VET) can be measured, which further assists in understanding the hemodynamic status of the patient. For example, a dysfunctional left ventricle requires more time to generate pressure to overcome the resistance to ejection so that the aortic valve opens (increased PEP) and has less time during which blood is ejected into the aorta (decreased VET).

\section*{INVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF CARDIAC HEMODYNAMICS}

An important method for evaluating the components of SV in a hemodynamically unstable patient is the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter, which is used to obtain the hemodynamic data essential for diagnosis and treatment (see Chap. 26). Connected to a computerized transducer apparatus, the PA catheter serves as a fluidfilled conduit for detecting pressure changes within the heart. The pulsatile changes in pressure are converted into electrical signals, which are displayed as waveforms on a monitor (Fig. 30-1; Chart 30-1).

CO is measured most often by the thermodilution method with the thermistor port of the catheter. The port is connected to a computer that calculates CO and other cardiac parameters. In thermodilution, a specific volume of fluid that is colder than the patient's blood is injected into the proximal port (right atrium). The fluid enters the right ventricle and is then ejected into the PA. The thermistor records the temperature before and after the ejection of fluid. The change in temperature is inversely related to CO ; the greater the CO , the faster the blood and fluid moves, the less time the fluid has to mix with the blood to cause a change
in temperature, and the less change in temperature detected by the thermistor.

Cardiac parameters for afterload and contractility are calculated at the same time as CO (Table 30-1). Measurements of the various pressures are made at intervals. Therapy, especially intravenous medication, is adjusted based on the assessment and diagnostic findings.

The patient with an invasive hemodynamic catheter is usually managed in an intensive care environment (see Chart 30-1) because of the need for frequent nursing assessments and interventions.

\section*{Heart Failure}

HF, often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF), is the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet the needs of the tissues for oxygen and nutrients. However, the term CHF is misleading, because it indicates that patients must experience pulmonary or peripheral congestion to have HF, and it implies that patients with congestion have HF. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) HF guidelines panel (1994) defined HF as a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of fluid overload or of inadequate tissue perfusion. These signs and symptoms result when the heart is unable to generate a CO sufficient to meet the body's demands. The HF guideline panel used the term heart failure because many patients with HF do not manifest pulmonary or systemic congestion. The term HF is preferred and indicates myocardial heart disease in which there is a problem with contraction of the heart (systolic dysfunction) or filling of the heart (diastolic dysfunction) and which may or may not cause pulmonary or systemic congestion. Some cases of HF are reversible, depending on the cause. Most often, HF is a life-long diagnosis that is managed with lifestyle changes and medications to prevent acute congestive episodes. CHF is usually an acute presentation of HF .

\section*{CHRONIC HEART FAILURE}

As with coronary artery disease, the incidence of HF increases with age. However, the rate of coronary artery disease is decreasing and just the opposite is true for HF. Nearly 5 million people in the United States have HF, with more than one-half million new cases diagnosed each year (American Heart Association, 2001). The prevalence rate of HF among non-Hispanic whites 20 years of age or older is $2.3 \%$ for men and $1.5 \%$ for women; for non-Hispanic blacks, the rates are $3.5 \%$ and $3.1 \%$, respectively (American Heart Association, 2001). HF is the most common reason for hospitalization of people older than age 65 and the second most common reason for visits to a physician's office. The rate of readmission to the hospital remains staggeringly high. The rise in the incidence of HF reflects the increased number of elderly and improvements in treatment of HF resulting in increased survival rates. However, the economic burden caused by HF is estimated to be more than 23 billion dollars in direct and indirect costs and is expected to increase (American Heart Association, 2001). Many hospitalizations could be prevented by improved and appropriate outpatient care. Prevention and early intervention to arrest the progression of HF are major health initiatives in the United States.

Medical management is based on the type, severity, and cause of HF. There are two types of HF, which are identified by assessment of left ventricular functioning: an alteration in ventricular filling (diastolic heart failure) and an alteration in ventricular contraction

\caption{EIGURE 30-1 The pulmonary artery (PA) catheter system serves as a fluid-filled conduit for detecting pressure changes within the heart. (A) The PA catheter is inserted through a sheath into the superior vena cava, usually via the right internal jugular or subclavian vein. It is connected to pressure tubing (B) which is then connected to a transducer (C). The transducer detects pulsatile changes in pressure and converts them into electrical signals. These signals are converted into waveforms, which are shown on a monitor (D). The transducer also contains a flush device (E) that automatically infuses a small amount of flush fluid through the catheter to help maintain its patency. Because of the pressure that the heart generates, pressure is applied to the flush fluid to ensure that the fluid flows into the catheter and into the bloodstream and that blood does not flow back into the catheter. The PA catheter contains several lumens (F) with openings located at various intervals. These lumens allow for the measurement of hemodynamic pressures at different points. The proximal port is usually in the right atrium and is used to measure central venous pressure (CVP). The distal tip of the catheter rests in the pulmonary artery and measures the pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures. When the balloon is inflated ( $\mathbf{G}$ ), the tip floats into smaller branches of the pulmonary artery until it can no longer pass, that is, until it is "wedged" in the vessel. The distal tip then records the pressure in front of it, called pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP). Cardiac output is measured most often by the thermodilution method with the thermistor port. The port is connected to a computer that calculates cardiac output and other cardiac parameters.}

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Hemodynamic Monitoring: Multilumen Pulmonary Artery Catheter}

\section*{ACTIONS}

\section*{Preparatory Phase}
1. Explain the procedure to the patient, family, and significant others.
2. Check vital signs and apply ECG electrodes.
3. Position the patient to allow the physician access to the insertion site, decrease the risk of complications, and promote patient comfort. To ensure consistency, the angle of elevation should be documented if the patient cannot lie flat.
4. Set up equipment according to manufacturer's directions.
a. The pulmonary artery (PA) catheter requires pressure tubing, a transducer, a flush system, and a pressure amplifier connected to a monitoring-recording system. In addition, an IV pole and a transducer holder are usually needed.
b. The pressure equipment is calibrated and flushed according to the manufacturer's directions.
c. The balloon is inflated with air to test for leakage.
5. Prepare the skin over the insertion site.

\section*{Performance Phase (Physician Responsibility)}
1. The PA catheter is inserted through a sheath that has been placed in the internal jugular, subclavian, or any easily accessible, largediameter vein by percutaneous puncture or venotomy. The sheath may be surrounded by a protective cover that maintains the sterility of the catheter.
2. The catheter is advanced while observing the monitor for pressure waveforms, which indicate the placement of the tip of the catheter within the heart. Occasionally fluoroscopy is used to verify proper placement of the PA catheter.
3. When the catheter is in the large vein, the balloon is inflated to its recommended volume.
4. The patient's blood flow will gently pull the inflated balloon at the tip of the catheter through the right atrium and tricuspid valve into the right ventricle and into the main pulmonary artery. The monitoring equipment displays specific pressure waveforms as the catheter advances through the various chambers of the heart. These initial waveforms and pressures are recorded.
5. The flowing blood will continue to direct the catheters more distally into the pulmonary arteries. When the catheter reaches a pulmonary vessel that is approximately the same size or slightly smaller in diameter than the inflated balloon, it will not advance any further. This is the wedge position from which pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) [pulmonary artery obstructive pressure (PAOP) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)] is measured.
6. The pressure is recorded with the balloon wedged in the pulmonary vascular bed. A mean capillary wedge pressure between 8 and 12 mm Hg indicates normal left ventricular function.
7. The balloon is then deflated, causing the catheter to retract spontaneously into a larger pulmonary artery. The change in the catheter tip position causes a reappearance of the pulmonary artery waveform. The pulmonary artery systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures are recorded.

\section*{RATIONALE/AMPLIFICATION}
1. The information may assist in reducing the patient's anxiety, which may also help to limit the patient's movement during the procedure.
2. An initial assessment provides a baseline for comparison.
3. The patient is usually placed in a flat or Trendelenburg position to minimize the risk of air embolization and facilitate access.
4. Monitoring systems and setups vary according to manufacturer. a. The complexity of the setup requires an understanding of the equipment in use.
b. Flushing the catheter system ensures patency and eliminates air bubbles.
c. Testing for leakage ensures that the balloon is intact.
5. Decreases risk of infection at insertion site
1. The internal jugular vein insertion site has standard landmarks, establishes a straight route into the central venous system, and is associated with few complications. The subclavian insertion site allows the patient more mobility. It is also easier to secure the catheter from this site.
2. Catheter placement is determined by characteristic waveforms and changes.
3. The amount of air to be used is indicated on the catheter.
4. Watching the ECG monitor for signs of ventricular irritability as the catheter enters the right ventricle allows dysrhythmias to be reported to the physician promptly. Subsequent pressure readings are taken from this baseline.
5. With the catheter in the wedge position, the balloon blocks the flow of blood from the right side of the heart toward the lungs. The resulting artery wedge pressure (PAWP) correlates with the mean left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
6. Wedge pressure is a valuable measure of cardiac function. Lower-than-normal pressure readings indicate hypovolemia. Higher-than-normal pressure readings indicate hypervolemia and/or left ventricular failure.
7. The normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 15 to 30 mm Hg , and the diastolic pressure range is 10 to 15 mm Hg . The normal mean pulmonary artery pressure (average pressure in pulmonary artery throughout the entire cardiac cycle) ranges from 10 to 20 mm Hg . Elevated pulmonary pressures can indicate several clinical problems, such as pulmonary disease, mitral valve disease, and ventricular failure.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Hemodynamic Monitoring: Multilumen Pulmonary Artery Catheter (Continued)}

\section*{ACTIONS}
8. The protective cover is attached to the introducer and secured to the catheter. The catheter is sutured in place and a dry dressing placed over the insertion site.
9. A chest x-ray to confirm catheter position and to serve as a baseline for future reference is obtained after catheter insertion.

\section*{To Obtain a Wedge Pressure Reading}
1. Inflate the balloon slowly until the pulmonary artery pressure waveform changes (indicating a wedge pressure waveform) and an increase in resistance to injection is detected. Once these changes occur, no more air is introduced. (The amount of air to cause these changes should be less than 1.5 mL .) Most cardiac monitors allow for freezing the wedge pressure waveform and its immediate printing.
2. As soon as the wedge pressure is obtained, allow passive deflation of the balloon by releasing pressure on the syringe.

To make sure that the syringe cannot be inflated accidentally, remove it, push the plunger to the bottom of the barrel so that it is totally empty of air, reattach it to the PA catheter, and lock it closed.

\section*{Follow-up Phase}
1. Inspect the insertion site daily. Observe for signs of infection, swelling, and bleeding.
2. In accord with protocol, record date and time of dressing change and IV tubing change. If a peripheral vessel access site is used, assess the extremity for color, temperature, capillary filling, and sensation.
3. Evaluate pulse.
4. Assess for complications: pneumothorax, pulmonary ischemia or infarction (due to persistent balloon wedging from inflation or catheter migration), pulmonary artery rupture (due to overinflation of the balloon), dysrhythmias, heart block, damage to tricuspid valve, knotting of catheter within the heart or blood vessels, thromboembolus, infection, balloon rupture, hematoma at insertion site, and bleeding.

\section*{For Removal of the Catheter}
1. Explain the procedure to the patient, and make sure the balloon is not inflated.
2. Place the patient in a supine position.
3. Stop all IVs running through the PA catheter and turn stopcocks off.
4. While the patient holds the breath or exhales, the catheter is withdrawn gently and continuously, without excessive force or traction; a sterile dressing is applied over the site.

\section*{RATIONALE/AMPLIFICATION}
8. Maintaining catheter sterility in this manner allows for the advancement and repositioning of the catheter if needed. Apply sterile dressing.
9. Accurate position will assure accurate readings and prevent complications.
1. Do not allow the catheter to remain in the wedge position. The decrease in blood flow through the pulmonary artery that occurs when wedging the catheter may cause segmental pulmonary infarction.
2. These are standard safety measures.
1. Careful monitoring helps prevent complications. A foreign body (catheter) in the vascular system increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Ischemia may occur from inadequate arterial flow.
3. Absence of a pulse may indicate occlusion of the vessel.
4. These are standard nursing practices.
1. An informed patient is less fearful; a deflated balloon is less likely to injure the patient's heart or blood vessels during catheter removal.
2. The supine position results in the least patient movement and is the best position for maintaining blood pressure and venous return.
3. This prevents fluid from infusing into tissues as the catheter is removed; it also prevents air from entering the catheter.
4. Positive intrathoracic pressure minimizes the chance of air entering the chest and vasculature through or around the catheter. Continuous gentle traction minimizes the risk of the catheter becoming kinked, knotted, or tangled. A sterile dressing minimizes the risk of infection from the skin wound.
(systolic heart failure). An assessment of the ejection fraction (EF) is performed to assist in determining the type of HF. EF is the percentage of the end-diastolic blood volume in the ventricle minus the end-systolic blood volume in the ventricle divided by the end-diastolic blood volume in the ventricle-an indication of the amount of blood that was ejected and the contractile ability of the ventricle. The EF is normal in diastolic HF, whereas the EF is less than $40 \%$ in systolic HF. The severity of HF is frequently classified according to the patient's symptoms. The New York Heart Association classification is described in Table 30-2, and the causes are explained in subsequent sections of this chapter.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

HF results from a variety of cardiovascular diseases but leads to some common heart abnormalities that result in decreased contraction (systole), decreased filling (diastole), or both. Significant myocardial dysfunction most often occurs before the patient experiences signs and symptoms of HF .

Systolic HF decreases the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle, which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system to release epinephrine and norepinephrine. The purpose of this initial response is to support the failing myocardium, but the continued

response causes loss of beta ${ }_{1}$-adrenergic receptor sites (downregulation) and further damage to the heart muscle cells. The sympathetic stimulation and the decrease in renal perfusion by the failing heart cause the release of renin by the kidney. Renin promotes the formation of angiotensin I, a benign, inactive substance. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lumen of blood vessels converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor that also causes the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone promotes sodium and fluid retention and stimulates the thirst center. Aldosterone causes additional detrimental effects to the myocardium and exacerbates myocardial fibrosis (Pitt et al., 1999; Weber, 2001). Angiotensin, aldosterone, and other neurohormones (eg, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin, and prostacyclin) lead to an increase in preload and afterload, which increases stress on the ventricular wall, causing an increase in the workload of the heart.

As the heart's workload increases, contractility of the myofibrils decreases. Decreased contractility results in an increase in end-diastolic blood volume in the ventricle, stretching the myofibers and increasing the size of the ventricle (ventricular dilation). The increased size of the ventricle further increases the stress on the ventricular wall, adding to the workload of the heart. One way the heart compensates for the increased workload is to increase the thickness of the heart muscle (ventricular hypertrophy). However, the hypertrophy is not accompanied by an adequate increase in capillary blood supply, resulting in myocardial ischemia. The sympathetic-induced coronary artery vasoconstriction, increased ventricular wall stress, and decreased mitochondrial energy production also lead to myocardial ischemia. Eventually, the myocardial ischemia causes myofibril death, even in patients without coronary artery disease. The compensatory mechanisms of HF have been called the "vicious cycle of HF" because the heart does not pump sufficient blood to the body, which causes the body to stimulate the heart to work harder; the heart is unable to respond and failure becomes worse.

Diastolic HF develops because of continued increased workload on the heart, which responds by increasing the number and size of myocardial cells (ie, ventricular hypertrophy and altered myocellular functioning). These responses cause resistance to ventricular filling, which increases ventricular filling pressures despite a normal or reduced blood volume. Less blood in the ventricles causes decreased CO. The low CO and high ventricular filling pressures cause the same neurohormonal responses as described for systolic HF.

\section*{Etiology}

Myocardial dysfunction is most often caused by coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or valvular disorders. Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries is the primary cause of HF. Coronary artery disease is found in more than $60 \%$ of the patients with HF (Braunwald et al., 2001). Ischemia causes myocardial dysfunction because of resulting hypoxia and acidosis from the accumulation of lactic acid. Myocardial infarction causes focal heart muscle necrosis, the death of heart muscle cells, and a loss of contractility; the extent of the infarction correlates with the severity of HF. Revascularization of the coronary artery by a percutaneous coronary intervention or by coronary artery bypass surgery may correct the underlying cause so that HF is resolved.

Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardium. There are three types: dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive (see Chap. 29). Dilated cardiomyopathy, the most common type of cardiomyopathy, causes diffuse cellular necrosis, leading to decreased contractility (systolic failure). Dilated cardiomyopathy can be idiopathic (unknown cause), or it can result from an inflammatory process, such as myocarditis, from pregnancy, or from a cytotoxic agent, such as alcohol or adriamycin. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy lead to decreased distensibility and ventricular filling (diastolic failure). Usually, HF due to cardiomyopathy becomes chronic. However, cardiomyopathy and HF may resolve after the end of pregnancy or with the cessation of alcohol ingestion.

Systemic or pulmonary hypertension increases afterload (resistance to ejection), which increases the workload of the heart and leads to hypertrophy of myocardial muscle fibers; this can be considered a compensatory mechanism because it increases contractility. However, the hypertrophy may impair the heart's ability to fill properly during diastole.

Valvular heart disease is also a cause of HF. The valves ensure that blood flows in one direction. With valvular dysfunction, blood has increasing difficulty moving forward, increasing pressure within the heart and increasing cardiac workload, leading to diastolic HF. Chapter 29 discusses the effects of valvular heart disease.

Several systemic conditions contribute to the development and severity of HF, including increased metabolic rate (eg, fever, thyrotoxicosis), iron overload (eg, from hemochromatosis), hypoxia, and anemia (serum hematocrit less than $25 \%$ ). All of these conditions require an increase in CO to satisfy the systemic oxygen demand. Hypoxia or anemia also may decrease the supply of oxygen to the myocardium. Cardiac dysrhythmias may cause HF, or they may be a result of HF; either way, the altered electrical stimulation impairs the myocardial contraction and decreases the overall efficiency of myocardial function. Other factors, such as acidosis (respiratory or metabolic), electrolyte abnormalities, and antiarrhythmic medications, can worsen the myocardial dysfunction.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical manifestations produced by the different types of HF (systolic, diastolic, or both) are similar (Chart 30-2) and therefore do not assist in differentiating the types of HF. The signs and symptoms of HF are most often described in terms of the effect on the ventricles. Left-sided heart failure (left ventricular failure) causes different manifestations than right-sided heart failure (right ventricular failure). Chronic HF produces signs and symptoms of failure of both ventricles. Although dysrhythmias (especially tachycardias, ventricular ectopic beats, or atrioventricular [AV] and ventricular conduction defects) are common in HF, they may also be a result of treatments used in HF (eg, side effect of digitalis).

\section*{LEFT-SIDED HEART FAILURE}

Pulmonary congestion occurs when the left ventricle cannot pump the blood out of the ventricle to the body. The increased left ventricular end-diastolic blood volume increases the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which decreases blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle during diastole. The blood volume and pressure in the left atrium increases, which decreases blood flow from the pulmonary vessels. Pulmonary venous blood volume and pressure rise, forcing fluid from the pulmonary capillar-

ies into the pulmonary tissues and alveoli, which impairs gas exchange. These effects of left ventricular failure have been referred to as backward failure. The clinical manifestations of pulmonary venous congestion include dyspnea, cough, pulmonary crackles, and lower-than-normal oxygen saturation levels. An extra heart sound, $S_{3}$, may be detected on auscultation.

Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, may be precipitated by minimal to moderate activity (dyspnea on exertion [DOE]); dyspnea also can occur at rest. The patient may report orthopnea, difficulty in breathing when lying flat. Patients with orthopnea usually prefer not to lie flat. They may need pillows to prop themselves up in bed, or they may sit in a chair and even sleep sitting up. Some patients have sudden attacks of orthopnea at night, a condition known as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). Fluid that accumulated in the dependent extremities during the day begins to be reabsorbed into the circulating blood volume when the person lies down. Because the impaired left ventricle cannot eject the increased circulating blood volume, the pressure in the pulmonary circulation increases, causing further shifting of fluid into the alveoli. The fluid filled alveoli cannot exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. Without sufficient oxygen, the patient experiences dyspnea and has difficulty getting an adequate amount of sleep.

The cough associated with left ventricular failure is initially dry and nonproductive. Most often, patients complain of a dry hacking cough that may be mislabeled as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The cough may become moist. Large quantities of frothy sputum, which is sometimes
pink (blood tinged), may be produced, usually indicating severe pulmonary congestion (pulmonary edema).

Adventitious breath sounds may be heard in various lobes of the lungs. Usually, bi-basilar crackles that do not clear with coughing are detected in the early phase of left ventricular failure. As the failure worsens and pulmonary congestion increases, crackles may be auscultated throughout all lung fields. At this point, a decrease in oxygen saturation may occur.

In addition to increased pulmonary pressures that cause decreased oxygenation, the amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle may decrease, sometimes called forward failure. The dominant feature in HF is inadequate tissue perfusion. The diminished CO has widespread manifestations because not enough blood reaches all the tissues and organs (low perfusion) to provide the necessary oxygen. The decrease in SV can also lead to stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, which further impedes perfusion to many organs.

Blood flow to the kidneys decreases, causing decreased perfusion and reduced urine output (oliguria). Renal perfusion pressure falls, which results in the release of renin from the kidney. Release of renin leads to aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone secretion causes sodium and fluid retention, which further increases intravascular volume. However, when the patient is sleeping, the cardiac workload is decreased, improving renal perfusion, which then leads to frequent urination at night (nocturia).

Decreased CO causes other symptoms. Decreased gastrointestinal perfusion causes altered digestion. Decreased brain perfusion causes dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, restlessness, and anxiety due to decreased oxygenation and blood flow. As anxiety increases, so does dyspnea, enhancing anxiety and creating a vicious cycle. Stimulation of the sympathetic system also causes the peripheral blood vessels to constrict, so the skin appears pale or ashen and feels cool and clammy.

The decrease in the ejected ventricular volume causes the sympathetic nervous system to increase the heart rate (tachycardia), often causing the patient to complain of palpitations. The pulses become weak and thready. Without adequate CO, the body cannot respond to increased energy demands, and the patient is easily fatigued and has decreased activity tolerance. Fatigue also results from the increased energy expended in breathing and the insomnia that results from respiratory distress, coughing, and nocturia.

\section*{RIGHT-SIDED HEART FAILURE}

When the right ventricle fails, congestion of the viscera and the peripheral tissues predominates. This occurs because the right side of the heart cannot eject blood and cannot accommodate all the blood that normally returns to it from the venous circulation. The increase in venous pressure leads to jugular vein distention (JVD).

The clinical manifestations that ensue include edema of the lower extremities (dependent edema), hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver), distended jugular veins, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity), weakness, anorexia and nausea, and paradoxically, weight gain due to retention of fluid.

Edema usually affects the feet and ankles, worsening when the patient stands or dangles the legs. The swelling decreases when the patient elevates the legs. The edema can gradually progress up the legs and thighs and eventually into the external genitalia and lower trunk. Edema in the abdomen, as evidenced by increased abdominal girth, may be the only edema present. Sacral edema is not uncommon for patients who are on bed rest, because the sacral area is dependent. Pitting edema, in which
indentations in the skin remain after even slight compression with the fingertips (Fig. 30-2), is obvious only after retention of at least 4.5 kg ( 10 lb ) of fluid ( 4.5 liters).

Hepatomegaly and tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen result from venous engorgement of the liver. The increased pressure may interfere with the liver's ability to perform (secondary liver dysfunction). As hepatic dysfunction progresses, pressure within the portal vessels may rise enough to force fluid into the abdominal cavity, a condition known as ascites. This collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity may increase pressure on the stomach and intestines and cause gastrointestinal distress. Hepatomegaly may also increase pressure on the diaphragm, causing respiratory distress.

Anorexia (loss of appetite) and nausea or abdominal pain results from the venous engorgement and venous stasis within the abdominal organs. The weakness that accompanies right-sided HF results from reduced CO, impaired circulation, and inadequate removal of catabolic waste products from the tissues.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

HF may go undetected until the patient presents with signs and symptoms of pulmonary and peripheral edema (congestion), which can lead the physician to make a preliminary diagnosis of CHF. However, the physical signs that suggest HF may also occur with other diseases, such as renal failure, liver failure, oncologic conditions, and COPD. If further assessment and evaluation are

not completed, these patients may be treated for HF inappropriately. The term congestive heart failure (CHF) means the patient has a fluid overload condition (congestion) that may or may not be caused by HF. CHF is caused by HF when ventricular dysfunction (systolic, diastolic, or both) has been identified. Assessment of ventricular function is an essential part of the initial diagnostic workup.

An echocardiogram is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis of HF, assist in the identification of the underlying cause, and determine the patient's ejection fraction, which assists in identification of the type and severity of HF. This information may also be obtained noninvasively by radionuclide ventriculography or invasively by ventriculogram as part of a cardiac catheterization procedure. A chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram (ECG) are obtained to assist in the diagnosis and to determine the underlying cause of HF. Laboratory studies usually completed in the initial workup include serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a complete blood cell count (CBC), and routine urinalysis. The results of these laboratory studies assist in determining the underlying cause and in establishing a baseline from which to measure effects of treatment. Exercise testing or cardiac catheterization may be performed to determine whether coronary artery disease and cardiac ischemia are causing the HF.

Ventricular function should be determined before discharge from a hospital of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) who are at risk for the development of HF. Patients who are at low risk for HF are those who meet all of the following criteria: no previous myocardial infarction, inferior myocardial infarction, small (less than two to four times normal) increase in cardiac enzymes, no Q waves on the ECG, and an uncomplicated clinical course (AHCPR, 1994). Evaluation of ventricular function may also be performed for patients whose initial assessment of HF suggested noncardiac causes but who failed to respond to treatment.

\section*{Medical Management}

A critical step in the management of HF is early identification and documentation of the type of HF. Medical management, especially the pharmacologic therapy, varies with the type of HF. The basic objectives in treating patients with HF are the following:
- Eliminate or reduce any etiologic contributory factors, especially those that may be reversible, such as atrial fibrillation or excessive alcohol ingestion.
- Reduce the workload on the heart by reducing afterload and preload.
Managing the patient with HF includes providing general counseling and education about sodium restriction, monitoring daily weights and other signs of fluid retention, encouraging regular exercise, and recommending avoidance of excessive fluid intake, alcohol, and smoking. Medications are prescribed based on the patient's type and severity of HF. Oxygen therapy is based on the degree of pulmonary congestion and resulting hypoxia. Some patients may need supplemental oxygen therapy only during activity. Others may require hospitalization and endotracheal intubation. If the patient has underlying coronary artery disease, coronary artery revascularization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or bypass surgery (see Chap. 28) may be considered. If the patient's condition is unresponsive to advanced aggressive medical therapy, innovative therapies, including mechanical assist devices and transplantation, may be considered.

Cardiac resynchronization, involving the use of left ventricular and biventricular pacing, is a treatment for HF with electrical conduction defects. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is frequently found in patients with systolic dysfunction. LBBB occurs when the electrical impulse, which normally depolarizes the right and left bundle branches at the same time, depolarizes the right bundle branch but not the left bundle branch. The dyssynchronous electrical stimulation of the ventricles causes the right ventricle to contract before the left ventricle, which can lead to further decreased ejection fraction (Gerber et al., 2001). Use of a pacing device (eg, Medtronic InSync), with leads placed on the inner wall of the right atrium and right ventricle and on the outer wall of the left ventricle, provides synchronized electrical stimulation to the heart. In one study, $63 \%$ of the patients who had received these devices showed improvement in clinical status, including NYHA functional class and global assessment, compared with $38 \%$ of placebo patients (Abraham, 2002).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Several medications are indicated for systolic HF. Medications for diastolic failure depend on the underlying condition, such as hypertension (see Chap. 32) or valvular dysfunction (see Chap. 29). If the patient is in mild systolic failure, an ACE inhibitor usually is prescribed. If the patient is unable to continue an ACE inhibitor (eg, because of development of renal impairment as evidenced by elevated serum creatinine or persistent serum potassium levels of $5.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ or above), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate are considered as part of the treatment plan. A diuretic is added if signs of fluid overload develop. Digitalis is added to ACE inhibitors if the symptoms continue. Although previously contraindicated in HF, specific beta-blockers decrease mortality and morbidity if added to the initial medications. Spironolactone, a weak diuretic may also be added for persistent symptoms.

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors. ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) have a pivotal role in the management of HF due to systolic dysfunction. They have been found to relieve the signs and symptoms of HF and significantly decrease mortality and morbidity (when used to treat a symptomatic patient) by inhibiting neurohormonal activation (CONSENSUS Trial Study Group, 1987; SOLVD Investigators, 1992). Available as oral and intravenous medications, ACE-Is promote vasodilation and diuresis by decreasing afterload and preload. By doing so, they decrease the workload of the heart. Vasodilation reduces resistance to left ventricular ejection of blood, diminishing the heart's workload and improving ventricular emptying. In promoting diuresis, ACE-Is decrease the secretion of aldosterone, a hormone that causes the kidneys to retain sodium. ACE-Is stimulate the kidneys to excrete sodium and fluid (while retaining potassium), thereby reducing left ventricular filling pressure and decreasing pulmonary congestion. ACE-Is may be the first medication prescribed for patients in mild failure-patients with fatigue or dyspnea on exertion but without signs of fluid overload and pulmonary congestion.

Results from studies (Clement et al., 2000; NETWORK Investigators, 1998) to identify the specific dose to achieve this effect are equivocal, although one large study showed significant reductions in death and hospitalization with higher doses (Packer et al., 1999). However, it is recommended to start at a low dose and increase every 2 weeks until the optimal dose is achieved and the patient is hemodynamically stable. The final maintenance dose depends on the patient's blood pressure, fluid status, renal status, and degree of cardiac failure.

Patients receiving ACE-I therapy are monitored for hypotension, hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and alterations in renal function, especially if they are also receiving diuretics. When to observe for these effects and for how long depends on the onset, peak, and duration of the medication. Table 30-3 identifies several types of ACE-Is and their pharmacokinetics. Hypotension is most likely to develop from ACE-I therapy in patients older than age 75 and in those with a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less, a serum sodium level of less than $135 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, or severe cardiac failure. Adjusting the dose or type of diuretic in response to the patient's blood pressure and renal function may allow for continued increases in the dosage of ACE-Is.

Because ACE-Is cause the kidneys to retain potassium, the patient who is also receiving a diuretic may not need to take oral potassium supplements. However, patients receiving potassiumsparing diuretics (which do not cause potassium loss with diuresis) must be carefully monitored for hyperkalemia, an increased level of potassium in the blood. Before the initiation of the ACE-I, hyperkalemic and hypovolemic states must be corrected. ACE-Is may be discontinued if the potassium remains above $5.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ or if the serum creatinine is $3.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and continues to increase. Other side effects of ACE-Is include a dry, persistent cough that may not respond to cough suppressants. However, the cough could also indicate a worsening of ventricular function and failure. Rarely, the cough indicates angioedema. If angioedema affects the oropharyngeal area and impairs breathing, the ACE-I must be stopped immediately.

Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs). Although their action is different than that of ACE-Is, ARBs (eg, losartan [Cozaar]) have a similar hemodynamic effect as ACE-Is: lowered blood pressure and lowered systemic vascular resistance. Whereas ACE-Is block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ARBs block the effects of angiotensin II at the angiotensin II receptor. ACE-Is and ARBs also have similar side effects: hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal dysfunction. ARBs are usually prescribed when patients are not able to tolerate ACE-Is.

Hydralazine and Isosorbide Dinitrate. A combination of hydralazine (Apresoline) and isosorbide dinitrate (Dilatrate-SR, Isordil, Sorbitrate) may be another alternative for patients who cannot take ACE-Is. Nitrates (eg, isosorbide dinitrate) cause ve-
nous dilation, which reduces the amount of blood return to the heart and lowers preload. Hydralazine lowers systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular afterload. It has also been shown to help avoid the development of nitrate tolerance. As with ARBs, this combination of medications is usually used when patients are not able to tolerate ACE-Is.

Beta-Blockers. When used with ACE-Is, beta-blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol), or bisoprolol (Zebeta), have been found to reduce mortality and morbidity in NYHA class II or III HF patients by reducing the cytotoxic effects from the constant stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial [BEST] Investigators, 2001; CIBIS-II Investigators and Committees, 1999; MERIT, 1999; Packer et al., 1996; Packer et al., 2001). These agents have also been recommended for patients with asymptomatic systolic dysfunction, such as after acute myocardial infarction or revascularization to prevent the onset of symptoms of HF . However, beta-blockers may also produce many side effects, including exacerbation of HF. The side effects are most common in the initial few weeks of treatment. The most frequent side effects are dizziness, hypotension, and bradycardia. To minimize these side effects, staggering the administration of the beta-blocker with the ACE-I is recommended. Because of the side effects, betablockers are initiated only after stabilizing the patient and ensuring a euvolemic (normal volume) state. They are titrated slowly (every 2 weeks), with close monitoring at each increase in dose. If the patient develops symptoms during the titration phase, treatment options include increasing the diuretic, reducing the dose of ACE-I, or decreasing the dose of the beta-blocker.

An important nursing role during titration is educating the patient about the potential worsening of symptoms during the early phase of treatment, and that improvement may take several weeks. It is very important that nurses provide support to patients going through this symptom-provoking phase of treatment. Because beta-blockade can cause bronchiole constriction, a beta ${ }_{1}$-selective beta-blocker (ie, one that primarily blocks the beta-adrenergic receptor sites in the heart), such as metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol), is recommended for patients with well-controlled, mild to moderate asthma. However, these patients need to be monitored closely for increased asthma symptoms. Any type of beta-blocker is contraindicated in patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma.

Diuretics. Diuretics are medications used to increase the rate of urine production and the removal of excess extracellular fluid from the body. Of the types of diuretics prescribed for patients with edema from HF, three are most common: thiazide, loop, and potassium-sparing diuretics. These medications are classified according to their site of action in the kidney and their effects on renal electrolyte excretion and reabsorption. Thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone (Mykrox, Zaroxolyn), inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption mainly in the early distal tubules. They also increase potassium and bicarbonate excretion. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix), inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption mainly in the ascending loop of Henle. Patients with signs and symptoms of fluid overload should be started on a diuretic, a thiazide for those with mild symptoms or a loop diuretic for patients with more severe symptoms or with renal insufficiency (Brater, 1998). Both types of diuretics may be used for those in severe HF
and unresponsive to a single diuretic. These medications may not be necessary if the patient responds to activity recommendations, avoidance of excessive fluid intake ( $<2$ quarts/day), and a lowsodium diet (eg, <2 g/day).

Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that inhibits sodium reabsorption in the late distal tubule and collecting duct. It has been found to be effective in reducing mortality and morbidity in NYHA class III and IV HF patients when added to ACE-Is, loop diuretics, and digoxin. Serum creatinine and potassium levels are monitored frequently (eg, within the first week and then every 4 weeks) when this medication is first administered.

Side effects of diuretics include electrolyte imbalances, symptomatic hypotension (especially with overdiuresis), hyperuricemia (causing gout), and ototoxicity. Dosages depend on the indications, patient age, clinical signs and symptoms, and renal function. Table 30-4 lists commonly used diuretics, dosages, and pharma-

cokinetic properties. Careful patient monitoring and dose adjustments are necessary to balance the effectiveness with the side effects of therapy. Diuretics greatly improve the patient's symptoms, but they do not prolong life.

Digitalis. The most commonly prescribed form of digitalis for patients with HF is digoxin (Lanoxin). The medication increases the force of myocardial contraction and slows conduction through the AV node. It improves contractility, increasing left ventricular output. The medication also enhances diuresis, which removes fluid and relieves edema. The effect of a given dose of medication depends on the state of the myocardium, electrolyte and fluid
balance, and renal and hepatic function. Although digitalis does not decrease the mortality rate, it is effective in decreasing the symptoms of systolic HF and in increasing the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (Digitalis Investigation Group, 1997). It also has been shown to significantly decrease hospitalization rates and emergency room visits for NYHA class II and III HF patients (Uretsky et al., 1993).

A key concern associated with digitalis therapy is digitalis toxicity. Chart 30-3 summarizes the actions and uses of digitalis along with the nursing surveillance required when it is administered. The patient is observed for the effectiveness of digitalis therapy: lessening dyspnea and orthopnea, decrease in pulmonary

Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside derived from digitalis, is used for patients with systolic HF, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. Digoxin improves cardiac function as follows:
- Increases the force of myocardial contraction
- Slows cardiac conduction through the AV node and therefore slows the ventricular rate in instances of supraventricular dysrhythmias
- Increases cardiac output by enhancing the force of ventricular contraction
- Promotes diuresis by increasing cardiac output.

The therapeutic level is usually 0.5 to $2.0 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$. Blood samples are usually obtained and analyzed to determine digitalis concentration at least 6 to 10 hours after the last dose. Toxicity may occur despite normal serum levels, and recommended dosages vary considerably.

\section*{Preparations}

\section*{Digoxin}
- Tablets: $0.125,0.25,0.5 \mathrm{mg}$ (Lanoxin)
- Capsules: $0.05,0.1,0.2 \mathrm{mg}$ (Lanoxicaps)
- Elixir: $0.05 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ (Lanoxin Pediatric elixir)
- Injection: $0.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}, 0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ (Lanoxin)

\section*{Digoxin Toxicity}

A serious complication of digoxin therapy is toxicity. The incidence is high, and toxicity may occur even though the serum digoxin level remains within a normal range. Diagnosis of digoxin toxicity is based on the patient's clinical symptoms, which include the following:
- Fatigue, depression, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting (early effects of digitalis toxicity)
- Changes in heart rhythm: new onset of regular rhythm or new onset of irregular rhythm
- ECG changes indicating SA or AV block; new onset of irregular rhythm indicating ventricular dysrhythmias; and atrial tachycardia with block, junctional tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia

\section*{Reversal of Toxicity}

Digoxin toxicity is treated by holding the medication while monitoring the patient's symptoms and serum digoxin level. If the toxicity is severe, digoxin immune FAB (Digibind) may be prescribed. Digibind binds with digoxin and makes it unavailable for use. The Digibind dosage is based on the digoxin level and the patient's weight. Serum digoxin values are not accurate for several days after administration of Digibind because they do not differentiate between bound and unbound digoxin. Because Digibind quickly decreases the amount of available digoxin, an increase in ventricular rate due to atrial fibrillation and worsening of symptoms of HF may ensue shortly after its administration.

\section*{Nursing Considerations and Actions}
1. Assess the patient's clinical response to digoxin therapy by evaluating relief of symptoms such as dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema.
2. Monitor serum potassium levels in patients receiving digoxin, especially those receiving both digoxin and diuretics. An undetected, uncorrected potassium imbalance predisposes patients to digoxin toxicity and dysrhythmias.
3. Assess for symptoms of electrolyte depletion: lassitude, apathy, mental confusion, anorexia, decreasing urinary output, azotemia.
4. Monitor the patient for factors that increase the risk of toxicity:
- Oral antibiotics, quinidine, amiodarone, calcium channel blocker therapy (See Table 27-1).
- Decreased potassium level (hypokalemia), which increases the action of digoxin and which may be caused by malnutrition, diarrhea, vomiting, or prolonged muscle wasting
- Impaired renal function, particularly in patients age 65 and older with decreased renal clearance.
5. Before administering digoxin, it is standard nursing practice to assess apical heart rate. When the patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation and the heart rate is less than 60 , or the rhythm becomes regular, the nurse may withhold the medication and notify the physician, because these signs indicate the development of AV conduction block. Although withholding digoxin is a common practice, the medication does not need to be withheld for a heart rate of less than 60 if the patient is in sinus rhythm because digoxin does not affect sinoatrial node automaticity. Measuring the PR interval for a patient with cardiac monitoring is more important than the apical pulse in determining whether digoxin should be held.

Note: If monitoring discloses that the patient is in sinus rhythm, the nurse monitors the patient's PR interval instead of the patient's heart rate. If the patient is in atrial fibrillation, the nurse monitors for the development of regular R-R intervals, indicating AV block.
6. Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distention.
7. Monitor for neurologic side effects: headache, malaise, nightmares, forgetfulness, social withdrawal, depression, agitation, confusion, paranoia, hallucinations, decreased visual acuity, yellow or green halo around objects (especially lights), or "snowy" vision.
8. Observe for and anticipate potential drug interactions when other medications are added to the patient's regimen. This is an important step in preventing toxicity. For example, antiarrhythmic and antibiotic medications may increase the amount of digoxin available to the patient. Diuretics may decrease the amount of potassium and increase the availability of digoxin. In addition, because digoxin is eliminated by the kidneys, renal function (serum creatinine and urine creatinine clearance) are monitored carefully.
crackles on auscultation, relief of peripheral edema, weight loss, and increase in activity tolerance. The serum potassium level is measured at intervals because diuresis may have caused hypokalemia. The effect of digitalis is enhanced in the presence of hypokalemia, so digitalis toxicity may occur. Serum digoxin levels are obtained once each year or more frequently if there have been changes in the patient's medications, renal function, or symptoms.

Calcium Channel Blockers. First-generation calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan), nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), and diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), are contraindicated in patients with systolic dysfunction, although they may be used in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Amlodipine (Norvasc) and felodipine (Plendil), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, cause vasodilation, reducing systemic vascular resistance. They may be used to improve symptoms especially in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, although they have no effect on mortality.

Other Medications. Anticoagulants may be prescribed, especially if the patient has a history of an embolic event or atrial fibrillation or mural thrombus is present. Other medications such as antianginal medications may be given to treat the underlying cause of HF. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprophen (Aleve, Advil, Motrin) should be avoided (Page \& Henry, 2000). They can increase systemic vascular resistance and decrease renal perfusion, especially in the elderly. For similar reasons, use of decongestants should be avoided.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

A low-sodium ( $\leq 2$ to $3 \mathrm{~g} /$ day ) diet and avoidance of excessive amounts of fluid are usually recommended. Although it has not been shown to affect the mortality rate, this recommendation reduces fluid retention and the symptoms of peripheral and pulmonary congestion. The purpose of sodium restriction is to decrease the amount of circulating volume, which would decrease the need for the heart to pump that volume. A balance needs to be achieved between the ability of the patient to alter the diet and the amount of medications that are prescribed. Any change in diet needs to be done with consideration of good nutrition as well as the patient's likes, dislikes, and cultural food patterns.

NURSING ALERT The sources of sodium should be specified in describing the regimen, rather than simply saying "low-salt" or "saltfree," and the quantity should be indicated in milligrams. Salt is not $100 \%$ sodium; there are 393 mg of sodium in $1 \mathrm{~g}(1000 \mathrm{mg})$ of salt.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse is responsible for administering the medications and for assessing their beneficial and detrimental effects to the patient. It is the balance of these effects that determines the type and dosage of pharmacologic therapy. Nursing actions to evaluate therapeutic effectiveness include the following:
- Keeping an intake and output record to identify a negative balance (more output than input)
- Weighing the patient daily at the same time and on the same scale, usually in the morning after urination; monitoring for a $2-$ to $3-\mathrm{lb}$ gain in a day or $5-\mathrm{lb}$ gain in week
- Auscultating lung sounds at least daily to detect an increase or decrease in pulmonary crackles
- Determining the degree of JVD
- Identifying and evaluating the severity of dependent edema
- Monitoring pulse rate and blood pressure, as well as monitoring for postural hypotension and making sure that the patient does not become hypotensive from dehydration
- Examining skin turgor and mucous membranes for signs of dehydration
- Assessing symptoms of fluid overload (eg, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and dyspnea on exertion) and evaluating changes

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Profuse and repeated diuresis can lead to hypokalemia (ie, potassium depletion). Signs are weak pulse, faint heart sounds, hypotension, muscle flabbiness, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and generalized weakness. Hypokalemia poses new problems for the patient with HF because it markedly weakens cardiac contractions. In patients receiving digoxin, hypokalemia can lead to digitalis toxicity. Digitalis toxicity and hypokalemia increase the likelihood of dangerous dysrhythmias (see Chart 30-3). Low levels of potassium may also indicate a low level of magnesium, which can add to the risk for dysrhythmias. Hyperkalemia may also occur, especially with the use of ACE-Is or ARBs and spironolactone.

> NURSING ALERT To reduce the risk for hypokalemia, the nurse advises patients to increase their dietary intake of potassium. Dried apricots, bananas, beets, figs, orange or tomato juice, peaches, and prunes (dried plums), potatoes, raisins, spinach, squash, and watermelon are good dietary sources of potassium. An oral potassium supplement (potassium chloride) may also be prescribed for patients receiving diuretic medications. If the patient is at risk for hyperkalemia, the nurse advises the patient to avoid the above products, including salt substitutes.

NURSING ALERT Grapefruit (fresh and juice) is a good dietary source of potassium but has serious drug-food interactions. Patients are advised to consult their physician or pharmacist before including grapefruit in their diet.

Prolonged diuretic therapy may also produce hyponatremia (deficiency of sodium in the blood), which results in apprehension, weakness, fatigue, malaise, muscle cramps and twitching, and a rapid, thready pulse.

NURSING ALERT Periodic assessment of the patient's electrolyte levels will alert health team members to hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyponatremia. Serum levels are assessed frequently when the patient starts diuretic therapy and then usually every 3 to 12 months. It is important to remember that serum potassium levels do not always indicate the total amount of potassium within the body.

Other problems associated with diuretic administration are hyperuricemia (excessive uric acid in the blood), volume depletion from excessive urination, and hyperglycemia.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Several normal changes that occur with aging increase the frequency of diastolic HF: increased systolic blood pressure, increased ventric-
ular wall thickness, increased atrial size, and increased myocardial fibrosis. Elderly people may present with atypical signs and symptoms: fatigue, weakness, and somnolence. Decreased renal function makes the elderly patient resistant to diuretics and more sensitive to changes in volume, especially with diastolic dysfunction. The administration of diuretics to elderly men requires nursing surveillance for bladder distention caused by urethral obstruction from an enlarged prostate gland. The bladder may be assessed with an ultrasound scanner, or the suprapubic area palpated for an oval mass and percussed for dullness, indicative of bladder fullness,

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH HEART FAILURE}

\section*{Assessment}

The nursing assessment for the patient with HF focuses on observing for effectiveness of therapy and for the patient's ability to understand and implement self-management strategies. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary and systemic fluid overload are recorded and reported immediately so that adjustments can be made in therapy. The nurse also explores the patient's emotional response to the diagnosis of HF, a chronic illness.

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

The nurse explores sleep disturbances, particularly sleep suddenly interrupted by shortness of breath. The nurse also asks about the number of pillows needed for sleep (an indication of orthopnea), activities of daily living, and the activities that cause shortness of breath. The nurse also explores the patient's understanding of HF , the selfmanagement strategies, and the desire to adhere to those strategies. The nurse helps patients to identify things that they have lost because of the diagnosis, their emotional response to that loss, and successful coping skills that they have used previously. Family and significant others are often included in these discussions.

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

The lungs are auscultated to detect crackles and wheezes or their absence. Crackles, which are produced by the sudden opening of small airways and alveoli that have adhered together by edema and exudate, may be heard at the end of inspiration and are not cleared with coughing. They may also sound like gurgling that may clear with coughing or suctioning. The rate and depth of respirations are also documented.

The heart is auscultated for an $S_{3}$ heart sound, a sign that the heart is beginning to fail and that increased blood volume remains in the ventricle with each beat. HR and rhythm are also documented. Rapid rates indicate that SV has decreased and that the ventricle has less time to fill, producing some blood stagnation in the atria and eventually in the pulmonary bed.

JVD is also assessed; distention greater than 3 cm above the sternal angle is considered abnormal. This is an estimate, not a precise measurement, of central venous pressure.

Sensorium and level of consciousness must be evaluated. As the volume of blood ejected by the heart decreases, so does the amount of oxygen transported to the brain.

The nurse makes sure that dependent parts of the patient's body are assessed for perfusion and edema. With significant decreases in SV, there is a decrease in perfusion to the periphery, causing the skin to feel cool and appear pale or cyanotic. If the patient is sitting upright, the feet and lower legs are examined for edema; if the patient is supine in bed, the sacrum and back are assessed for edema. Fingers and hands may also become edematous.

In extreme cases of HF, the patient may develop periorbital edema, in which the eyelids may swell shut.

The liver is assessed for hepatojugular reflux. The patient is asked to breathe normally while manual pressure is applied over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen for 30 to 60 seconds. If neck vein distention increases more than 1 cm , the test finding is positive for increased venous pressure.

If the patient is hospitalized, the nurse measures output carefully to establish a baseline against which to measure the effectiveness of diuretic therapy. Intake and output records are rigorously maintained. It is important to know whether the patient has ingested more fluid than he or she has excreted (positive fluid balance), which is then correlated with a gain in weight. The patient must be monitored for oliguria (diminished urine output, $<400 \mathrm{~mL} / 24$ hours) or anuria (urine output $<50 \mathrm{~mL} / 24$ hours).

The patient is weighed daily in the hospital or at home, at the same time of day, with the same type of clothing, and on the same scale. If there is a significant change in weight (ie, 2- to $3-\mathrm{lb}$ increase in a day or $5-\mathrm{lb}$ increase in a week), the patient is instructed to notify the physician or adjust the medications (eg, increase the diuretic dose).

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient with HF may include the following:
- Activity intolerance (or risk for activity intolerance) related to imbalance between oxygen supply and demand because of decreased CO
- Excess fluid volume related to excess fluid or sodium intake and retention of fluid because of HF and its medical therapy
- Anxiety related to breathlessness and restlessness from inadequate oxygenation
- Powerlessness related to inability to perform role responsibilities because of chronic illness and hospitalizations
- Noncompliance related to lack of knowledge

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Cardiogenic shock (see also Chap. 15)
- Dysrhythmias (see Chap. 27)
- Thromboembolism (see Chap. 31)
- Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade (see also Chap. 29)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Major goals for the patient may include promoting activity and reducing fatigue, relieving fluid overload symptoms, decreasing the incidence of anxiety or increasing the patient's ability to manage anxiety, teaching the patient about the self-care program, and encouraging the patient to verbalize his or her ability to make decisions and influence outcomes.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING ACTIVITY TOLERANCE}

Although prolonged bed rest and even short periods of recumbency promote diuresis by improving renal perfusion, they also promote
decreased activity tolerance. Prolonged bed rest, which may be selfimposed, should be avoided because of the deconditioning effects and hazards, such as pressure ulcers (especially in edematous patients), phlebothrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. An acute event that causes severe symptoms or that requires hospitalization indicates the need for initial bed rest. Otherwise, a total of 30 minutes of physical activity three to five times each week should be encouraged (Georgiou et al., 2001). The nurse and patient can collaborate to develop a schedule that promotes pacing and prioritization of activities. The schedule should alternate activities with periods of rest and avoid having two significant energy-consuming activities occur on the same day or in immediate succession.

Before undertaking physical activity, the patient should be given the following safety guidelines:
- Begin with a few minutes of warm-up activities.
- Avoid performing physical activities outside in extreme hot, cold, or humid weather.
- Ensure that you are able to talk during the physical activity; if you are unable to do so, decrease the intensity of activity.
- Wait 2 hours after eating a meal before performing the physical activity.
- Stop the activity if severe shortness of breath, pain, or dizziness develops.
- End with cool-down activities and a cool-down period.

Because some patients may be severely debilitated, they may need to perform physical activities only 3 to 5 minutes at a time, one to four times per day. The patient then should be advised to increase the duration of the activity, then the frequency, before increasing the intensity of the activity (Meyer, 2001).

Barriers to performing an activity are identified, and methods of adjusting an activity to ensure pacing but still accomplish the task are discussed. For example, objects that need to be taken upstairs can be put in a basket at the bottom of the stairs throughout the day. At the end of the day, the person can carry the objects up the stairs all at once. Likewise, the person can carry cleaning supplies around in a basket or backpack rather than walk back and forth to obtain the items. Vegetables can be chopped or peeled while sitting at the kitchen table rather than standing at the kitchen counter. Small, frequent meals decrease the amount of energy needed for digestion while providing adequate nutrition. The nurse helps the patient to identify peak and low periods of energy and plan energy-consuming activities for peak periods. For example, the person may prepare the meals for the entire day in the morning. Pacing and prioritizing activities help maintain the patient's energy to allow participation in regular physical activity (see Chap. 28).

The patient's response to activities needs to be monitored. If the patient is hospitalized, vital signs and oxygen saturation level are monitored before, during, and immediately after an activity to identify whether they are within the desired range. Heart rate should return to baseline within 3 minutes. If the patient is at home, the degree of fatigue felt after the activity can be used as assessment of the response. If the patient tolerates the activity, short-term and long-term goals can be developed to gradually increase the intensity, duration, and frequency of activity. Referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program may be needed, especially for HF patients with recent myocardial infarction, recent open-heart surgery, or increased anxiety. A supervised program may also benefit those who need the structured environment, significant educational support, regular encouragement, and interpersonal contact.

\section*{MANAGING FLUID VOLUME}

Patients with severe HF may receive intravenous diuretic therapy, but patients with less severe symptoms may receive oral diuretic medication (see Table 30-4 for a summary of common diuretics). Oral diuretics should be administered early in the morning so that diuresis does not interfere with the patient's nighttime rest. Discussing the timing of medication administration is especially important for patients, such as elderly people, who may have urinary urgency or incontinence. A single dose of a diuretic may cause the patient to excrete a large volume of fluid shortly after administration.

The nurse monitors the patient's fluid status closelyauscultating the lungs, monitoring daily body weights, and assisting the patient to adhere to a low-sodium diet by reading food labels and avoiding high-sodium foods such as canned, processed, and convenience foods (Chart 30-4). If the diet includes fluid restriction, the nurse can assist the patient to plan the fluid intake throughout the day while respecting the patient's dietary preferences. If the patient is receiving intravenous fluids, the

\section*{Cheurts $30-4$}

\section*{Facts About Dietary Sodium}

Although the major source of sodium in the average American diet is salt, many types of natural foods contain varying amounts of sodium. Even if no salt is added in cooking and if salty foods are avoided, the daily diet may still contain between 1000 and 2000 mg of sodium.

\section*{Additives in Food}

Added food substances (additives), such as sodium alginate, which improves food texture; sodium benzoate, which acts as a preservative; and disodium phosphate, which improves cooking quality in certain foods, increase the sodium intake when included in the daily diet. Therefore, patients on low-sodium diets should be advised to check labels carefully for such words as "salt" or "sodium," especially on canned foods. For example, without looking at the sodium content per serving found on the nutrition labels, when given a choice between a serving of salt and vinegar potato chips and a cup of canned cream of mushroom soup, most would think that soup is lower in sodium. However, when the labels are examined, the lower sodium choice is found to be the chips. Although potato chips are not recommended in a low sodium diet, this example illustrates that it is important to read food labels to determine both sodium content and serving size.

\section*{Nonfood Sodium Sources}

Sodium is also contained in toothpaste and municipal water. Patients on sodium-restricted diets should be cautioned against using nonprescription medications such as antacids, cough syrups, laxatives, sedatives, or salt substitutes, because these products contain sodium or excessive amounts of potassium. Over-the-counter medications should not be used without first consulting the physician.

\section*{Promoting Dietary Adherence}

If patients find food unpalatable because of the dietary sodium restrictions and/or the taste disturbances caused by the medications, they may refuse to eat or to comply with the dietary regimen. For this reason, severe sodium restrictions should be avoided and the amount of medication should be balanced with the patient's ability to restrict dietary sodium. A variety of flavorings, such as lemon juice, vinegar, and herbs, may be used to improve the taste of the food and increase acceptance of the diet. The patient's food preferences should be taken into account-diet counseling and educational handouts can be geared to individual and ethnic preferences. It is very important to involve the family in the dietary teaching.
amount of fluid needs to be monitored closely, and the physician or pharmacist can be consulted about the possibility of maximizing the amount of medication in the same amount of intravenous fluid (eg, double-concentrating to decrease the fluid volume administered).

The nurse positions the patient or teaches the patient how to assume a position that shifts fluid away from the heart. The number of pillows may be increased, the head of the bed may be elevated ( $20-$ to $30-\mathrm{cm}$ [ $8-$ to 10 -inch] blocks may be used), or the patient may sit in a comfortable armchair. In this position, the venous return to the heart (preload) is reduced, pulmonary congestion is alleviated, and impingement of the liver on the diaphragm is minimized. The lower arms are supported with pillows to eliminate the fatigue caused by the constant pull of their weight on the shoulder muscles.

The patient who can breathe only in the upright position may sit on the side of the bed with the feet supported on a chair, the head and arms resting on an overbed table, and the lumbosacral spine supported by a pillow. If pulmonary congestion is present, positioning the patient in an armchair is advantageous, because this position favors the shift of fluid away from the lungs.

Because decreased circulation in edematous areas increases the risk of skin injury, the nurse assesses for skin breakdown and institutes preventive measures. Frequent changes of position, positioning to avoid pressure, the use of elastic compression stockings, and leg exercises may help to prevent skin injury.

\section*{CONTROLLING ANXIETY}

Because patients in HF have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation, they are likely to be restless and anxious and feel overwhelmed by breathlessness. These symptoms tend to intensify at night. Emotional stress stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which causes vasoconstriction, elevated arterial pressure, and increased heart rate. This sympathetic response increases the amount of work that the heart has to do. By decreasing anxiety, the patient's cardiac work also is decreased. Oxygen may be administered during an acute event to diminish the work of breathing and to increase the patient's comfort.

When the patient exhibits anxiety, the nurse takes steps to promote physical comfort and psychological support. In many cases, a family member's presence provides reassurance. To help decrease the patient's anxiety, the nurse should speak in a slow, calm, and confident manner and maintain eye contact. When necessary, the nurse should also state specific, brief directions for an activity.

After the patient is comfortable, the nurse can begin teaching ways to control anxiety and to avoid anxiety-provoking situations. The nurse explains how to use relaxation techniques and assists the patient to identify factors that contribute to anxiety. Lack of sleep may increase anxiety, which may prevent adequate rest. Other contributing factors may include misinformation, lack of information, or poor nutritional status. Promoting physical comfort, providing accurate information, and teaching the patient to perform relaxation techniques and to avoid anxietytriggering situations may relax the patient.

> NURSING ALERT Cerebral hypoxia with superimposed carbon dioxide retention may be a problem in HF, causing the patient to react to sedative-hypnotic medications with confusion and increased anxiety. Hepatic congestion may slow the liver's metabolism of medication, leading to toxicity. Sedative-hypnotic medications must be administered with caution.

In cases of confusion and anxiety reactions that affect the patient's safety, the use of restraints should be avoided. Restraints are likely to be resisted, and resistance inevitably increases the cardiac workload. The patient who insists on getting out of bed at night can be seated comfortably in an armchair. As cerebral and systemic circulation improves, the degree of anxiety decreases, and the quality of sleep improves.

\section*{MINIMIZING POWERLESSNESS}

Patients need to recognize that they are not helpless and that they can influence the direction of their lives and the outcomes of treatment. The nurse assesses for factors contributing to a sense of powerlessness and intervenes accordingly. Contributing factors may include lack of knowledge and lack of opportunities to make decisions, particularly if health care providers and family members behave in maternalistic or paternalistic ways. If the patient is hospitalized, hospital policies may promote standardization and limit the patient's ability to make decisions (eg, what time to have meals, take medications, prepare for bed).

Taking time to listen actively to patients often encourages them to express their concerns and ask questions. Other strategies include providing the patient with decision-making opportunities, such as when activities are to occur or where objects are to be placed, and increasing the frequency and significance of those opportunities over time; providing encouragement while identifying the patient's progress; and assisting the patient to differentiate between factors that can be controlled and those that cannot. In some cases, the nurse may want to review hospital policies and standards that tend to promote powerlessness and advocate for their elimination or change (eg, limited visiting hours, prohibition of food from home, required wearing of hospital gowns).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse provides patient education and involves the patient in implementing the therapeutic regimen to promote understanding and adherence to the plan. When the patient understands or believes that the diagnosis of HF can be successfully managed with lifestyle changes and medications, recurrences of acute HF lessen, unnecessary hospitalizations decrease, and life expectancy increases. Patients and their families need to be taught to follow the medication regimen as prescribed, maintain a low-sodium diet, perform and record daily weights, engage in routine physical activity, and recognize symptoms that indicate worsening HF. Although noncompliance is not well understood, interventions that may promote adherence include teaching to ensure accurate understanding. A summary of teaching points for the patient with HF is presented in Chart 30-5.

The patient and family members are supported and encouraged to ask questions so that information can be clarified and understanding enhanced. The nurse should be aware of cultural factors and adapt the teaching plan accordingly. Patients and their families need to be informed that the progression of the disease is influenced in part by choices made about health care and the decisions about following the treatment plan. They also need to be informed that health care providers are there to assist them in reaching their health care goals. Patients and family members need to make the decisions about the treatment plan, but they also need to understand the possible outcomes of those decisions. The treatment plan then will be based on what the patient wants, not just what the physician or other health care team members think is needed. Ultimately, the nurse needs to convey that monitoring symptoms and daily weights, restricting sodium intake, avoiding

excess fluids, preventing infection with influenza and pneumococcal immunizations, avoiding noxious agents (eg, alcohol, tobacco), and participating in regular exercise all aid in preventing exacerbations of HF.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Depending on the patient's physical status and the availability of family assistance, a home care referral may be indicated for a patient who has been hospitalized. Elderly patients and those who have long-standing heart disease with compromised physical stamina often require assistance with the transition to home after hospitalization for an acute episode of HF . It is important for the home care nurse to assess the physical environment of the home. Suggestions for adapting the home environment to meet the patient's activity limitations are important. If stairs are the concern, the patient can plan the day's activities so that stair climbing is minimized; for some patients, a temporary bedroom may be set up on the main level of the home. The home care nurse collaborates with the patient and family to maximize the benefits of these changes.

The home care nurse also reinforces and clarifies information about dietary changes and fluid restrictions, the need to monitor symptoms and daily body weights, and the importance of obtaining follow-up health care. Assistance may be given in scheduling and keeping appointments as well. The patient is encouraged to gradually increase his or her self-care and responsibility for accomplishing the therapeutic regimen.

\section*{ACUTE HEART FAILURE (PULMONARY EDEMA)}

Pulmonary edema is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs. The fluid may accumulate in the interstitial spaces or in the alveoli.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Pulmonary edema is an acute event that results from HF . It can occur acutely, such as with myocardial infarction, or it can occur as an exacerbation of chronic HF. Myocardial scarring as a result of ischemia can limit the ventricular distensibility and render it vulnerable to a sudden increase in workload. With increased resistance to left ventricular filling, the blood backs up into the pulmonary circulation. The patient quickly develops pulmonary edema, sometimes called flash pulmonary edema, from the blood volume overload in the lungs. Pulmonary edema can also be caused by noncardiac disorders, such as renal failure, liver failure, and oncologic conditions that cause the body to retain fluid. The left ventricle cannot handle the resulting hypervolemia, preventing blood from easily flowing from the left atrium into the left ventricle. This causes the pressure to increase in the left atrium. The increase in atrial pressure may result in an increase in pulmonary venous pressure, which produces an increase in hydrostatic pressure that forces fluid out of the pulmonary capillaries into the interstitial spaces and alveoli.

Impaired lymphatic drainage also contributes to the accumulation of fluid in the lung tissues. The fluid within the alveoli mixes with air, creating "bubbles" that are expelled from the mouth and nose, producing the classic symptom of pulmonary edema, frothy pink (blood-tinged) sputum. Because of the fluid within the alveoli, air cannot enter, and gas exchange is impaired. The result is hypoxemia, which is often severe. The onset may be preceded by premonitory symptoms of pulmonary congestion, but it also may develop quickly in the patient with a ventricle that has little reserve to meet increased oxygen needs.

In pulmonary edema, as well as in HF, preload, contractility, and afterload may be altered, thereby impairing CO. Technological advances (eg, impedance cardiography) have made it easier to implement effective pharmacologic therapy in treating acute pulmonary edema.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

As a result of decreased cerebral oxygenation, the patient becomes increasingly restless and anxious. Along with a sudden onset of breathlessness and a sense of suffocation, the patient's hands become cold and moist, the nail beds become cyanotic (bluish), and the skin turns ashen (gray). The pulse is weak and rapid, and the neck veins are distended. Incessant coughing may occur, producing increasing quantities of mucoid sputum. As pulmonary edema progresses, the patient's anxiety and restlessness increase; the patient becomes confused, then stuporous. Breathing is rapid, noisy, and moist sounding. The patient's oxygen levels (saturation) are significantly decreased. The patient, nearly suffocated by the blood-tinged, frothy fluid filling the alveoli, is literally drowning in secretions. The situation demands immediate action.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis is made by evaluating the clinical manifestations resulting from pulmonary congestion. Most often, a chest x -ray is obtained to confirm that the pulmonary veins are engorged. Abrupt onset of signs and symptoms of left-sided HF(eg, crackles on auscultation of the lungs, flash pulmonary edema) without evidence of right-sided HF (eg, no JVD, no dependent edema) may indicate diastolic failure due to ischemia.

\section*{Prevention}

Like most complications, pulmonary edema is easier to prevent than to treat. To recognize it in its early stages, the nurse auscultates the lung fields and heart sounds, measures JVD, and assesses the degree of peripheral edema and the severity of breathlessness. A dry, hacking cough; fatigue; weight gain; development or worsening of edema; and decreased activity tolerance may be early indicators of developing pulmonary edema.

In an early stage, the condition may be corrected by placing the patient in an upright position with the feet and legs dependent, eliminating overexertion, and minimizing emotional stress to reduce the left ventricular load. A re-examination of the patient's treatment regimen and the patient's understanding of and adherence to it are also needed. The long-range approach to preventing pulmonary edema must be directed at identifying its precipitating factors.

\section*{Medical Management}

Clinical management of a patient with acute pulmonary edema due to HF is directed toward improving ventricular function and increasing respiratory exchange. These goals are accomplished through a combination of oxygen, medication therapies, and nursing support.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Various treatments and medications are prescribed for pulmonary edema, among them oxygen, morphine, diuretics, and various intravenous medications.

Oxygen Therapy. Oxygen is administered in concentrations adequate to relieve hypoxemia and dyspnea. Usually, a face mask or non-rebreathing mask is initially used. If respiratory failure is severe or persists despite optimal management, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is effective in reducing venous return, decreasing fluid movement from the pulmonary capillaries to the alveoli, and improving oxygenation. Oxygenation is monitored with pulse oximetry and by measurement of arterial blood gases.

Morphine. Morphine is administered intravenously in small doses (2 to 5 mg ) to reduce peripheral resistance and venous return so that blood can be redistributed from the pulmonary circulation to other parts of the body. This action decreases pressure in the pulmonary capillaries and decreases seepage of fluid into the lung tissue. The effect of morphine in decreasing anxiety is also beneficial.

Diuretics. Diuretics promote the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys. Furosemide (Lasix), for example, is administered intravenously to produce a rapid diuretic effect. Furosemide also causes vasodilation and pooling of blood in peripheral blood
vessels, which reduces the amount of blood returned to the heart, even before the diuretic effect. Some physicians may prescribe bumetanide (Bumex) and metolazone (Mykrox, Zaroxolyn) in place of furosemide.

Dobutamine. Dobutamine (Dobutrex) is an intravenous medication given to patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction. A catecholamine, dobutamine stimulates the beta ${ }_{1}$-adrenergic receptors. Its major action is to increase cardiac contractility. However, at higher amounts, it also increases the heart rate and the incidence of ectopic beats and tachydysrhythmias. Because it also increases AV conduction, care must be taken in patients who have underlying atrial fibrillation. A medication that protects the AV node, such as digitalis, a beta-blocker, or a calcium channel blocker, may be indicated before dobutamine therapy is initiated to prevent increased ventricular response rate.

Milrinone. Milrinone (Primacor) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that delays the release of calcium from intracellular reservoirs and prevents the uptake of extracellular calcium by the cells. This promotes vasodilation, decreasing preload and afterload, reducing the workload of the heart. Milrinone is administered intravenously, usually to patients who have not responded to other therapies. It is not usually used to treat patients with renal failure. The major side effects are hypotension (usually asymptomatic), gastrointestinal dysfunction, increased ventricular dysrhythmias, and decreased platelet counts. The patient's blood pressure is monitored closely.

Nesiritide. Nesiritide (Natrecor) is an intravenous medication that is indicated for acutely decompensated HF. Natriuretic peptides are produced by the myocardium as a compensatory response to increased ventricular end-diastolic pressure and myocardial wall stress and to the increased release of neurohormones (eg, norepinephrine, renin, aldosterone) that occur with HF. Nesiritide is a human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) made from Escherichia coli using recombinant technology. Human BNP binds to vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, causing dilation of arteries and veins and suppression of the neurohormones. The result is improved stroke volume and reduced preload and afterload (Colucci et al., 2000). This medication causes rapid improvement in the symptoms of HF and may be used with other HF medications (eg, beta-blockers, digoxin). The most common side effect is dose-related hypotension.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{POSITIONING THE PATIENT TO PROMOTE CIRCULATION}

Proper positioning can help reduce venous return to the heart. The patient is positioned upright, preferably with the legs dangling over the side of the bed. This has the immediate effect of decreasing venous return, lowering the output of the right ventricle, and decreasing lung congestion. If the patient is unable to sit with the lower extremities dependent, the patient may be placed in an upright position in bed.

\section*{PROVIDING PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT}

As the ability to breathe decreases, the patient's sense of fear and anxiety rises proportionately, making the condition more severe. Reassuring the patient and providing skillful anticipatory nursing care are integral parts of the therapy. Because this patient feels a sense of impending doom and has an unstable condition, the nurse must remain with the patient. The nurse should give the pa-
tient simple, concise information in a reassuring voice about what is being done to treat the condition and the expected results. The nurse should also identify any anxiety-inducing factors (eg, a pet left alone at home, presence of an unwelcome family member at the bedside, a wallet full of money) and initiate strategies to eliminate the concern or reduce its effect.

\section*{MONITORING MEDICATIONS}

The patient receiving morphine is observed for respiratory depression, hypotension, and vomiting; a morphine antagonist, such as naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan), is kept available and given to the patient who exhibits these side effects.

The patient receiving diuretic therapy may excrete a large volume of urine within minutes after a potent diuretic is administered. A bedside commode may be used to decrease the energy required by the patient and to reduce the resultant increase in cardiac workload induced by getting on and off a bedpan. If necessary, an indwelling urinary catheter may be inserted.

NURSING ALERT Because of the resulting diuresis, the patient's electrolyte levels, especially potassium and sodium, need to be monitored closely. Fluid balance in some patients is very brittle; they easily become hypovolemic or hypervolemic with small changes in the amount of circulating fluid. Falling blood pressure, increasing heart rate, and decreasing urine output indicate that the circulatory system is not tolerating diuresis and that measures must be taken to reverse the fluid imbalance that has occurred. Serum creatinine is monitored to assess renal function. Men with prostatic hyperplasia must be observed for signs of urinary retention. Additional monitoring activities are discussed in Chart 30-6.

\section*{Other Complications}

\section*{CARDIOGENIC SHOCK}

Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to supply the amount of oxygen needed by the tissues. This may occur because of one significant or multiple smaller infarctions in which more than $40 \%$ of the myocardium becomes necrotic, because of a ruptured ventricle, significant valvular dysfunction, trauma to the heart resulting in myocardial contusion, or as the end stage of HF. It also can occur with cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and dysrhythmias.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock reflect the circular nature of the pathophysiology of HF. The degree of shock is proportional to the extent of left ventricular dysfunction. The heart muscle loses its contractile power, resulting in a marked reduction in SV and CO, which is sometimes called forward failure. The damage to the myocardium results in a decrease in CO, which reduces arterial blood pressure and tissue perfusion in the vital organs (heart, brain, lung, kidneys). Flow to the coronary arteries is reduced, resulting in decreased oxygen supply to the myocardium, which increases ischemia and further reduces the heart's ability to pump. The inadequate emptying of the ventricle also leads to increased pulmonary pressures, pulmonary congestion, and pulmonary edema, exacerbating the hypoxia, causing ischemia of vital organs, and setting a vicious cycle in motion (Fig. 30-3).

\caption{FIGURE 30-3 Pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The classic signs of cardiogenic shock are tissue hypoperfusion manifested as cerebral hypoxia (restlessness, confusion, agitation), low blood pressure, rapid and weak pulse, cold and clammy skin, increased respiratory crackles, hypoactive bowel sounds, and decreased urinary output. Initially, arterial blood gas analysis may show respiratory alkalosis. Dysrhythmias are common and result from a decrease in oxygen to the myocardium.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Use of a PA catheter to measure left ventricular pressures and CO is important in assessing the severity of the problem and planning management. The PA wedge pressure is elevated and the CO decreased as the left ventricle loses its ability to pump. The systemic vascular resistance is elevated because of the sympathetic nervous system stimulation that occurs as a compensatory response to the decrease in blood pressure. The decreased blood flow to the kidneys causes a hormonal response (ie, increased catecholamines and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) that causes fluid retention and further vasoconstriction. Increases in HR, circulating volume, and vasoconstriction occur to maintain circulation to the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs, but at a cost: an increase in the workload of the heart.

The reduction in blood volume delivered to the tissues results in an increase in the amount of oxygen that is extracted from the blood that is delivered to the tissues (to try to meet the cellular demand for oxygen). The increased systemic oxygen extraction results in decreased venous (mixed and central) oxygen saturation. When the cellular oxygen needs cannot be met by the systemic oxygen delivery and the oxygen extraction, anaerobic metabolism and the resulting build up of lactic acid occur. Continuous central venous oximetry and measurement of blood lactic acid levels may assist in assessing the severity of the shock as well as the effectiveness of treatment.

Continued cellular hypoperfusion eventually results in organ failure. The patient becomes unresponsive, severe hypotension ensues, and the patient develops shallow respirations; cold, cyanotic or mottled skin; and absent bowel sounds. Arterial blood gas analysis shows metabolic acidosis, and all laboratory test results indicate organ dysfunction. Chapter 15 presents in more detail the pathophysiology and management of cardiogenic shock.

\section*{Medical Management}

The major approach to treating cardiogenic shock is to correct the underlying problems, reduce any further demand on the heart, improve oxygenation, and restore tissue perfusion. For example, if the ventricular failure is the result of an acute myocardial infarction, emergency percutaneous coronary intervention may be indicated (Webb et al., 2001). Ventricular assist devices may be implanted to support the pumping action of the heart (Barron et al., 2001) (see Chap. 29). Major dysrhythmias are corrected because they may have caused or contributed to the shock. If the patient has hypervolemia, diuresis is indicated. Diuretics, vasodilators, and mechanical devices, such as filtration (continuous renal replacement therapy [CRRT]) and dialysis, have been used to reduce the circulating blood volume. If hypovolemia or low intravascular volume is suspected or detected through pressure readings, the patient is given intravenous volume expanders (eg, normal saline solution, lactated Ringer's solution, albumin) to increase the amount of circulating fluid. The patient is placed on strict bedrest to conserve
energy. If the patient has hypoxemia, as detected by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis, oxygen administration is increased, often under positive pressure when regular flow is insufficient to meet tissue demands. Intubation and sedation may be necessary to maintain oxygenation. The settings for mechanical ventilation are adjusted according to the patient's oxygenation status and the need for conserving energy.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Medication therapy is selected and guided according to CO , other cardiac parameters, and mean arterial blood pressure. Because of the decreased perfusion to the gastrointestinal system and the need to adjust the dosage quickly, most medications are administered intravenously.

Vasopressors, or pressor agents, are medications used to raise blood pressure and increase CO. Many pressor medications are catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (Levophed) and highdose ( $>10 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per minute) dopamine (Intropin). Their purpose is to promote perfusion to the heart and brain, but they compromise circulation to other organs (eg, kidney). Because they also tend to increase the workload of the heart by increasing oxygen demand, they are not administered early in the cardiogenic shock process.

Diuretics and vasodilators may be administered carefully to reduce the workload of the heart as long as they do not cause worsening of the tissue hypoperfusion. Agents such as amrinone (Inocor), milrinone (Primacor), sodium nitroprusside (Nipride), and nitroglycerin (Tridil) are effective vasoactive medications that lower the volume returning to the heart, decrease blood pressure, and decrease cardiac work. They cause the arteries and veins to dilate, thereby shunting much of the intravascular volume to the periphery and causing a reduction in preload and afterload.

Positive inotropic medications are given to increase myocardial contractility. Dopamine (Intropin, given at more than $2 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per minute), dobutamine (Dobutrex), and epinephrine (Adrenalin) are catecholamines that increase contractility. Each of these can cause tachydysrhythmias because they increase automaticity with increasing dosage. Monitoring baseline HR is therefore important. As the baseline HR increases, so does the risk of developing tachydysrhythmias.

\section*{OTHER TREATMENTS}

Other therapeutic modalities for cardiogenic shock include use of circulatory assist devices. The most frequently used mechanical support device is the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The IABP is a catheter with an inflatable balloon at the end. The catheter is usually inserted through the femoral artery, and the balloon is positioned in the descending thoracic aorta (Fig. 30-4). IABP uses internal counterpulsation through the regular inflation and deflation of the balloon to augment the pumping action of the heart. The device inflates during diastole, increasing the pressure in the aorta during diastole and therefore increasing blood flow through the coronary and peripheral arteries. It deflates just before systole, lessening the pressure within the aorta before left ventricular contraction, decreasing the amount of resistance the heart has to overcome to eject blood and therefore decreasing the amount of work the heart must put forth to eject blood. The device is connected to a console that synchronizes the inflation and deflation of the balloon with the ECG or the arterial pressure (as indicators for systole and diastole). Hemodynamic monitoring is essential to determine the patient's response to the IABP. Other ventricular assist devices are described in Chapter 29.

\end{figure}

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient in cardiogenic shock requires constant monitoring and intensive care. The critical care (intensive care) nurse must carefully assess the patient, observe the cardiac rhythm, monitor hemodynamic parameters, and record fluid intake and urinary output. The patient must be closely assessed for responses to the medical interventions and for the development of complications, which must be corrected immediately.

Because of the frequency of nursing interventions and the technology required for effective medical management, the patient is always treated in an intensive care environment. Critical care nurses are responsible for the nursing management, which includes frequent assessments and timely adjustments to medications and therapies based on the assessment data. More information about nursing management of the patient in cardiogenic shock can be found in Chapter 15.

\section*{THROMBOEMBOLISM}

The decreased mobility of the patient with cardiac disease and the impaired circulation that accompany these disorders contribute to the development of intracardiac and intravascular thrombosis. Intracardiac thrombus is especially common in patients with atrial fibrillation, because the atria do not contract forcefully
and blood flow slows through the atrium, increasing thrombus formation. Intracardiac thrombus is detected by an echocardiogram and treated with anticoagulants, such as heparin and warfarin (Coumadin). A part of the thrombus may become detached (embolus) and may be carried to the brain, kidneys, intestines, or lungs. The most common problem is pulmonary embolism. The symptoms of pulmonary embolism include chest pain, cyanosis, shortness of breath, rapid respirations, and hemoptysis (bloody sputum).

The pulmonary embolus may block the circulation to a part of the lung, producing an area of pulmonary infarction. Usually, there is a significant decrease in oxygenation measured by arterial blood gas analysis or pulse oximetry. Pain experienced is usually pleuritic; it increases with respiration and may subside when the patient holds the breath. Cardiac pain is usually continuous and does not vary with respirations. However, it may be difficult to differentiate by symptoms alone. The patient usually undergoes a ventilationperfusion scan or a pulmonary arteriogram for definitive diagnosis. The treatment and care for patients with pulmonary embolism are discussed in Chapter 23.

Systemic embolism may manifest as cerebral, mesenteric, or renal infarction; an embolism can also compromise the blood supply to an extremity, which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 31. The nurse must be aware of such possible complications and be prepared to identify and report signs and symptoms.

\section*{PERICARDIAL EFFUSION AND CARDIAC TAMPONADE}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Pericardial effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. This occurrence may accompany pericarditis (see Chap. 29), advanced HF, metastatic carcinoma, cardiac surgery, trauma, or nontraumatic hemorrhage.

Normally, the pericardial sac contains less than 50 mL of fluid, which is needed to decrease friction for the beating heart. An increase in pericardial fluid raises the pressure within the pericardial sac and compresses the heart. This has the following effects:
- Increased right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures
- Decreased venous return
- Inability of the ventricles to distend adequately and to fill

Pericardial fluid may accumulate slowly without causing noticeable symptoms. A rapidly developing effusion, however, can stretch the pericardium to its maximum size and, because of increased pericardial pressure, reduce venous return to the heart and decrease CO. The result is cardiac tamponade (compression of the heart).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient may complain of a feeling of fullness within the chest or may have substantial or ill-defined pain. The feeling of pressure in the chest may result from stretching of the pericardial sac. Because of increased pressure within the pericardium, venous pressure tends to rise, as evidenced by engorged neck veins. Other signs include shortness of breath and a drop and fluctuation in blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure that is detected during exhalation but not heard with inhalation is called pulsus paradoxus. The difference in systolic pressure between the point that it is heard during exhalation and the point that it is heard during inhalation is measured. Pulsus paradoxus exceeding 10 mm Hg
is abnormal. The cardinal signs of cardiac tamponade are falling systolic blood pressure, narrowing pulse pressure, rising venous pressure (increased jugular venous distention), and distant (muffled) heart sounds (Chart 30-7).

\section*{NURSING ALERT Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening}
situation, demanding immediate intervention.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Pericardial effusion is detected by percussing the chest and noticing an extension of flatness across the anterior aspect of the chest. An echocardiogram may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The clinical signs and symptoms and chest x-ray findings are usually sufficient to diagnose pericardial effusion.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{PERICARDIOCENTESIS}

If cardiac function becomes seriously impaired, pericardiocentesis (puncture of the pericardial sac to aspirate pericardial fluid) is performed to remove fluid from the pericardial sac. The major

\section*{Chart 30-7 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Signs and Symptoms of Cardiac Tamponade}

Assessment findings in cardiac tamponade resulting from pericardial effusion include feelings of faintness, shortness of breath, anxiety, and pain from decreased cardiac output, cough from pressure created in the trachea from swelling of the pericardial sac, distended neck veins from rising venous pressure, paradoxical pulse, and muffled or distant heart sounds.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-325.jpg?height=931&width=792&top_left_y=1626&top_left_x=1148)
goal is to prevent cardiac tamponade, which restricts normal heart action.

During the procedure, the patient is monitored by ECG and hemodynamic pressure measurements. Emergency resuscitative equipment should be readily available. The head of the bed is elevated to 45 to 60 degrees, placing the heart in proximity to the chest wall so that the needle can be inserted into the pericardial sac more easily. If a peripheral intravenous device is not already in place, one is inserted, and a slow intravenous infusion is started in case it becomes necessary to administer emergency medications or blood products.

The pericardial aspiration needle is attached to a $50-\mathrm{mL}$ syringe by a three-way stopcock. Several possible sites are used for pericardial aspiration. The needle may be inserted in the angle between the left costal margin and the xiphoid, near the cardiac apex; at the fifth or sixth intercostal space at the left sternal margin; or on the right sternal margin of the fourth intercostal space. The needle is advanced slowly until it has entered the epicardium and fluid is obtained. The ECG can help determine when the needle has contacted the epicardium. The cable of a precordial lead is attached to the aspirating needle with alligator clamps; contact with the epicardium is seen by ST segment elevation on the ECG. During the procedure, drainage fluid must be checked for clotting. Although not entirely accurate, the guideline is that pericardial blood does not clot readily, whereas blood obtained from inadvertent puncture of one of the heart chambers does clot.

A resulting fall in central venous pressure and an associated rise in blood pressure after withdrawal of pericardial fluid indicate that the cardiac tamponade has been relieved. The patient almost always feels immediate relief. If there is a substantial amount of pericardial fluid, a small catheter may be left in place to drain recurrent accumulation of blood or fluid. Pericardial fluid is sent to the laboratory for examination for tumor cells, bacterial culture, chemical and serologic analysis, and differential blood cell count.

Complications of pericardiocentesis include ventricular or coronary artery puncture, dysrhythmias, pleural laceration, gastric puncture, and myocardial trauma. After pericardiocentesis, the patient's heart rhythm, blood pressure, venous pressure, and heart sounds are monitored to detect any possible recurrence of cardiac tamponade. If it recurs, repeated aspiration is necessary. Cardiac tamponade may require treatment by open pericardial drainage (pericardiotomy). The patient is ideally in an intensive care unit.

\section*{PERICARDIOTOMY}

Recurrent pericardial effusions, usually associated with neoplastic diseases, may be treated by a pericardiotomy (pericardial window). The patient receives a general anesthetic, but cardiopulmonary bypass is seldom necessary. A portion of the pericardium is excised to permit the pericardial fluid to drain into the lymphatic system. Uncommonly, catheters are placed between the pericardium and abdominal cavity to drain the pericardial fluid. The nursing care is the same as that described for other cardiac surgery (see Chap. 28).

\section*{MYOCARDIAL RUPTURE}

Myocardial rupture is a rare event. However, it can occur when a myocardial infarction, infectious process, cardiac trauma, pericardial disease, or other myocardial dysfunction weakens the cardiac muscle (eg, ventricular aneurysm) substantially. Persistent elevation of the ST segment is an indication of ventricular aneurysm. In
many cases, the result of myocardial rupture is immediate death, even if the patient undergoes immediate cardiac surgery.

\section*{CARDIAC ARREST}

Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to produce an effective pulse and blood circulation. It may be caused by a cardiac electrical event, as when the HR is too fast (especially ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or too slow (bradycardia or AV block) or when there is no heart rate at all (asystole). Cardiac arrest may follow respiratory arrest; it may also occur when electrical activity is present but there is ineffective cardiac contraction or circulating volume, which is called pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Formerly called electrical-mechanical dissociation (EMD), PEA can be caused by hypovolemia (eg, with excessive bleeding), cardiac tamponade, hypothermia, massive pulmonary embolism, medication overdoses (eg, tricyclic agents, digitalis, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers), significant acidosis, and massive acute myocardial infarction.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Consciousness, pulse, and blood pressure are lost immediately. Ineffective respiratory gasping may occur. The pupils of the eyes begin dilating within 45 seconds. Seizures may or may not occur.

The risk of irreversible brain damage and death increases with every minute from the time that circulation ceases. The interval varies with the age and underlying condition of the patient. During this period, the diagnosis of cardiac arrest must be made, and measures must be taken immediately to restore circulation.

NURSING ALERT The most reliable sign of cardiac arrest is the absence of a pulse. In the adult and the child, the carotid pulse is assessed. In an infant, the brachial pulse is assessed. Valuable time should not be wasted taking the blood pressure, listening for the heartbeat, or checking proper contact of electrodes.

\section*{Emergency Management: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation}

The ABCDs of basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are airway, breathing, circulation, and defibrillation (Guidelines 2000 for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care, 2000). Once loss of consciousness has been established, the resuscitation priority for the adult in most cases is placing a phone call to activate the code team or the emergency medical system (EMS). Exceptions to this include near drowning, drug or medication overdose, and respiratory arrest situations, for which 1 minute of CPR should be performed before activating the EMS. Because the underlying cause of arrest in an infant or child is usually respiratory, the priority is to begin CPR and then activate the EMS after 1 minute of CPR. Because the care of the pediatric patient is individualized, the following discussion on the care of a cardiac arrest patient applies only to adults.

Resuscitation consists of the following steps:
1. Airway: maintaining an open airway
2. Breathing: providing artificial ventilation by rescue breathing
3. Circulation: promoting artificial circulation by external cardiac compression
4. Defibrillation: restoring the heartbeat (see Chap. 27)

If the patient is monitored or is immediately placed on the monitor using the multifunction pads or the quick-look paddles (found on most defibrillators) and the ECG shows ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, defibrillation rather than CPR is the treatment of choice. In this scenario, CPR is performed initially only if the defibrillator is not immediately available. The survival rate decreases by $10 \%$ for every minute that defibrillation is delayed (Guidelines, 2000). If the patient has not been defibrillated within 10 minutes, the chance of survival is close to zero. More information on defibrillation can be found in Chapter 27.

\section*{MAINTAINING AIRWAY AND BREATHING}

The first step in CPR is to obtain an open airway. Any obvious material in the mouth or throat should be removed. The chin is directed up and back, or the jaw (mandible) is lifted forward. The rescuer "looks, listens, and feels" for air movement. An oropharyngeal airway is inserted if available. Two rescue ventilations over 3 to 4 seconds are provided using a bag-mask or mouthmask device (Fig. 30-5). An obstructed airway should be suspected when the rescuer cannot give the initial ventilations, and the Heimlich maneuver or abdominal thrusts should be administered to relieve the obstruction.

If the first rescue ventilations enter easily, the patient is ventilated with 12 breaths per minute, and the open airway is maintained. Endotracheal intubation is frequently performed by a physician, nurse anesthetist, or respiratory therapist during a resuscitation procedure (also called a code) to ensure an adequate airway and ventilation. The resuscitation bag device is then connected directly to the endotracheal tube.

Because of the risk of unrecognized esophageal intubation or dislodgement of the endotracheal tube (ET), tracheal intubation must be confirmed by one technique from each of two different methods: a primary method (visualization of the ET through the vocal cords, auscultation of breath sounds in five areas on the chest, or bilateral chest expansion) and a secondary method (an esophageal detector device [such as Ambu TubeChek] or an end-tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ detector). The end-tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ detectors available give qualitative (yes/no) or quantitative (measurable; ie, capnometry) results. Because delivery of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is low in patients in cardiopulmonary arrest, the qualitative devices are not as accurate in detecting incorrect placement as are esophageal detector devices (EDDs). There are two main types of EDD: a bulb type and a syringe type.

\end{figure}

The bulb is collapsed or the plunger of the syringe compressed before its attachment to the ET; each creates a suction force at the end of the ET. If the ET is in the trachea, the presence of air in the lungs and the rigid walls of the trachea allow re-inflation of the bulb or aspiration of the syringe. If the ET is in the esophagus, the suction pulls on the unsupported walls of the esophagus, causing them to collapse and preventing the bulb from reinflating or the syringe to aspirate. A chest x-ray, which is frequently obtained after ET placement, is helpful in determining whether the ET is too high, too low, or in a main bronchus. However, a chest x-ray cannot confirm placement of an ET. The ET may be in the esophagus or the trachea and result in the same appearance on the x-ray (Guidelines, 2000). Arterial blood gas levels are measured to guide oxygen therapy.

\section*{RESTORING CIRCULATION}

After performing ventilation, the carotid pulse is assessed and external cardiac compressions are provided when no pulse is detected. If a defibrillator is not yet available but a process has been put into place to obtain one, chest compressions are initiated. Compressions are performed with the patient on a firm surface, such as the floor, a cardiac board, or a meal tray. The rescuer (facing the patient's side) places the heel of one hand on the lower half of the sternum, two fingerwidths ( 3.8 cm [ 1.5 inches]) from the tip of the xiphoid and positions the other hand on top of the first hand (Fig. 30-6) (Guidelines, 2000). The fingers should not touch the chest wall.

Using the body weight while keeping the elbows straight, the rescuer presses quickly downward from the shoulder area to deliver a forceful compression to the victim's lower sternum about 3.8 to 5 cm (1.5 to 2 inches) toward the spine (Guidelines, 2000 ). The chest compression rate is 80 to 100 times per minute. If only one rescuer is available, the rate is two ventilations to every 15 cardiac compressions. When two rescuers are available, the first person performs the cardiac compressions, pausing after the fifth compression, when the second rescuer gives one ventilation over 1.5 to 2 seconds and at a tidal volume of less than 1 L .

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline AGENT AND ACTION & INDICATIONS & NURSING CONSIDERATIONS \\
\hline Oxygen-improves tissue oxygenation and corrects hypoxemia & Administered to all patients with acute cardiac ischemia or suspected hypoxemia, including those with COPD & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Use $100 \% \mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ during resuscitation. \\
- Recognize that no lung damage occurs when used for less than 24 hours. \\
- Monitor dose by end-tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or pulse oximeter.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Epinephrine (Adrenalin)-increases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure; improves coronary and cerebral perfusion and myocardial contractility & Given to patients in cardiac arrest, especially caused by asystole or pulseless electrical activity; may be given if caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Administer by IV push (IVP) or through the endotracheal (ET) tube. \\
- Avoid adding to IV lines that contain alkaline solution (eg, bicarbonate).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Atropine-blocks parasympathetic action; increases SA node automaticity and AV conduction & Given to patients with symptomatic bradycardia (hemodynamically unstable, frequent premature ventricular contractions and symptoms of ischemia) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Give rapidly as 2.0 to 2.5 mg IVP or through the ET tube. \\
- Be aware that less than 0.5 mg in the adult can cause the heart rate to decrease to a worse bradycardia. \\
- Monitor patient for reflexive tachycardia.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Sodium bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\right)$ - corrects metabolic acidosis & Given to correct metabolic acidosis that is refractory to standard advanced cardiac life support interventions (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, and respiratory management) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Administer initial dose of $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV; then administer the dose based on the base deficit calculated from arterial blood gas values. \\
- Recognize that to prevent development of rebound metabolic alkalosis, complete correction of acidosis is not indicated
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Magnesium-promotes adequate functioning of the cellular sodium-potassium pump & Given to patients with torsades de pointes & \begin{tabular}{l}
- May give diluted over 1-2 min or intravenous push. \\
- Monitor for hypotension, asystole, bradycardia, respiratory paralysis.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Vasopressin (Pitressin)-increases inotropic action (contraction) of the heart & An alternative to epinephrine when cardiac arrest is caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation & - Give 40 U IV one time only. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

When the code team or emergency medical personnel arrive, the patient is quickly assessed to determine cardiac rhythm and respiratory status, as well as possible causes for the arrest. The specific subsequent advanced life support interventions depend on the assessment results. For example, after the patient is placed on a cardiac monitor and ventricular fibrillation is detected, the patient will be defibrillated up to three times, and then CPR will be resumed. However, if asystole is detected on the monitor, CPR is resumed immediately while trying to identify the underlying cause, such as hypovolemia, hypothermia, or hypoxia. CPR may be stopped when the patient responds and begins to breathe, the rescuers are too exhausted or at risk (eg, the building is at risk of collapsing) to continue CPR, or signs of death are obvious. If the patient does not respond to therapies given during the arrest, the resuscitation effort may be stopped or "called" by the physician. The decision to terminate resuscitation is based on medical considerations and takes into account the underlying condition of the patient and the chances for survival.

\section*{FOLLOW-UP MONITORING}

Once successfully resuscitated, the patient is transferred to an intensive care unit for close monitoring. Continuous ECG monitoring and frequent blood pressure assessments are essential until hemodynamic stability is reestablished. Etiologic factors that precipitated the arrest, such as metabolic or rhythm abnormalities, must be identified and treated. Possible contributing factors, such as electrolyte or acid-base imbalances, need to be identified and corrected. Selected medications, as described in Table 30-5, may be used during and after resuscitation.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your patient is a 55-year-old man who was diagnosed last year with systolic HF (due to coronary artery disease) and was stabilized with lisinopril, Lasix, and metoprolol. He follows a low-sodium diet, with only an occasional indiscretion. He is complaining of a nagging cough. What are some of the possible causes for the cough? What would be key assessment factors that would help identify the cause? What medical treatments and nursing interventions would be appropriate for each of the possible causes?
2. A 77-year-old female patient was readmitted for HF for the third time in 2 months. Identify the factors that possibly contribute to her readmission and that would need to be assessed. What interventions could be implemented to prevent another readmission? Describe the interaction (ie, behaviors, words, and communication techniques) that would demonstrate the concept of partnering with the patient.

\section*{Assessment and Management of Patients With Vascular Disorders and Problems of Peripheral Circulation}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Identify anatomic and physiologic factors that affect peripheral blood flow and tissue oxygenation.
2. Use appropriate parameters for assessment of peripheral circulation.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework of care for patients with circulatory insufficiency of the extremities.
4. Compare the various diseases of the arteries, their causes, pathologic and physiologic changes, clinical manifestations, management, and prevention.
5. Describe the prevention and management of venous thrombosis.
6. Compare the preventive management of venous insufficiency, leg ulcers, and varicose veins.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework of care for patients with leg ulcers.
8. Describe the relationship between lymphangitis and lymphedema.

Adequate perfusion oxygenates and nourishes body tissues and depends in part on a properly functioning cardiovascular system. Adequate blood flow depends on the efficient pumping action of the heart, patent and responsive blood vessels, and adequate circulating blood volume. Nervous system activity, blood viscosity, and the metabolic needs of tissues influence the rate and adequacy of blood flow.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The vascular system consists of two interdependent systems. The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs to the pulmonary circulation, and the left side of the heart pumps blood to all other body tissues through the systemic circulation. The blood vessels in both systems channel the blood from the heart to the tissues and back to the heart (Fig. 31-1). Contraction of the ventricles is the driving force that moves blood through the vascular systems.

Arteries distribute oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to the tissues, whereas the veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues to the right side of the heart. Capillary vessels, located within the tissues, connect the arterial and venous systems and are the site of exchange of nutrients and metabolic wastes between the circulatory system and the tissues. Arterioles and venules immediately adjacent to the capillaries, together with the capillaries, make up the microcirculation.

The lymphatic system complements the function of the circulatory system. Lymphatic vessels transport lymph (a fluid similar to plasma), and tissue fluids (containing smaller proteins, cells, and cellular debris) from the interstitial space to systemic veins.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM}

\section*{Arteries and Arterioles}

Arteries are thick-walled structures that carry blood from the heart to the tissues. The aorta, which has a diameter of approximately 25 mm ( 1 inch), gives rise to numerous branches, which divide into smaller arteries that are about 4 mm ( 0.16 inch) in diameter by the time they reach the tissues. Within the tissues,

Oxygen-rich blood from the pulmonary circulation is pumped from the left heart into the aorta and the systemic arteries to the capillaries, where the exchange of nutrients and waste products takes place.

anastomosis: surgical junction of two vessels
aneurysm: a localized sac or dilation of an artery formed at a weak point in the vessel wall
ankle-brachial index (ABI) or ankle-arm index (AAI): ratio of the ankle systolic pressure to the arm systolic pressure; an objective measurement of arterial disease that provides quantification of the degree of stenosis
angioplasty: an invasive procedure that uses a balloon-tipped catheter to dilate a stenotic area of a blood vessel
arteriosclerosis: diffuse process whereby the muscle fibers and the endothelial lining of the walls of small arteries and arterioles thicken
atherosclerosis: disease process involving the accumulation of lipids, calcium, blood components, carbohydrates, and fibrous tissue on the intimal layer of a large or medium-sized artery
bruit: sound produced by turbulent blood flow through an irregular, tortuous, stenotic, or dilated vessel
dissection: separation of the weakened elastic and fibromuscular elements in the medial layer of an artery
duplex ultrasonography: combines B-mode gray-scale imaging of tissue, organs, and blood vessels with capabilities of estimating velocity changes by use of a pulsed Doppler
intermittent claudication: a muscular, cramp-like pain in the extremities con-
sistently reproduced with the same degree of exercise or activity and relieved by rest international normalized ratio (INR): method of measuring anticoagulation levels, such as warfarin (Coumadin); devised to bring a universal standard to monitoring of anticoagulation achieved by oral medications
ischemia: deficient blood supply
rest pain: persistent pain in the foot or digits when the patient is resting, indicating a severe degree of arterial insufficiency rubor: reddish blue discoloration of the extremities; indicative of severe peripheral arterial damage in vessels that remain dilated and unable to constrict
stenosis: narrowing or constriction of a vessel
the vessels divide further, diminishing to approximately $30 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter; these vessels are called arterioles.

The walls of the arteries and arterioles are composed of three layers: the intima, an inner endothelial cell layer; the media, a middle layer of smooth elastic tissue; and the adventitia, an outer layer of connective tissue. The intima, a very thin layer, provides a smooth surface for contact with the flowing blood. The media makes up most of the vessel wall in the aorta and other large arteries of the body. This layer is composed chiefly of elastic and connective tissue fibers that give the vessels considerable strength and allow them to constrict and dilate to accommodate the blood ejected from the heart (stroke volume) and maintain an even, steady flow of blood. The adventitia is a layer of connective tissue that anchors the vessel to its surroundings. There is much less elastic tissue in the smaller arteries and arterioles, and the media in these vessels is composed primarily of smooth muscle.

Smooth muscle controls the diameter of the vessels by contracting and relaxing. Chemical, hormonal, and nervous system factors influence the activity of smooth muscle. Because arterioles can alter their diameter, thereby offering resistance to blood flow, they are often referred to as resistance vessels. Arterioles regulate the volume and pressure in the arterial system and the rate of blood flow to the capillaries. Because of the large amount of muscle, the walls of the arteries are relatively thick, accounting for approximately $25 \%$ of the total diameter of the artery. The walls of the arterioles account for approximately $67 \%$ of the total diameter of arterioles.

The intima and the inner third of the smooth muscle layer are in such close contact with the blood that the blood vessel receives its nourishment by direct diffusion. The adventitia and the outer media layers have a limited vascular system for nourishment and require their own blood supply to meet metabolic needs.

Capillary walls, which lack smooth muscle and adventitia, are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells. This thin-walled structure permits rapid and efficient transport of nutrients to the cells and removal of metabolic wastes. The diameter of capillaries ranges from 5 to $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$; this narrow channel requires red blood cells to alter their shape to pass through these vessels. Changes in a capillary's diameter are passive and are influenced by contractile changes in the blood vessels that carry blood to and from a capillary. The capillary's diameter also changes in response to chemical stimuli. In some tissues, a cuff of smooth muscle, called the precapillary sphincter, is located at the arteriolar end of the capillary and is responsible, along with the arteriole, for controlling capillary blood flow.

Some capillary beds, such as in the fingertips, contain arteriovenous anastomoses, through which blood passes directly from the arterial to the venous system. These vessels are believed to regulate heat exchange between the body and the external environment.

The distribution of capillaries varies with the type of tissue. For example, skeletal tissue, which is metabolically active, has a denser capillary network than does cartilage, which is less active.

\section*{Veins and Venules}

Capillaries join to form larger vessels called venules, which join to form veins. The venous system is therefore structurally analogous to the arterial system; venules correspond to arterioles, veins to arteries, and the vena cava to the aorta. Analogous types of ves-
sels in the arterial and venous systems have approximately the same diameters (see Fig. 31-1).

The walls of the veins, in contrast to those of the arteries, are thinner and considerably less muscular. The wall of the average vein amounts to only $10 \%$ of the vein diameter, in contrast to $25 \%$ in the artery. The walls of a vein, like those of arteries, are composed of three layers, although these layers are not as well defined.

The thin, less muscular structure of the vein wall allows these vessels to distend more than arteries. Greater distensibility and compliance permit large volumes of blood to be stored in the veins under low pressure. For this reason, veins are referred to as capacitance vessels. Approximately $75 \%$ of total blood volume is contained in the veins. The sympathetic nervous system, which innervates the vein musculature, can stimulate the veins to constrict (venoconstriction), thereby reducing venous volume and increasing the volume of blood in the general circulation. Contraction of skeletal muscles in the extremities creates the primary pumping action to facilitate venous blood flow back to the heart.

Some veins, unlike arteries, are equipped with valves. In general, veins that transport blood against the force of gravity, as in the lower extremities, have one-way bicuspid valves that interrupt the column of blood to prevent blood from seeping backward as it is propelled toward the heart. Valves are composed of endothelial leaflets, the competency of which depends on the integrity of the vein wall.

\section*{Lymphatic Vessels}

The lymphatic vessels are a complex network of thin-walled vessels similar to the blood capillaries. This network collects lymphatic fluid from tissues and organs and transports the fluid to the venous circulation. The lymphatic vessels converge into two main structures: the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct. These ducts empty into the junction of the subclavian and the internal jugular veins. The right lymphatic duct conveys lymph primarily from the right side of the head, neck, thorax, and upper arms. The thoracic duct conveys lymph from the remainder of the body. Peripheral lymphatic vessels join larger lymph vessels and pass through regional lymph nodes before entering the venous circulation. The lymph nodes play an important role in filtering foreign particles.

The lymphatic vessels are permeable to large molecules and provide the only means by which interstitial proteins can return to the venous system. With muscular contraction, lymph vessels become distorted to create spaces between the endothelial cells, allowing protein and particles to enter. Muscular contraction of the lymphatic walls and surrounding tissues aids in propelling the lymph toward the venous drainage points.

\section*{FUNCTION OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM}

\section*{Circulatory Needs of Tissues}

The amount of blood flow needed by body tissues constantly changes. The percentage of blood flow received by individual organs or tissues is determined by the rate of tissue metabolism, the availability of oxygen, and the function of the tissues (Table 31-1). When metabolic requirements increase, blood vessels dilate to increase the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. When metabolic needs decrease, vessels constrict, and blood flow to the tissues decreases. Metabolic demands of tissues increase with physical activity or exercise, local heat application, fever, and infection. Reduced metabolic requirements of tissues accompany rest or decreased physical activity, local cold application, and
cooling of the body. If the blood vessels fail to dilate in response to the need for increased blood flow, tissue ischemia (ie, deficient blood supply to a body part) results. The mechanism by which blood vessels dilate and constrict to adjust for metabolic changes ensures that normal arterial pressure is maintained.

As blood passes through tissue capillaries, oxygen is removed, and carbon dioxide is added. The amount of oxygen extracted by each tissue differs. For example, the myocardium tends to extract about $50 \%$ of the oxygen from arterial blood in one pass through its capillary bed, whereas the kidneys extract only about $7 \%$ of the oxygen from the blood that passes through them. The average amount of oxygen removed collectively by all of the body tissues is about $25 \%$. This means that the blood in the vena cavae contains about $25 \%$ less oxygen than aortic blood. This is known as the systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference. The value increases when the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues is decreased relative to their metabolic needs (see Table 31-1).

\section*{Blood Flow}

Blood flow through the cardiovascular system always proceeds in the same direction: left side of the heart to the aorta, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, veins, vena cavae, and right side of the heart. This unidirectional flow is caused by a pressure difference that exists between the arterial and venous systems. Because arterial pressure (approximately 100 mm Hg ) is greater than venous pressure (approximately 4 mm Hg ) and fluid always flows from an area of high pressure to an area of lower pressure, blood flows from the arterial to the venous system.

The pressure difference ( $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ ) between the two ends of the vessel provides the impetus for the forward propulsion of blood. Impediments to blood flow offer the opposing force, which is known as resistance (R). The rate of blood flow is determined by dividing the pressure difference by the resistance:
$$\text { Flow rate }=\Delta \mathrm{P} / \mathrm{R}$$

This equation clearly shows that, when resistance increases, a greater driving pressure is required to maintain the same degree of flow. In the body, an increase in driving pressure is accomplished by an increase in the force of contraction of the heart. If arterial resistance is chronically elevated, the myocardium hypertrophies (enlarges) to sustain the greater contractile force.

In most long smooth blood vessels, flow is laminar or streamlined, with blood in the center of the vessel moving slightly faster than the blood near the vessel walls. Laminar flow becomes turbulent when the blood flow rate increases, when blood viscosity increases, when the diameter of the vessel becomes greater than normal, or when segments of the vessel are narrowed or constricted. Turbulent blood flow creates a sound, called a bruit, that can be auscultated with a stethoscope.

\section*{Blood Pressure}

Chapters 26 and 32 provide more information on the physiology and measurement of blood pressure.

\section*{Capillary Filtration and Reabsorption}

Fluid exchange across the capillary wall is continuous. This fluid, which has the same composition as plasma without the proteins, forms the interstitial fluid. The equilibrium between hydrostatic and osmotic forces of the blood and interstitium, as well as capillary permeability, governs the amount and direction of fluid movement across the capillary. Hydrostatic force is a driving pressure that is generated by the blood pressure. Osmotic pressure is the pulling force created by plasma proteins. Normally, the hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end of the capillary is relatively high compared with that at the venous end. This high pressure at the arterial end of the capillaries tends to drive fluid out of the capillary and into the tissue space. Osmotic pressure tends to pull fluid back into the capillary from the tissue space, but this osmotic force cannot overcome the high hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end of the capillary. At the venous end of the capillary, however, the osmotic force predominates over the low hydrostatic pressure, and there is a net reabsorption of fluid from the tissue space back into the capillary.

Except for a very small amount, fluid that is filtered out at the arterial end of the capillary bed is reabsorbed at the venous end. The excess filtered fluid enters the lymphatic circulation. These processes of filtration, reabsorption, and lymph formation aid in maintaining tissue fluid volume and removing tissue waste and debris. Under normal conditions, capillary permeability remains constant.

Under certain abnormal conditions, the fluid filtered out of the capillaries may greatly exceed the amounts reabsorbed and car-
ried away by the lymphatic vessels. This imbalance can result from damage to capillary walls and subsequent increased permeability, obstruction of lymphatic drainage, elevation of venous pressure, or decrease in plasma protein osmotic force. The accumulation of fluid that results from these processes is known as edema.

\section*{Hemodynamic Resistance}

The most important factor that determines resistance in the vascular system is the vessel radius. Small changes in vessel radius lead to large changes in resistance. The predominant sites of change in the caliber or width of blood vessels, and therefore in resistance, are the arterioles and the precapillary sphincter. Peripheral vascular resistance is the opposition to blood flow provided by the blood vessels. Poiseuille's law provides the method by which resistance can be calculated:
$$\mathrm{R}=8 \theta \mathrm{~L} / \pi \mathrm{r}^{4}$$
where $R=$ resistance, $r=$ radius of the vessel, $L=$ length of the vessel, $\theta=$ viscosity of the blood, and $8 / \pi=a$ constant. This equation shows that the resistance is proportional to the viscosity or thickness of the blood and the length of the vessel but is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius.

Under normal conditions, blood viscosity and vessel length do not change significantly, and these factors do not usually play an important role in blood flow. A large increase in hematocrit, however, may increase blood viscosity and reduce capillary blood flow.

\section*{Peripheral Vascular Regulating Mechanisms}

Because the metabolic needs of body tissues, even at rest, are continuously changing, an integrated and coordinated regulatory system is necessary so that blood flow to individual areas is maintained in proportion to the needs of that area. As might be expected, this regulatory mechanism is complex and consists of central nervous system influences, circulating hormones and chemicals, and independent activity of the arterial wall itself.

Sympathetic (adrenergic) nervous system activity, mediated by the hypothalamus, is the most important factor in regulating the caliber and therefore the blood flow of peripheral blood vessels. All vessels are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system except the capillary and precapillary sphincters. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction. The neurotransmitter responsible for sympathetic vasoconstriction is norepinephrine. Sympathetic activation occurs in response to physiologic and psychological stressors. Diminution of sympathetic activity by medications or sympathectomy results in vasodilation.

Other hormonal substances affect peripheral vascular resistance. Epinephrine, released from the adrenal medulla, acts like norepinephrine in constricting peripheral blood vessels in most tissue beds. In low concentrations, however, epinephrine causes vasodilation in skeletal muscles, the heart, and the brain. Angiotensin, a potent substance formed from the interaction of renin (synthesized by the kidney) and a circulating serum protein, stimulates arterial constriction. Although the amount of angiotensin concentrated in the blood is usually small, its profound vasoconstrictor effects are important in certain abnormal states, such as heart failure and hypovolemia.

Alterations in local blood flow are influenced by various circulating substances that have vasoactive properties. Potent vasodilators include histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandin, and certain muscle metabolites. A reduction in available oxygen and nutrients
and changes in local pH also affect local blood flow. Serotonin, a substance liberated from platelets that aggregate at the site of vessel wall damage, constricts arterioles. The application of heat to parts of the body surface causes local vasodilation, whereas the application of cold causes vasoconstriction.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM}

Reduced blood flow through peripheral blood vessels characterizes all peripheral vascular diseases. The physiologic effects of altered blood flow depend on the extent to which tissue demands exceed the supply of oxygen and nutrients available. If tissue needs are high, even modestly reduced blood flow may be inadequate to maintain tissue integrity. Tissues then fall prey to ischemia (deficient blood supply), become malnourished, and ultimately die if adequate blood flow is not restored.

\section*{Pump Failure}

Inadequate peripheral blood flow occurs when the heart's pumping action becomes inefficient. Left ventricular failure causes an accumulation of blood in the lungs and a reduction in forward flow or cardiac output, which results in inadequate arterial blood flow to the tissues. Right ventricular failure causes systemic venous congestion and a reduction in forward flow (see Chap. 30).

\section*{Alterations in Blood and Lymphatic Vessels}

Intact, patent, and responsive blood vessels are necessary to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen to tissues and to remove metabolic wastes. Arteries can become obstructed by atherosclerotic plaque, a thrombus, or an embolus. Arteries can become damaged or obstructed as a result of chemical or mechanical trauma, infections or inflammatory processes, vasospastic disorders, and congenital malformations. A sudden arterial occlusion causes profound and often irreversible tissue ischemia and tissue death. When arterial occlusions develop gradually, there is less risk for sudden tissue death because collateral circulation has an opportunity to develop and the body adapts to the decreased blood flow.

Venous blood flow can be reduced by a thrombus obstructing the vein, by incompetent venous valves, or by a reduction in the effectiveness of the pumping action of surrounding muscles. Decreased venous blood flow results in increased venous pressure, a subsequent rise in capillary hydrostatic pressure, net filtration of fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, and subsequent edema. Edematous tissues cannot receive adequate nutrition from the blood and consequently are more susceptible to breakdown, injury, and infection. Obstruction of lymphatic vessels also results in edema. Lymphatic vessels can become obstructed by tumor or by damage resulting from mechanical trauma or inflammatory processes.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Aging produces changes in the walls of the blood vessels that affect the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The intima thickens as a result of cellular proliferation and fibrosis. Elastin fibers of the media become calcified, thin, and fragmented, and collagen accumulates in the intima and the media. These changes cause the vessels to stiffen, which results in increased peripheral resistance, impaired blood flow, and increased left ventricular workload.

\section*{Circulatory Insufficiency of the Extremities}

Although many types of peripheral vascular diseases exist, most result in ischemia and produce some of the same symptoms: pain, skin changes, diminished pulse, and possible edema. The type and severity of symptoms depend in part on the type, stage, and extent of the disease process and on the speed with which the disorder develops. Table 31-2 highlights the distinguishing features of arterial and venous insufficiency. In this chapter, peripheral vascular disease is categorized as arterial, venous, or lymphatic disorders.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

A description of the pain and any precipitating factors, the skin color and temperature, and the peripheral pulses are important for the diagnosis of arterial disorders.

\section*{Intermittent Claudication}

A muscular, cramp-type pain in the extremities consistently reproduced with the same degree of exercise or activity and relieved by rest is experienced by patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency. Referred to as intermittent claudication, this pain is caused by the inability of the arterial system to provide adequate blood flow to the tissues in the face of increased demands for nutrients during exercise. As the tissues are forced to complete the energy cycle without the nutrients, muscle metabolites and lactic acid are produced. Pain is experienced as the metabolites aggravate the nerve endings of the surrounding tissue. Usually, about $50 \%$ of the arterial lumen or $75 \%$ of the cross-sectional area must be obstructed before intermittent claudication is experienced. When the patient rests and thereby decreases the metabolic needs of the muscles, the pain subsides. The progression of the arterial disease can be monitored by documenting the amount of exercise or the distance a patient can walk before pain is produced. Persistent pain in the forefoot when the patient is resting indicates a severe degree of arterial insufficiency and a critical state of ischemia. Known as rest pain, this discomfort is often worse at
night and may interfere with sleep. This pain frequently requires that the extremity be lowered to a dependent position to improve perfusion pressure to the distal tissues.

The site of arterial disease can be deduced from the location of claudication, because pain occurs in muscle groups below the disease. As a general rule, the pain of intermittent claudication occurs one joint level below the disease process. Calf pain may accompany reduced blood flow through the superficial femoral or popliteal artery, whereas pain in the hip or buttock may result from reduced blood flow in the abdominal aorta or the common iliac or hypogastric arteries.

\section*{Changes in Skin Appearance and Temperature}

Adequate blood flow warms the extremities and gives them a rosy coloring. Inadequate blood flow results in cool and pale extremities. Further reduction of blood flow to these tissues, which occurs when the extremity is elevated, for example, results in an even whiter or more blanched appearance (pallor). Rubor, a reddish blue discoloration of the extremities, may be observed within 20 seconds to 2 minutes after the extremity is dependent. Rubor suggests severe peripheral arterial damage in which vessels that cannot constrict remain dilated. Even with rubor, the extremity begins to turn pale with elevation. Cyanosis, a bluish tint on the skin, is manifested when the amount of oxygenated hemoglobin contained in the blood is reduced.

Additional changes resulting from a chronically reduced nutrient supply include loss of hair, brittle nails, dry or scaling skin, atrophy, and ulcerations. Edema may be apparent bilaterally or unilaterally and is related to the affected extremity's chronically dependent position because of severe rest pain. Gangrenous changes appear after prolonged, severe ischemia and represent tissue necrosis. In elderly patients who are inactive, gangrene may be the first sign of disease. These patients may have adjusted their lifestyle to accommodate the limitations imposed by the disease, and may not walk enough to develop symptoms of claudication. Circulation is decreased, but this is not apparent to the patient until trauma occurs. At this point, gangrene develops when minimal arterial flow is impaired further by edema formation resulting from the traumatic event.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Pulses}

Determining the presence or absence, as well as the quality, of peripheral pulses is important in assessing the status of peripheral arterial circulation (Fig. 31-2). Absence of a pulse may indicate that the site of stenosis (narrowing or constriction) is proximal to that location. Occlusive arterial disease impairs blood flow and can reduce or obliterate palpable pulsations in the extremities. Pulses should be palpated bilaterally and simultaneously, comparing both sides for symmetry in rate, rhythm, and quality.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

In elderly people, symptoms of peripheral arterial disease may be more pronounced than in younger people because of the condition's duration and coexisting chronic disease. Intermittent claudication may occur after walking only a few short blocks or after walking up a slight incline. Any prolonged pressure on the foot can cause pressure areas that become ulcerated, infected, and gangrenous. The outcomes of arterial insufficiency in the elderly person include reduced mobility and activity and a loss of independence.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

In identifying and diagnosing the various abnormalities affecting the vascular structures (arteries, veins, and lymphatics), various tests may be performed.

\section*{DOPPLER ULTRASOUND FLOW STUDIES}

Palpating pulses is subjective, and the examiner may mistake his or her own pulse for that of the patient. To prevent this, the examiner should use light touch and avoid using only the index finger for palpation, because this finger has the strongest arterial pulsation of all the fingers. The thumb should not be used for the same reason. When pulses cannot be reliably palpated, use of a microphone-like, hand-held Doppler ultrasound device, called a transducer or probe, may be helpful in detecting and assessing peripheral flow.

A continuous-wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound device may be used to hear (insonate) the blood flow in vessels when pulses cannot be palpated. This hand-held device emits a continuous signal through the patient's tissues. The signals are reflected by (echo off) the moving blood cells and are received by the device. The filtered-output Doppler signal is then transmitted to a loudspeaker or headphones, where it can be heard for interpretation. Because CW Doppler emits a continuous signal, all vascular structures in the path of the sound beam are insonated, and differentiating arterial from venous flow and detecting the site of a stenosis may be difficult. The depth at which blood flow can be detected by Doppler is determined by the frequency (in megahertz [MHz]) it generates. The lower the frequency, the deeper the tissue penetration; a 5-to $10-\mathrm{MHz}$ probe may be used to evaluate the peripheral arteries.

To evaluate the lower extremities, the patient is placed in a supine position with the head of bed elevated 20 to 30 degrees; the legs are externally rotated, if possible, to permit adequate access to the medial malleolus. Acoustic gel is applied to the patient's skin

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-337.jpg?height=1153&width=1750&top_left_y=1372&top_left_x=219}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 31-2 Assessing peripheral pulses. (Left) Popliteal pulse. (Right) Dorsalis pedis pulse. (Bottom) Posterior tibial pulse.}
\end{figure}
to permit uniform transmission of the ultrasound wave (electrocardiogram gel is not used because it contains sodium, which may dissolve the epoxy that covers the transducer's tip). The tip of the Doppler transducer is positioned at a 45 - to 60 -degree angle over the expected location of the artery and angled slowly to identify arterial blood flow. Excessive pressure is avoided because severely diseased arteries can collapse with even minimal pressure.

Because the equipment can detect blood flow in advanced arterial disease states, especially if collateral circulation has developed, identifying a signal documents only the presence of blood flow. However, it is clinically relevant to notify the primary care provider of the absence of a signal if one had been detected during a previous examination.

CW Doppler (Fig. 31-3) is more useful as a clinical tool when combined with ankle blood pressures, which are used to determine the ankle-brachial index (ABI), also called the ankle-arm index (AAI). The ABI is the ratio of the ankle systolic blood pressure to the arm systolic blood pressure. It is an objective indicator of arterial disease that allows the examiner to quantify the degree of stenosis. With increasing degrees of arterial narrowing, there is a progressive decrease in systolic pressure distal to the involved sites.

The first step in determining the ABI is to have the patient rest in a supine position (not seated) for at least 5 minutes. An ap-propriate-sized blood pressure cuff (typically, a $10-\mathrm{cm}$ cuff) is applied to the patient's ankle above the malleolus. After identifying an arterial signal at the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries, the systolic ankle pressures are obtained in both feet. Diastolic pressures cannot be measured with a Doppler. If pressure in these arteries cannot be measured, pressure can be measured in the peroneal artery, which can also be assessed at the ankle (Fig. 31-4).

Doppler ultrasonography is used to measure brachial pressures in both arms. Both arms are evaluated because the patient may have an asymptomatic stenosis in the subclavian artery, causing brachial pressure on the affected side to be 20 mm Hg or more lower than systemic pressure. The abnormally low pressure should not be used for assessment.

To calculate ABI, the ankle systolic pressure for each foot is divided by the higher of the two brachial systolic pressures;

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-338.jpg?height=589&width=866&top_left_y=1797&top_left_x=112}

\end{figure}

Chart 31-1 offers more information. The ABI can be computed for a patient with the following systolic pressures:

> Right brachial: 160 mm Hg
> Left brachial: 120 mm Hg
> Right posterior tibial: 80 mm Hg
> Right dorsalis pedis: 60 mm Hg
> Left posterior tibial: 100 mm Hg
> Left dorsalis pedis: 120 mm Hg

The highest systolic pressure for each ankle ( 80 mm Hg for the right, 120 mm Hg for the left) would be divided by the highest brachial pressure ( 160 mm Hg ).
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Right: } 80 / 160 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}=0.50 \mathrm{ABI} \\
& \text { Left: } 120 / 160 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}=0.75 \mathrm{ABI}
\end{aligned}$$

In general, systolic pressure in the ankle of a healthy person is the same or slightly higher than the brachial systolic pressure, resulting in an ABI of about 1.0 (no arterial insufficiency). Patients with claudication usually have an ABI of 0.95 to 0.50 (mild to moderate insufficiency); patients with ischemic rest pain have an ABI of less than 0.50, and patients with severe ischemia or tissue loss have an ABI of 0.25 or less.

\section*{EXERCISE TESTING}

Exercise testing is used to determine how long a patient can walk and to measure the ankle systolic blood pressure in response to walking. The patient walks on a treadmill at 1.5 mph with a $10 \%$ incline for a maximum of 5 minutes. Most patients can complete the test unless they have severe cardiac, pulmonary, or orthopedic problems or are physically disabled. A normal response to the test is little or no drop in ankle systolic pressure after exercise. In a patient with true claudication, however, ankle pressure drops. Combining this hemodynamic information with the walking time helps the physician determine whether intervention is necessary.

\section*{DUPLEX ULTRASONOGRAPHY}

Duplex ultrasonography involves B-mode gray-scale imaging of the tissue, organs, and blood vessels (arterial and venous) and permits estimation of velocity changes by use of a pulsed Doppler

\begin{figure}

\caption{(Fig. 31-5). Color flow techniques, which can identify vessels, may be used to shorten the examination time. The procedure helps determine the level and extent of disease and is universally employed to evaluate the venous system. The technique makes it possible to image and assess blood flow, evaluate the runoff status of the distal vessels, locate the disease (stenosis versus occlusion), and determine anatomic morphology and the hemodynamic significance of plaque causing stenosis. Duplex ultrasound findings help in planning therapy and monitoring its outcomes. Moreover, the test is noninvasive and usually requires no patient preparation. The equipment is portable, making it useful anywhere for initial diagnosis or follow-up evaluations.}
\end{figure}

\section*{COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY}

Computed tomography (CT) provides cross-sectional images of soft tissue and can identify the area of volume changes to an extremity and the compartment where changes take place. CT of a lymphedematous arm or leg, for example, demonstrates a characteristic honeycomb pattern in the subcutaneous tissue.

In spiral (also called volumetric) CT, the scan head moves circumferentially around the patient as the patient passes through the scanner, creating a series of overlapping images that are connected to one another in a continuous spiral (Verta \& Verta, 1998). Scan times are short; however, the patient is exposed to

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-339.jpg?height=581&width=863&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=1119}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 31-5 Color flow duplex image of popliteal artery with normal triphasic Doppler flow.}
\end{figure}
x-rays, and contrast agent usually must be injected to adequately visualize the blood vessels. Using computer software, the slicelike images are reconstructed into three-dimensional images that can be rotated and viewed from multiple angles.

\section*{COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC ANGIOGRAPHY}

In computed tomographic angiography (CTA), a spiral CT scanner and rapid intravenous infusion of contrast agent are used to image very thin ( $1-\mathrm{mm}$ ) sections of the target area; the results are configured in three dimensions so that the image closely resembles a regular angiogram (Verta \& Verta, 1998). CTA shows the aorta and main visceral arteries better than it shows smaller branch vessels. Scan times are usually between 20 and 30 seconds. The large volume of contrast agent required for CTA limits the usefulness of this study in patients with allergy to the contrast agent or with significantly impaired renal function.

\section*{MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY}

Magnetic resonance angiography is performed with a standard MRI scanner but with image-processing software specifically programmed to isolate the blood vessels. The images are reconstructed to resemble a standard angiogram, but because the images are reassembled in three dimensions, they can be rotated and viewed from multiple angles. Because no contrast agent is necessary, this study is useful in patients with poor renal function or allergy to contrast agent. Scan time is long, and motion artifacts are common, restricting the use of the test to relatively short segments of the vascular system (Verta \& Verta, 1998).

\section*{ANGIOGRAPHY}

An arteriogram produced by angiography may be used to confirm the diagnosis of occlusive arterial disease when considering surgery or other interventions. The procedure involves injecting a radiopaque contrast agent directly into the vascular system to visualize the vessels. The location of a vascular obstruction or an aneurysm (abnormal dilation of a blood vessel) and the collateral circulation can be demonstrated. Usually, patients experience a temporary sensation of warmth as the contrast agent is injected, and local irritation may occur at the injection site. Infrequently, a patient
may have an immediate or delayed allergic reaction to the iodine contained in the contrast agent. Manifestations include dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, and numbness of the extremities. Any such reaction must be reported to the physician at once; treatment may include the administration of one or more of epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines, or corticosteroids. Additional risks include vessel injury, bleeding, and CVA (brain attack, stroke).

\section*{AIR PLETHYSMOGRAPHY}

Named for the standardized air chambers that fit around the lower leg and that are calibrated after being filled with a standard amount of air, air plethysmography quantifies venous reflux and calf muscle pump ejection. Changes in volume are measured with the patient's legs elevated, with the patient supine and standing, and after the patient performs toe-ups (patient extends ankle while standing; stands on tip-toes). Air plethysmography provides information about venous filling time, functional venous volume, ejected volume, and residual volume. It is useful in evaluating patients with suspected valvular incompetence or chronic venous insufficiency.

\section*{CONTRAST PHLEBOGRAPHY}

Also known as venography, contrast phlebography involves injecting radiographic contrast media into the venous system through a dorsal foot vein. If a thrombus exists, the x-ray image discloses an unfilled segment of vein in an otherwise completely filled vein. Injection of the contrast agent may cause a brief but painful inflammation of the vein. The test is generally performed if the patient is to undergo thrombolytic therapy, but duplex ultrasonography is now accepted as the gold standard for diagnosing venous thrombosis.

\section*{LYMPHANGIOGRAPHY}

Lymphangiography affords a means of detecting lymph node involvement that results from metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, or infection in sites that are otherwise inaccessible to the examiner except by surgery. In this test, a lymphatic vessel in each foot (or hand) is injected with contrast agent. A series of x-rays are taken at the conclusion of the injection, 24 hours later, and periodically thereafter, as indicated. The failure to identify subcutaneous lymphatic collection of contrast agent and the persistence of contrast agent in the tissue for days afterward help to confirm a diagnosis of lymphedema.

\section*{LYMPHOSCINTIGRAPHY}

Lymphoscintigraphy is a reliable alternative to lymphangiography. A radioactively labeled colloid is injected subcutaneously in the second interdigital space. The extremity is then exercised to facilitate the uptake of the colloid by the lymphatic system, and serial images are obtained at preset intervals. No adverse reactions have been reported.

\section*{Management of Arterial Disorders}

\section*{ARTERIOSCLEROSIS AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS}

Arteriosclerosis is the most common disease of the arteries; the term means hardening of the arteries. It is a diffuse process whereby the muscle fibers and the endothelial lining of the walls of small
arteries and arterioles become thickened. Atherosclerosis involves a different process, affecting the intima of the large and mediumsized arteries. These changes consist of the accumulation of lipids, calcium, blood components, carbohydrates, and fibrous tissue on the intimal layer of the artery. These accumulations are referred to as atheromas or plaques.

Although the pathologic processes of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis differ, rarely does one occur without the other, and the terms are often used interchangeably. Because atherosclerosis is a generalized disease of the arteries, when it is present in the extremities, atherosclerosis is usually present elsewhere in the body.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The most common direct results of atherosclerosis in arteries include narrowing (stenosis) of the lumen, obstruction by thrombosis, aneurysm, ulceration, and rupture. Its indirect results are malnutrition and the subsequent fibrosis of the organs that the sclerotic arteries supply with blood. All actively functioning tissue cells require an abundant supply of nutrients and oxygen and are sensitive to any reduction in the supply of these nutrients. If such reductions are severe and permanent, the cells undergo ischemic necrosis (death of cells due to deficient blood flow) and are replaced by fibrous tissue, which requires much less blood flow.

Atherosclerosis can develop at any point in the body, but certain sites are more vulnerable, typically bifurcation or branch areas. In the proximal lower extremity, these include the distal abdominal aorta, the common iliac arteries, the orifice of the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries, and the superficial femoral artery in the adductor canal. Distal to the knee, atherosclerosis occurs anywhere along the artery. There are no specific areas, such as arterial bifurcations, that are more vulnerable for atherosclerosis.

Although many theories exist about the development of atherosclerosis, no single theory fully explains the pathogenesis; however, parts of several theories have been combined into the reaction-to-injury theory. According to this theory, vascular endothelial cell injury results from prolonged hemodynamic forces, such as shearing stresses and turbulent flow, irradiation, chemical exposure, or chronic hyperlipidemia in the arterial system. Injury to the endothelium increases the aggregation of platelets and monocytes at the site of the injury. Smooth muscle cells migrate and proliferate, allowing a matrix of collagen and elastic fibers to form. It may be that there is no single cause or mechanism for the development of atherosclerosis; rather, multiple processes may be involved (Moore, 2002).

Morphologically, atherosclerotic lesions are of two types: fatty streaks and fibrous plaque. Fatty streaks are yellow and smooth, protrude slightly into the lumen of the artery, and are composed of lipids and elongated smooth muscle cells. These lesions have been found in the arteries of people of all age groups, including infants. It is not clear whether fatty streaks predispose the person to the formation of fibrous plaques or if they are reversible. They do not usually cause clinical symptoms.

The fibrous plaque characteristic of atherosclerosis is composed of smooth muscle cells, collagen fibers, plasma components, and lipids. It is white to whitish yellow and protrudes in various degrees into the arterial lumen, sometimes completely obstructing it. These plaques are found predominantly in the abdominal aorta and the coronary, popliteal, and internal carotid arteries. This plaque is believed to be an irreversible lesion (Fig. 31-6). Gradual narrowing of the arterial lumen as the disease process progresses stimulates the development of collateral circulation

\caption{FIGURE 31-6 Schematic concept of the progression of atherosclerosis. Fatty streaks constitute one of the earliest lesions of atherosclerosis.

(Fig. 31-7). Collateral circulation consists of preexisting vessels that enlarge to reroute blood flow in the presence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis or occlusion. Collateral flow allows continued perfusion to the tissues beyond the arterial obstruction, but it is often inadequate to meet imposed metabolic demand, and ischemia results.

\section*{Risk Factors}

Many risk factors are associated with atherosclerosis (Chart 31-2). Although it is not completely clear whether modification of these risk factors prevents the development of cardiovascular disease, evidence indicates that it may slow the disease process. Some risk factors, such as age or gender, cannot be modified. However, it is believed that genetic factors can be modified indirectly by altering other risk factors (Moore, 2002).

Tobacco use may be one of the strongest risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Nicotine decreases blood flow to the extremities and increases heart rate and blood pressure by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, causing vasoconstriction. It also increases the risk for clot formation by increasing the aggregation of platelets. Carbon monoxide, a toxin produced by burning tobacco, combines more readily with the hemoglobin than oxygen does, depriving the tissues of oxygen. The amount of tobacco use is directly related to the extent of the disease, and cessation of tobacco use reduces the risks. Many other factors

\section*{Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis}

\section*{Modifiable}

Nicotine use (ie, tobacco smoking, chewing)
Diet (contributing to hyperlipidemin)
Hypertension
Diabetes (which speeds the atherosclerotic process by thickening the basement membranes of both large and small vessels)
Stress
Sedentary lifestyle
Nonmodifiable
Age
Gender
such as obesity, stress, and lack of exercise have been identified as contributing to the disease process.

\section*{Prevention}

Intermittent claudication is a sign of generalized atherosclerosis and may be a marker of occult coronary artery disease. Because a high-fat diet is suspected of contributing to atherosclerosis, it is reasonable to measure serum cholesterol and to begin prevention efforts. The American Heart Association recommends reducing the amount of fat ingested in a healthy diet, substituting unsaturated fats for saturated fats, and decreasing cholesterol intake to no more than 300 mg daily to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (Krauss et al., 2000).

Certain medications combined with dietary modification and exercise are being used to reduce blood lipid levels. There is limited evidence that these medications can alter the course of peripheral arterial disease, but they may reduce the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease. Several classes of medication are used to prevent atherosclerosis: bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine [Questran, Prevalite] or colestipol [Colestid]), nicotinic acid (niacin, $\mathrm{B}_{3}$, Niacor; Niaspan), statins (atorvastatin [Lipitor], lovastatin [Mevacor], pravastatin [Pravachol], simvastatin [Zocor]), fibric acids (gemfibrozil [Lopid]), and lipophilic substances (probucol). Patients receiving long-term therapy with these medications require close medical supervision. Hypertension, which may accelerate the rate at which atherosclerotic lesions form in high-pressure vessels, can lead to cerebrovascular accident (CVA; brain attack, stroke), ischemic renal disease, severe peripheral arterial disease, or coronary artery disease. Results of large, randomized studies demonstrated dramatic reductions in myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death when blood pressure was decreased to at least $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (Moser, 1999; McAlister et al., 2001).

Although no single risk factor has been identified as the primary contributor to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it is clear that the greater the number of risk factors, the greater the likelihood of developing the disease. Elimination of all controllable risk factors, particularly tobacco use, is strongly recommended.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical signs and symptoms resulting from atherosclerosis depend on the organ or tissue affected. Coronary atherosclerosis (heart disease), angina, and acute myocardial infarction are discussed in Chapter 28. Cerebrovascular diseases, including transient cerebral ischemic attacks and stroke, are discussed in Chapter 62. Atherosclerosis of the aorta, including aneurysm, and atherosclerotic lesions of the extremities are discussed later in this chapter. Renovascular disease (renal artery stenosis and end-stage renal disease), including hypertension, is discussed in Chapter 45.

\section*{Medical Management}

The traditional medical management of atherosclerosis involves modification of risk factors, a controlled exercise program to improve circulation and increase the functioning capacity of the circulation, medication, and interventional or surgical graft procedures.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Vascular surgical procedures are divided into two groups: inflow procedures, which provide blood supply from the aorta into the femoral artery, and outflow procedures, which provide blood sup-
ply to vessels below the femoral artery. Inflow surgical procedures are discussed with diseases of the aorta and outflow procedures with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

\section*{RADIOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS}

Several interventional radiologic techniques are important adjunctive therapies to surgical procedures. If an isolated lesion or lesions are identified during the arteriogram, angioplasty, also called percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), may be performed. After the patient receives a local anesthetic, a balloontipped catheter is maneuvered across the area of stenosis. Exactly how PTA works is controversial. Some theorize that it improves blood flow by overstretching (and thereby dilating) the elastic fibers of the nondiseased arterial segment, but most clinicians believe that the procedure widens the arterial lumen by cracking and flattening the plaque against the vessel wall (see Chap. 28). Complications from PTA include hematoma formation, embolus, dissection (separation of the intima) of the vessel, and bleeding. To decrease the risk of reocclusion, stents (small, mesh tubes made of nitinol, titanium, or stainless steel) may be inserted to support the walls of blood vessels and prevent collapse immediately after balloon inflation (Fig. 31-8). A variety of covered wall stents and stent-grafts may be used for short-segment stenoses. Complications associated with stent or stent-graft use include distal embolization, intimal damage (dissection), and dislodgment. The advantage of angioplasty, stents, and stent-grafts is the decreased length of hospital stay required for the treatment; many of the procedures are performed on an outpatient basis.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WHO HAS PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL INSUFFICIENCY OF THE EXTREMITIES}

\section*{Assessment}

The nursing assessment includes a complete health and medication history and identification of risk factors for peripheral artery disease. Signs and symptoms detected during the nursing assessment may include claudication pain; rest pain in the forefoot; pallor, rubor, or cyanosis; weak or absent peripheral pulses; and skin breakdown or ulcerations.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include the following:
- Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion related to compromised circulation
- Chronic pain related to impaired ability of peripheral vessels to supply tissues with oxygen
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to compromised circulation
- Deficient knowledge regarding self-care activities

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include increased arterial blood supply to the extremities, promotion of vasodilation, prevention of vascular compression, relief of pain, attainment or maintenance of tissue integrity, and adherence to the self-care program.

Measures used by the patient and members of the health care team to accomplish a single goal must be evaluated in terms of

FIGURE 31-8 (A) Flexible stent. Courtesy of Medtronics, Peripheral Division, Santa Rosa, California. (B) Representation of a common iliac artery with a Wallstent (Boston Scientific).
the positive and the negative effects these measures may have on the simultaneous achievement of other goals. An overview of the care of a patient with peripheral arterial problems is provided in the Plan of Nursing Care: The Patient With Peripheral Vascular Problems.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL CIRCULATION}

Arterial blood supply to a body part can be enhanced by positioning the part below the level of the heart. For the lower extremities, this is accomplished by elevating the head of the patient's bed on $15-\mathrm{cm}$ (6-inch) blocks or by having the patient use a reclining chair or sit with the feet resting on the floor.

The nurse can assist the patient with walking or other moderate or graded isometric exercises that may be prescribed to promote blood flow and encourage the development of collateral circulation. The nurse instructs the patient to walk to the point of pain, rest until pain subsides, and then resume walking so that endurance can be increased as collateral circulation develops. Pain can serve as a guide in determining the amount of exercise appropriate for an individual. The onset of pain indicates that the tissues are not receiving adequate oxygen, signaling the patient to rest before continuing activity. However, a regular exercise program can result in increased walking distance before the onset of claudication. The amount of exercise a patient can tolerate before the onset of pain is determined to provide a baseline for evaluation.

Not all patients with peripheral vascular disease should exercise. Before recommending any exercise program, the primary health care provider should be consulted. Conditions that worsen with activity include leg ulcers, cellulitis, gangrene, or acute thrombotic occlusions.

\section*{PROMOTING VASODILATION AND PREVENTING VASCULAR COMPRESSION}

Arterial dilation promotes increased blood flow to the extremities and is therefore a desirable goal for patients with peripheral arterial disease. However, if the arteries are severely sclerosed, inelastic, or damaged, dilation is not possible. For this reason, measures to promote vasodilation, such as medications or surgery, may be only minimally effective.

Nursing interventions may involve applications of warmth to promote arterial flow and instructions to the patient to avoid exposure to cold temperatures, which causes vasoconstriction. Ad-
equate clothing and warm temperatures protect the patient from chilling. If chilling occurs, a warm bath or drink is helpful.

When heat is applied directly to ischemic extremities, the temperature of the heat source must not exceed body temperature. Even at lower temperatures, burn injuries can occur in ischemic extremities. Excess heat may increase the metabolic rate of the extremities and increase the need for oxygen beyond that provided by the reduced arterial flow through the diseased artery.

> NURSING ALERT Patients are instructed to test the temperature of bath water and to avoid using hot-water bottles and heating pads on the extremities. Applying a heating pad to the abdomen can cause reflex vasodilation in the extremities and is safer than direct application of heat to affected extremities.

Nicotine causes vasospasm and can thereby dramatically reduce circulation to the extremities. Tobacco smoke also impairs transport and cellular use of oxygen and increases blood viscosity. Patients with arterial insufficiency who use tobacco (ie, smoke, chew) must be fully informed of the effects of nicotine on circulation and encouraged to stop using tobacco.

Emotional upsets stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction. Although emotional stress is unavoidable, it can be minimized to some degree by avoiding stressful situations when possible or by consistently following a stress-management program. Counseling services or relaxation training may be indicated for people who cannot cope effectively with situational stressors.

Constrictive clothing and accessories such as tight socks, panty girdles, and shoelaces impede circulation to the extremities and promote venous stasis and therefore should be avoided. Crossing the legs should be discouraged because it compresses vessels in the legs.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Frequently, the pain associated with peripheral arterial insufficiency is chronic and continuous. It limits activities, affects work and responsibilities, disturbs sleep, and alters patients' sense of well-being. Patients are often depressed, irritable, and unable to exert the energy necessary to execute prescribed therapies, making pain relief even more difficult. Analgesics such as oxycodone plus acetylsalicylic acid (Percodan) or oxycodone plus acetamin-

\section*{MAINTAINING TISSUE INTEGRITY}

Poorly nourished tissues are susceptible to damage and infection. When lesions develop, healing may be delayed or inhibited because of the poor blood supply to the area. Infected, nonhealing ulcerations of the extremities can be debilitating and may require prolonged and often expensive treatments. Amputation of an ischemic limb may eventually be necessary. Measures to prevent these complications must be a high priority and vigorously implemented.

Trauma to the extremities must be avoided. Advising the patient to wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes or slippers to prevent foot injury and blisters may be helpful, as may be recommending neutral soaps and body lotions to prevent drying and cracking of skin. Scratching and vigorous rubbing can abrade skin and create a site for bacterial invasion; therefore, feet should be patted dry. Stockings should be clean and dry. Fingernails and toenails should be carefully trimmed straight across and sharp corners filed to follow the contour of the nail. If nails are thick and brittle and cannot be trimmed safely, a podiatrist must be consulted. Corns and calluses need to be removed by a health care professional. Special shoe inserts may be needed to prevent calluses from recurring. All signs of blisters, ingrown toenails, infection, or other problems should be
reported to health care professionals for treatment and follow-up. Patients with diminished vision may require assistance in periodically examining the lower extremities for trauma.

Good nutrition promotes healing and prevents tissue breakdown and is therefore included in the overall therapeutic program for patients with peripheral vascular disease. Eating a wellbalanced diet that contains adequate protein and vitamins is necessary for patients with arterial insufficiency. Key nutrients play specific roles in wound healing. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis and capillary development. Vitamin A enhances epithelialization. Zinc is necessary for cell mitosis and cell proliferation. Obesity strains the heart, increases venous congestion, and reduces circulation; therefore, a weight-reduction plan may be necessary for some patients. A diet low in lipids may be indicated for patients with atherosclerosis.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

The self-care program is planned with the patient so that activities that promote arterial and venous circulation, relieve pain, and promote tissue integrity are acceptable. The patient and family are helped to understand the reasons for each aspect of the program and the possible consequences of nonadherence. Long-term care of the feet and legs is of prime importance in the prevention of trauma, ulceration, and gangrene. The Plan of Nursing Care describes nursing care for patients with peripheral vascular disease. Chart 31-3 provides detailed patient instructions for foot and leg care.

\section*{PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL OCCLUSIVE DISEASE}

Arterial insufficiency of the extremities is usually found in individuals older than 50 years of age, most often in men. The legs are most frequently affected; however, the upper extremities may be involved. The age of onset and the severity are influenced by the type and number of atherosclerotic risk factors (Chart 31-4). In peripheral arterial disease, obstructive lesions are predominantly confined to segments of the arterial system extending from the aorta below the renal arteries to the popliteal artery (Fig. 31-9). However, distal occlusive disease is frequently seen in patients with diabetes mellitus and in elderly patients.

\section*{Risk Factors for Peripheral Arterial Disease}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 31-9 Common sites of atherosclerotic obstruction in major arteries.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The hallmark is intermittent claudication. This pain may be described as aching, cramping, fatigue, or weakness that is consistently reproduced with the same degree of exercise or activity and relieved with rest. The pain commonly occurs in muscle groups one joint level below the stenosis or occlusion. As the disease progresses, the patient may have a decreased ability to walk the same distance or may notice increased pain with ambulation. When the arterial insufficiency becomes severe, the
patient begins to have rest pain. This pain is associated with critical ischemia of the distal extremity and is persistent, aching, or boring; it may be so excruciating that it is unrelieved by opioids. Ischemic rest pain is usually worse at night and often wakes the patient. Elevating the extremity or placing it in a horizontal position increases the pain, whereas placing the extremity in a dependent position reduces the pain. In bed, some patients sleep with the affected leg hanging over the side of the bed. Some patients sleep in a reclining chair in an attempt to relieve the pain.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A sensation of coldness or numbness in the extremities may accompany intermittent claudication and is a result of the reduced arterial flow. When the extremity is examined, it may feel cool to the touch and look pale when elevated or ruddy and cyanotic when placed in a dependent position. Skin and nail changes, ulcerations, gangrene, and muscle atrophy may be evident. Bruits may be auscultated with a stethoscope; a bruit is the sound produced by turbulent blood flow through an irregular, tortuous, stenotic vessel or through a dilated segment of the vessel (aneurysm). Peripheral pulses may be diminished or absent.

Examining the peripheral pulses is an important part of assessing arterial occlusive disease. Unequal pulses between extremities or the absence of a normally palpable pulse is a sign of peripheral arterial disease. The femoral pulse in the groin and the posterior tibial pulse beside the medial malleolus are most easily palpated. The popliteal pulse is sometimes difficult to palpate; the location of the dorsalis pedis artery on the dorsum of the foot varies and is normally absent in about $7 \%$ of the population.

The presence, location, and extent of arterial occlusive disease are determined by a careful history of the symptoms and by physical examination. The color and temperature of the extremity are noted and the pulses palpated. The nails may be thickened and opaque, and the skin may be shiny, atrophic, and dry, with sparse hair growth. The assessment includes comparison of the right and left extremities.

The diagnosis of peripheral arterial occlusive disease may be made using CW Doppler and ankle-brachial indices (ABIs), treadmill testing for claudication, duplex ultrasonography, or other imaging studies previously described.

\section*{Medical Management}

Generally, patients feel better with some type of exercise program. If this program is combined with weight reduction and cessation of tobacco use, patients often can improve their activity tolerance. Patients should not be promised that their symptoms will be relieved if they stop tobacco use, because claudication may persist, and they may lose their motivation to stop using tobacco.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Various medications are prescribed to treat the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease. Pentoxifylline (Trental) increases erythrocyte flexibility and reduces blood viscosity, and it is therefore thought to improve the supply of oxygenated blood to the muscle. Cilostazol (Pletal) works by inhibiting platelet aggregation, inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation, and increasing vasodilation. Antiplatelet aggregating agents such as aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), and clopidogrel (Plavix) are thought to improve circulation throughout diseased arteries or prevent intimal hyperplasia leading to stenosis.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In most patients, when intermittent claudication becomes severe and disabling or when the limb is at risk for amputation because of tissue loss, vascular grafting or endarterectomy is the treatment of choice. The choice of the surgical procedure depends on the degree and location of the stenosis or occlusion. Other important considerations are the overall health of the patient and the length of the procedure that can be tolerated. It is sometimes necessary to provide the palliative therapy of primary amputation rather than an arterial bypass. If endarterectomy is performed, an incision is made into the artery, and the atheromatous obstruction is

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 31-1 Does Exercise Relieve Pain of Peripheral Arterial claudication?}

Braun, C. M., Colucci, A. M., \& Patterson, R. B. (1999). Components of an optimal exercise program for the treatment of patients with claudication. Journal of Vascular Nursing, 17(2), 32-36.

\section*{Purpose}

Because patients with peripheral arterial claudication increasingly limit activity because of pain, they become physically deconditioned. The patients and their families report decreased quality of life (QOL) because of the activity limitations. Traditional treatment for peripheral arterial claudication has been surgical bypass. Exercise programs are beginning to be offered as treatment for patients with peripheral arterial claudication. Little is known about the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of this patient population. This study evaluated whether a supervised exercise and education program increased pain-free walking distance and improved total fitness of patients with peripheral arterial claudication.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This study was a retrospective review of 96 patients who had experienced symptoms of peripheral arterial claudication for longer than 3 months. Patients participated in a cardiovascular conditioning and muscle training exercise program with education classes for 12 weeks. Twenty-two patients were monitored for 2 years; data were collected at 1 year and 2 years after the original 12 -week program.

\section*{Findings}

Patients' walking distances increased threefold after participation in the 12 -week program. The average maximum distance patients were able to walk at the beginning of the program was 190 meters. After the 12-week program the average distance was 580 m . The 22 patients followed for two years had an average maximum walking distance of 882 m 1 year after the 12-week program and 731 m 2 years after the 12 -week program. The researchers concluded that patients were able to maintain and continue exercising after completion of the 12 -week program. Families reported improvement in general health and psychosocial behavior of the patients.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Patients with peripheral arterial claudication benefit from a supervised exercise program combined with education programs. Supervised exercise programs may enable patients with peripheral arterial claudication to increase the distance they can walk without symptoms, improve their quality of life, and avoid or delay surgical intervention.
removed. The artery is then sutured closed to restore vascular integrity (Fig. 31-10).

Bypass grafts are performed to reroute the blood flow around the stenosis or occlusion. Before bypass grafting, the surgeon determines where the distal anastomosis (site where the vessels are surgically joined) will be placed. The distal outflow vessel must be at least $50 \%$ patent for the graft to remain patent. A higher bypass graft patency rate is associated with keeping the length of the bypass as short as possible.

If the atherosclerotic occlusion is below the inguinal ligament in the superficial femoral artery, the surgical procedure of choice is the femoral-to-popliteal graft. This procedure is further classified as above-knee and below-knee grafts, referring to the location of the distal anastomosis.

Lower leg or ankle vessels with occlusions may also require grafts. Occasionally, the entire popliteal artery is occluded, and there is only collateral circulation. The distal anastomosis may be
A
B
C
D

EIGURE 31-10 In an aortoiliac endarterectomy, the vascular surgeon (A) identifies the diseased area, (B) clamps off the blood supply to the vessel, (C) removes the plaque, and (D) sutures the vessel shut, after which blood flow is restored.

made onto any of the tibial arteries (posterior tibial, anterior tibial, or peroneal arteries) or the dorsalis pedis or plantar artery. The distal anastomosis site is determined by the ease of exposure of the vessel in surgery and by which vessel provides the best flow to the distal limb. These grafts require the use of native vein to ensure patency. Native vein is autologous vein (the patient's own vein). The greater or lesser saphenous vein or a combination of one of the saphenous veins and an upper extremity vein such as the cephalic vein are used to meet the required length.

How long the graft remains patent is determined by several factors, including the size of the graft, graft location, and development of intimal hyperplasia at anastomosis sites. Bypass grafts may be synthetic or autologous vein. Several synthetic materials are available for use as a peripheral bypass graft: woven or knitted Dacron, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE, such as GoreTex or Impra), collagen-impregnated, and umbilical vein. Infection is a problem that threatens survival of the graft and almost always requires removal of the graft.

If a vein graft is the surgical choice, care must be taken in the operating room not to damage the vein after harvesting (removing the vein from the patient's body). The vein is occluded at one end and inflated with a heparinized solution to check for leakage and competency. When this is done, the graft is placed in a heparinized solution to keep it from becoming dry and brittle.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{MAINTAINING CIRCULATION}

The primary objective in the postoperative management of patients who have undergone vascular procedures is to maintain adequate circulation through the arterial repair. Pulses, Doppler assessment, color and temperature of the extremity, capillary refill, and sensory and motor function of the affected extremities are checked, compared with those of the other extremity, and recorded every hour for the first 8 hours and then every 2 hours for 24 hours. Doppler evaluation of the vessels distal to the bypass graft should be performed for all postoperative vascular patients, because it is more sensitive than palpation for pulses. The ABI is monitored at least once every 8 hours for the first 24 hours and then once each day until discharge (not usually assessed for pedal artery bypasses). An adequate circulating blood volume should be established and maintained. Disappearance of a pulse that was present may indicate thrombotic occlusion of the graft; the surgeon is immediately notified.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Continuous monitoring of urine output (more than $30 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour), central venous pressure, mental status, and pulse rate and volume permit early recognition and treatment of fluid imbalances. Bleeding can result from the heparin administered during surgery or from an anastomotic leak. A hematoma may form as well.

Leg crossing and prolonged extremity dependency are avoided to prevent thrombosis. Edema is a normal postoperative finding; however, elevating the extremities and encouraging the patient to exercise the extremities while in bed reduces edema. Elastic compression stockings may be prescribed for some patients, but care must be taken to avoid compressing distal vessel bypass grafts. Severe edema of the extremity, pain, and decreased sensation of toes or fingers can be an indication of compartment syndrome.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Discharge planning includes assessing the patient's ability to manage independently. The nurse determines if the patient has a network of family and friends to assist with activities of daily living. The patient may need to be encouraged to make the lifestyle changes necessary with a chronic disease, including pain management and modifications in diet, activity, and hygiene (skin care). The nurse ensures that the patient has the knowledge and ability to assess for any postoperative complications such as infection, occlusion of the artery or graft, and decreased blood flow. The nurse assists the patient in developing a plan to stop using tobacco. The Plan of Nursing Care describes nursing care for patients with peripheral vascular disease.

\section*{UPPER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL OCCLUSIVE DISEASE}

Arterial occlusions occur less frequently in the upper extremities (arms) than in the legs and cause less severe symptoms because the collateral circulation is significantly better in the arms. The arms also have less muscle mass and are not subjected to the workload of the legs.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Stenosis and occlusions in the upper extremity result from atherosclerosis or trauma. The stenosis usually occurs at the origin of
the vessel proximal to the vertebral artery, setting up the vertebral artery as the major contributor of flow. The patient may develop a "subclavian steal" syndrome characterized by reverse flow in the vertebral and basilar artery to provide blood flow to the arm. This syndrome may cause vertebrobasilar (cerebral) symptoms. Most patients are asymptomatic; however, some report vertigo, ataxia, syncope, or bilateral visual changes.

The patient typically complains of arm fatigue and pain with exercise (forearm claudication) and inability to hold or grasp objects (eg, painting, combing hair, placing objects on shelves above the head). Some even notice difficulties driving.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment findings include coolness and pallor of the affected extremity, decreased capillary refill, and a difference in arm blood pressures of more than 20 mm Hg . Noninvasive studies performed to evaluate for upper extremity arterial occlusions include upper and forearm blood pressure determinations and duplex ultrasonography to identify the anatomic location of the lesion and to evaluate the hemodynamics of the blood flow. Transcranial Doppler evaluation is performed to evaluate the intracranial circulation and to detect any siphoning of blood flow from the posterior circulation to provide blood flow to the affected arm. If a surgical or interventional procedure is planned, an arteriogram may be necessary.

\section*{Medical Management}

If a short, focal lesion is identified in an upper extremity artery, a PTA may be performed. If the lesion involves the subclavian artery with documented siphoning of blood flow from the intracranial circulation, several surgical procedures are available: carotid-to-subclavian artery bypass, axillary-to-axillary artery bypass, and autogenous reimplantation of the subclavian to the carotid artery.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing assessment involves bilateral comparison of upper arm blood pressures (obtained by stethoscope and Doppler); radial, ulnar, and brachial pulses; motor and sensory function; temperature; color changes; and capillary refill every 2 hours. Disappearance of a pulse or Doppler flow that had been present may indicate an acute occlusion of the vessel, and the physician is notified immediately.

NURSING ALERT Before and for 24 hours after surgery, the patient's arm is kept at heart level and protected from cold, venipunctures or arterial sticks, tape, and constrictive dressings.

After surgery, the arm is kept at heart level or elevated, with the fingers at the highest level. Pulses are monitored with Doppler assessment of the arterial flow every hour for 8 hours and then every 2 hours for 24 hours. Blood pressure (obtained by stethoscope and Doppler) is also assessed every hour for 8 hours and then every 2 hours for 24 hours. Motor and sensory function, warmth, color, and capillary refill are monitored with each arterial flow (pulse) assessment.

Discharge planning includes assessing the patient's ability to manage independently. The nurse determines whether the patient has a network of family and friends to assist with activities of daily living. The patient may need to be encouraged to make the lifestyle changes necessary for a chronic disease, including pain management and modifications in diet, activity, and hygiene
(skin care). The nurse ensures that the patient has the knowledge and ability to assess for any postoperative complications such as infection, reocclusion of the artery or occlusion of the graft, and decreased blood flow. The patient is assisted in developing a plan to stop using tobacco. The Plan of Nursing Care describes nursing care for patients with peripheral vascular disease.

\section*{THROMBOANGIITIS OBLITERANS (BUERGER'S DISEASE)}

Buerger's disease is characterized by recurring inflammation of the intermediate and small arteries and veins of the lower and (in rare cases) upper extremities. It results in thrombus formation and occlusion of the vessels. It is differentiated from other vessel diseases by its microscopic appearance. In contrast to atherosclerosis, Buerger's disease is believed to be an autoimmune disease that results in occlusion of distal vessels.

The cause of Buerger's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune vasculitis. It occurs most often in men between the ages of 20 and 35 years, and it has been reported in all races and in many areas of the world. There is considerable evidence that heavy smoking or chewing of tobacco is a causative or an aggravating factor (Frost-Rude et al., 2000). Generally, the lower extremities are affected, but arteries in the upper extremities or viscera can also be involved. Buerger's disease is generally bilateral and symmetric with focal lesions. Superficial thrombophlebitis may be present.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Although this condition is different from atherosclerosis, Buerger's disease in older patients may also be followed by atherosclerosis of the larger vessels after involvement of the smaller vessels. The patient's ability to walk may be severely limited. Patients are at higher risk for nonhealing wounds because of impaired circulation.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Pain is the outstanding symptom of Buerger's disease. The patient complains of foot cramps, especially of the arch (instep claudication), after exercise. The pain is relieved by rest; often, a burning pain is aggravated by emotional disturbances, nicotine, or chilling. Cold sensitivity of the Raynaud type is found in one half the patients and is frequently confined to the hands. Digital rest pain is constant, and the characteristics of the pain do not change between activity and rest.

Physical signs include intense rubor (reddish blue discoloration) of the foot and absence of the pedal pulse but with normal femoral and popliteal pulses. Radial and ulnar artery pulses are absent or diminished. Various types of paresthesia may develop.

As the disease progresses, definite redness or cyanosis of the part appears when the extremity is in a dependent position. Involvement is generally bilateral, but color changes may affect only one extremity or only certain digits. Color changes may progress to ulceration, and ulceration with gangrene eventually occurs.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Segmental limb blood pressures are taken to demonstrate the distal location of the lesions or occlusions. Duplex ultrasonography is used to document patency of the proximal vessels and to visualize the extent of distal disease. Contrast angiography is performed to demonstrate the diseased portion of the anatomy.

\section*{Management}

The treatment of Buerger's disease is essentially the same as that for atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. The main objectives are to improve circulation to the extremities, prevent the progression of the disease, and protect the extremities from trauma and infection. Treatment of ulceration and gangrene is directed toward minimizing infection and conservative débridement of necrotic tissue. Tobacco use is highly detrimental, and patients are strongly advised to stop using tobacco completely. Symptoms are often relieved by cessation of smoking and other uses of tobacco.

Vasodilators are rarely prescribed because these medications cause dilation of only healthy vessels; vasodilators may divert blood away from the partially occluded vessels, making the situation worse. A regional sympathetic block or ganglionectomy may be useful in some instances to produce vasodilation and increase blood flow.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS}

If gangrene of a toe develops as a result of arterial occlusive disease in the leg, it is unlikely that toe amputation or even transmetatarsal amputation will be sufficient; usually, a below-knee amputation or, occasionally, an above-knee amputation is necessary. The indications for amputation are worsening gangrene, especially if the infected area is moist, severe rest pain, or fulminating sepsis.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS}

If an amputation is performed, immediate postoperative care includes elevating the stump for the first 24 hours to promote venous return and minimize edema. The incision is monitored for signs of hematoma (unapproximated suture line, discoloration or ruddy color changes of the skin along the suture line, tenderness with palpation, or oozing of dark blood from the suture line). The nurse assesses the fit of the elastic bandages and ensures the integrity of the wrap and continued ability to fit two fingers between layers of the wrap. Distal skin color and warmth are assessed, if accessible, and recorded. Elastic bandages are removed and reapplied as prescribed by the surgeon (eg, every 6 hours using figure-of-eight turns).

The patient may experience grief, fear, or anxiety related to loss of the limb. The patient is encouraged to discuss his or her feelings. Spiritual advisors and other health care team members are consulted as appropriate. Recovery and rehabilitation require consultation among health care providers (eg, physicians, physical and occupational therapists, prosthetists, dietitians, nurses, discharge coordinators). The patient may decide to be fitted for and learn to use a prosthetic device. Rehabilitation facilities, home care, and outpatient therapy can assist the patient to adapt to the changes in lifestyle.

Discharge planning includes assessing the patient's ability to manage independently. The patient is assisted in developing a plan to stop using tobacco and to manage pain. The patient may need to be encouraged to make the lifestyle changes necessary with a chronic disease, including modifications in diet, activity, and hygiene (skin care). The nurse determines whether the patient has a network of family and friends to assist with activities of daily living. The nurse ensures that the patient has the knowledge and ability to assess for any postoperative complications such as infection and decreased blood flow. The Plan of Nursing Care describes nursing care for patients with peripheral vascular disease.

\section*{AORTITIS}

The aorta, which is the main trunk of the arterial system, is divided into the ascending aorta ( 5 cm [2 inches] in diameter, contained in the pericardium), the aortic arch (extending upward, backward, and downward), and the descending aorta. The thoracic aorta is above the diaphragm; the abdominal aorta is below the diaphragm. The abdominal aorta is further designated as suprarenal (above renal artery level), perirenal level (at renal artery level), and infrarenal (below renal artery level).

Aortitis is inflammation of the aorta, particularly of the aortic arch. Two types are known to occur: Takayasu's disease and syphilitic aortitis. Takayasu's disease, or occlusive thromboaortopathy, is uncommon; today, syphilitic aortitis is rare.

Takayasu's disease, a chronic inflammatory disease of the aortic arch and its branches, primarily affects young or middle-aged women and is more common in those of Asian descent. It is nonatherosclerotic; the exact pathologic mechanism is unknown but thought to be immune complex mediated. It progresses from a systemic inflammation with localized arteritis to end-organ ischemia because of large vessel stenosis or obstruction. Magnetic resonance angiography, CT, duplex ultrasonography, or arteriography is used to diagnose and evaluate the lesions, which are typically long, smooth areas of narrowing with or without aneurysms. In the early stages, the disease may respond to corticosteroids, and patients may benefit from the addition of cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents (Strider et al., 1996). Selective PTA and surgical revascularization may be performed after suppression of the systemic vascular inflammation.

\section*{AORTOILIAC DISEASE}

If collateral circulation has developed, patients with a stenosis or occlusion of the aortoiliac segment may be asymptomatic, or they may complain of buttock or low back discomfort associated with walking. Men may experience impotence. These patients may have decreased or absent femoral pulses.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment of aortoiliac disease is essentially the same as that for atherosclerotic peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The surgical procedure of choice is the aortobi iliac graft. If possible, the distal anastomosis is made to the iliac artery, and the entire surgical procedure can be performed within the abdomen. If the iliac vessels are diseased, the distal anastomosis is made to the femoral arteries (aortobifemoral graft). Bifurcated woven or knitted Dacron grafts are preferred for this surgical procedure.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Preoperative assessment, in addition to the standard parameters (see Chap. 18), includes evaluating the brachial, radial, ulnar, femoral, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses to establish a baseline for follow-up after arterial lines are placed and postoperatively. Patient teaching includes an overview of the procedure to be performed, the preparation for surgery, and the anticipated postoperative plan of care. Sights, sounds, and sensations that the patient may experience are discussed.

Postoperative care includes monitoring for signs of thrombosis in arteries distal to the surgical site. The nurse assesses color and temperature of the extremity, capillary refill time, sensory and motor function, and pulses by palpation and Doppler every hour for the first 8 hours and then every 2 hours for the first

24 hours. Any dusky or bluish discoloration, coolness, capillary refill time greater than 3 seconds, decrease in sensory or motor function, or decrease in pulse quality are reported immediately to the physician.

Postoperative care also includes monitoring for urine output greater than or equal to $30 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour. Renal function may be impaired as a result of hypoperfusion from hypotension, involvement of the renal arteries during the surgical procedure, hypovolemia, or embolization of the renal artery or renal parenchyma. Vital signs, pain, and intake and output are monitored with the pulse and extremity assessments. Results of laboratory tests are monitored and reported to the physician. Abdominal assessment for bowel sounds and paralytic ileus is performed at least every 8 hours. Bowel sounds may not return before the third postoperative day. The absence of bowel sounds, absence of flatus, and abdominal distention are indications of paralytic ileus. Manual manipulation of the bowel during surgery may have caused bruising, resulting in decreased peristalsis. Nasogastric suction may be necessary to decompress the bowel until peristalsis returns. A liquid bowel movement before the third postoperative day may indicate bowel ischemia, which may occur when the mesenteric blood supply (celiac, superior mesenteric, or inferior mesenteric arteries) is occluded. Ischemic bowel usually causes increased pain and an elevated white blood cell count ( 20,000 to 30,000 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ).

\section*{AORTIC ANEURYSM}

An aneurysm is a localized sac or dilation formed at a weak point in the wall of the aorta (Fig. 31-11). It may be classified by its shape or form. The most common forms of aneurysms are saccular or fusiform. A saccular aneurysm projects from one side of the vessel only. If an entire arterial segment becomes dilated, a fusiform aneurysm develops. Very small aneurysms due to localized infection are called mycotic aneurysms.

Historically, the cause of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the most common type of degenerative aneurysm, has been attributed to atherosclerotic changes in the aorta. Other causes of aneurysm formation are listed in Chart 31-5. Aneurysms are serious because they can rupture, leading to hemorrhage and death.

Etiologic Classification of Arterial Aneurysms
Congenital: Primary connective tissue disorders (Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and other diseases (focal medial agenesis, tuberous sclerosis, Turner's syndrome, Menkes' syndrome)
Mechanical (hemodynamic): Poststenotic and arteriovenous fistula and amputation-related
Traumatic (pseudoaneurysms): Penetrating arterial injuries, blunt arterial injuries, pseudoaneurysms
Inflammatory (noninfectious): Associated with arteritis (Takayasu's disease, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's syndrome, Kawasaki's disease) and periarterial inflammation (ie, pancreatitis)
Infectious (mycotic): Bacterial, fungal, spirochetal infections
Pregnancy-related degenerative: Nonspecific, inflammatory variant
Anastomotic (postarteriotomy) and graft aneurysms: Infection, arterial wall failure, suture failure, graft failure

\section*{THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSM}

Approximately 85\% of all cases of thoracic aortic aneurysm are caused by atherosclerosis. They occur most frequently in men between the ages 40 and 70 years. The thoracic area is the most common site for a dissecting aneurysm. About one third of patients with thoracic aneurysms die of rupture of the aneurysm (Rutherford, 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms are variable and depend on how rapidly the aneurysm dilates and how the pulsating mass affects surrounding intrathoracic structures. Some patients are asymptomatic. In most cases, pain is the most prominent symptom. The pain is usually constant and boring but may occur only when the person is supine.

\begin{figure}

(C) True aneurysm. One, two, or all three layers of the artery may be involved. (D) Fusiform aneurysm-symmetric, spindle-shaped expansion of entire circumference of involved vessel. (E) Saccular aneurysm-a bulbous protrusion of one side of the arterial wall. (F) Dissecting aneurysm-this usually is a hematoma that splits the layers of the arterial wall.}
\end{figure}

Other conspicuous symptoms are dyspnea, the result of pressure of the sac against the trachea, a main bronchus, or the lung itself; cough, frequently paroxysmal and with a brassy quality; hoarseness, stridor, or weakness or complete loss of the voice (aphonia), resulting from pressure against the left recurrent laryngeal nerve; and dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) due to impingement on the esophagus by the aneurysm.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

When large veins in the chest are compressed by the aneurysm, the superficial veins of the chest, neck, or arms become dilated, and edematous areas on the chest wall and cyanosis are often evident. Pressure against the cervical sympathetic chain can result in unequal pupils. Diagnosis of a thoracic aortic aneurysm is principally made by chest x-ray, transesophageal echocardiography, and CT .

\section*{Medical Management}

In most cases, an aneurysm is treated by surgical repair. General measures such as controlling blood pressure and correcting risk factors may be helpful. It is important to control blood pressure in patients with dissecting aneurysms. Systolic pressure is maintained at about 100 to 120 mm Hg with antihypertensive medications (eg, hydralazine hydrochloride [Hydralazine], esmolol hydrochloride [Brevibloc] or another beta-blocker such as atenolol [Tenormin] or timolol maleate [Timoptic]). Pulsatile flow is reduced by medications that reduce cardiac contractility (eg, pro-
pranolol [Inderal]). The goal of surgery is to repair the aneurysm and restore vascular continuity with a vascular graft (Fig. 31-12). Intensive monitoring is usually required after this type of surgery, and the patient is cared for in the critical care unit. Repair of thoracic aneurysms using endovascular grafts implanted (deployed) percutaneously in an interventional laboratory (eg, cardiac catheterization laboratory) may decrease postoperative recovery time and decrease complications compared with traditional surgical techniques.

\section*{ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM}

The most common cause of abdominal aortic aneurysm is atherosclerosis. The condition, which is more common among Caucasians, affects men four times more often than women and is most prevalent in elderly patients (Rutherford, 1999). Most of these aneurysms occur below the renal arteries (infrarenal aneurysms). Untreated, the eventual outcome may be rupture and death.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

All aneurysms involve a damaged media layer of the vessel. This may be caused by congenital weakness, trauma, or disease. After an aneurysm develops, it tends to enlarge. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, smoking (or other tobacco use), and hypertension; more than one half of patients with aneurysms have hypertension.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-353.jpg?height=923&width=1785&top_left_y=1495&top_left_x=197}

\end{figure}

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

About two fifths of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have symptoms; the remainder do not. Some patients complain that they can feel their heart beating in their abdomen when lying down, or they may say they feel an abdominal mass or abdominal throbbing. If the abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with thrombus, a major vessel may be occluded or smaller distal occlusions may result from emboli. A small cholesterol, platelet, or fibrin emboli may lodge in the interosseous or digital arteries, causing blue toes.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The most important diagnostic indication of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a pulsatile mass in the middle and upper abdomen. About $80 \%$ of these aneurysms can be palpated. A systolic bruit may be heard over the mass. Duplex ultrasonography or CT is used to determine the size, length, and location of the aneurysm (Fig. 31-13). When the aneurysm is small, ultrasonography is conducted at 6 -month intervals until the aneurysm reaches a size at which surgery to prevent rupture is of more benefit than the possible complications of a surgical procedure. Some aneurysms remain stable over many years of observation.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Most abdominal aneurysms occur in patients between the ages of 60 and 90 years. Rupture is likely with coexisting hypertension and with aneurysms wider than 6 cm . In most cases at this point, the chances of rupture are greater than the chance of death during surgical repair. If the elderly patient is considered at moderate risk for complications related to surgery or anesthesia, the aneurysm is not repaired until it is at least 5 cm ( 2 inches) wide.

\section*{Medical Management}

An expanding or enlarging abdominal aneurysm is likely to rupture. Surgery is the treatment of choice for abdominal aneurysms wider than 5 cm (2 inches) wide or those that are enlarging.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The standard treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair has been open surgical repair of the aneurysm by resecting the vessel

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-354.jpg?height=594&width=866&top_left_y=1896&top_left_x=109}

\end{figure}
and sewing a bypass graft in place. The mortality rate associated with elective aneurysm repair, a major surgical procedure, is reported to be $1 \%$ to $4 \%$. The prognosis for a patient with a ruptured aneurysm is poor, and surgery is performed immediately (Rutherford, 1999).

An alternative for treating an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is endovascular grafting. Endovascular grafting involves the transluminal placement and attachment of a sutureless aortic graft prosthesis across an aneurysm (Fig. 31-14). This procedure can be performed under local or regional anesthesia. Endovascular grafting of abdominal aortic aneurysms may be performed if the patient's abdominal aorta and iliac arteries are not extremely tortuous and if the aneurysm does not begin at the level of the renal arteries. Clinical trials are evaluating endograft treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms at or above the level of the renal arteries and the thoracic aorta. Potential complications include bleeding, hematoma, or wound infection at the femoral insertion site; distal ischemia or embolization; dissection or perforation of the aorta; graft thrombosis; graft infection; break of the attachment system; graft migration; proximal or distal graft leaks; delayed rupture; and bowel ischemia.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Before surgery, nursing assessment is guided by anticipating a rupture and by recognizing that the patient may have cardiovascular, cerebral, pulmonary, and renal impairment from atherosclerosis. The functional capacity of all organ systems should be assessed. Medical therapies designed to stabilize physiologic function should be promptly implemented.

Signs of impending rupture include severe back pain or abdominal pain, which may be persistent or intermittent and is often
localized in the middle or lower abdomen to the left of the midline. Low back pain may also be present because of pressure of the aneurysm on the lumbar nerves. This is a serious symptom, usually indicating that the aneurysm is expanding rapidly and is about to rupture. Indications of a rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysm include constant, intense back pain; falling blood pressure; and decreasing hematocrit. Rupture into the peritoneal cavity is rapidly fatal. A retroperitoneal rupture of an aneurysm may result in hematomas in the scrotum, perineum, flank, or penis. Signs of heart failure or a loud bruit may suggest a rupture into the vena cava. Rupture into the vena cava results in the higher-pressure arterial blood entering the lower-pressure venous system and causing turbulence, which is heard as a bruit. The high blood pressure and increased blood volume returning to the right heart from the vena cava may cause the right heart to fail. The overall surgical mortality rate associated with a ruptured aneurysm is $50 \%$ to $75 \%$.

Postoperative care requires intense monitoring of pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic status. Possible complications of surgery include arterial occlusion, hemorrhage, infection, ischemic bowel, renal failure, and impotence.

\section*{DISSECTING AORTA}

Occasionally, in an aorta diseased by arteriosclerosis, a tear develops in the intima or the media degenerates, resulting in a dissection (see Fig. 31-11).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Arterial dissections (separations) are commonly associated with poorly controlled hypertension; they are three times more common in men than in women and occur most commonly in the 50 - to 70 -year-old age group (Rutherford, 1999). Dissection is caused by rupture in the intimal layer. A rupture may occur through adventitia or into the lumen through the intima, allowing blood to reenter the main channel and resulting in chronic dissection or occlusion of branches of the aorta.

As the separation progresses, the arteries branching from the involved area of the aorta shear and occlude. The tear occurs most commonly in the region of the aortic arch, with the highest mortality rate associated with ascending aortic dissection. The dissection of the aorta may progress backward in the direction of the heart, obstructing the openings to the coronary arteries or producing hemopericardium (effusion of blood into the pericardial sac) or aortic insufficiency, or it may extend in the opposite direction, causing occlusion of the arteries supplying the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, spinal cord, and legs.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Onset of symptoms is usually sudden. Severe and persistent pain, described as tearing or ripping, may be reported. The pain is in the anterior chest or back and extends to shoulders, epigastric area, or abdomen. Aortic dissection may be mistaken for an acute myocardial infarction, which could confuse the clinical picture and initial treatment. Cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal symptoms are responsible for other clinical manifestations, depending on the location and extent of the dissection. The patient may appear pale. Sweating and tachycardia may be detected. Blood pressure may be elevated or markedly different from one arm to the other if dissection involves the orifice of the subclavian artery on one side. Because of the variable clinical picture associated with this condition, early diagnosis is usually difficult.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Arteriography, CT, transesophageal echocardiography, duplex ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging aid in the diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical or surgical treatment of a dissecting aneurysm depends on the type of dissection present and follows the general principles outlined for the treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms.

\section*{Nursing Management}

A patient with a dissecting aorta requires the same nursing care as a patient with an aortic aneurysm requiring surgical intervention, as described earlier in this chapter. Interventions described in the Plan of Nursing Care are also appropriate.

\section*{OTHER ANEURYSMS}

Aneurysms may also arise in the peripheral vessels, most often as a result of atherosclerosis. These may involve such vessels as the subclavian artery, renal artery, femoral artery, or (most frequently) popliteal artery. Between $50 \%$ and $60 \%$ of popliteal aneurysms are bilateral and may be associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms.

The aneurysm produces a pulsating mass and disturbs peripheral circulation distal to it. Pain and swelling develop because of pressure on adjacent nerves and veins. Diagnosis is made by duplex ultrasonography and CT to determine the size, length, and extent of the aneurysm. Arteriography may be performed to evaluate the level of proximal and distal involvement.

Surgical repair is performed with replacement grafts or endovascular repair using a stent-graft or wall graft, which is a Dacron or PTFE (polytetrafluroethylene) graft with external structures made from a variety of materials (nitinol, titanium, stainless steel) for additional support.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient who has had an endovascular repair must lie supine for 6 hours; the head of the bed may be elevated up to 45 degrees after 2 hours. The patient needs to use a bedpan or urinal while on bed rest, or a Foley catheter may be used. Vital signs and Doppler assessment of peripheral pulses are performed every 15 minutes for four times, then every 30 minutes for four times, then every hour for four times, and then as directed by the physician or unit standards. The catheterization site is assessed when vital signs and pulses are monitored. The nurse assesses for bleeding, swelling, pain, and hematoma formation. Any changes in vital signs, pulse quality, bleeding, swelling, pain, or hematoma are reported to the physician. The physician is also notified of persistent coughing, sneezing, vomiting, or systolic blood pressure above 180 mm Hg because of the increased risk for hemorrhage. Most patients are able to resume their preprocedure diet and are encouraged to drink fluids. An intravenous infusion may be continued until the patient is able to drink normally. Fluids are important to maintain blood flow through the arterial repair site and to assist the kidneys with excreting intravenous contrast agent and other medications used during the procedure. Six hours after the procedure, the patient may be able to roll side to side and may be able to ambulate with assistance to the bathroom. After the patient is able to
take adequate fluids orally, the intravenous infusion may be discontinued and the intravenous access converted to a saline lock.

\section*{ARTERIAL EMBOLISM AND ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS}

Acute vascular occlusion may be caused by an embolus or acute thrombosis. Acute arterial occlusions may result from iatrogenic injury, which can occur during insertion of invasive catheters such as those used for arteriography, PTA or stent placement, or an intra-aortic balloon pump. Other causes include trauma from a fracture, crush injury, and penetrating wounds that disrupt the arterial intima. The accurate diagnosis of an arterial occlusion as embolic or thrombotic in origin is necessary to initiate appropriate treatment.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Arterial emboli arise most commonly from thrombi that develop in the chambers of the heart as a result of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, infective endocarditis, or chronic heart failure. These thrombi become detached and are carried from the left side of the heart into the arterial system, where they lodge in and obstruct an artery that is smaller than the embolus. Emboli may also develop in advanced aortic atherosclerosis because the atheromatous plaques ulcerate or become rough. Acute thrombosis frequently occurs in patients with preexisting ischemic symptoms.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms of arterial emboli depend primarily on the size of the embolus, the organ involved, and the state of the collateral vessels. The immediate effect is cessation of distal blood flow. The blockage can progress above and below the obstruction. Secondary vasospasm can contribute to the ischemia. The embolus can fragment or break apart, resulting in occlusion of distal vessels. Emboli tend to lodge at arterial bifurcations and areas narrowed by atherosclerosis. Cerebral, mesenteric, renal, and coronary arteries are often involved in addition to the large arteries of the extremities.

The symptoms of acute arterial embolism in extremities with poor collateral flow are acute, severe pain and a gradual loss of sensory and motor function. The six $P_{s}$ associated with acute arterial embolism are pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, poikilothermia (coldness), and paralysis. Eventually, superficial veins may collapse because of decreased blood flow to the extremity. The part of the extremity below the occlusion is markedly colder and paler than the part above the occlusion because of ischemia.

Arterial thrombosis can also acutely occlude an artery. A thrombosis is a slowly developing clot that usually occurs where the arterial wall has become damaged, generally as a result of atherosclerosis. Thrombi may also develop in an arterial aneurysm. The manifestations of an acute thrombotic arterial occlusion are similar to those described for embolic occlusion. However, treatment is more difficult with a thrombus because the arterial occlusion has occurred in a degenerated vessel and requires more extensive reconstructive surgery to restore flow than is required with an embolic event.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

An arterial embolus is usually diagnosed on the basis of the sudden nature of the onset of symptoms and an apparent source for the embolus. Two-dimensional echocardiography or transesophageal
echocardiography, chest x-ray, and electrocardiography may reveal underlying cardiac disease. Noninvasive duplex and Doppler ultrasonography can determine the presence and extent of underlying atherosclerosis, and arteriography may be performed.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of arterial thrombosis depends on its cause. Management of acute embolic occlusion usually requires surgery because time is of the essence. Because the onset of the event is acute, collateral circulation has not developed, and the patient quickly moves through the list of six $P_{s}$ to paralysis, which is the most advanced stage. Heparin therapy is initiated immediately to prevent further development of emboli and to hamper the extension of existing thrombi. Typically, an initial bolus of 5,000 to 10,000 units is administered intravenously, followed by a continuous infusion of 1,000 units per hour until the patient is able to undergo surgery.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Emergency embolectomy is the procedure of choice only if the involved extremity is viable (Fig. 31-15). Arterial emboli are usually treated by insertion of an embolectomy catheter. The catheter is passed through a groin incision into the affected artery and advanced past the occlusion. The balloon is inflated with sterile saline solution, and the thrombus is extracted as the catheter is withdrawn. This procedure involves incising the vessel and removing the clot.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

When the patient has collateral circulation, treatment may include intravenous anticoagulation with heparin, which can prevent the thrombus from spreading and reduce muscle necrosis. The use of intra-arterial thrombolytic medications helps to dissolve the embolus. Fibrin-specific thrombolytic medications (eg, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA, alteplase, Activase] and single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator [scu-PA, pro-urokinase]) avoid systemic depletion of circulating fibrinogen and plasminogen, which prevents the development of systemic fibrinolysis.

The deflated balloon-tipped catheter is advanced past the embolus, inflated and then gently withdrawn, carrying the embolic material with it. Adapted with permission from Rutherford, R. B. (1999). Vascular surgery: Vol. 1 and 2 (5th ed.). Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders.

Other thrombolytic medications are reteplase (r-PA, Retavase), tenecteplase (TNKase), and staphylokinase (Moore, 2002). Although these agents differ in their pharmacokinetics, they are administered in a similar manner. A catheter is advanced under x-ray visualization to the clot, and the thrombolytic agent is infused.

Thrombolytic therapy should not be used when there are known contraindications to therapy or when the extremity cannot tolerate the several additional hours of ischemia that it takes for the agent to lyse (disintegrate) the clot. Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy include active internal bleeding, CVA (brain attack, stroke), recent major surgery, uncontrolled hypertension, and pregnancy.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Before surgery, the patient remains on bed rest with the extremity level or slightly dependent ( 15 degrees). The affected part is kept at room temperature and protected from trauma. Heating and cooling pads are contraindicated because ischemic extremities are easily traumatized by alterations in temperature. If possible, tape and electrocardiogram electrodes should not be used on the extremity; sheepskin and foot cradles are used to protect the leg from mechanical trauma.

If the patient is treated with thrombolytic therapy, she or he is accurately weighed in kilograms, and the dose of thrombolytic therapy is determined based on the patient's weight. The patient is admitted to a critical care unit for continuous monitoring. Vital signs are taken every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours, and then every hour for 16 hours. Bleeding is the most common side effect of thrombolytic therapy, and the patient is closely monitored for any signs of bleeding. The nurse also minimizes the number of punctures for inserting intravenous lines, avoids intramuscular injections, prevents any possible tissue trauma, and applies pressure at least twice as long as usual after any puncture that is performed. If $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$ is used for the treatment, heparin is usually administered to prevent another thrombus from forming at the site of the lesion. The $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$ activates plasminogen on the thrombus more than circulating plasminogen, but it does not decrease the clotting factors as much as other thrombolytic therapies, so patients receiving t-PA are able to make new thrombi more easily than with some of the other thrombolytics.

During the postoperative period, the nurse collaborates with the surgeon about the patient's appropriate activity level based on the patient's condition. Generally, every effort is made to encourage the patient to move the leg to stimulate circulation and prevent stasis. Anticoagulant therapy may be continued after surgery to prevent thrombosis of the affected artery and to diminish the development of subsequent thrombi at the initiating site. The nurse assesses for evidence of local and systemic hemorrhage, including mental status changes, which can occur when anticoagulants are administered. Pulses, Doppler signals, ABI, and motor and sensory function are assessed every hour for the first 24 hours, because significant changes may indicate reocclusion. Metabolic abnormalities, renal failure, and compartment syndrome may be complications after an acute arterial occlusion.

\section*{RAYNAUD'S DISEASE}

Raynaud's disease is a form of intermittent arteriolar vasoconstriction that results in coldness, pain, and pallor of the fingertips or toes. The cause is unknown, although many patients with the disease seem to have immunologic disorders. Symptoms may re-
sult from a defect in basal heat production that eventually decreases the ability of cutaneous vessels to dilate. Episodes may be triggered by emotional factors or by unusual sensitivity to cold. The disease is most common in women between 16 and 40 years of age, and it occurs more frequently in cold climates and during the winter.

The term Raynaud's phenomenon is used to refer to localized, intermittent episodes of vasoconstriction of small arteries of the feet and hands that cause color and temperature changes. Generally unilateral and affecting only one or two digits, the phenomenon is always associated with underlying systemic disease. It may occur with scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, obstructive arterial disease, or trauma.

The prognosis for Raynaud's disease varies; some patients slowly improve, some become progressively worse, and others show no change. Ulceration and gangrene are rare; however, chronic disease may cause atrophy of the skin and muscles. With appropriate patient teaching and lifestyle modifications, the disorder is generally benign and self-limiting.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The classic clinical picture reveals pallor brought on by sudden vasoconstriction. The skin then becomes bluish (cyanotic) due to pooling of deoxygenated blood during vasospasm. As a result of exaggerated reflow (hyperemia) due to vasodilation, a red color is produced (rubor) when oxygenated blood returns to the digits after the vasospasm stops. The characteristic sequence of color change of Raynaud's phenomenon is described as white, blue, and red. Numbness, tingling, and burning pain occur as the color changes. The involvement tends to be bilateral and symmetric.

\section*{Medical Management}

Avoiding the particular stimuli (eg, cold, tobacco) that provoke vasoconstriction is a primary factor in controlling Raynaud's disease. Calcium channel blockers may be effective in relieving symptoms. Studies indicate that nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat) is an effective calcium channel blocker for treating an acute episode of vasospasm (Kaufman et al., 1996). Sympathectomy (interrupting the sympathetic nerves by removing the sympathetic ganglia or dividing their branches) may help some patients.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse teaches patients to avoid situations that may be stressful or unsafe. Stress management classes may be helpful. Exposure to cold must be minimized, and in areas where the fall and winter months are cold, the patient should remain indoors as much as possible and wear layers of clothing when outdoors. Hats and mittens or gloves should be worn at all times when outside. Fabrics specially designed for cold climates (eg, Thinsulate) are recommended. Patients should warm up their vehicles before getting in so that they can avoid touching a cold steering wheel or door handle, which could elicit an attack. During summer, a sweater should be available when entering air-conditioned rooms.

Concerns about serious complications, such as gangrene and amputation, are common among patients. However, these consequences are uncommon. Patients should avoid all forms of nicotine; the nicotine gum or patches used to help people quit smoking may induce attacks.

Patients should be careful about safety. Sharp objects should be handled carefully to avoid injuring the fingers. Patients should be informed about the postural hypotension that may result
from medications, such as calcium channel blockers, used to treat Raynaud's disease. The nurse also discusses safety precautions related to alcohol, exercise, and hot weather.

\section*{Management of Venous Disorders}

\section*{VENOUS THROMBOSIS, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (DVT), THROMBOPHLEBITIS, AND PHLEBOTHROMBOSIS}

Although the terms venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombophlebitis, and phlebothrombosis do not necessarily reflect identical disease processes, for clinical purposes, they are often used interchangeably.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Superficial veins, such as the greater saphenous, lesser saphenous, cephalic, basilic, and external jugular veins, are thick-walled muscular structures that lie just under the skin. Deep veins are thin walled and have less muscle in the media. They run parallel to arteries and bear the same names as the arteries. Deep and superficial veins have valves that permit unidirectional flow back to the heart. The valves lie at the base of a segment of the vein that is expanded into a sinus. This arrangement permits the valves to open without coming into contact with the wall of the vein, permitting rapid closure when the blood starts to flow backward. Other kinds of veins are known as perforating veins. These vessels have valves that allow one-way blood flow from the superficial system to the deep system.

Although the exact cause of venous thrombosis remains unclear, three factors, known as Virchow's triad, are believed to play a significant role in its development: stasis of blood (venous stasis), vessel wall injury, and altered blood coagulation (Chart 316). At least two of the factors seem to be necessary for thrombosis to occur. Venous stasis occurs when blood flow is reduced, as in heart failure or shock; when veins are dilated, as with some medication therapies; and when skeletal muscle contraction is reduced, as in immobility, paralysis of the extremities, or anesthesia. Moreover, bed rest reduces blood flow in the legs by at least $50 \%$. Damage to the intimal lining of blood vessels creates a site for clot formation. Direct trauma to the vessels, as with fractures or dislocation, diseases of the veins, and chemical irritation of the vein from intravenous medications or solutions, can damage veins. Increased blood coagulability occurs most commonly in patients who have been abruptly withdrawn from anticoagulant medications. Oral contraceptive use and several blood dyscrasias (abnormalities) also can lead to hypercoagulability.

Formation of a thrombus frequently accompanies thrombophlebitis, which is an inflammation of the vein walls. When a thrombus develops initially in the veins as a result of stasis or hypercoagulability but without inflammation, the process is referred to as phlebothrombosis. Venous thrombosis can occur in any vein but occurs more in the veins of the lower extremities. The superficial and deep veins of the extremities may be affected.

Upper extremity venous thrombosis is not as common as lower extremity thrombosis. However, upper extremity venous thrombosis is more common in patients with intravenous catheters or in patients with an underlying disease that causes hypercoagulability. Internal trauma to the vessels may result from pacemaker leads, chemotherapy ports, dialysis catheters, or parenteral nutri-

tion lines. The lumen of the vein may be decreased as a result of the catheter or from external compression, such as by neoplasms or an extra cervical rib. Effort thrombosis of the upper extremity is caused by repetitive motion, such as experienced by competitive swimmers, tennis players, and construction workers, that irritates the vessel wall, causing inflammation and subsequent thrombosis.

Venous thrombi are aggregates of platelets attached to the vein wall, along with a tail-like appendage containing fibrin, white blood cells, and many red blood cells. The "tail" can grow or can propagate in the direction of blood flow as successive layers of the thrombus form. A propagating venous thrombosis is dangerous because parts of the thrombus can break off and produce an embolic occlusion of the pulmonary blood vessels. Fragmentation of the thrombus can occur spontaneously as it dissolves naturally, or it can occur in association with an elevation in venous pressure, as occurs when a person stands suddenly or engages in muscular activity after prolonged inactivity. After an episode of acute deep vein thrombosis, recanalization of the lumen typically occurs. The time required for complete recanalization is an important determinant of venous valvular incompetence, which is one complication of venous thrombosis (Meissner et al., 2000). Other complications of venous thrombosis are listed in Chart 31-7.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

A major problem associated with recognizing deep vein thrombosis is that the signs and symptoms are nonspecific. The exception is phlegmasia cerulea dolens (massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis), in which the entire extremity becomes massively swollen, tense, painful, and cool to the touch. Despite this variability, clinical signs should always be investigated.

\section*{DEEP VEINS}

With obstruction of the deep veins comes edema and swelling of the extremity because the outflow of venous blood is inhibited.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-359.jpg?height=570&width=861&top_left_y=194&top_left_x=205)

The amount of swelling can be determined by measuring the circumference of the affected extremity at various levels with a tape measure and comparing one extremity with the other at the same level to determine size differences. If both extremities are swollen, a size difference may be difficult to detect. The affected extremity may feel warmer than the unaffected extremity, and the superficial veins may appear more prominent.

Tenderness, which usually occurs later, is produced by inflammation of the vein wall and can be detected by gently palpating the affected extremity. Homans' sign (pain in the calf after the foot is sharply dorsiflexed) is not specific for deep vein thrombosis because it can be elicited in any painful condition of the calf. In some cases, signs of a pulmonary embolus are the first indication of deep vein thrombosis.

\section*{SUPERFICIAL VEINS}

Thrombosis of superficial veins produces pain or tenderness, redness, and warmth in the involved area. The risk of the superficial venous thrombi becoming dislodged or fragmenting into emboli is very low because most of them dissolve spontaneously. This condition can be treated at home with bed rest, elevation of the leg, analgesics, and possibly anti-inflammatory medication.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Careful assessment is invaluable in detecting early signs of venous disorders of the lower extremities. Patients with a history of varicose veins, hypercoagulation, neoplastic disease, cardiovascular disease, or recent major surgery or injury are at high risk. Other patients at high risk include those who are obese or elderly and women taking oral contraceptives.

When performing the nursing assessment, key concerns include limb pain, a feeling of heaviness, functional impairment, ankle engorgement, and edema; differences in leg circumference bilaterally from thigh to ankle; increase in the surface temperature of the leg, particularly the calf or ankle; and areas of tenderness or superficial thrombosis (ie, cordlike venous segment). Homans' sign (pain in the calf as the foot is sharply dorsiflexed) has been used historically to assess for DVT. It is not a reliable or valid sign for DVT and has no clinical value in the assessment of a patient for DVT.

\section*{Prevention}

Venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, and DVT can be prevented, especially if patients who are considered at high risk are identified and preventive measures are instituted without delay.

Preventive measures include the application of elastic compression stockings, the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices, and special body positioning and exercise (discussed later in the section on nursing management). A further method to prevent venous thrombosis in surgical patients is administration of subcutaneous unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment for deep vein thrombosis are to prevent the thrombus from growing and fragmenting (risking pulmonary embolism) and to prevent recurrent thromboemboli. Anticoagulant therapy (administration of a medication to delay the clotting time of blood, prevent the formation of a thrombus in postoperative patients, and forestall the extension of a thrombus after it has formed) can meet these objectives, although anticoagulants cannot dissolve a thrombus that has already formed.

\section*{ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY}

Measures for preventing or reducing blood clotting within the vascular system are indicated in patients with thrombophlebitis, recurrent embolus formation, and persistent leg edema from heart failure. They are also indicated in elderly patients with a hip fracture that may result in lengthy immobilization.

Unfractionated Heparin. Unfractionated heparin (heparin) is administered subcutaneously to prevent development of deep vein thrombosis, or by intermittent intravenous infusion or continuous infusion for 5 to 7 days to prevent the extension of a thrombus and the development of new thrombi. Oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin (Coumadin), are administered with heparin therapy. Medication dosage is regulated by monitoring the partial thromboplastin time, the international normalized ratio (INR), and the platelet count.

Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin. Subcutaneous low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) is an effective treatment for some cases of deep vein thrombosis. It has a longer half-life than unfractionated heparin, so doses can be given in one or two subcutaneous injections each day. Doses are adjusted according to weight. LMWH prevents the extension of a thrombus and development of new thrombi and is associated with fewer bleeding complications than unfractionated heparin. Because there are several preparations, the dosing schedule must be based on the product used and the protocol at each institution. The cost is higher than for unfractionated heparin; however, LMWH may be used safely in pregnant women, and the patients may be more mobile and have an improved quality of life.

Thrombolytic Therapy. Unlike the heparins, thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy causes the thrombus to lyse and dissolve in 50\% of patients. Thrombolytic therapy (eg, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA, alteplase, Activase], reteplase [r-PA, Retavase], tenecteplase [TNKase], staphylokinase, urokinase, streptokinase) is given within the first 3 days after acute thrombosis. Therapy initiated beyond 5 days after the onset of symptoms is significantly less effective (Moore, 2002). The advantages of thrombolytic therapy include less long-term damage to the venous valves and a reduced incidence of postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous insufficiency. However, thrombolytic therapy results in approximately a threefold greater incidence of bleeding than heparin. If bleeding occurs and cannot be stopped, the thrombolytic agent is discontinued.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgery is necessary for deep vein thrombosis when anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Chart 31-8), the danger of pulmonary embolism is extreme, or the venous drainage is so severely compromised that permanent damage to the extremity will probably result. A thrombectomy (removal of the thrombosis) is the procedure of choice. A vena cava filter may be placed at the time of the thrombectomy; this filter traps large emboli and prevents pulmonary emboli (see Chap. 23).

\section*{Nursing Management}

If the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, the nurse must frequently monitor the partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, hemoglobin and hematocrit values, platelet count, and fibrinogen level. Close observation is also required to detect bleeding; if bleeding occurs, it must be reported immediately and anticoagulant therapy discontinued.

\section*{ASSESSING AND MONITORING ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY}

To prevent inadvertent infusion of large volumes of heparin, which could cause hemorrhage, continuous intravenous infusion by electronic infusion device is the preferred method of administering unfractionated heparin. Dosage calculations are based on the patient's weight, and any possible bleeding tendencies are detected by a pretreatment clotting profile. If renal insufficiency exists, lower doses of heparin are required. Periodic coagulation tests and hematocrit levels are obtained. Heparin is in the effective, or therapeutic, range when the partial thromboplastin time is 1.5 times the control.

Intermittent intravenous injection is another means of administering heparin; a dilute solution of heparin is administered every 4 hours. Administration may be facilitated by using a heparin lock, an intravenous catheter or a small, butterfly-type scalp vein needle with an injection site at the end of the tubing.

Oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, are monitored by the prothrombin time or INR. Because their effect is delayed for 3 to
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-360.jpg?height=890&width=866&top_left_y=1720&top_left_x=109)

5 days, they are usually administered with heparin until desired anticoagulation has been achieved (ie, when the prothrombin time is 1.5 to 2 times normal or the INR is 2.0 to 3.0 ).

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Bleeding. The principal complication of anticoagulant therapy is spontaneous bleeding anywhere in the body. Bleeding from the kidneys is detected by microscopic examination of the urine and is often the first sign of anticoagulant toxicity from excessive dosage. Bruises, nosebleeds, and bleeding gums are also early signs. To reverse the effects of heparin promptly, intravenous injections of protamine sulfate may be administered. Reversing the effects of warfarin, a coumarin derivative, is more difficult, but effective measures that may be prescribed include vitamin K and possibly transfusion of fresh frozen plasma.

Thrombocytopenia. Another complication of therapy may be heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (decrease in platelets), which may develop in patients who receive heparin for more than 5 days or on readministration after a brief interruption of heparin therapy. Beginning warfarin concomitantly with heparin can provide a stable INR or prothrombin time by day 5 of heparin treatment.

The use of LMWH is less frequently associated with heparininduced thrombocytopenia. The thrombocytopenia is thought to result from an immunologic mechanism that causes aggregation of platelets. This serious complication results in thromboembolic manifestations, and the prognosis is extremely guarded.

Prevention of thrombocytopenia depends on regular monitoring of platelet counts. Early signs of thrombocytopenia are a falling platelet count to less than $100,000 / \mathrm{mL}$, a decrease in platelet count exceeding 25\% at one time, the need for increasing doses of heparin to maintain the therapeutic level, thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications, and a history of heparin sensitivity (Stevens, 2000). If thrombocytopenia does occur, platelet aggregation studies are conducted, the heparin is discontinued, and protamine sulfate is administered to reverse heparin's effects.

Drug Interactions. Because oral anticoagulants interact with many other medications and herbal and nutritional supplements, close monitoring of the patient's medication schedule is necessary. Medications and supplements that potentiate oral anticoagulants include salicylates, anabolic steroids, chloral hydrate, glucagon, chloramphenicol, neomycin, quinidine, phenylbutazone (Butazolidin), coenzyme Q10, dong quai, garlic, gingko, ginseng, green tea, and vitamin E; those that decrease the anticoagulant effect include phenytoin, barbiturates, diuretics, estrogen, and vitamin C . It is advisable to identify medication interactions for patients taking specific oral anticoagulants. Contraindications to anticoagulant therapy are summarized in Chart 31-8.

\section*{PROVIDING COMFORT}

Bed rest, elevation of the affected extremity, elastic compression stockings, and analgesics for pain relief are adjuncts to therapy. They help to improve circulation and increase comfort. Depending on the extent and location of a venous thrombosis, bed rest may be required for 5 to 7 days after diagnosis. This is approximately the time necessary for the thrombus to adhere to the vein wall, preventing embolization.

Warm, moist packs applied to the affected extremity reduce the discomfort associated with deep vein thrombosis, as do mild analgesics prescribed for pain control. When the patient begins to ambulate, elastic compression stockings are used. Walking is
better than standing or sitting for long periods. Bed exercises, such as dorsiflexion of the foot, are also recommended.

\section*{APPLYING ELASTIC COMPRESSION STOCKINGS}

Elastic compression stockings usually are prescribed for patients with venous insufficiency. These stockings exert a sustained, evenly distributed pressure over the entire surface of the calves, reducing the caliber of the superficial veins in the legs and resulting in increased flow in the deeper veins. The stockings may be knee-high, thigh-high, or panty hose. Thigh-high stockings are difficult for the patient to wear, because they have a tendency to roll down. The roll of the stocking further restricts blood flow rather than the stocking providing evenly distributed pressure over the thigh.

NURSING ALERT Any type of stocking, including the elastic type, can inadvertently become a tourniquet if applied incorrectly (ie, rolled tightly at the top). In such instances, the stockings produce stasis rather than prevent it. For ambulatory patients, elastic compression stockings are removed at night and reapplied before the legs are lowered from the bed to the floor in the morning.

When the stockings are off, the skin is inspected for signs of irritation, and the calves are examined for possible tenderness. Any skin changes or signs of tenderness are reported. Stockings are contraindicated in patients with severe pitting edema because they can produce severe pitting at the knee.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Because of decreased strength and manual dexterity, elderly patients may be unable to apply elastic compression stockings properly. If such is the case, a family member or friend should be taught to assist the patient to apply the stockings so that they do not cause undue pressure on any part of the feet or legs.

\section*{USING INTERMITTENT PNEUMATIC COMPRESSION DEVICES}

These devices can be used with elastic compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis. They consist of an electric controller that is attached by air hoses to plastic knee-high or thighhigh sleeves. The leg sleeves are divided into compartments, which sequentially fill to apply pressure to the ankle, calf, and thigh at 35 to 55 mm Hg of pressure. These devices can increase blood velocity beyond that produced by the stockings. Nursing measures include ensuring that prescribed pressures are not exceeded and assessing for patient comfort.

\section*{POSITIONING THE BODY AND ENCOURAGING EXERCISE}

When the patient is on bed rest, the feet and lower legs should be elevated periodically above the level of the heart. This position allows the superficial and tibial veins to empty rapidly and to remain collapsed. Active and passive leg exercises, particularly those involving calf muscles, should be performed to increase venous flow. Early ambulation is most effective in preventing venous stasis. Deep-breathing exercises are beneficial because they produce increased negative pressure in the thorax, which assists in emptying the large veins. Once ambulatory, patients are instructed to avoid sitting for more than 2 hours at a time. The goal is to walk at least 10 minutes every 1 to 2 hours. Patients are also instructed to perform active and passive leg exercises when they are not able to ambulate as frequently as necessary, such as during long car, train, and plane trips.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

In addition to teaching the patient how to apply elastic compression stockings and explaining the importance of elevating the legs and exercising adequately, the nurse teaches about the medication, its purpose, and the need to take the correct amount at the specific times prescribed (Chart 31-9). The patient should also be aware that blood tests are scheduled periodically to determine whether a change in medication or dosage is required. If the patient fails to adhere to the therapeutic regimen, continuation of the medication therapy should be questioned. A person who refuses to discontinue the use of alcohol should not receive anticoagulants because chronic alcohol use decreases their effectiveness. In patients with liver problems, the potential for bleeding may be exacerbated by anticoagulant therapy.

\section*{CHRONIC VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY}

Venous insufficiency results from obstruction of the venous valves in the legs or a reflux of blood back through the valves. Superficial and deep leg veins can be involved. Resultant venous hypertension can occur whenever there has been a prolonged increase in venous pressure, such as occurs with deep venous thrombosis. Because the walls of veins are thinner and more elastic than
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-361.jpg?height=129&width=175&top_left_y=1140&top_left_x=1121)

\section*{Chart 31-9 • PATIENT EDUCATION Taking Anticoagulant Medications}
- Take the anticoagulant at the same time each day, usually between 8:00 and 9:00 AM.
- Wear or carry identification indicating the anticoagulant being taken.
- Keep all appointments for blood tests.
- Because other medications affect the action of the anticoagulant, do not take any of the following medications or supplements without consulting with the primary health care provider: vitamins, cold medicines, antibiotics, aspirin, mineral oil, and anti-inflammatory agents, such as ibuprofen (Motrin) and similar medications or herbal or nutritional supplements. The primary health care provider should be contacted before taking any over-the-counter drugs.
- Avoid alcohol, because it may change the body's response to an anticoagulant.
- Avoid food fads, crash diets, or marked changes in eating habits.
- Do not take warfarin (Coumadin) unless directed.
- Do not stop taking Coumadin (when prescribed) unless directed.
- When seeking treatment from physician, a dentist, a podiatrist, or another health care provider, be sure to inform the caregiver that you are taking an anticoagulant.
- Contact your primary health care provider before having dental work or elective surgery.
- If any of the following signs appear, report them immediately to the primary health care provider:

Faintness, dizziness, or increased weakness
Severe headaches or abdominal pain
Reddish or brownish urine
Any bleeding-for example, cuts that do not stop bleeding
Bruises that enlarge, nosebleeds, or unusual bleeding from any part of the body
Red or black bowel movements
Rash
- Avoid injury that can cause bleeding.
- For women: Notify the primary health care provider if you suspect pregnancy.
the walls of arteries, they distend readily when venous pressure is consistently elevated. In this state, leaflets of the venous valves are stretched and prevented from closing completely, allowing a backflow or reflux of blood in the veins. Duplex ultrasonography confirms the obstruction and identifies the level of valvular incompetence.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

When the valves in the deep veins become incompetent after a thrombus has formed, postthrombotic syndrome may develop (Fig. 31-16). This disorder is characterized by chronic venous stasis, resulting in edema, altered pigmentation, pain, and stasis dermatitis. The patient may notice the symptoms less in the morning and more in the evening. Obstruction or poor calf muscle pumping in addition to valvular reflux must be present for the development of severe postthrombotic syndrome, which includes stasis ulceration (Caps et al., 1999). Superficial veins may be dilated. The disorder is long-standing, difficult to treat, and often disabling.

Stasis ulcers develop as a result of the rupture of small skin veins and subsequent ulcerations. When these vessels rupture, red blood cells escape into surrounding tissues and then degenerate, leaving a brownish discoloration of the tissues. The pigmentation and ulcerations usually occur in the lower part of the extremity, in the area of the medial malleolus of the ankle. The skin becomes dry, cracks, and itches; subcutaneous tissues fibrose and atrophy. The risk of injury and infection of the extremities is increased.

\section*{Complications}

Venous ulceration is the most serious complication of chronic venous insufficiency and can be associated with other conditions affecting the circulation of the lower extremities. Cellulitis or dermatitis may complicate the care of chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulcerations.

\section*{Management}

Management of the patient with venous insufficiency is directed at reducing venous stasis and preventing ulcerations. Measures that increase venous blood flow are antigravity activities, such as elevating the leg, and compression of superficial veins with elastic compression stockings.

\caption{FIGURE 31-16 Competent valves showing blood flow patterns when the valve is open (A) and closed (B), allowing blood to flow against gravity. (C) With faulty or incompetent valves, the blood is unable to move toward the heart.}
\end{figure}

Elevating the legs decreases edema, promotes venous return, and provides symptomatic relief. The legs should be elevated frequently throughout the day (at least 15 to 30 minutes every 2 hours). At night, the patient should sleep with the foot of the bed elevated about 15 cm ( 6 inches). Prolonged sitting or standing still is detrimental; walking should be encouraged. When sitting, the patient should avoid placing pressure on the popliteal spaces, as occurs when crossing the legs or sitting with the legs dangling over the side of the bed. Constricting garments such as panty girdles or tight socks should be avoided.

Compression of the legs with elastic compression stockings reduces the pooling of venous blood and enhances venous return to the heart. Elastic compression stockings are recommended for people with venous insufficiency. The stocking should fit so that pressure is greater at the foot and ankle and then gradually declines to a lesser pressure at the knee or groin. If the top of the stocking is too tight or becomes twisted, a tourniquet effect is created, which worsens venous pooling. Stockings should be applied after the legs have been elevated for a period, when the amount of blood in the leg veins is at its lowest.

Extremities with venous insufficiency must be carefully protected from trauma; the skin is kept clean, dry, and soft. Signs of ulceration are immediately reported to the health care provider for treatment and follow-up.

\section*{LEG ULCERS}

A leg ulcer is an excavation of the skin surface that occurs when inflamed necrotic tissue sloughs off. About $75 \%$ of all leg ulcers result from chronic venous insufficiency. Lesions due to arterial insufficiency account for approximately $20 \%$; the remaining 5\% are caused by burns, sickle cell anemia, and other factors (Gloviczki \& Yao, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Inadequate exchange of oxygen and other nutrients in the tissue is the metabolic abnormality that underlies the development of leg ulcers. When cellular metabolism cannot maintain energy balance, cell death (necrosis) results. Alterations in blood vessels at the arterial, capillary, and venous levels may affect cellular processes and lead to the formation of ulcers.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical appearance and associated characteristics of leg ulcers are determined by the cause of the ulcer. Most ulcers, especially in an elderly patient, have more than one cause. The symptoms depend on whether the problem is arterial or venous in origin (see Table 31-2). The severity of the symptoms depends on the extent and duration of the vascular insufficiency. The ulcer itself appears as an open, inflamed sore. The area may be draining or covered by eschar (dark, hard crust).

\section*{ARTERIAL ULCERS}

Chronic arterial disease is characterized by intermittent claudication, which is pain caused by activity and relieved after a few minutes of rest. The patient may also complain of digital or forefoot pain at rest. If the onset of arterial occlusion is acute, ischemic pain is unrelenting and rarely relieved even with opioid analgesics. Typically, arterial ulcers are small, circular, deep ulcerations on the tips of toes or in the web spaces between toes. Ulcers often occur on the medial side of the hallux or lateral fifth toe and may be caused by a combination of ischemia and pressure (Fig. 31-17).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-363.jpg?height=1243&width=872&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=200}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 31-17 (A) Ulcers resulting from arterial emboli. (B) Gangrene of the toes resulting from severe arterial ischemia. (C) Ulcer from venous stasis.}
\end{figure}

Arterial insufficiency may result in gangrene of the toe (digital gangrene), which usually is caused by trauma. The toe is stubbed and then turns black (see Fig. 31-17). Usually, patients with this problem are elderly people without adequate circulation to provide revascularization. Débridement is contraindicated in these instances. Although the toe is gangrenous, it is dry. Managing dry gangrene is preferable to débriding the toe and causing an open wound that will not heal because of insufficient circulation. If the toe were to be amputated, the lack of adequate circulation would prevent healing and might make further amputation necessary-a below-knee or an above-knee amputation. A higherlevel amputation in the elderly could result in a loss of independence and possibly institutional care. Dry gangrene of the toe in an elderly person with poor circulation is usually left undisturbed. The nurse keeps the toe clean and dry until it separates (without creating an open wound).

\section*{VENOUS ULCERS}

Chronic venous insufficiency is characterized by pain described as aching or heaviness. The foot and ankle may be edematous. Ulcerations are in the area of the medial or lateral malleolus (gaiter area) and are typically large, superficial, and highly exudative. Venous hypertension causes extravasation of blood, which discolors the gaiter area (see Fig. 31-17). Patients with neuropathy frequently have ulcerations on the side of the foot over the metatarsal heads. These ulcers are painless and are described in further detail in Chapter 41.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Because ulcers have many causes, the cause of each ulcer needs to be identified so appropriate therapy can be prescribed. The history of the condition is important in determining venous or arterial insufficiency. The pulses of the lower extremities (femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis) are carefully examined. More conclusive diagnostic aids are Doppler and duplex ultrasound studies, arteriography, and venography. Cultures of the ulcer bed may be necessary to determine whether the infecting agent is the primary cause of the ulcer.

\section*{Medical Management}

Patients with ulcers can be effectively managed by advanced practice nurses or certified wound care nurses in collaboration with physicians. All ulcers have the potential to become infected.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Antibiotic therapy is prescribed when the ulcer is infected; the specific antibiotic is selected on the basis of culture and sensitivity test results. Oral antibiotics usually are prescribed because topical antibiotics have not proven to be effective for leg ulcers.

\section*{DÉBRIDEMENT}

To promote healing, the wound is kept clean of drainage and necrotic tissue. The usual method is to flush the area with normal saline solution. If this is unsuccessful, débridement may be necessary. Débridement is the removal of nonviable tissue from wounds. Removing the dead tissue is important, particularly in instances of infection. Débridement can be accomplished by several different methods:
- Sharp surgical débridement is the fastest method and can be performed by a physician, skilled advanced practice nurse, or certified wound care nurse in collaboration with the physician.
- Nonselective débridement can be accomplished by applying isotonic saline dressings of fine-mesh gauze to the ulcer. When the dressing dries, it is removed (dry), along with the debris adhering to the gauze. Pain management is usually necessary.
- Enzymatic débridement with the application of enzyme ointments may be prescribed to treat the ulcer. The ointment is applied to the lesion but not to normal surrounding skin. Most enzymatic ointments are covered with saline-soaked gauze that has been thoroughly wrung out. A dry gauze dressing and a loose bandage are then applied. The enzymatic ointment is discontinued when the necrotic tissue has been débrided and an appropriate wound dressing is applied.
- Débriding agents can be used. Dextranomer (Debrisan) beads are small, highly porous, spherical beads ( 0.1 to 0.3 mm in diameter) that can absorb wound secretions. Bacteria and the products of tissue necrosis and protein degradation are absorbed into the bead layer. When the beads are saturated, they take on a grayish yellow color, at which point their cleansing action stops. They are then flushed from the wound with normal saline, and a fresh layer is applied.
- Calcium alginate dressings can also be used for débridement when absorption of exudate is needed. These dressings are changed when the exudate seeps through the cover dressing or at least every 7 days. The dressing can also be used on areas that are bleeding, because the material helps stop the bleeding. As the dry fibers absorb exudate, they become a gel that is painlessly removed from the ulcer bed. Calcium alginate dressings should not be used on dry or nonexudative wounds.

\section*{TOPICAL THERAPY}

A variety of topical agents can be used in conjunction with cleansing and débridement therapies to promote healing of leg ulcers. The goals of treatment are to remove devitalized tissue and to keep the ulcer clean and moist while healing takes place. The treatment should not destroy developing tissue. For topical treatments to be successful, adequate nutritional therapy must be maintained.

\section*{WOUND DRESSING}

After the circulatory status has been assessed and determined to be adequate for healing (ABI of more than 0.5 ), surgical dressings can be used to promote a moist environment. The simplest method is to use a wound contact material (eg, Tegapore) next to the wound bed and cover it with gauze. Tegapore maintains a moist environment, can be left in place for several days, and does not disrupt the capillary bed when removed for evaluation. Hydrocolloids (eg, Comfeel, DuoDerm CGF, Restore, Tegasorb) are also available options to promote granulation tissue and reepithelialization. They also provide a barrier for protection because they adhere to the wound bed and surrounding tissue. However, deep wounds and infected wounds are often more appropriately treated with other dressings.

Knowledge deficit, frustration, fear, and depression can result in the patient's and family's decreased compliance with the prescribed therapy; therefore, patient and family education is necessary before beginning and throughout the wound care program.

\section*{STIMULATED HEALING}

Tissue-engineered human skin equivalent along with therapeutic compression has been developed by Apligraf; it is a skin product cultured from human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. When applied, it seems to react to factors in the wound and may interact with the patient's cells to stimulate the production of growth factors. Application is not difficult, no suturing is involved, and the procedure is painless.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WHO HAS LEG ULCERS}

\section*{Assessment}

A careful nursing history and assessment of symptoms are important. The extent and type of pain are carefully assessed, as are the appearance and temperature of the skin of both legs. The quality of all peripheral pulses is assessed, and comparisons are made of the pulses in both legs. The legs are checked for edema. If the extremity is edematous, the degree of edema is determined. Any limitation of mobility and activity that results from the vascular insufficiency is identified. The patient's nutritional status is assessed, and a history of diabetes, collagen disease, or varicose veins is obtained.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include:
- Impaired skin integrity related to vascular insufficiency
- Impaired physical mobility related to activity restrictions of the therapeutic regimen and pain
- Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements, related to increased need for nutrients that promote wound healing

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Infection
- Gangrene

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include restoration of skin integrity, improved physical mobility, adequate nutrition, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The nursing challenge in caring for these patients is great, whether the patient is in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home. The physical problem is often a long-term one that causes a substantial drain on the patient's physical, emotional, and economic resources.

\section*{RESTORING SKIN INTEGRITY}

To promote wound healing, measures are used to keep the area clean. Cleansing requires very gentle handling, a mild soap, and lukewarm water. Positioning of the legs depends on whether the ulcer is of arterial or venous origin. If there is arterial insufficiency, the patient should be referred to be evaluated for vascular reconstruction. If there is venous insufficiency, dependent edema can be avoided by elevating the lower extremities. A decrease in edema promotes the exchange of cellular nutrients and waste products in the area of the ulcer, promoting healing.

Avoiding trauma to the lower extremities is imperative in promoting skin integrity. Protective boots may be used (eg, the Rooke Vascular boot, Lunax Boot, Bunny Boot); they are soft and provide warmth and protection from injury. If the patient is on bed rest, it is important to relieve pressure on the heels to prevent pressure ulcerations. When the patient is in bed, a bed cradle can be used to relieve pressure from bed linens and to prevent anything from touching the legs. When the patient is ambulatory, all obstacles are moved from the patient's path so that the patient's legs will not be bumped. Heating pads, hot-water bottles, or hot baths are avoided. Heat increases the oxygen demands and thus the blood flow demands of the tissue, which in this case are already compromised. The patient with diabetes mellitus suffers from neuropathy with decreased sensation, and heating pads may produce injury before the patient is aware of being burned.

\section*{IMPROVING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Generally, physical activity is initially restricted to promote healing. When infection resolves and healing begins, ambulation should resume gradually and progressively. Activity promotes arterial flow and venous return and is encouraged after the acute phase of the ulcer process. Until full activity resumes, the patient is encouraged to move about when in bed, to turn from side to side frequently, and to exercise the upper extremities to maintain muscle tone and strength. Meanwhile, diversional activities that interest the patient are encouraged. Consultation with an occupational therapist may be helpful if a prolonged period of limited mobility and activity is anticipated.

If pain limits the patient's activity, analgesics may be prescribed by the physician. The pain of peripheral vascular disease, whether it is arterial or venous, is typically chronic. Analgesics may be taken before scheduled activities to help the patient participate more comfortably.

\section*{PROMOTING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Nutritional deficiencies are determined from the patient's report of usual dietary intake. Alterations in the diet are made to remedy these deficiencies. A diet that is high in protein, vitamins C and A, iron, and zinc is encouraged in an attempt to promote healing.

Many patients with peripheral vascular disease are elderly. Their caloric intake may need to be adjusted because of their decreased metabolic rate and level of activity. Particular consideration should also be given to their iron intake, because many elderly people are anemic.

After a diet plan has been developed that meets the patient's nutritional needs and promotes healing, diet instruction is provided to the patient and family. The nurse and patient design the diet plan to be compatible with the lifestyle and preferences of the patient and family.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

The self-care program is planned with the patient so that activities to promote arterial and venous circulation, relieve pain, and promote tissue integrity will be used. Reasons for each aspect of the program are explained to the patient and family. Leg ulcers are often chronic and difficult to heal; they frequently recur, even when patients rigorously follow the plan of care. Long-term care of the feet and legs to promote healing of wounds and prevent recurrence of ulcerations is the primary goal. Leg ulcers increase the patient's risk for infection, may be painful, and limit mobility, necessitating life-style changes. Participation of family members and home-health providers may be necessary for treatments such as dressing changes, reassessments, and evaluation of the plan of care. Regular follow-up with a primary health care provider is necessary.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{VARICOSE VEINS}

Varicose veins (varicosities) are abnormally dilated, tortuous, superficial veins caused by incompetent venous valves (see Fig. 31-16). Most commonly, this condition occurs in the lower extremities, the saphenous veins, or the lower trunk; however, it can occur elsewhere in the body, such as esophageal varices (see Chap. 39).

It is estimated that varicose veins occur in up to $60 \%$ of the adult population in the United States, with an increased incidence correlated with increased age (Johnson, 1997). The condition is most common in women and in people whose occupations require prolonged standing, such as salespeople, hair stylists, teach-
ers, nurses, ancillary medical personnel, and construction workers. A hereditary weakness of the vein wall may contribute to the development of varicosities, and it is not uncommon to see this condition occur in several members of the same family. Varicose veins are rare before puberty. Pregnancy may cause varicosities. The leg veins dilate during pregnancy because of hormonal effects related to distensibility, increased pressure by the gravid uterus, and increased blood volume which all contribute to the development of varicose veins (Johnson, 1997).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Varicose veins may be considered primary (without involvement of deep veins) or secondary (resulting from obstruction of deep veins). A reflux of venous blood in the veins results in venous stasis. If only the superficial veins are affected, the person may have no symptoms but may be troubled by the appearance of the dilated veins.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms, if present, may take the form of dull aches, muscle cramps, and increased muscle fatigue in the lower legs. Ankle edema and a feeling of heaviness of the legs may occur. Nocturnal cramps are common. When deep venous obstruction results in varicose veins, patients may develop the signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency: edema, pain, pigmentation, and ulcerations. Susceptibility to injury and infection is increased.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic tests for varicose veins include the duplex scan, which documents the anatomic site of reflux and provides a quantitative measure of the severity of valvular reflux. Air plethysmography measures the changes in venous blood volume. Venography is not routinely performed to evaluate for valvular reflux. When it is used, however, it involves injecting an x-ray contrast agent into the leg veins so that the vein anatomy can be visualized by x-ray studies during various leg movements.

\section*{Prevention}

The patient should avoid activities that cause venous stasis, such as wearing tight socks or a constricting panty girdle, crossing the legs at the thighs, and sitting or standing for long periods. Changing position frequently, elevating the legs when they are tired, and getting up to walk for several minutes of every hour promote circulation. The patient should be encouraged to walk 1 or 2 miles each day if there are no contraindications. Walking up the stairs rather than using the elevator or escalator is helpful in promoting circulation. Swimming is also good exercise for the legs.

Elastic compression stockings, especially knee-high stockings, are useful. Patients are more likely to use knee-high stockings than thigh-high stockings. The overweight patient should be encouraged to begin a weight-reduction plan.

\section*{Medical Management}

Surgery for varicose veins requires that the deep veins be patent and functional. The saphenous vein is ligated and divided. The vein is ligated high in the groin, where the saphenous vein meets the femoral vein. Additionally, the vein may be removed (stripped). After the vein is ligated, an incision is made in the ankle, and a
metal or plastic wire is passed the full length of the vein to the point of ligation. The wire is then withdrawn, pulling (removing, "stripping") the vein as it is removed (Fig. 31-18). Pressure and elevation keep bleeding at a minimum during surgery.

\section*{SCLEROTHERAPY}

In sclerotherapy, a chemical is injected into the vein, irritating the venous endothelium and producing localized phlebitis and fibrosis, thereby obliterating the lumen of the vein. This treatment may be performed alone for small varicosities or may follow vein ligation or stripping. Sclerosing is palliative rather than curative. After the sclerosing agent is injected, elastic compression bandages are applied to the leg and are worn for approximately 5 days. The health care provider who performed sclerotherapy removes the first bandages. Elastic compression stockings are then worn for an additional 5 weeks.

After sclerotherapy, patients are encouraged to perform walking activities as prescribed to maintain blood flow in the leg. Walking enhances dilution of the sclerosing agent.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Surgery can be performed in an outpatient setting, or patients can be admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery and discharged the next day, but nursing measures are the same as if the patient were hospitalized. Bed rest is maintained for 24 hours, after which the patient begins walking every 2 hours for 5 to 10 minutes. Elastic compression stockings are used to maintain compression of the leg. They are worn continuously for about 1 week after vein stripping. The nurse assists the patient to perform exercises and move the legs. The foot of the bed should be elevated. Standing still and sitting are discouraged.

\section*{PROMOTING COMFORT AND UNDERSTANDING}

Analgesics are prescribed to help patients move affected extremities more comfortably. Dressings are inspected for bleeding, particularly at the groin, where the risk of bleeding is greatest. The nurse is alert for reported sensations of "pins and needles." Hyper-
sensitivity to touch in the involved extremity may indicate a temporary or permanent nerve injury resulting from surgery, because the saphenous vein and nerve are close to each other in the leg.

Usually, the patient may shower after the first 24 hours. The patient is instructed to dry the incisions well with a clean towel using a patting technique rather than rubbing. Application of skin lotion is to be avoided until the incisions are completely healed to decrease the chance of developing an infection.

If the patient underwent sclerotherapy, a burning sensation in the injected leg may be experienced for 1 or 2 days. The nurse may encourage the use of a mild analgesic (eg, propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen [Darvocet N ], oxycodone and acetaminophen [Percocet], oxycodone and acetylsalicylic acid [Percodan]) as prescribed by a physician or nurse practitioner and walking to provide relief.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Patients require long-term elastic support of the leg after discharge, and plans are made to obtain adequate supplies of elastic compression stockings or bandages as appropriate. Exercises of the legs are necessary; the development of an individualized plan requires consultation with the patient and the health care team.

\section*{Cellulitis}

\section*{Pathophysiology and Clinical Manifestations}

Cellulitis is the most common infectious cause of limb swelling. Cellulitis can occur as a single isolated event or a series of recurrent events. It is often misdiagnosed, usually as recurrent thrombophlebitis or chronic venous insufficiency. Cellulitis occurs when an entry point through normal skin barriers allows bacteria to enter and release their toxins in the subcutaneous tissues. The acute onset of swelling, localized redness, and pain is frequently associated with systemic signs of fever, chills, and sweating. The redness may not be uniform and often skips areas. Regional lymph nodes may also be tender and enlarged.

\end{figure}

\section*{Medical Management}

Mild cases of cellulitis can be treated on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotic therapy. If the cellulitis is severe, the patient is hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics for at least 7 to 14 days. The key to preventing recurrent episodes of cellulitis lies in adequate antibiotic therapy for the initial event and in identifying the site of the bacterial entry. The most commonly overlooked areas are the cracks and fissures that occur in the skin between the toes. Other possible locations are drug use injection sites, contusions, abrasions, ulcerations, ingrown toenails, and hangnails.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient is instructed to elevate the affected area above heart level and apply warm, moist packs to the site every 2 to 4 hours. Individuals with sensory and circulatory deficits, such as diabetes and paralysis, should use caution when applying warm packs because burns may occur; it is advisable to use a thermometer or have a caregiver ensure that the temperature is not more than lukewarm. Education should focus on preventing a recurrent episode. The patient with peripheral vascular disease or diabetes mellitus should receive education or re-education about skin and foot care.

\section*{Management of Lymphatic Disorders}

The lymphatic system consists of a set of vessels that spread throughout most of the body. These vessels start as lymph capillaries that drain unabsorbed plasma from the interstitial spaces (spaces between the cells). The lymphatic capillaries unite to form the lymph vessels, which pass through the lymph nodes and then empty into the large thoracic duct that joins the jugular vein on the left side of the neck.

The fluid drained from the interstitial space by the lymphatic system is called lymph. The flow of lymph depends on the intrinsic contractions of the lymph vessels, the contraction of muscles, respiratory movements, and gravity. The lymphatic system of the abdominal cavity maintains a steady flow of digested fatty food (chyle) from the intestinal mucosa to the thoracic duct. In other parts of the body, the lymphatic system's function is regional; the lymphatic vessels of the head, for example, empty into clusters of lymph nodes located in the neck, and those of the extremities empty into nodes of the axillae and the groin.

\section*{LYMPHANGITIS AND LYMPHADENITIS}

Lymphangitis is an acute inflammation of the lymphatic channels. It arises most commonly from a focus of infection in an extremity. Usually, the infectious organism is a hemolytic Streptococcus. The characteristic red streaks that extend up the arm or the leg from an infected wound outline the course of the lymphatic vessels as they drain.

The lymph nodes located along the course of the lymphatic channels also become enlarged, red, and tender (acute lymphadenitis). They can also become necrotic and form an abscess (suppurative lymphadenitis). The nodes involved most often are those in the groin, axilla, or cervical region.

Because these infections are nearly always caused by organisms that are sensitive to antibiotics, it is unusual to see abscess formation. Recurrent episodes of lymphangitis are often associated with progressive lymphedema. After acute attacks, an elastic compres-
sion stocking or sleeve should be worn on the affected extremity for several months to prevent long-term edema.

\section*{LYMPHEDEMA AND ELEPHANTIASIS}

Lymphedemas are classified as primary (congenital malformations) or secondary (acquired obstructions). Tissue swelling occurs in the extremities because of an increased quantity of lymph that results from obstruction of lymphatic vessels. It is especially marked when the extremity is in a dependent position. Initially, the edema is soft, pitting, and relieved by treatment. As the condition progresses, the edema becomes firm, nonpitting, and unresponsive to treatment. The most common type is congenital lymphedema (lymphedema praecox), which is caused by hypoplasia of the lymphatic system of the lower extremity. This disorder is usually seen in women and first appears between ages 15 and 25.

The obstruction may be in the lymph nodes and the lymphatic vessels. Sometimes, it is seen in the arm after an axillary node dissection (eg, for breast cancer) and in the leg in association with varicose veins or chronic thrombophlebitis. In the latter case, the lymphatic obstruction usually is caused by chronic lymphangitis. Lymphatic obstruction caused by a parasite (filaria) is seen frequently in the tropics. When chronic swelling is present, there may be frequent bouts of acute infection characterized by high fever and chills and increased residual edema after the inflammation has resolved. These lead to chronic fibrosis, thickening of the subcutaneous tissues, and hypertrophy of the skin. This condition, in which chronic swelling of the extremity recedes only slightly with elevation, is referred to as elephantiasis.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of therapy is to reduce and control the edema and prevent infection. Active and passive exercises assist in moving lymphatic fluid into the bloodstream. External compression devices milk the fluid proximally from the foot to the hip or from the hand to the axilla. When the patient is ambulatory, custom-fitted elastic compression stockings or sleeves are worn; those with the highest compression strength (exceeding 40 mm Hg ) are required. When the leg is affected, strict bed rest with the leg elevated may aid in mobilizing the fluids.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

As initial therapy, the diuretic furosemide (Lasix) is prescribed as needed to prevent the fluid overload that can result from the mobilization of extracellular fluid. Diuretics have also been used palliatively for lymphedema in conjunction with elevating the leg and wearing elastic compression stockings or sleeves. However, the use of diuretics alone has little benefit because their main action is to limit capillary filtration by decreasing the circulating blood volume. If lymphangitis or cellulitis is present, antibiotic therapy is initiated. The patient is taught to inspect the skin for evidence of infection.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgery is performed if the edema is severe and uncontrolled by medical therapy, if mobility is severely compromised, or if infection persists. One surgical approach involves the excision of the affected subcutaneous tissue and fascia, with skin grafting to cover the defect. Another procedure involves the surgical relocation of superficial lymphatic vessels into the deep lymphatic system by means of a buried dermal flap to provide a conduit for lymphatic drainage.

\section*{Nursing Management}

After surgery, the management of skin grafts and flaps is the same as when these therapies are used for other conditions. Prophylactic antibiotics may be prescribed for 5 to 7 days. Constant elevation of the affected extremity and observations for complications are essential. Complications may include flap necrosis, hematoma or abscess under the flap, and cellulitis. The nurse instructs the patient or caregiver to inspect the dressing daily. Unusual drainage or any inflammation around the wound margin may suggest infection and should be reported to the physician. The patient is informed that there may be a loss of sensation in the skin graft area. The patient is also instructed to avoid the application of heating pads or exposure to sun to prevent burns or trauma to the area.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your patient has been diagnosed with an enlarging $a b-$ dominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The physician gives the patient two surgical options: repair of the AAA using an endovascular graft or open surgical repair. What factors would you include in discussing the surgical options, postoperative care, continuing care, and home care? If the patient is taking warfarin (Coumadin) for atrial fibrillation and insulin for diabetes, how would you incorporate these factors into the plan of care?
2. Your 96-year-old patient presents with a 1-year history of experiencing symptoms of claudication after walking four or five blocks. The patient lives alone, six blocks from the local shopping area, and no longer drives a vehicle. The patient does not wish to undergo surgery at this time and wants to continue living at his current location. What options would you discuss with the patient? If this patient also had a nonhealing foot wound and had smoked two packs of cigarettes each day for the past 80 years, how would your plan of care change?
3. Your patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of a calf. The physician gives the patient two treatment options: hospitalization with intravenous sodium heparin therapy or home treatment with LMWH. What factors would you include in discussing the treatment options with the patient?

\title{
Assessment and Management of Patients With Hypertension
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Define blood pressure and identify risk factors for hypertension.
2. Explain the difference between normal blood pressure and hypertension and discuss the significance of hypertension.
3. Describe the treatment approach for hypertension, including lifestyle changes and medication therapy.
4. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with hypertension.
5. Describe the necessity for immediate treatment of hypertensive crisis.

Blood pressure is the product of cardiac output multiplied by peripheral resistance. Cardiac output is the product of the heart rate multiplied by the stroke volume. In normal circulation, pressure is exerted by the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels. High blood pressure, known as hypertension, can result from a change in cardiac output, a change in peripheral resistance, or both. The medications used for treating hypertension decrease peripheral resistance, blood volume, or the strength and rate of myocardial contraction.

\section*{Hypertension Defined}

Hypertension is a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mm Hg over a sustained period, based on the average of two or more blood pressure measurements taken in two or more contacts with the health care provider after an initial screening (Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure [JNC VI], 1997). Table 32-1 shows the categories of blood pressure established in 1997 by the JNC VI. The classification shows the direct relation between the risk of morbidity and mortality from hypertension and the level of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The higher the systolic or diastolic pressure, the greater the risk.

Three stages ( 1,2 , and 3 ) of hypertension are defined by the JNC VI, which used these terms, similar to those used to describe cancer progression, so that the public and health care professionals would be aware that sustained elevations in blood pressure are associated with increased risks to health. Even within the normotensive range, three levels of blood pressureoptimal, normal, and high-normal-were specified to emphasize that the lower the blood pressure, the lower the risk. The JNC VI also developed recommendations for follow-up monitoring according to initial blood pressure readings at the time of diagnosis (Table 32-2).

\section*{Primary Hypertension}

Between $20 \%$ and $25 \%$ of the adult population in the United States has hypertension (Burt et al., 1995b). Of this population, between $90 \%$ and $95 \%$ have primary hypertension, meaning that the reason for the elevation in blood pressure cannot be identified. The remaining 5\% to 10\% of this group have high blood pressure related to specific causes, such as narrowing of the renal arteries, renal parenchymal disease, hyperaldosteronism (mineralocorticoid hypertension) certain medications, pregnancy, and coarctation of the aorta (Kaplan, 2001). Secondary hypertension

*Not taking antihypertensive drugs and not acutely ill. When systolic and diastolic blood pressures fall into different categories, the higher category should be selected to classify the individual's blood pressure status. For example, $160 / 92 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ should be classified as stage 2 hypertension, and $174 / 120 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ should be classified as stage 3 hypertension. Isolated systolic hypertension is defined as SPP of 140 mm Hg or greater and DBP below 90 mm Hg and staged appropriately (eg, $170 / 82 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ is defined as stage 2 isolated systolic hypertension). In addition to classifying stages of hypertension on the basis of average blood pressure levels, clinicians should specify presence or absence of target organ disease and additional risk factors. This specificity is important for risk classification and treatment.

is the term used to signify high blood pressure from an identified cause.

Hypertension is sometimes called "the silent killer" because people who have it are often symptom free. In a national survey (1991 to 1994), $32 \%$ of people who had pressures exceeding $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ were unaware of their elevated blood pressure (Burt et al., 1995a). Once identified, elevated blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals because hypertension is a lifelong condition.

Hypertension often accompanies risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease, such as dyslipidemia (abnormal blood fat levels) and diabetes mellitus. The incidence of hypertension is higher in the southeastern United States, particularly among African Americans. Cigarette smoking does not cause high blood pressure; however, if a person with hypertension smokes, his or her risk of dying from heart disease or related disorders increases significantly.

High blood pressure can be viewed in three ways: as a sign, a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or a disease.
dyslipidemia: abnormally high or low blood lipid levels
hypertensive emergency: a situation in which blood pressure must be lowered immediately to prevent damage to target organs
hypertensive urgency: a situation in which blood pressure must be lowered within a few hours to prevent damage to target organs

Findings and recommendations of JNC VI are contained in an extensive report published in 1997. monotherapy: medication therapy with a single medication
primary hypertension: also called essential hypertension; denotes high blood pressure from an unidentified cause
rebound hypertension: pressure that is controlled with therapy and that becomes uncontrolled (abnormally high) with the discontinuation of therapy

As a sign, nurses and other health care professionals use blood pressure to monitor a patient's clinical status. Elevated pressure may indicate an excessive dose of vasoconstrictive medication or other problems. As a risk factor, hypertension contributes to the rate at which atherosclerotic plaque accumulates within arterial walls. As a disease, hypertension is a major contributor to death from cardiac, renal, and peripheral vascular disease.

Prolonged blood pressure elevation eventually damages blood vessels throughout the body, particularly in target organs such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. The usual consequences of prolonged, uncontrolled hypertension are myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal failure, strokes, and impaired vision. The left ventricle of the heart may become enlarged (left ventricular hypertrophy) as it works to pump blood against the elevated pressure. An echocardiogram is the recommended method of determining whether hypertrophy (enlargement) has occurred.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Although the precise cause for most cases of hypertension cannot be identified, it is understood that hypertension is a multifactorial condition. Because hypertension is a sign, it is most likely to have many causes, just as fever has many causes. For hypertension to occur, there must be a change in one or more factors affecting peripheral resistance or cardiac output (some of these factors are outlined in Fig. 32-1). In addition, there must also be a problem with the control systems that monitor or regulate pressure. Single gene mutations have been identified for a few rare types of hypertension, but most types of high blood pressure are thought to be polygenic (mutations in more than one gene) (Dominiczak et al., 2000).

Several hypotheses about the pathophysiologic bases of elevated blood pressure are associated with the concept of hypertension as a multifactorial condition. Given the overlap among these hypotheses, it is likely that aspects of all of them will eventually prove correct. Hypertension may be caused by one or more of the following:
- Increased sympathetic nervous system activity related to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system
- Increased renal reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water related to a genetic variation in the pathways by which the kidneys handle sodium
- Increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in expansion of extracellular fluid volume and increased systemic vascular resistance
- Decreased vasodilation of the arterioles related to dysfunction of the vascular endothelium
- Resistance to insulin action, which may be a common factor linking hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and glucose intolerance

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Structural and functional changes in the heart and blood vessels contribute to increases in blood pressure that occur with age. The changes include accumulation of atherosclerotic plaque, fragmentation of arterial elastins, increased collagen deposits, and impaired vasodilation. The result of these changes is a decrease in the elasticity of the major blood vessels. Consequently, the aorta and large arteries are less able to accommodate the volume of blood pumped out by the heart (stroke volume), and the energy that would have stretched the vessels instead elevates the systolic blood pressure. Isolated systolic hypertension is more common in older adults.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Physical examination may reveal no abnormalities other than high blood pressure. Occasionally, retinal changes such as hemorrhages, exudates (fluid accumulation), arteriolar narrowing, and cottonwool spots (small infarctions) occur. In severe hypertension, papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) may be seen. People with hypertension can be asymptomatic and remain so for many years. However, when specific signs and symptoms appear, they usually indicate vascular damage, with specific manifestations related to the organs served by the involved vessels. Coronary artery disease with angina or myocardial infarction is a common consequence of hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy occurs in response to the increased workload placed on the ventricle as it contracts against higher systemic pressure. When heart damage is extensive, heart failure ensues. Pathologic changes in the kidneys (indicated by increased blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and creatinine levels) may manifest as nocturia. Cerebrovascular involvement may lead to a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), manifested by alterations in vision or speech, dizziness, weakness, a sudden fall, or temporary paralysis on one side (hemiplegia). Cerebral infarctions account for most of the strokes and TIAs in patients with hypertension.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation}

A thorough health history and physical examination are necessary. The retinas are examined, and laboratory studies are performed to assess possible target organ damage. Routine laboratory tests include urinalysis, blood chemistry (ie, analysis of sodium, potassium, creatinine, fasting glucose, and total and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol levels), and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. Left ventricular hypertrophy can be assessed by echocardiography. Renal damage may be suggested by elevations in BUN and creatinine levels or by microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Additional studies, such as creatinine clearance, renin level, urine tests, and 24 -hour urine protein, may be performed.

FIGURE 32-1 Factors involved in control of blood pressure, which is cardiac output multiplied by peripheral resistance. Adapted from Kaplan, N. M., Lieberman, E., \& Neal, W. (2002). Kaplan's clinical hypertension (8th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.

A risk factor assessment, as advocated by the JNC VI, is needed to classify and guide treatment of hypertensive people at risk for cardiovascular damage. Risk factors and cardiovascular problems related to hypertension are presented in Chart 32-1 and Table 32-3.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of hypertension treatment is to prevent death and complications by achieving and maintaining the arterial blood pressure at $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ or lower. The JNC VI specified a lower goal pressure of $130 / 85 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ for people with diabetes mellitus or with proteinuria greater than 1 g per 24 hours (JNC VI, 1997). The optimal management plan is inexpensive, simple, and causes the least possible disruption in the patient's life.

The management options for hypertension are summarized in the treatment algorithm issued in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (1997) (Fig. 32-2) and in Chart 32-2, which lists recommended lifestyle modifications. The clinician uses the algorithm in conjunction with the risk factor assessment data and the patient's blood pressure category to choose the initial and subsequent treatment plans for patients. Research findings demonstrate that weight loss, reduced alcohol and sodium intake, and regular physical activity are effective life-
style adaptations to reduce blood pressure (Appel et al., 1997; Cushman et al., 1998; Hagberg et al., 2000; Sacks et al., 2001). Studies show that diets high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat diary products can prevent the development of hypertension and can lower elevated pressures. Table 32-4 delineates the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

For patients with uncomplicated hypertension and no specific indications for another medication, the recommended initial medications include diuretics, beta-blockers, or both. Patients are first given low doses of medication. If blood pressure does not fall to less than $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the dose is increased gradually, and additional medications are included as necessary to achieve control. Table 32-5 describes the various pharmacologic agents used in treating hypertension. When the blood pressure has been less than $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ for at least 1 year, gradual reduction of the types and doses of medication is recommended. To promote compliance, clinicians try to prescribe the simplest treatment schedule possible, ideally one pill once each day.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Hypertension, particularly elevated systolic blood pressure, increases the risk of death and complications in elderly patients. Treatment reduces this risk. Like younger patients, elderly patients should begin treatment with lifestyle modifications. If medications are needed to achieve the blood pressure goal of less than $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the starting dose should be one-half that used in younger patients.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH HYPERTENSION}

\section*{Assessment}

When hypertension is initially detected, nursing assessment involves carefully monitoring the blood pressure at frequent intervals and then, after diagnosis, at routinely scheduled intervals. The American Heart Association and the American Society of Hypertension have defined the standards for blood pressure measurement, in-
cluding conditions required before measurements are made, equipment specifications, and techniques for measuring blood pressure to obtain accurate and reliable readings (Chart 32-3) (American Society of Hypertension, 1992; Perloff et al., 1993) When the patient begins an antihypertensive treatment regimen, blood pressure assessments are needed to determine the effectiveness of medication therapy and to detect any changes in blood pressure that indicate the need for a change in the treatment plan.

A complete history is obtained to assess for symptoms that indicate target organ damage (whether other body systems have been affected by the elevated blood pressure). Such symptoms may include anginal pain; shortness of breath; alterations in speech, vision, or balance; nosebleeds; headaches; dizziness; or nocturia.

During the physical examination, the nurse must also pay specific attention to the rate, rhythm, and character of the apical and peripheral pulses to detect effects of hypertension on the heart and blood vessels. A thorough assessment can yield valuable information about the extent to which the hypertension has affected the body and about any other personal, social, or financial factors related to the condition.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, nursing diagnoses for the patient may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge regarding the relation between the treatment regimen and control of the disease process
- Noncompliance with therapeutic regimen related to side effects of prescribed therapy

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Left ventricular hypertrophy
- Myocardial infarction
- Heart failure
- TIAs
- Cerebrovascular accident (stroke or brain attack)

\section*{Lifestyle Modifications for Hypertension Prevention and Management}
- Lose weight if overweight.
- Limit alcohol intake to no more than $1 \mathrm{oz}(30 \mathrm{~mL})$ ethanol (eg, 24 oz [ 720 mL ] beer, 10 oz [ 300 mL ] wine, or 2 oz [ 60 mL ] 100-proof whiskey) per day or $0.5 \mathrm{oz}(15 \mathrm{~mL})$ ethanol per day for women and lighter weight people.
- Increase aerobic physical activity (30 to 45 minutes most days of the week).
- Reduce sodium intake to no more than 100 mmol per day ( 2.4 g sodium or 6 g sodium chloride).
- Maintain adequate intake of dietary potassium (approximately 90 mmol per day).
- Maintain adequate intake of dietary calcium and magnesium for general health.
- Stop smoking and reduce intake of dietary saturated fat and cholesterol for overall cardiovascular health.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The objective of nursing care for hypertensive patients focuses on lowering and controlling the blood pressure without adverse effects and without undue cost. To achieve these goals, the nurse must support and teach the patient to adhere to the treatment regimen by implementing necessary lifestyle changes, taking medications as prescribed, and scheduling regular follow-up appointments with the health care provider to monitor progress or identify and treat any complications of disease or therapy.

\section*{INCREASING KNOWLEDGE}

The patient needs to understand the disease process and how lifestyle changes and medications can control hypertension. The nurse needs to emphasize the concept of controlling hypertension rather than curing it. The nurse can encourage the patient to consult a dietitian to help develop a plan for weight loss. The program usually consists of restricting sodium and fat intake, increasing intake of fruits and vegetables, and implementing regular physical activity. Explaining that it takes 2 to 3 months for the taste buds to adapt to changes in salt intake may help the patient adjust to reduced salt intake. The patient should be advised to limit alcohol

intake (see Chart 32-2 for specific recommendations), and tobacco should be avoided-not because smoking is related to hypertension, but because anyone with high blood pressure is already at increased risk for heart disease, and smoking amplifies this risk. Support groups for weight control, smoking cessation, and stress reduction may be beneficial for some patients; others can benefit from the support of family and friends. The nurse assists the patient to develop and adhere to an appropriate exercise regimen, because regular activity is a significant factor in weight reduction and a blood pressure-reducing intervention in the absence of any loss in weight (Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 1997).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Blood pressure screenings with the sole purpose of case finding are not recommended by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program because approximately $70 \%$ of persons with hypertension are already aware of their blood pressure levels (JNC VI, 1997). If asked to participate in a blood pressure screening, the nurse should be sure that proper blood pressure measurement technique is being used (see Chart 32-3), that the manometers used are calibrated (Perloff et al., 1993), and that provision has been made to provide follow-up for any person identified as having an elevated blood pressure. Adequate time should also be allowed to teach people what the blood pressure numbers mean. Each person
should be given a written record of his or her blood pressure at the screening.

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The therapeutic regimen is the responsibility of the patient in collaboration with the health care provider. Education about high blood pressure and how to manage it, including medications, lifestyle changes of diet, weight control, and exercise (see Table 32-2), setting goal blood pressures, and assistance with social support, can help the patient achieve blood pressure control. Involving family members in education programs enables them to support the patient's efforts to control hypertension. The American Heart Association and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute provide printed and electronic patient education materials.

Written information about the expected effects and side effects of medications is important. When side effects occur, patients need to understand the importance of reporting them and to whom they should be reported. Patients need to be informed that rebound hypertension can occur if antihypertensive medications are suddenly stopped. Female and male patients should be informed that some medications, such as beta-blockers, may cause sexual dysfunction and that, if a problem with sexual function or satisfaction occurs, other medications are available. The nurse can encourage and teach patients to measure their blood pressure at home. This practice involves patients in their own care and emphasizes the fact that failing to take medications may result in an identifiable rise in blood pressure. Patients need to know that blood pressure varies continuously and that the range within which their pressure varies should be monitored.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Regular follow-up care is imperative so that the disease process can be assessed and treated, depending on whether control or progression is found. A history and physical examination should be completed at each clinic visit. The history should include all data that pertain to any potential problem, specifically medicationrelated problems such as postural (orthostatic) hypotension (experienced as dizziness or lightheadedness).

Deviation from the therapeutic program is a significant problem for people with hypertension and other chronic conditions requiring lifetime management. It is estimated that $50 \%$ discontinue their medications within 1 year of beginning to take them. Blood pressure control is achieved by only $27 \%$ (JNC VI, 1997). However, when patients actively participate in self-care, including self-monitoring of blood pressure and diet, compliance increasespossibly because patients receive immediate feedback and have a greater sense of control.

Considerable effort is required by patients with hypertension to adhere to recommended lifestyle modifications and to take regularly prescribed medications. The effort needed to follow the therapeutic plan may seem unreasonable to some, particularly when they have no symptoms without medications but do have side effects with medications. The recommended lifestyle changes are listed in Chart 32-2. Continued education and encouragement are usually needed to enable patients to formulate an acceptable plan that helps them live with their hypertension and adhere to the treatment plan. Compromises may have to be made about some aspects of therapy to achieve success in higher-priority goals. The nurse can assist with behavior change by supporting patients in making small changes with each visit that move them toward their goals. Another important factor is following up at each visit to see how the patient has progressed with the plans
made at the prior visit. If the patient has had difficulty with a particular aspect of the plan, the patient and nurse can work together to develop an alternative or modification to the plan that the patient believes will be more successful.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Symptoms suggesting that hypertension is progressing to the extent that target organ damage is occurring must be detected early so that appropriate treatment can be initiated accordingly. When the patient returns for follow-up care, all body systems must be assessed to detect any evidence of vascular damage. Examining the eyes with an ophthalmoscope is particularly important because retinal blood vessel damage indicates similar damage elsewhere in the vascular system. The patient is questioned about blurred vision, spots in front of the eyes, and diminished visual acuity. The heart, nervous system, and kidneys are also carefully assessed and examined. Any significant findings are promptly reported to determine whether additional diagnostic studies are required. Based on the findings, medications may be changed to improve blood pressure control.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Compliance with the therapeutic program may be more difficult for elderly people. The medication regimen can be difficult to remember, and the expense can be a problem. Monotherapy (treatment with a single agent), if appropriate, may simplify the medication regimen and make it less expensive. Special care must be taken to ensure that the elderly patient understands the regimen and can see and read instructions, open the medication container, and get the prescription refilled. The elderly person's family or caregivers should be included in the teaching program so that they can understand the patient's needs, encourage adherence to the treatment plan, and know when and whom to call if problems arise or information is needed.

NURSING ALERT The patient and caregivers should be cautioned that antihypertensive medications can cause hypotension. Low blood pressure or postural hypotension should be reported immediately. Because elderly people have impaired cardiovascular reflexes, they are often more sensitive than younger people to the extracellular volume depletion caused by diuretic therapy and to the sympathetic inhibition caused by adrenergic antagonists. The nurse teaches patients to change positions slowly when moving from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. The nurse also counsels elderly patients to use supportive devices such as hand rails and walkers when necessary to prevent falls that could result from dizziness.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include the following:
1. Maintains adequate tissue perfusion
a. Maintains blood pressure at less than $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (or less than $130 / 85 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ for persons with diabetes mellitus or proteinuria greater than 1 g per 24 hours) with lifestyle modifications, medications, or both
b. Demonstrates no symptoms of angina, palpitations, or vision changes
c. Has stable BUN and serum creatinine levels
d. Has palpable peripheral pulses
2. Complies with the self-care program
a. Adheres to the dietary regimen as prescribed: reduces calorie, sodium, and fat intake; increases fruit and vegetable intake
b. Exercises regularly
c. Takes medications as prescribed and reports any side effects
d. Measures blood pressure routinely
e. Abstains from tobacco and excessive alcohol intake
f. Keeps follow-up appointments
3. Has no complications
a. Reports no changes in vision
b. Exhibits no retinal damage on vision testing
c. Maintains pulse rate and rhythm and respiratory rate within normal ranges
d. Reports no dyspnea or edema
e. Maintains urine output consistent with intake
f. Has renal function test results within normal range
g. Demonstrates no motor, speech, or sensory deficits
h. Reports no headaches, dizziness, weakness, changes in gait, or falls

\section*{Hypertensive Crises}

There are two hypertensive crises that require nursing intervention: hypertensive emergency and hypertensive urgency. Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies may occur in patients whose hypertension has been poorly controlled or in those who have abruptly discontinued their medications. Once the hypertensive crisis has been managed, a complete evaluation is performed to review the patient's ongoing treatment plan and strategies to minimize the occurrence of subsequent hypertensive crises.

\section*{HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY}

Hypertensive emergency is a situation in which blood pressure must be lowered immediately (not necessarily to less than $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) to halt or prevent damage to the target organs. Conditions associated with hypertensive emergency include acute myocardial infarction, dissecting aortic aneurysm, and intracranial hemorrhage. Hypertensive emergencies are acute, lifethreatening blood pressure elevations that require prompt treatment in an intensive care setting because of the serious target organ damage that may occur. The medications of choice in hypertensive emergencies are those that have an immediate effect. Intravenous vasodilators, including sodium nitroprusside (Nipride, Nitropress), nicardipine hydrochloride (Cardene), fenoldopam mesylate (Corlopam), enalaprilat (Vasotec I.V.), and nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid IV, Tridil), have an immediate action that is short lived (minutes to 4 hours), and they are therefore used as the initial treatment. Table 32-5 provides for more information about these medications.

\section*{HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY}

Hypertensive urgency is a situation in which blood pressure must be lowered within a few hours. Severe perioperative hypertension is considered a hypertensive urgency. Hypertensive urgencies are managed with oral doses of fast-acting agents such as loop diuretics (bumetanide [Bumex], furosemide [Lasix]), beta-blockers propranolol (Inderal), metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol (Corgard),
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (benazepril [Lotensin], captopril [Capoten], enalapril [Vasotec]), calcium antagonists (diltiazem [Cardizem], verapamil [Isoptin SR, Calan SR, Covera HS]), or alpha ${ }_{2}$-agonists, such as clonidine (Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) (see Table 32-5).

Extremely close hemodynamic monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and cardiovascular status is required during treatment of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The exact frequency of monitoring is a matter of clinical judgment and varies with the patient's condition. The nurse may think that taking vital signs every 5 minutes is appropriate if the blood pressure is changing rapidly or may check vital signs at 15 or 30 minutes intervals if the situation is more stable. A precipitous drop in blood pressure can occur, which would require immediate action to restore blood pressure to an acceptable level.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are a nursing student assigned to a hypertension clinic. One of the patients is a 58 -year-old telemarketer. During the physical assessment, the patient, who is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 180 lb , asks you what he can do to reduce his blood pressure. How would you answer this patient's question? Identify what additional data you need to consider before you answer the patient's question. How would your assessment and plan change if the patient also had degenerative arthritis of his knees?
2. You are a home care nurse. One of your patients is an elderly man who lives alone and who has hypertension along with other health problems, including heart failure and atrial fibrillation. During a home visit, you learn that he has difficulty taking his medications as directed. What questions come to mind as you consider the situation? How will you direct your assessment to identify factors contributing to this problem? Using the factors identified, develop a sample follow-up home care teaching plan for this patient.

\section*{Assessment and Management of Patients With Hematologic Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the process of hematopoiesis.
2. Describe the processes involved in maintaining hemostasis.
3. Differentiate between the hypoproliferative and the hemolytic anemias and compare and contrast the physiologic mechanisms, clinical manifestations, medical management, and nursing interventions for each.
4. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with anemia.
5. Compare the leukemias, their incidence, physiologic alterations, clinical manifestations, management, and prognosis.
6. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with acute leukemia.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma.
8. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with bleeding disorders.
9. Identify therapies for blood disorders, including the nursing implications for the administration of blood and blood components.

Unlike many other body systems, the hematologic system truly encompasses the entire human body. Patients with hematologic disorders can be quite challenging to nurses because they often have significant abnormalities in blood tests but few or no symptoms. It is therefore imperative that nurses have a good understanding of the pathophysiology of the patient's condition and can make a thorough assessment that relies heavily on the interpretation of laboratory tests. It is equally important for the nurse to anticipate potential patient needs and to target nursing interventions accordingly. Because it is so important to the under-
standing of most hematologic diseases, a basic appreciation of blood cells and bone marrow function is necessary.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

composed of plasma and various types of cells. Plasma is the fluid portion of blood; it contains various proteins, such as albumin, globulin, fibrinogen, and other factors necessary for clotting, as well as electrolytes, waste products, and nutrients. About 55\% of blood volume is plasma.

\section*{BLOOD}

The cellular component of blood consists of three primary cell types (Table 33-1): RBCs (red blood cells or erythrocytes), WBCs (white blood cells or leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). These cellular components of blood normally make up $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ of the blood volume. Because most blood cells have a short life span, the need for the body to replenish its supply of cells is continuous; this process is termed hematopoiesis. The primary site for hematopoiesis is the bone marrow. During embryonic development and in other conditions, the liver and spleen may also be involved.

Under normal conditions, the adult bone marrow produces about 175 billion RBCs, 70 billion neutrophils (mature form of a WBC), and 175 billion platelets each day. When the body needs more blood cells, as in infection (when WBCs are needed to fight the invading pathogen) or in bleeding (when more RBCs are required), the marrow increases its production of the cells required. Thus, under normal conditions, the marrow responds to increased demand and releases adequate numbers of cells into the circulation.

The volume of blood in humans is approximately $7 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the normal body weight and amounts to 5 to 6 L . Circulating through the vascular system and serving as a link between body organs, the blood carries oxygen absorbed from the lungs and nutri-

ents absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract to the body cells for cellular metabolism. Blood also carries waste products produced by cellular metabolism to the lungs, skin, liver, and kidneys, where they are transformed and eliminated from the body. Blood also carries hormones, antibodies, and other substances to their sites of action or use.

To function, blood must remain in its normally fluid state. Because blood is fluid, the danger always exists that trauma can lead to loss of blood from the vascular system. To prevent this, an intricate clotting mechanism is activated when necessary to seal any leak in the blood vessels. Excessive clotting is equally dangerous, because it can obstruct blood flow to vital tissues. To prevent this, the body has a fibrinolytic mechanism that eventually dissolves clots (thrombi) formed within blood vessels. The balance between these two systems, clot (thrombus) formation and clot (thrombus) dissolution or fibrinolysis, is called hemostasis.

\section*{BONE MARROW}

The bone marrow is the site of hematopoiesis, or blood cell formation (Fig. 33-1). In a child all skeletal bones are involved, but as the child ages marrow activity decreases. By adulthood, marrow activity is usually limited to the pelvis, ribs, vertebrae, and sternum.

Marrow is one of the largest organs of the body, making up $4 \%$ to $5 \%$ of total body weight. It consists of islands of cellular components (red marrow) separated by fat (yellow marrow). As the adult ages, the proportion of active marrow is gradually replaced by fat; however, in the healthy person, the fat can again be replaced by active marrow when more blood cell production is required. In adults with disease that causes marrow destruction, fibrosis, or scarring, the liver and spleen can also resume production of blood cells by a process known as extramedullary hematopoiesis.

The marrow is highly vascular. Within it are primitive cells called stem cells. The stem cells have the ability to self-replicate, thereby ensuring a continuous supply of stem cells throughout the life cycle. When stimulated to do so, stem cells can begin a process of differentiation into either myeloid or lymphoid stem cells. These stem cells are committed to produce specific types of blood cells. Lymphoid stem cells produce either T or B lymphocytes. Myeloid stem cells differentiate into three broad cell types: RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. Thus, with the exception of lymphocytes, all blood cells are derived from the myeloid stem cell. A defect in the myeloid stem cell can cause problems not only with WBC production but also with RBC and platelet production. The entire process of hematopoiesis is highly complex. Research has identified many of the complex mechanisms involved, often at the molecular level. A thorough description of these processes is beyond the scope of this textbook; however, some mechanisms against which a specific treatment is targeted are briefly described in the relevant disease-specific sections of this chapter.

\section*{BLOOD CELLS}

\section*{Red Blood Cells (RBCs)}

The normal RBC is a biconcave disk that resembles a soft ball compressed between two fingers (Fig. 33-2). It has a diameter of about $8 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and is so flexible that it can pass easily through capillaries that may be as small as $2.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. The RBC membrane is so thin that gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, can easily diffuse across it; the disk shape provides a large surface area that facilitates the absorption and release of oxygen molecules.

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

EIGURE 33-1 Hematopoiesis. Uncommitted (pluripotent) stem cells can differentiate into myeloid or lymphoid stem cells. These stem cells then undergo a complex process of differentiation and maturation into normal cells that are released into the circulation. The myeloid stem cell is responsible not only for all nonlymphoid white blood cells (WBCs) but also for the production of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. Each step of the differentiation process depends in part on the presence of specific growth factors for each cell type. When the stem cells are dysfunctional, they may respond inadequately to the need for more cells, or they may respond excessively, sometimes uncontrollably, as in leukemia.

\end{figure}

Mature RBCs consist primarily of hemoglobin, which contains iron and makes up 95\% of the cell mass. RBCs have no nuclei, and they have many fewer metabolic enzymes than do most other cells. The presence of a large amount of hemoglobin enables the RBC to perform its principal function, the transport of oxygen between the lungs and tissues. Occasionally the marrow releases slightly immature forms of RBCs, called reticulocytes, into the circulation. This occurs as a normal response to an increased demand for RBCs (as in bleeding) or in some disease states.

The oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecule is made up of four subunits, each containing a heme portion attached to a globin chain. Iron is present in the heme component of the molecule. An important property of heme is its ability to bind to oxygen loosely and reversibly. Oxygen readily binds to hemoglobin in the lungs and is carried as oxyhemoglobin in arterial blood. Oxyhemoglobin is a brighter red than hemoglobin that does not contain oxygen (reduced hemoglobin), which is why arterial blood is a brighter red than venous blood. The oxygen readily dissociates (detaches) from hemoglobin in the tissues, where the oxygen is needed for cellular metabolism. In venous blood, hemoglobin combines with hydrogen ions produced by cellular metabolism and thus buffers excessive acid. Whole blood normally contains about 15 g of hemoglobin per 100 mL of blood.

\section*{ERYTHROPOIESIS}

Erythroblasts arise from the primitive myeloid stem cells in bone marrow. The erythroblast is a nucleated cell that, in the process of maturing within the bone marrow, accumulates hemoglobin and
gradually loses its nucleus. At this stage, the cell is known as a reticulocyte. Further maturation into an RBC entails the loss of the dark-staining material and slight shrinkage. The mature RBC is then released into the circulation. Under conditions of rapid erythropoiesis (RBC production), reticulocytes and other immature cells (eg, nucleated RBCs) may be released prematurely into the circulation.

Differentiation of the primitive myeloid stem cell of the marrow into an erythroblast is stimulated by erythropoietin, a hormone produced primarily by the kidney. If the kidney detects low levels of oxygen (as would occur in anemia, in which fewer RBCs are available to bind oxygen, or in people living at high altitudes), the release of erythropoietin is increased. The increased erythropoietin then stimulates the marrow to increase production of RBCs. The entire process typically takes 5 days.

For normal RBC production, the bone marrow also requires iron, vitamin $B_{12}$, folic acid, pyridoxine (vitamin $B_{6}$ ), protein, and other factors. A deficiency of these factors during erythropoiesis can result in decreased RBC production and anemia.

Iron Stores and Metabolism. The average daily diet in the United States contains 10 to 15 mg of elemental iron; normally 0.5 to 1 mg of ingested iron is absorbed from the small intestine. The rate of iron absorption is regulated by the amount of iron already stored in the body and by the rate of RBC production. Additional amounts of iron, up to 2 mg daily, must be absorbed by women to replace blood lost during menstruation. Total body iron content in the average adult is approximately 3 g , most of which is present in
hemoglobin or in one of its breakdown products. Iron is stored in the small intestine as ferritin and in reticuloendothelial cells. When required, the iron is released into the plasma, binds to transferrin, and is transported into the membranes of the normoblasts (RBC precursor cells) within the marrow, where it is incorporated into hemoglobin. Iron is lost in the feces, either in bile, blood, or mucosal cells from the intestine.

The concentration of iron in blood is normally about 75 to $175 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 13 to $31 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) for men and 65 to $165 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 11 to $29 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})$ for women. With iron deficiency, bone marrow iron stores are rapidly depleted; hemoglobin synthesis is depressed, and the RBCs produced by the marrow are small and low in hemoglobin. Iron deficiency in the adult generally indicates that blood has been lost from the body (eg, from bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or heavy menstrual flow). In the adult, lack of dietary iron is rarely the sole cause of iron deficiency anemia. The source of iron deficiency should be investigated promptly, because iron deficiency in an adult may be a sign of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or colon cancer.

Vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ and Folic Acid Metabolism. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folic acid are required for the synthesis of DNA in many tissues, but deficiencies of either of these vitamins have the greatest effect on erythropoiesis. Both vitamin $B_{12}$ and folic acid are derived from the diet. Folic acid is absorbed in the proximal small intestine, but only small amounts are stored within the body. If the diet is deficient in folic acid, stores within the body quickly become depleted. Because vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is found only in foods of animal origin, strict vegetarians may ingest little $B_{12}$. Vitamin $B_{12}$ combines with intrinsic factor produced in the stomach. The vitamin B-intrinsic factor complex is absorbed in the distal ileum. People who have had a partial or total gastrectomy may have limited amounts of intrinsic factor, and therefore the absorption of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ may be diminished. The effects of either decreased absorption or decreased intake of $B_{12}$ are not apparent for 2 to 4 years.

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folic acid deficiencies are characterized by the production of abnormally large RBCs called megaloblasts. Because these cells are abnormal, many are sequestered (trapped) while still in the bone marrow, and their rate of release is decreased. Some of these cells actually die in the marrow before they can be released into the circulation. This results in megaloblastic anemia.

\section*{RED BLOOD CELL DESTRUCTION}

The average life span of a normal circulating RBC is 120 days. Aged RBCs lose their elasticity and become trapped in small blood vessels, particularly in the spleen. They are removed from the blood by the reticuloendothelial cells, particularly in the liver and the spleen. As the RBCs are destroyed, their hemoglobin is largely recycled. Some hemoglobin also breaks down to form bilirubin and is secreted in the bile. Most of the iron is recycled to form new hemoglobin molecules within the bone marrow; small amounts are lost daily in the feces and urine and monthly in menstrual flow.

\section*{White Blood Cells (WBCs)}

Leukocytes are divided into two general categories: granulocytes and lymphocytes. In normal blood, the total leukocyte count is 5000 to 10,000 cells per cubic millimeter. Of these, approximately $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ are granulocytes and $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ are lymphocytes. Primarily, WBCs protect the body against infection and tissue injury.

\section*{GRANULOCYTES}

Granulocytes are defined by the presence of granules in the cytoplasm of the cell. Granulocytes are divided into three main subgroups, which are characterized by the staining properties of these granules (see Fig. 33-2). Eosinophils have bright-red granules in their cytoplasm, whereas the granules in basophils stain deep blue. The third and by far the most numerous cell in this class is the neutrophil, with granules that stain a pink to violet hue. Neutrophils are also called polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs, or polys) or segmented neutrophils (segs).

The nucleus of the mature neutrophil has multiple lobes (usually two to five) that are connected by thin filaments of nuclear material, a "segmented" nucleus; it is usually twice the size of an RBC. The somewhat less mature granulocyte has a single-lobed, elongated nucleus and is called a band cell. Ordinarily, band cells account for only a small percentage of circulating granulocytes, although their percentage can increase greatly under conditions in which neutrophil production increases, such as infection. An increased number of band cells is sometimes called a "left shift" or "shift to the left." (Traditionally, the diagram of neutrophil maturation shows the stem cell on the left with progressive maturation stages toward the right, ending with a fully mature neutrophil on the right side. A shift to the left indicates that more immature cells are present in the blood than normally occurs.)

Granulocyte production from the myeloid stem cell pool results in the gradual differentiation of these cells from a myeloid blast cell into a fully mature neutrophil. The process, called myelopoiesis, is highly complex and depends on many factors. These factors, including specific cytokines such as growth factors, are normally present within the marrow itself. As the blast cell matures, the cytoplasm of the cell changes in color (from blue to violet) and granules begin to form with the cytoplasm. The shape of the nucleus also changes. The entire process of maturation and differentiation takes about 10 days (see Fig. 33-1). Once the neutrophil is released into the circulation from the marrow, it stays there for only about 6 hours before it migrates into the body tissues to perform its function of phagocytosis (ingestion and digestion of bacteria and particles) (Fig. 33-3). Here, neutrophils last no more than 1 to 2 days before they die. The number of circulating granulocytes found in the healthy person is relatively constant, but in infection large numbers of these cells are rapidly released into the circulation.

\section*{MONONUCLEAR WHITE BLOOD CELLS (AGRANULOCYTES)}

Monocytes. Monocytes (also called mononuclear leukocytes) are WBCs with a single-lobed nucleus and a granule-free cytoplasmhence the term agranulocyte. In normal adult blood, monocytes account for approximately 5\% of the total WBCs. Monocytes are the largest of the WBCs. Produced by the bone marrow, they remain in the circulation for a short time before entering the tissues and transforming into macrophages. Macrophages are particularly active in the spleen, liver, peritoneum, and the alveoli of the lungs.

Lymphocytes. Mature lymphocytes are small cells with scanty cytoplasm. Immature lymphocytes are produced in the marrow from the lymphoid stem cells. A second major source of production is the cortex of the thymus. Cells derived from the thymus are known as T lymphocytes (or T cells); those derived from the marrow can also be T cells but are more commonly B lymphocytes (or B cells). Lymphocytes complete their differentiation and maturation primarily in the lymph nodes and in the lymphoid tissue of the intestine and spleen after exposure to a specific antigen. Mature lymphocytes are antigen-specific cells.

\end{figure}

FIGURE 33-3 Phagocytosis. When foreign matter (such as bacteria or dead tissue) comes in contact with the cell membrane of the neutrophil, the membrane surrounds and pinches off the area, leaving the membrane intact. Thus, the engulfed material is left in a vacuole within the neutrophil, where enzymes within the cell destroy the foreign material.

\section*{FUNCTION OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS}

WBCs protect the body from invasion by bacteria and other foreign entities. The major function of neutrophils is phagocytosis (see Fig. 33-3). Neutrophils arrive at the site within 1 hour after the onset of an inflammatory reaction and initiate phagocytosis, but they are short-lived. An influx of monocytes follows; these cells continue their phagocytic activities for long periods as macrophages. This process constitutes a second line of defense for the body against inflammation and infection. Although neutrophils can often work adequately against bacteria without the need for excessive involvement with macrophages, macrophages are particularly effective against fungi and viruses. Macrophages also digest senescent (aging or aged) blood cells, such as RBCs, primarily within the spleen.

The primary function of lymphocytes is to produce substances that aid in attacking foreign material. One group of lymphocytes (T lymphocytes) kills foreign cells directly or releases a variety of lymphokines, substances that enhance the activity of phagocytic cells. T lymphocytes are responsible for delayed allergic reactions, rejection of foreign tissue (eg, transplanted organs), and destruction of tumor cells. This process is known as cellular immunity. The other group of lymphocytes (B lymphocytes) is capable of differentiating into plasma cells. Plasma cells, in turn, produce immunoglobulin (Ig), or antibodies, which are protein molecules that destroy foreign material by several mechanisms. This process is known as humoral immunity.

Eosinophils and basophils function in hypersensitivity reactions. Eosinophils are important in the phagocytosis of parasites. The increase in eosinophil levels in allergic states indicates that these cells are involved in the hypersensitivity reaction; their function there is to neutralize histamine. Basophils produce and store histamine as well as other substances involved in hypersensitivity reactions. The release of these substances provokes allergic reactions.

\section*{Platelets (Thrombocytes)}

Platelets, or thrombocytes, are not actually cells. Rather, they are granular fragments of giant cells in the bone marrow called megakaryocytes. Platelet production in the marrow is regulated in part by the hormone thrombopoietin, which stimulates the production and differentiation of megakaryocytes from the myeloid stem cell.

Platelets play an essential role in the control of bleeding. They circulate freely in the blood in an inactive state, where they nurture the endothelium of the blood vessels, maintaining the integrity of the vessel. When vascular injury does occur, platelets collect at the site and are activated. They adhere to the site of injury and to each other, forming a platelet plug that temporarily stops bleeding. Substances released from platelet granules activate coagulation factors in the blood plasma and initiate the formation of a stable clot composed of fibrin, a filamentous protein. Platelets have a normal life span of 7 to 10 days.

\section*{PLASMA AND PLASMA PROTEINS}

After cellular elements are removed from blood, the remaining liquid portion is called plasma. More than $90 \%$ of plasma is water. The remainder consists primarily of plasma proteins, clotting factors (particularly fibrinogen), and small amounts of other substances such as nutrients, enzymes, waste products, and gases. If plasma is allowed to clot, the remaining fluid is called serum. Serum has essentially the same composition as plasma, except that fibrinogen and several clotting factors have been removed in the clotting process.

Plasma proteins consist primarily of albumin and globulins. The globulins can be separated into three main fractions-alpha, beta, and gamma-each of which consists of distinct proteins
that have different functions. Important proteins in the alpha and beta fractions are the transport globulins and the clotting factors that are made in the liver. The transport globulins carry various substances in bound form around the circulation. For example, thyroid-binding globulin carries thyroxin, and transferrin carries iron. The clotting factors, including fibrinogen, remain in an inactive form in the blood plasma until activated by the clotting cascade. The gamma globulin fraction refers to the immunoglobulins, or antibodies. These proteins are produced by the well-differentiated lymphocytes and plasma cells. The actual fractionation of the globulins can be seen on a specific laboratory test (serum protein electrophoresis).

Albumin is particularly important for the maintenance of fluid balance within the vascular system. Capillary walls are impermeable to albumin, so its presence in the plasma creates an osmotic force that keeps fluid within the vascular space. Albumin, which is produced by the liver, has the capacity to bind to several substances that are transported in plasma (eg, certain medications, bilirubin, some hormones). People with poor hepatic function may have low concentrations of albumin, with a resultant decrease in osmotic pressure and the development of edema.

\section*{RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM (RES)}

The RES is composed of special tissue macrophages, which are derived from monocytes. When released from the marrow, monocytes spend a short time in the circulation (about 24 hours) and then enter the body tissues. Within the tissues, the monocytes continue to differentiate into cells called macrophages, which can survive for months. Macrophages have a variety of important functions. They defend the body against foreign invaders (ie, bacteria and other pathogens) via phagocytosis. They remove old or damaged cells from the circulation. They stimulate the inflammatory process and present antigen to the immune system (see Chapter 50). Macrophages give rise to tissue histiocytes, including Kupffer cells of the liver, peritoneal macrophages, alveolar macrophages, and other components of the RES. Thus, the RES is a component of many other organs within the body, particularly the spleen, lymph nodes, lung, and liver.

The spleen is the site of activity for most macrophages. Most of the spleen ( $75 \%$ ) is made of red pulp; here the blood enters the venous sinuses through capillaries that are surrounded by macrophages. Within the red pulp are tiny aggregates of white pulp, consisting of B and T lymphocytes. The spleen sequesters newly released reticulocytes from the marrow, removing nuclear fragments and other materials (eg, denatured hemoglobin, iron) before the now fully mature RBC returns to the circulation. Although a minority of RBCs (less than $5 \%$ ) is pooled in the spleen, a significant proportion of platelets ( $20 \%-40 \%$ ) is pooled here. If the spleen is enlarged, a greater proportion of RBCs and platelets can be sequestered. The spleen is a major source of hematopoiesis in fetal life. It can resume hematopoiesis later in adulthood if necessary (eg, in bone marrow fibrosis). The spleen has important immunologic functions as well. It forms a substance that promotes the phagocytosis of neutrophils; it also forms the antibody IgM after exposure to antigen.

\section*{HEMOSTASIS}

Hemostasis is the process of preventing blood loss from intact vessels and of stopping bleeding from a severed vessel. The prevention of blood loss from intact vessels requires adequate numbers of functional platelets. Platelets nurture the endothelium
and thereby maintain the structural integrity of the vessel wall. Two processes are involved in arresting bleeding: primary and secondary hemostasis.

In primary hemostasis, the severed blood vessel constricts. Circulating platelets aggregate at the site and adhere to the vessel and to one another. An unstable hemostatic plug is formed. For the coagulation process to be correctly activated, circulating inactive coagulation factors must be converted to active forms. This process occurs on the surface of the aggregated platelets at the site of vessel injury. The end result is the formation of fibrin, which reinforces the platelet plug and anchors it to the injury site. This process is termed secondary hemostasis (Fig. 33-4). The process of blood coagulation is highly complex. It can be activated by the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathway. Both pathways are needed for maintenance of normal hemostasis.

Many factors are involved in the reaction cascade that forms fibrin. When tissue is injured, the extrinsic pathway is activated by the release from the tissue of a substance called thromboplastin. As the result of a series of reactions, prothrombin is converted to thrombin, which in turn catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Clotting by the intrinsic pathway is activated when the collagen that lines blood vessels is exposed. Clotting factors are activated sequentially until, as with the extrinsic pathway, fibrin is ultimately formed. Although the intrinsic pathway is slower, this sequence is probably most often responsible for clotting in vivo.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 33-4 Secondary hemostasis. Based on the type of stimulus (injury to the endothelial membrane of a blood vessel or a tissue), one of two clotting pathways is initiated.

Thrombin is necessary for fibrinogen to be converted into fibrin, the stabilizing protein that anchors the fragile platelet plug to the site of injury to prevent further bleeding and permit the injured vessel or site to heal.}
\end{figure}

As the injured vessel is repaired and again covered with endothelial cells, the fibrin clot is no longer needed. The fibrin is digested via two systems: the plasma fibrinolytic system and the cellular fibrinolytic system. The substance plasminogen is required to lyse (break down) the fibrin. Plasminogen, which is present in all body fluids, circulates with fibrinogen and is therefore incorporated into the fibrin clot as it forms. When the clot is no longer needed (eg, after an injured blood vessel has healed), the plasminogen is activated to form plasmin. Plasmin actually digests the fibrinogen, and the breakdown particles of the clot (fibrin degradation products) are released into the circulation. Through this system, clots are dissolved as tissue is repaired, and the vascular system returns to its normal baseline state.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF THE HEMATOLOGIC SYSTEM}

Most hematologic diseases reflect a defect in the hematopoietic, hemostatic, or RES systems. The defect can be quantitative (eg, increased or decreased production of cells), qualitative (eg, the cells that are produced are defective in their normal functional capacity), or both.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

In elderly patients, a common problem is decreased ability of the bone marrow to respond to the body's need for blood cells (RBCs, WBCs, and platelets). This inability is a result of many factors, including diminished production of the growth factors necessary for hematopoiesis by stromal cells within the marrow or a diminished response to the growth factors (in the case of erythropoietin). When an elderly person needs more blood cells (eg, WBCs in infection, RBCs in anemia), the bone marrow may not be able to increase production of these cells adequately. Leukopenia (a decreased number of circulating WBCs) or anemia can result. In the elderly, the bone marrow may be more susceptible to the myelosuppressive effects of medications.

Anemia is the most common hematologic condition affecting elderly patients; with each successive decade of life, the incidence of anemia increases. Anemia frequently results from iron deficiency (in the case of blood loss) or from a nutritional deficiency, particularly folate or $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency or protein-calorie malnutrition; it may also result from inflammation or chronic disease. Management of the disorder varies depending on the etiology. Therefore, it is important to identify the cause of the anemia rather than to consider it an inevitable consequence of aging. Elderly people with concurrent cardiac or pulmonary problems may not tolerate anemia very well, and a prompt, thorough evaluation is warranted.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Many hematologic conditions cause few symptoms. Therefore, the use of extensive laboratory tests is often required to diagnose a hematologic disorder. For most hematologic conditions, continued monitoring via specific blood tests is required because it is very important to assess for changes in test results over time.

\section*{HEMATOLOGIC STUDIES}

The most common tests used are the complete blood count (CBC) and the peripheral blood smear (Table 33-2). The CBC identifies the total number of blood cells (WBCs, RBCs, and platelets) as well as the hemoglobin, hematocrit (percentage of blood consisting of RBCs), and RBC indices. Because cellular
morphology (shape and appearance of the cells) is particularly important in most hematologic disorders, the physician needs to examine the blood cells involved. This process is referred to as the manual examination of the peripheral smear, which may be part of the CBC. In this test, a drop of blood is spread on a glass slide, stained, and examined under a microscope. The shape and size of the RBCs and platelets as well as the actual appearance of the WBCs provides useful information in identifying hematologic conditions. Blood for the CBC is typically obtained by venipuncture.

\section*{BONE MARROW ASPIRATION AND BIOPSY}

The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are crucial when additional information is needed to assess how an individual's blood cells are being formed and to assess the quantity and quality of each type of cell produced within the marrow. These tests are also used to document infection or tumor within the marrow.

Normal bone marrow is in a semifluid state and can be aspirated through a special large needle. In adults, bone marrow is usually aspirated from the iliac crest and occasionally from the sternum. The aspirate provides only a sample of cells. Aspirate alone may be adequate for evaluating certain conditions, such as anemia. However, when more information is required, a biopsy is also performed. Biopsy samples are taken from the posterior iliac crest; occasionally, an anterior approach is required. A marrow biopsy shows the architecture of the bone marrow as well as its degree of cellularity.

Most patients need no more preparation than a careful explanation of the procedure, but for some very anxious patients, an antianxiety agent may be useful. It is always important for the physician or nurse to describe and explain to the patient the procedure and the sensations that will be experienced. The risks, benefits, and alternatives are also discussed. A signed informed consent is needed before the procedure is performed.

Before aspiration, the skin is cleansed as for any minor surgery, using aseptic technique. Then a small area is anesthetized with a local anesthetic through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the periosteum of the bone. It is not possible to anesthetize the bone itself. The bone marrow needle is introduced with a stylet in place. When the needle is felt to go through the outer cortex of bone and enter the marrow cavity, the stylet is removed, a syringe is attached, and a small volume ( 0.5 mL ) of blood and marrow is aspirated. Patients typically feel a pressure sensation as the needle is advanced into position. The actual aspiration always causes sharp but brief pain, resulting from the suction exerted as the marrow is aspirated into the syringe; the patient should be forewarned about this. Taking deep breaths or using relaxation techniques often helps ease the discomfort.

If a bone marrow biopsy is necessary, it is best performed after the aspiration and in a slightly different location, because the marrow structure may be altered after aspiration. A special biopsy needle is used. Because these needles are large, the skin is punctured first with a surgical blade to make a $3-$ or $4-\mathrm{mm}$ incision. The biopsy needle is advanced well into the marrow cavity. When the needle is properly positioned, a portion of marrow is cored out, using a twisting or gentle rocking motion to free the sample and permit its removal within the biopsy needle. Patients feel a pressure sensation but should not feel actual pain. The nurse should instruct the patient to inform the physician if pain occurs so that additional anesthetic can be administered.

The major hazard of either bone marrow aspiration or biopsy is a slight risk of bleeding and infection. The bleeding risk is somewhat increased if the patient's platelet count is low or if the patient has been taking a medication (eg, aspirin) that alters platelet func-

tion. After the marrow sample is obtained, pressure is applied to the site for several minutes. The site is then covered with a sterile dressing. Most patients have no discomfort after a bone marrow aspiration, but the site of a biopsy may ache for 1 or 2 days. Warm tub baths and use of a mild analgesic (eg, acetaminophen) may be useful. Aspirin-containing analgesics should be avoided because they can aggravate or potentiate any bleeding that may occur.

\section*{Management of Hematologic Disorders}

Commonly encountered blood disorders are anemia, polycythemia, leukopenia and neutropenia, leukocytosis, lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, and various bleeding and coagulation disorders. Nursing management of patients with these disorders requires skillful assessment and monitoring as well as meticulous care and teaching to prevent deterioration and complications.

\section*{ANEMIA}

Anemia, per se, is not a specific disease state but a sign of an underlying disorder. It is by far the most common hematologic condition. Anemia, a condition in which the hemoglobin concentration is lower than normal, reflects the presence of fewer than normal RBCs within the circulation. As a result, the amount of oxygen delivered to body tissues is also diminished.

There are many different kinds of anemia (Table 33-3), but all can be classified into three broad etiologic categories:
- Loss of RBCs—occurs with bleeding, potentially from any major source, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the uterus, the nose, or a wound
- Decreased production of RBCs-can be caused by a deficiency in cofactors (including folic acid, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, and iron) required for erythropoiesis; RBC production may also be reduced if the bone marrow is suppressed (eg, by tumor, medications, toxins) or is inadequately stimulated because of a lack of erythropoietin (as occurs in chronic renal disease).
- Increased destruction of RBCs-may occur because of an overactive RES (including hypersplenism) or because the bone marrow produces abnormal RBCs that are then destroyed by the RES (eg, sickle cell anemia).

A conclusion as to whether the anemia is caused by destruction or by inadequate production of RBCs usually can be reached on the basis of the following factors:
- The marrow's ability to respond to the decreased RBCs (as evidenced by an increased reticulocyte count in the circulating blood)
- The degree to which young RBCs proliferate in the bone marrow and the manner in which they mature (as observed on bone marrow biopsy)
- The presence or absence of end products of RBC destruction within the circulation (eg, increased bilirubin level, decreased haptoglobin level)

\section*{Classification of Anemias}

Anemia may be classified in several ways. The physiologic approach is to determine whether the deficiency in RBCs is caused by a defect in their production (hypoproliferative anemia), by their destruction (hemolytic anemia), or by their loss (bleeding).

In the hypoproliferative anemias, RBCs usually survive normally, but the marrow cannot produce adequate numbers of these cells. The decreased production is reflected in a low reticulocyte count. Inadequate production of RBCs may result from marrow damage due to medications or chemicals (eg, chloramphenicol, benzene) or from a lack of factors necessary for RBC formation (eg, iron, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, folic acid, erythropoietin).

Hemolytic anemias stem from premature destruction of RBCs, which results in a liberation of hemoglobin from the RBC into the plasma. The increased RBC destruction results in tissue hypoxia, which in turn stimulates erythropoietin production. This increased production is reflected in an increased reticulocyte count, as the bone marrow responds to the loss of RBCs. The released hemoglobin is converted in large part to bilirubin; therefore, the bilirubin concentration rises. Hemolysis can result from an abnormality within the RBC itself (eg, sickle cell anemia, glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase [G-6-PD] deficiency) or within the plasma (eg, immune hemolytic anemias), or from direct injury to the RBC within the circulation (eg, hemolysis caused by mechanical heart valve). Chart 33-1 identifies the causes of hemolytic anemia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Aside from the severity of the anemia itself, several factors influence the development of anemia-associated symptoms:
- The speed with which the anemia has developed
- The duration of the anemia (ie, its chronicity)
- The metabolic requirements of the individual
- Other concurrent disorders or disabilities (eg, cardiopulmonary disease)
- Special complications or concomitant features of the condition that produced the anemia

In general, the more rapidly an anemia develops, the more severe its symptoms. An otherwise healthy person can often tolerate as much as a 50\% gradual reduction in hemoglobin without pronounced symptoms or significant incapacity, whereas the rapid loss of as little as $30 \%$ may precipitate profound vascular collapse in the same individual. A person who has been anemic for a very long time, with hemoglobin levels between 9 and $11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, usually has few or no symptoms other than slight tachycardia on exertion and fatigue.

\end{tabular}

Patients who customarily are very active or who have significant demands on their lives (eg, a single, working mother of small children) are more likely to have symptoms, and those symptoms are more likely to be pronounced than in a more sedentary person. A patient with hypothyroidism with decreased oxygen needs may be completely asymptomatic, without tachycardia or increased cardiac output, at a hemoglobin level of $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$. Similarly, patients with coexistent cardiac, vascular, or pulmonary disease may develop more pronounced symptoms of anemia (eg, dyspnea, chest pain, muscle pain or cramping) at a higher hemoglobin level than those without these concurrent health problems.

Finally, some anemic disorders are complicated by various other abnormalities that do not result from the anemia but are inherently associated with these particular diseases. These abnormalities may give rise to symptoms that completely overshadow those of the anemia, as in the painful crises of sickle cell anemia.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A variety of hematologic studies are performed to determine the type and cause of the anemia. In an initial evaluation, the hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and RBC indices, particularly the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), are particularly useful. Iron studies (serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity [TIBC], percent saturation, and ferritin), as well as serum vitamin $B_{12}$ and folate levels, are also frequently obtained. Other tests include haptoglobin and erythropoietin levels. The remaining CBC values are useful in determining whether the anemia is an isolated problem or part of another hematologic condition, such as leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Bone marrow aspiration may be performed. In addition, other diagnostic studies may be performed to determine the presence of underlying chronic illness, such as malignancy, and the source of any blood loss, such as polyps or ulcers within the gastrointestinal tract.

\section*{Complications}

General complications of severe anemia include heart failure, paresthesias, and confusion. At any given level of anemia, patients with underlying heart disease are far more likely to have angina or symptoms of heart failure than those without heart disease. Complications associated with specific types of anemia are included in the description of each type.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of anemia is directed toward correcting or controlling the cause of the anemia; if the anemia is severe, the RBCs that are lost or destroyed may be replaced with a transfusion of packed RBCs (PRBCs). The management of the various types of anemia is covered in the discussions that follow.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH ANEMIA}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history and physical examination provide important data about the type of anemia involved, the extent and type of symptoms it produces, and the impact of those symptoms on the patient's life. Weakness, fatigue, and general malaise are common, as are pallor of the skin and mucous membranes (sclera, oral mucosa).

Jaundice may be present in patients with megaloblastic anemia or hemolytic anemia. The tongue may be smooth and red (in iron deficiency anemia) or beefy red and sore (in megaloblastic anemia ); the corners of the mouth may be ulcerated (angular cheilosis) in both types of anemia. Individuals with iron deficiency anemia may crave ice, starch, or dirt (known as pica); their nails may be brittle, ridged, and concave.

The health history should include a medication history, because some medications can depress bone marrow activity or interfere with folate metabolism. An accurate history of alcohol intake, including the amount and duration, should be obtained. Family history is important, because certain anemias are inherited. Athletic endeavors should be assessed, because extreme exercise can decrease erythropoiesis and RBC survival in some athletes.

A nutritional assessment is important, because it may indicate deficiencies in essential nutrients such as iron, vitamin $B_{12}$, and folic acid. Children of indigent families may be at higher risk for anemia because of nutritional deficiencies. Strict vegetarians are also at risk for megaloblastic types of anemia if they do not supplement their diet with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

Cardiac status should be carefully assessed. When the hemoglobin level is low, the heart attempts to compensate by pumping faster and harder in an effort to deliver more blood to hypoxic tissue. This increased cardiac workload can result in such symptoms as tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, orthopnea, and exertional dyspnea. Heart failure may eventually develop, as evidenced by an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) and liver (hepatomegaly) and by peripheral edema.

Assessment of the gastrointestinal system may disclose complaints of nausea, vomiting (with specific questions as to the appearance of any emesis [eg, looks like "coffee grounds"]), melena or dark stools, diarrhea, anorexia, and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Stools should be tested for occult blood. Women should be questioned about their menstrual periods (eg, excessive menstrual flow, other vaginal bleeding) and the use of iron supplements during pregnancy.

The neurologic examination is also important because of the effect of pernicious anemia on the central and peripheral nervous systems. Assessment should include the presence and extent of peripheral numbness and paresthesias, ataxia, poor coordination, and confusion. Finally, it is important to monitor relevant laboratory test results and to note any changes over time.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the anemic patient may include:
- Activity intolerance related to weakness, fatigue, and general malaise
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inadequate intake of essential nutrients
- Ineffective tissue perfusion related to inadequate blood volume or hematocrit
- Noncompliance with prescribed therapy

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Heart failure
- Paresthesias
- Confusion

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include increased tolerance of normal activity, attainment or maintenance of adequate nutrition, maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion, compliance with prescribed therapy, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MANAGING FATIGUE}

The most frequent symptom and complication of anemia is fatigue. This distressing symptom is too often minimized by health care providers. Fatigue is often the symptom that has the greater negative impact on the individual's level of functioning and consequent quality of life. Patients describe the fatigue from anemia as oppressive. Fatigue can be significant, yet the anemia may not be severe enough to warrant transfusion. Fatigue can interfere with an individual's ability to work, both inside and outside the home. It can harm relationships with family and friends. Patients often lose interest in hobbies and activities, including sexual activity. The distress from fatigue is often related to an individual's responsibilities and life demands as well as the amount of assistance and support received from others.

Nursing interventions can focus on assisting the patient to prioritize activities and to establish a balance between activity and rest that is realistic and feasible from the patient's perspective. Patients with chronic anemia need to maintain some physical activity and exercise to prevent the deconditioning that results from inactivity.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Inadequate intake of essential nutrients, such as iron, vitamin $B_{12}$, folic acid, and protein can cause some anemias. The symptoms associated with anemia (eg, fatigue, anorexia) can in turn interfere with maintaining adequate nutrition. A healthy diet should be encouraged. Because alcohol interferes with the utilization of essential nutrients, the nurse should advise the patient to avoid alcoholic beverages or to limit their intake and should provide the rationale for this recommendation. Dietary teaching sessions should be individualized, including cultural aspects related to food preferences and food preparation. The involvement of family members enhances compliance with dietary recommendations. Dietary supplements (eg, vitamins, iron, folate, protein) may be prescribed as well.

Equally important, the patient and family must understand the role of nutritional supplements in the proper context, because many forms of anemia are not the result of a nutritional deficiency. In such cases, excessive intake of nutritional supplements will not improve the anemia. A potential problem in individuals with chronic transfusion requirements occurs with the indiscriminate use of iron. Unless an aggressive program of chelation therapy is implemented, these individuals are at risk for iron overload from their transfusions alone. The addition of an iron supplement only exacerbates the situation.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE PERFUSION}

Patients with acute blood loss or severe hemolysis may have decreased tissue perfusion from decreased blood volume or reduced circulating RBCs (decreased hematocrit). Lost volume is replaced with transfusions or intravenous fluids, based on the symptoms and the laboratory findings. Supplemental oxygen may be necessary, but it is rarely needed on a long-term basis unless there is underlying severe cardiac or pulmonary disease as well. The nurse monitors vital signs closely; other medica-
tions, such as antihypertensive agents, may need to be adjusted or withheld.

\section*{PROMOTING COMPLIANCE WITH PRESCRIBED THERAPY}

For patients with anemia, medications or nutritional supplements are often prescribed to alleviate or correct the condition. These patients need to understand the purpose of the medication, how to take the medication and over what time period, and how to manage any side effects of therapy. To enhance compliance, the nurse can assist patients in developing ways to incorporate the therapeutic plan into their lives, rather than merely giving the patient a list of instructions. For example, many patients have difficulty taking iron supplements because of related gastrointestinal effects. Rather than seeking assistance from a health care provider in managing the problem, some of these patients simply stop taking the iron.

Abruptly stopping some medications can have serious consequences, as in the case of high-dose corticosteroids to manage hemolytic anemias. Some medications, such as growth factors, are extremely expensive. Patients receiving these medications may need assistance with obtaining needed insurance coverage or with exploring alternatives for obtaining these medications.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

A significant complication of anemia is heart failure from chronic diminished blood volume and the heart's compensatory effort to increase cardiac output. Patients with anemia should be assessed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. A serial record of body weights can be more useful than a record of dietary intake and output, because the intake and output measurements may not be accurate. In the case of fluid retention resulting from congestive heart failure, diuretics may be required.

In megaloblastic forms of anemia, the significant potential complications are neurologic. A neurologic assessment should be performed for patients with known or suspected megaloblastic anemia. Patients may initially complain of paresthesias in their lower extremities. These paresthesias are usually manifested as numbness and tingling on the bottom of the foot, and they gradually progress. As the anemia progresses and damage to the spinal cord occurs, other signs become apparent. Position and vibration sense may be diminished; difficulty maintaining balance is not uncommon, and some patients have gait disturbances as well. Initially mild but gradually progressive confusion may develop.

\section*{Hypoproliferative Anemias}

\section*{IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA}

Iron deficiency anemia typically results when the intake of dietary iron is inadequate for hemoglobin synthesis. The body can store about one fourth to one third of its iron, and it is not until those stores are depleted that iron deficiency anemia actually begins to develop. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia in all age groups, and it is the most common anemia in the world. More than 500 million people are affected, more commonly in underdeveloped countries, where inadequate iron stores can result from inadequate intake of iron (seen with vegetarian diets) or from blood loss (eg, from intestinal hookworm). Iron deficiency is also common in the United States. In children, adolescents, and pregnant women, the cause is typically inadequate iron in the diet to keep up with increased growth. However, for most adults with iron deficiency anemia, the cause is blood loss. In fact, in adults, the cause of iron deficiency anemia should be considered to be bleeding until proven otherwise.

The most common cause of iron deficiency in men and postmenopausal women is bleeding (from ulcers, gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or gastrointestinal tumors). The most common cause of iron deficiency anemia in premenopausal women is menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding) and pregnancy with inadequate iron supplementation. Patients with chronic alcoholism often have chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, which causes iron loss and eventual anemia. Other causes include iron malabsorption, as is seen after gastrectomy or with celiac disease.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients with iron deficiency primarily have the symptoms of anemia. If the deficiency is severe or prolonged, they may also have a smooth, sore tongue, brittle and ridged nails, and angular cheilosis (an ulceration of the corner of the mouth). These signs subside after iron-replacement therapy. The health history may be significant for multiple pregnancies, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pica (a craving for unusual substances, such as ice, clay, or laundry starch).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The most definitive method of establishing the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is bone marrow aspiration. The aspirate is stained to detect iron, which is at a low level or even absent. How-
ever, few patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia undergo bone marrow aspiration. In many patients, the diagnosis can be established with other tests, particularly in patients with a history of conditions that predispose them to this type of anemia.

There is a strong correlation between laboratory values measuring iron stores and levels of hemoglobin. After the iron stores are depleted (as reflected by low serum ferritin levels), the hemoglobin level falls. The diminished iron stores cause small RBCs. Therefore, as the anemia progresses, the MCV, which measures the size of the RBC, also decreases. Hematocrit and RBC levels are also low in relation to the hemoglobin level. Other laboratory tests that measure iron stores are useful but are not as consistent indicators as a low ferritin level, which reflects low iron stores. Typically, patients with iron deficiency anemia have a low serum iron level and an elevated TIBC, which measures the transport protein supplying the marrow with iron as needed (also referred to as transferrin). However, other disease states, such as infection and inflammatory conditions, can also cause a low serum iron level and TIBC with an elevated ferritin level. Therefore, the most reliable laboratory findings in evaluating iron deficiency anemia are the ferritin and hemoglobin values.

\section*{Medical Management}

Except in the case of pregnancy, the cause of iron deficiency should be investigated. Anemia may be a sign of a curable gastrointestinal cancer or of uterine fibroid tumors. Stool specimens should be tested for occult blood. People 50 years of age or older should have a colonoscopy, endoscopy, or other examination of the gastrointestinal tract to detect ulcerations, gastritis, polyps, or cancer. Several oral iron preparations-ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate-are available for treating iron deficiency anemia. In some cases, oral iron is poorly absorbed or poorly tolerated, or iron supplementation is needed in large amounts. In these situations, intravenous or intramuscular administration of iron dextran may be needed. Before parenteral administration of a full dose, a small test dose should be administered to avoid the risk of anaphylaxis with either intravenous or intramuscular injections. Emergency medications (eg, epinephrine) should be close at hand.If no signs of allergic reaction have occured after 30 minutes, the remaining dose of iron may be administered. Several doses are required to replenish the patient's iron stores.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Preventive education is important, because iron deficiency anemia is common in menstruating and pregnant women. Food sources high in iron include organ meats (beef or calf's liver, chicken liver), other meats, beans (black, pinto, and garbanzo), leafy green vegetables, raisins, and molasses. Taking iron-rich foods with a source of vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron.

The nurse helps the patient select a healthy diet. Nutritional counseling can be provided for those whose usual diet is inadequate. Patients with a history of eating fad diets or strict vegetarian diets are counseled that such diets often contain inadequate amounts of absorbable iron. The nurse encourages patients to continue iron therapy as long as it is prescribed, although they may no longer feel fatigued.

Because iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, patients should be advised to take the supplement an hour before meals. Most patients can use the less expensive, more standard forms of ferrous sulfate. Tablets with enteric coating may be poorly

\section*{Chart 33-2 - PATIENT EDUCATION}

\section*{Taking Iron Supplements}

Iron supplementation is usually given in oral form, typically as ferrous sulfate, or $\mathrm{FeSO}_{4}$. Many patients have difficulty tolerating iron supplements, primarily due to gastrointestinal toxicities (eg, nausea, abdominal discomfort, constipation). Here are some helpful guidelines for taking iron supplements:
- Take iron on an empty stomach ( 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Iron absorption is reduced with food, especially dairy products.
- To prevent gastrointestinal distress, the following schedule may work better if more than one tablet a day is prescribed: Start with only one tablet per day for a few days, then increase
to two tablets per day, then three tablets per day. This method permits the body to adjust gradually to the iron.
- Increase the intake of vitamin C (citrus fruits and juices, strawberries, tomatoes, broccoli), to enhance iron absorption.
- Eat foods high in fiber to minimize problems with constipation.
- Remember that stools will become dark in color.

Polysaccharide iron complex forms are better tolerated but are more expensive. Liquid forms of iron supplementation may be better tolerated than solid forms, although they are more expensive. The liquid forms can discolor teeth. Use a straw or place the spoon at the back of the mouth to take the supplement; rinse mouth thoroughly afterward.
absorbed and should be avoided. Other patients have difficulty taking iron supplements because of gastrointestinal side effects (primarily constipation, but also cramping, nausea, and vomiting). Some iron formulations are designed to limit gastrointestinal side effects by the addition of a stool softener or use of sustainedrelease formulations to limit nausea or gastritis. Specific patient teaching aids, such as the accompanying patient education guide (Chart 33-2), can assist patients with the use of iron supplements.

If taking iron on an empty stomach causes gastric distress, the patient may need to take the iron supplement with meals. However, doing so diminishes iron absorption by as much as $50 \%$, thus prolonging the time required to replenish iron stores. Antacids or dairy products should not be taken with iron, because they greatly diminish the absorption of iron. Polysaccharide iron complex forms that have less gastrointestinal toxicity are also available, but they are more expensive.

Liquid forms of iron that cause less gastrointestinal distress are available. However, they can stain the teeth; patients should be instructed to take this medication through a straw, to rinse the mouth with water, and to practice good oral hygiene after taking this medication. Finally, patients should be informed that iron salts may color the stool dark green or black. However, iron replacement therapy does not cause a false-positive result on stool analyses for occult blood.

Intramuscular supplementation is used infrequently. The volume of iron required may be excessive. The intramuscular injection causes some local pain and can stain the skin. These side effects are minimized by using the Z-track technique for administering iron dextran deep into the gluteus maximus muscle (buttock). Avoid vigorously rubbing the injection site after the injection. Because of the problems with intramuscular administration, the intravenous route is preferred for administration of iron dextran.

\section*{ANEMIAS IN RENAL DISEASE}

The degree of anemia in patients with end-stage renal disease varies greatly, but in general patients do not become significantly anemic until the serum creatinine level exceeds $3 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}$. The symptoms of anemia are often the most disturbing of the patient's symptoms. The hematocrit usually falls to between $20 \%$ and $30 \%$, although in rare cases it may fall to less than $15 \%$. The RBCs appear normal on the peripheral smear.

This anemia is caused by both a mild shortening of RBC life span and a deficiency of erythropoietin (necessary for erythro-
poiesis). As renal function decreases, erythropoietin, which is produced by the kidney, also decreases. Because erythropoietin is also produced outside the kidney, some erythropoiesis does continue, even in patients whose kidneys have been removed. However, the amount is small and the degree of erythropoiesis is inadequate.

Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis lose blood into the dialyzer and therefore may become iron deficient. Folic acid deficiency develops because this vitamin passes into the dialysate. Therefore, patients who receive hemodialysis and who are anemic should be evaluated for iron and folate deficiency and treated appropriately.

The availability of recombinant erythropoietin (epoetin alfa [Epogen, Procrit]) has dramatically altered the management of anemia in end-stage renal disease by decreasing the need for RBC transfusion, with its associated risks. Erythropoietin, in combination with oral iron supplements, can raise and maintain hematocrit levels to between $33 \%$ and $38 \%$. This treatment has been successful with dialysis patients. Many patients report decreased fatigue, increased energy, increased feelings of well-being, improved exercise tolerance, better tolerance of dialysis treatments, and improved quality of life. Hypertension is the most serious side effect in this patient population when the hematocrit rapidly increases to a high level. Therefore, the hematocrit should be checked frequently when a patient with renal disease begins erythropoietin therapy. The dose of erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) should be titrated to the hematocrit. In some patients, the elevated hematocrit and associated hypertension may necessitate antihypertensive therapy.

\section*{ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE}

The term "anemia of chronic disease" is a misnomer in that only the chronic diseases of inflammation, infection, and malignancy cause this type of anemia. Many chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with a normochromic, normocytic anemia (ie, the RBCs are normal in color and size). These disorders include rheumatoid arthritis; severe, chronic infections; and many cancers. It is therefore imperative that the "chronic disease" be diagnosed when this form of anemia is identified so that it can be appropriately managed.

The anemia is usually mild to moderate and nonprogressive. It develops gradually over 6 to 8 weeks and then stabilizes at a hematocrit seldom less than $25 \%$. The hemoglobin level rarely falls below $9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, and the bone marrow has normal cellularity
with increased stores of iron as the iron is diverted from the serum (and thus is unavailable as a growth factor for invading pathogens). Erythropoietin levels are low, perhaps because of decreased production, and iron use is blocked by erythroid cells (cells that are or will become mature RBCs). A moderate shortening of RBC survival also occurs.

Most of these patients have few symptoms and do not require treatment for the anemia. With successful treatment of the underlying disorder, the bone marrow iron is used to make RBCs and the hemoglobin level rises.

\section*{APLASTIC ANEMIA}

Aplastic anemia is a rather rare disease caused by a decrease in or damage to marrow stem cells, damage to the microenvironment within the marrow, and replacement of the marrow with fat. It results in bone marrow aplasia (markedly reduced hematopoiesis). Therefore, in addition to severe anemia, significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (a deficiency of platelets) are also seen.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Aplastic anemia can be congenital or acquired, but most cases are idiopathic (ie, without apparent cause). Infections and pregnancy can trigger it, or it may be caused by certain medications, chemicals, or radiation damage (Chart 33-3). Agents that regularly produce marrow aplasia include benzene and benzene derivatives (eg, airplane glue). Certain toxic materials, such as inorganic arsenic and several pesticides (including DDT, which is no longer used or available in the United States), have also been implicated as potential causes. Various medications have been associated with aplastic anemia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The manifestations of aplastic anemia are often insidious. Complications resulting from bone marrow failure may occur before

the diagnosis is established. Typical complications are infection and symptoms of anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor, dyspnea). Purpura (bruising) may develop later and should trigger a CBC and hematologic evaluation if these were not performed initially. If the patient has had repeated throat infections, cervical lymphadenopathy may be seen. Other lymphadenopathies and splenomegaly sometimes occur. Retinal hemorrhages are common.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In many situations, aplastic anemia occurs when a medication or chemical is ingested in toxic amounts. However, in a few people, it develops after a medication has been taken at the recommended dosage. This may be considered an idiosyncratic reaction in those who are highly susceptible, possibly caused by a genetic defect in the medication biotransformation or elimination process. A bone marrow aspirate shows an extremely hypoplastic or even aplastic (very few to no cells) marrow replaced with fat.

\section*{Medical Management}

It is presumed that the lymphocytes of patients with aplastic anemia destroy the stem cells and consequently impair the production of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. Despite its severity, aplastic anemia can be successfully treated in most people. Potentially, those who are younger than 60 years of age, who are otherwise healthy, and who have a compatible donor can be cured of the disease by a bone marrow transplantaton (BMT) or peripheral stem cell transplantation (BSCT). In others, the disease can be managed with immunosuppressive therapy. A combination of antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine is used most commonly. Immunosuppressants prevent the patient's lymphocytes from destroying the stem cells. If relapse occurs (ie, the patient becomes pancytopenic again), reinstitution of the same immunologic agents may induce another remission. Corticosteroids are not very useful as an immunosuppressive agent, because patients with aplastic anemia appear particularly susceptible to the development of bone complications from corticosteroids (ie, aseptic necrosis of the head of the femur).

Supportive therapy plays a major role in the management of aplastic anemia. Any offending agent is discontinued. The patient is supported with transfusions of RBCs and platelets as necessary. Death usually is caused by hemorrhage or infection.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients with aplastic anemia are vulnerable to problems related to RBC, WBC, and platelet deficiencies. They should be assessed carefully for signs of infection and bleeding. Specific interventions are delineated in the sections on neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

\section*{MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIAS}

In the anemias caused by deficiencies of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folic acid, identical bone marrow and peripheral blood changes occur, because both vitamins are essential for normal DNA synthesis. In either anemia, the RBCs that are produced are abnormally large and are called megaloblastic RBCs. Other cells derived from the myeloid stem cell (nonlymphoid WBCs, platelets) are also abnor-
mal. A bone marrow analysis reveals hyperplasia (abnormal increase in the number of cells), and the precursor erythroid and myeloid cells are large and bizarre in appearance. Many of these abnormal RBCs and myeloid cells are destroyed within the marrow, however, so the mature cells that do leave the marrow are actually fewer in number. Thus, pancytopenia (a decrease in all myeloid-derived cells) can develop. In an advanced situation, the hemoglobin value may be as low as 4 to $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, the WBC count 2,000 to $3,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, and the platelet count less than $50,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. Those cells that are released into the circulation are often abnormally shaped. The neutrophils are hypersegmented. The platelets may be abnormally large. The RBCs are abnormally shaped, and the shapes may vary widely (poikilocytosis). Because the RBCs are very large, the MCV is very high, usually exceeding $110 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{3}$.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

\section*{FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY}

Folic acid, a vitamin that is necessary for normal RBC production, is stored as compounds referred to as folates. The folate stores in the body are much smaller than those of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, and they are quickly depleted when the dietary intake of folate is deficient (within 4 months). Folate is found in green vegetables and liver. Folate deficiency occurs in people who rarely eat uncooked vegetables. Alcohol increases folic acid requirements, and, at the same time, patients with alcoholism usually have a diet that is deficient in the vitamin. Folic acid requirements are also increased in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias and in women who are pregnant, because the need for RBC production is increased in these conditions. Some patients with malabsorptive diseases of the small bowel, such as sprue, may not absorb folic acid normally.

\section*{VITAMIN B ${ }_{12}$ DEFICIENCY}

A deficiency of vitamin $B_{12}$ can occur in several ways. Inadequate dietary intake is rare but can develop in strict vegetarians who consume no meat or dairy products. Faulty absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is more common. This occurs in conditions such as Crohn's disease, or after ileal resection or gastrectomy. Another cause is the absence of intrinsic factor, as in pernicious anemia. Intrinsic factor is normally secreted by cells within the gastric mucosa; normally it binds with the dietary vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and travels with it to the ileum, where the vitamin is absorbed. Without intrinsic factor, orally consumed vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ cannot be absorbed, and RBC production is eventually diminished. Even if adequate vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and intrinsic factor are present, a deficiency may occur if disease involving the ileum or pancreas impairs absorption. Pernicious anemia, which tends to run in families, is primarily a disorder of adults, particularly the elderly. The abnormality is in the gastric mucosa: the stomach wall atrophies and fails to secrete intrinsic factor. Therefore, the absorption of vita$\min B_{12}$ is significantly impaired.

The body normally has large stores of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, so years may pass before the deficiency results in anemia. Because the body compensates so well, the anemia can be severe before the patient becomes symptomatic. For unknown reasons, patients with pernicious anemia have a higher incidence of gastric cancer than the general population; these patients should have endoscopies at regular intervals (every 1 to 2 years) to screen for early gastric cancer.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of folic acid and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiencies are similar, and the two anemias may coexist. However, the neurologic manifestations of vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency do not occur with folic acid deficiency, and they persist if $B_{12}$ is not replaced. Therefore, careful distinction between the two anemias must be made. Serum levels of both vitamins can be measured. In the case of folic acid deficiency, even small amounts of folate will increase the serum folate level, sometimes to normal. Measuring the amount of folate within the RBC itself (red cell folate) is therefore a more sensitive test in determining true folate deficiency.

After the body stores of vitamin $B_{12}$ are depleted, patients may begin to show signs of the anemia. However, because the onset and progression of the anemia are so gradual, the body can compensate very well until the anemia is severe, so that the typical manifestations of anemia (weakness, listlessness, fatigue) may not be apparent initially. The hematologic effects of deficiency are accompanied by effects on other organ systems, particularly the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. Patients with pernicious anemia develop a smooth, sore, red tongue and mild diarrhea. They are extremely pale, particularly in the mucous membranes. They may become confused; more often they have paresthesias in the extremities (particularly numbness and tingling in the feet and lower legs). They may have difficulty maintaining their balance because of damage to the spinal cord, and they also lose position sense (proprioception). These symptoms are progressive, although the course of illness may be marked by spontaneous partial remissions and exacerbations. Without treatment, patients can die after several years, usually from heart failure secondary to anemia.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The classic method of determining the cause of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency is the Schilling test, in which the patient receives a small oral dose of radioactive vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, followed in a few hours by a large, nonradioactive parenteral dose of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (this aids in renal excretion of the radioactive dose). If the oral vitamin is absorbed, more than $8 \%$ will be excreted in the urine within 24 hours; therefore, if no radioactivity is present in the urine (ie, the radioactive vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ stays within the gastrointestinal tract), the cause is gastrointestinal malabsorption of the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Conversely, if the urine is radioactive, the cause of the deficiency is not ileal disease or pernicious anemia. Later, the same procedure is repeated, but this time intrinsic factor is added to the oral radioactive vita$\min \mathrm{B}_{12}$. If radioactivity is now detected in the urine (ie, the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in the presence of intrinsic factor), the diagnosis of pernicious anemia can be made. The Schilling test is useful only if the urine collections are complete; therefore, the nurse must promote the patient's understanding and ability to comply with this collection.

Another useful, easier test is the intrinsic factor antibody test. A positive test indicates the presence of antibodies that bind the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-intrinsic factor complex and prevent it from binding to receptors in the ileum, thus preventing its absorption. Unfortunately, this test is not specific for pernicious anemia alone, but it can aid in the diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Folate deficiency is treated by increasing the amount of folic acid in the diet and administering 1 mg of folic acid daily. Folic acid is administered intramuscularly only for people with malab-
sorption problems. With the exception of the vitamins administered during pregnancy, most proprietary vitamin preparations do not contain folic acid, so it must be administered as a separate tablet. After the hemoglobin level returns to normal, the folic acid replacement can be stopped. However, patients with alcoholism should continue receiving folic acid as long as they continue alcohol consumption.

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency is treated by vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ replacement. Vegetarians can prevent or treat deficiency with oral supplements through vitamins or fortified soy milk. When, as is more common, the deficiency is due to defective absorption or absence of intrinsic factor, replacement is by monthly intramuscular injections of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, usually at a dose of $1000 \mu \mathrm{~g}$. The reticulocyte count rises within 1 week, and in several weeks the blood counts are all normal. The tongue improves in several days. However, the neurologic manifestations require more time for recovery; if there is severe neuropathy, the patient may never recover fully. To prevent recurrence of pernicious anemia, vitamin $B_{12}$ therapy must be continued for life.

> NURSING ALERT Even when the anemia is severe, RBC transfusions should not be used because the patient's body has compensated over time by expanding the total blood volume. Administration of blood transfusions to such patients, particularly those who are elderly or who have cardiac dysfunction, can precipitate pulmonary edema. If transfusions are required, the RBCs should be transfused slowly, with careful attention to signs and symptoms of fluid overload.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Assessment of patients who have or are at risk for megaloblastic anemia includes inspection of the skin and mucous membranes. Mild jaundice may be apparent and is best seen in the sclera without using fluorescent lights. Vitiligo (patchy loss of skin pigmentation) and premature graying of the hair are often seen in patients with pernicious anemia. The tongue is smooth, red, and sore. Because of the neurologic complications associated with these anemias, a careful neurologic assessment is important, including tests of position and vibration sense.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

The nurse needs to pay particular attention to ambulation and should assess the patient's gait and stability as well as the need for assistive devices (eg, canes, walkers) and for assistance in managing daily activities. Of particular concern is ensuring safety when position sense, coordination, and gait are affected. Physical and occupational therapy referrals may be needed.

If sensation is altered, patients need to be instructed to avoid excessive heat and cold.

Because mouth and tongue soreness may restrict nutritional intake, the nurse can advise patients and families to prepare bland, soft foods and to eat small amounts frequently. The nurse also may explain that other nutritional deficiencies, such as alcohol-induced anemia, can induce neurologic problems.

Patients must also be taught about the chronicity of their disorder and the necessity for monthly vitamin $B_{12}$ injections even in the absence of symptoms. Many patients can be instructed to self-administer their injections. The gastric atrophy associated with pernicious anemia increases the risk of gastric carcinoma, so these patients need to understand that ongoing medical followup and screening are important.

\section*{MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES (MDS)}

The MDSs are a group of disorders of the myeloid stem cell that cause dysplasia (abnormal development) in one or more types of cell lines. The most common feature of MDS-dysplasia of the RBCs-is manifested as a macrocytic anemia; however, the WBCs (myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils) and platelets can also be affected. Although the bone marrow is actually hypercellular, many of the cells within it die before being released into the circulation. Therefore, the number of affected cells in the circulation is typically lower than normal. In addition to the quantitative defect (ie, fewer cells than normal), there is also a qualitative defect: the cells are not as functional as normal. The neutrophils have diminished ability to destroy bacteria by phagocytosis; platelets are less able to aggregate and are less adhesive than usual. The result of these qualitative defects is an increased risk for infection and bleeding, even when the actual number of circulating cells may not be excessively low. A significant proportion of MDS cases evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML); this type of leukemia tends to be nonresponsive to standard therapy.

Primary MDS tends to be a disease of the elderly; more than $80 \%$ of patients with MDS are older than 60 years of age. Secondary MDS may occur at any age and results from prior toxic exposure to chemicals, including chemotherapeutic medications (particularly alkylating agents). Secondary MDS tends to have a poorer prognosis than does primary MDS.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The manifestations of MDS can vary widely. Many patients are asymptomatic, with the illness being discovered incidentally when a CBC is performed for other purposes. Other patients have profound symptoms and complications from the illness. Fatigue is often present, at varying levels. Neutrophil dysfunction renders the person at risk for infection; recurrent pneumonias are not uncommon. Because platelet function can also be altered, bleeding can occur. These problems may persist in a fairly steady state for months, even years. They may also progress over time; as the dysplasia evolves into a leukemic state, the complications increase in severity.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The CBC typically reveals a macrocytic anemia; WBC and platelet counts may be diminished as well. Serum erythropoietin levels may be inappropriately low, as is the reticulocyte count. As the disease evolves into AML, more immature blast cells are noted on the CBC.

\section*{Medical Management}

With the exception of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), there is no known cure for MDS. Chemotherapy has been used, particularly in patients with more aggressive forms of the illness, typically with disappointing results (Deeg \& Applebaum, 2000; Beran, 2000). However, patients with mild cytopenias (low blood counts) actually require no therapy. For most patients with MDS, transfusions of RBCs are required to control the anemia and its symptoms. These patients can develop significant problems with iron overload from the repeated transfusions; this problem can be diminished with prompt initiation of chelation therapy to remove the excess iron (see Nursing Management). In some patients, the use of erythropoietin can be successful in
reducing the need for transfusions and their attendant complications. Some patients may also require ongoing platelet transfusions to prevent significant bleeding. Infections need to be managed aggressively and promptly. Administration of growth factors, particularly granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), erythropoietin, or both, has been successful in increasing neutrophils and diminishing anemia in certain patients; however, these agents are expensive and the effect is lost if the medications are stopped. Because MDS tend to occur in elderly people, other chronic conditions may limit treatment options. Secondary MDS and MDS that evolves into AML tend to be much more refractory to conventional therapy for leukemia.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Caring for patients with MDS can be challenging because the illness is unpredictable. As with other hematologic conditions, some patients (especially those with no symptoms) have difficulty perceiving that they have a serious illness that can place them at risk for life-threatening complications. At the other extreme, many patients have tremendous difficulty coping with the uncertain trajectory of the illness and fear that the illness will evolve into AML at a time when they are feeling very well physically.

Patients with MDS need extensive instruction about infection risk, measures to avoid it, signs and symptoms of developing infection, and appropriate actions to initiate should such symptoms occur. Instruction should also be given regarding the risk for bleeding. Patients with MDS who are hospitalized may require neutropenic precautions.

Laboratory values need to be monitored closely to anticipate the need for transfusion and to determine response to treatment with growth factors. Patients with chronic transfusion requirements usually benefit from a vascular access device for this purpose. Patients receiving growth factors or chelation therapy must be educated about these medications, their side effects, and administration techniques.

Chelation therapy is a process that is used to remove excess iron acquired from chronic transfusions. Iron is bound to a substance, the chelating agent, and then excreted in the urine. Oral forms of chelating agents have not been successful (due to either diminished efficacy or excessive toxicity). Chelation therapy is most effective as a subcutaneous infusion administered over 8 to 12 hours; most patients prefer to do this at night. Because chelation therapy removes only a small amount of iron with each treatment, patients with chronic transfusion requirements (and iron overload) need to continue chelation therapy as long as the iron overload exists, potentially for the rest of their lives. Patients who are embarking on chelation therapy must be highly motivated and need instruction in the subcutaneous infusion technique, infusion pump maintenance, and side effect management. Local erythema at the injection site is the most common reaction and typically requires no intervention. Patients should have baseline and annual auditory and eye examinations, because hearing loss and visual changes can occur with treatment.

\section*{Hemolytic Anemias}

In hemolytic anemias, the RBCs have a shortened life span; thus, the number of RBCs in circulation is reduced. Fewer RBCs result in decreased in available oxygen causes hypoxia, which in turn stimulates an increase in erythropoietin release from the kidney. The erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to compensate by
producing new RBCs and releasing some of them into the circulation somewhat prematurely as reticulocytes. If the RBC destruction persists, the hemoglobin is broken down excessively; about $80 \%$ of the heme is converted to bilirubin, conjugated in the liver, and excreted in the bile.

The mechanism of RBC destruction varies, but all types of hemolytic anemia share certain laboratory features: the reticulocyte count is elevated, the fraction of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin is increased, and the supply of haptoglobin (a binding protein for free hemoglobin) is depleted as more hemoglobin is released. As a result, the plasma haptoglobin level is low. If the marrow cannot compensate to replace the RBCs (indicated by a decreased reticulocyte count), the anemia will progress.

Hemolytic anemia has various forms. Among the inherited forms are sickle cell anemia, thalassemia and thalassemia major, G-6-PD deficiency, and hereditary spherocytosis. Acquired forms include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, nonimmune-mediated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and heart valve hemolysis, as well as anemias associated with hypersplenism.

\section*{SICKLE CELL ANEMIA}

Sickle cell anemia is a severe hemolytic anemia that results from inheritance of the sickle hemoglobin gene. This gene causes the hemoglobin molecule to be defective. The sickle hemoglobin ( HbS ) acquires a crystal-like formation when exposed to low oxygen tension. The oxygen level in venous blood can be low enough to cause this change; consequently, the RBC containing ( HbS ) loses its round, very pliable, biconcave disk shape and becomes deformed, rigid, and sickle-shaped (Fig. 33-5). These long, rigid RBCs can adhere to the endothelium of small vessels; when they pile up against each other, blood flow to a region or an organ may be reduced (Hoffman, et al., 2000). If ischemia or infarction results, the patient may have pain, swelling, and fever. The sickling process takes time; if the RBC is again exposed to adequate amounts of oxygen (eg, when it travels through the pulmonary circulation) before the membrane becomes too rigid, it can revert to a normal shape. For this reason, the "sickling crises" are intermittent. Cold can aggravate

the sickling process, because vasoconstriction slows the blood flow. Oxygen delivery can also be impaired by an increased blood viscosity, with or without occlusion due to adhesion of sickled cells; in this situation, the effects are seen in larger vessels, such as arterioles.

The $H b S$ gene is inherited in people of African descent and to a lesser extent in people from the Middle East, the Mediterranean area, and aboriginal tribes in India. Sickle cell anemia is the most severe form of sickle cell disease. Less severe forms include sickle cell hemoglobin C (SC) disease, sickle cell hemoglobin D (SD) disease, and sickle cell beta-thalassemia. The clinical manifestations and management are the same as for sickle cell anemia. The term sickle cell trait refers to the carrier state for SC diseases; it is the most benign type of SC disease, in that less than $50 \%$ of the hemoglobin within an RBC is HbS . However, in terms of genetic counseling, it is still an important condition. If two people with sickle cell trait have children, the children may inherit two abnormal genes. These children will produce only HbS and therefore will have sickle cell anemia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of sickle cell anemia vary and are only somewhat based on the amount of HbS . Symptoms and complications result from chronic hemolysis or thrombosis. The sickled RBCs have a shortened life span. Patients are always anemic, usually with hemoglobin values of 7 to $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$. Jaundice is characteristic and is usually obvious in the sclerae. The bone marrow expands in childhood in a compensatory effort to offset the anemia, sometimes leading to enlargement of the bones of the face and skull. The chronic anemia is associated with tachycardia, cardiac murmurs, and often an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly). Dysrhythmias and heart failure may occur in adults.

Virtually any organ may be affected by thrombosis, but the primary sites involve those areas with slowed circulation, such as the spleen, lungs, and central nervous system. All the tissues and organs are constantly vulnerable to microcirculatory interruptions by the sickling process and therefore are susceptible to hypoxic damage or true ischemic necrosis. Patients with sickle cell anemia are unusually susceptible to infection, particularly pneumonia and osteomyelitis. Complications of sickle cell anemia include infection, stroke, renal failure, impotence, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Table 33-4 summarizes the complications resulting from sickle cell anemia.

\section*{SICKLE CELL CRISIS}

There are three types of sickle cell crisis in the adult population. The most common is the very painful sickle crisis, which results from tissue hypoxia and necrosis due to inadequate blood flow to a specific region of tissue or organ. Aplastic crisis results from infection with the human parvovirus. The hemoglobin level falls rapidly and the marrow cannot compensate, as evidenced by an absence of reticulocytes. Sequestration crisis results when other organs pool the sickled cells. Although the spleen is the most common organ responsible for sequestration in children, by 10 years of age most children with sickle cell anemia have had a splenic infarction and the spleen is then no longer functional (autosplenectomy). In adults, the common organs involved in sequestration are the liver and, more seriously, the lungs.

\section*{ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME}

Acute chest syndrome is manifested by a rapidly falling hemoglobin level, tachycardia, fever, and bilateral infiltrates seen on the chest x-ray. These signs often mimic infection; in fact, recent studies have identified infection as a major cause of acute chest syndrome (Vichinsky, et al., 2000). Another common cause is pulmonary fat embolism. Increased secretory phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$

concentration has been identified as a predictor of impending acute chest syndrome; the increased amounts of free fatty acids can cause increased permeability of the pulmonary endothelium and leakage of the pulmonary capillaries. Although this syndrome is potentially lethal, prompt intervention can result in a favorable outcome.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient with sickle cell trait usually has a normal hemoglobin level, a normal hematocrit, and a normal blood smear. In contrast, the patient with sickle cell anemia has a low hematocrit and sickled cells on the smear. The diagnosis is confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis.

\section*{Prognosis}

Patients with sickle cell anemia are usually diagnosed in childhood, because they become anemic in infancy and begin to have sickle cell crises at 1 or 2 years of age. Some children die in the first years of life, typically from infection, but the use of antibiotics and parent teaching have greatly improved the outcomes for these children. However, with current management strategies, the average life expectancy is still suboptimal, at 42 years. Young adults are often forced to live with multiple, often severe, complications from their disease. In some patients, the symptoms and complications diminish by 30 years of age; these patients live into the sixth decade or longer. At this time, there is no way to predict which patients will fall into this subgroup.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment for sickle cell anemia is the focus of continued research (Steinberg, 1999). Many trials of medications that have antisickling properties are being conducted, as is research using antiadhesion treatment for vasoocclusive crises. However, aside from the equally important aggressive management of symptoms and complications, currently there are only three primary treatment modalities for sickle cell diseases: BMT, hydroxyurea, and longterm RBC transfusion.

BMT offers the potential for cure for this disease. However, this treatment modality is available to only a small subset of the patient population, because of either the lack of a compatible donor or the severe organ (eg, renal, liver, lung) damage already present in the patient.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Hydroxyurea (Hydrea), a chemotherapy agent, has been shown to be effective in increasing hemoglobin F levels in patients with sickle cell anemia, thereby decreasing the permanent formation of sickled cells. Patients who receive hydroxyurea appear to have fewer painful episodes of sickle cell crisis, a lower incidence of acute chest syndrome, and less need for transfusions (Ferster et al., 2001). However, whether hydroxyurea can prevent or reverse actual organ damage remains unknown. Side effects of hydroxyurea include chronic suppression of WBC formation, teratogenesis, and potential for later development of a malignancy. Patient response to the medication varies significantly. The incidence and severity of side effects are also highly variable within a dose range. Some patients have toxicity when receiving a very small dose ( $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day), whereas others have little toxicity with a much higher dose ( $35 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day). More research is needed to identify specific patient subgroups that are more likely to respond to this medication.

\section*{TRANSFUSION THERAPY}

Chronic transfusions with RBCs have been shown to be highly effective in several situations: in an acute exacerbation of anemia (eg, aplastic crisis), in the prevention of severe complications from anesthesia and surgery, and in improving the response to infection (when it results in exacerbated anemia) (Ohene-Frempong, 2001). Chronic transfusions have also been shown to be effective in diminishing episodes of sickle cell crisis in pregnant women; however, these transfusions have not been shown to improve fetal survival. Transfusion therapy may be effective in preventing complications from sickle cell disease. Although controversial, some data support the use of chronic transfusions in patients with cerebral ischemic injury (as seen on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or Doppler studies) to prevent more severe injury (eg, CVA). More than $50 \%$ of asymptomatic patients have some cerebral ischemia documented by MRI. In a recent study (Adams, 2000), chronic transfusion with RBCs resulted in a $90 \%$ reduction of stroke in children at risk for this complication, as demonstrated by elevated blood viscosity on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Transfusions may also be useful in the management of severe cases of acute chest syndrome.

The risk of complications from transfusion is important to consider. These risks include iron overload, which necessitates chronic chelation therapy (see MDS Nursing Management); poor venous access, which necessitates a vascular access device (and its attendant risk for infection or thrombosis); infections (hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]); and alloimmunization from repeated transfusions. Another complication from transfusion is the increased viscosity of blood before the concentration of hemoglobin $S$ is reduced. Exchange transfusion (in which the patient's own blood is removed and replaced via transfusion) may be performed to diminish the risk of increasing the viscosity excessively; the objective is to reduce the hematocrit to less than $30 \%$, with transfusions supplying more than $80 \%$ of the patient's blood volume. Finally, it is important to consider the significant financial cost of an aggressive transfusion and chelation program.

Patients with sickle cell anemia require daily folic acid replacements to maintain the supply required for increased erythropoiesis from hemolysis. Infections must be treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics; infection remains a major cause of death in these patients.

Acute chest syndrome is managed by prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. Incentive spirometry has been shown to decrease the incidence of pulmonary complications significantly. In severe cases, bronchoscopy may be required to identify the source of pulmonary disease. Fluid restriction may be more beneficial than aggressive hydration. Corticosteroids may also be useful. Transfusions reverse the hypoxia and decrease the level of secretory phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$. Pulmonary function should be monitored regularly to detect pulmonary hypertension early, when therapy (hydroxyurea, transfusions, or transplantation) may have a positive impact.

Because repeated blood transfusions are necessary, patients may develop multiple autoantibodies, making cross-matching difficult. In this patient population, a hemolytic transfusion reaction (see later discussion) may mimic the signs and symptoms of a sickle cell crisis. The classic distinguishing factor is that, with a hemolytic transfusion reaction, the patient becomes more anemic after being transfused. These patients need very close observation. Further transfusion is avoided if possible until the hemolytic process abates. If possible, the patient is supported with corticosteroids (Prednisone), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; Gammagard, Sandoglobulin, Venoglobulin), and erythropoietin (Epogen, Procrit).

\section*{SUPPORTIVE THERAPY}

Supportive care is equally important. A significant issue is pain management. The incidence of painful sickle cell crises is highly variable; many patients have pain on a daily basis. The severity of the pain may not be enough to cause the patient to seek assistance from health care providers but severe enough to interfere with the ability to work and function within the family. Acute pain episodes tend to be self-limited, lasting hours to days. If the patient cannot manage the pain at home, intervention is frequently sought in the acute care setting, usually at an urgent care facility or emergency department. Adequate hydration is important during a painful sickling episode. Oral hydration is acceptable if the patient can maintain adequate amounts of fluids; intravenous hydration with dextrose $5 \%$ in water (D5W) or dextrose $5 \%$ in 0.25 normal saline solution ( $3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{m}^{2} / 24$ hours) is usually required for sickle crisis. Supplemental oxygen may also be needed.

The use of medication to relieve pain is important (see Chap. 13 for a discussion of pain management). Aspirin is very useful in diminishing mild to moderate pain; it also diminishes inflammation and potential thrombosis (due to its ability to diminish platelet adhesion). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are useful for moderate pain or in combination with opioid analgesics. Although no tolerance develops with NSAIDs, a "ceiling effect" does develop whereby an increase in dosage does not increase analgesia. NSAID use must be carefully monitored, because these medications can precipitate renal dysfunction. When opioid analgesics are used, morphine is the medication of choice for acute pain. Patient-controlled analgesia is frequently used.

Chronic pain increases in incidence as the patient ages. Here, the pain is caused by complications from the sickling, such as avascular necrosis of the hip. With chronic pain management, the principal goal is to maximize functioning; pain may not be completely eliminated without sacrificing function. This concept may be difficult for patients to accept; they may need repeated explanations and support from nonjudgmental health care providers. Nonpharmacologic approaches to pain management are crucial in this setting. Examples include physical and occupational therapy, physiotherapy (including the use of heat, massage, and exercise), cognitive and behavioral intervention (including distraction, relaxation, and motivational therapy), and support groups.

Working with patients who have multiple episodes of severe pain can be challenging. It is important for health care providers to realize that patients with sickle cell disease must face a lifelong experience with severe and unpredictable pain. Such pain is disruptive to the person's level of functioning, including social functioning, and may result in a feeling of helplessness. Patients with inadequate social support systems may have more difficulty coping with chronic pain.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH SICKLE CELL CRISIS}

Patients in sickle cell crisis should be assessed for factors that could have precipitated the crisis, such as symptoms of infection or dehydration, or situations that promote fatigue or emotional stress.

\section*{Assessment}

Patients are asked to recall factors that seemed to precipitate previous crises and measures they use to prevent and manage crises. Pain levels should always be monitored; a pain-rating scale, such as a 0 -to- 10 scale, best accomplishes this. The quality of the pain (eg, sharp, dull, burning), the frequency of the pain (constant versus intermittent), and factors that aggravate or alleviate the pain
are included in this assessment. If a sickle cell crisis is suspected, the nurse needs to determine whether the pain currently experienced is the same as or different than the pain typically encountered in crisis.

Because the sickling process can interrupt circulation in any tissue or organ, with resultant hypoxia and ischemia, a careful assessment of all body systems is necessary. Particular emphasis is placed on assessing for pain, swelling, and fever. All joint areas are carefully examined for pain and swelling. The abdomen is assessed for pain and tenderness because of the possibility of splenic infarction.

The respiratory system must be assessed carefully, including auscultation of breath sounds, measurement of oxygen saturation levels, and signs of cardiac failure, such as the presence and extent of dependent edema, an increased point of maximal impulse, and cardiomegaly (as seen on chest x-ray). The patient should be assessed for signs of dehydration by a history of fluid intake and careful examination of mucous membranes, skin turgor, urine output, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values.

A careful neurologic examination is important to elicit symptoms of cerebral hypoxia. However, ischemic findings on MRI or Doppler studies may significantly precede the findings on the physical examination. MRI and Doppler studies are used for early diagnosis and may be more beneficial to improve patient outcome, because therapy can be initiated more promptly.

Because patients with sickle cell anemia are so susceptible to infections, they are assessed for the presence of any infectious process. Particular attention is given to examination of the chest, long bones, and femoral head, because pneumonia and osteomyelitis are especially common. Leg ulcers, which may be infected and are slow to heal, are common.

The extent of anemia (as measured by the hemoglobin level and the hematocrit) and the ability of the marrow to replenish RBCs (as measured by the reticulocyte count) should be monitored and compared with the patient's baseline values. The patient's current and past history of medical management should also be assessed, particularly chronic transfusion therapy, hydroxyurea use, and prior treatment for infection.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient with sickle cell crisis may include:
- Acute pain related to tissue hypoxia due to agglutination of sickled cells within blood vessels
- Risk for infection
- Risk for powerlessness related to illness-induced helplessness
- Deficient knowledge regarding sickle crisis prevention

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Hypoxia, ischemia, infection, and poor wound healing leading to skin breakdown and ulcers
- Dehydration
- Cerebrovascular accident (CVA, brain attack, stroke)
- Anemia
- Renal dysfunction
- Heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and acute chest syndrome
- Impotence
- Poor compliance
- Substance abuse related to poorly managed chronic pain

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient are relief of pain, decreased incidence of crisis, enhanced sense of self-esteem and power, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MANAGING PAIN}

Acute pain during a sickle cell crisis can be severe and unpredictable. The patient's subjective description and rating of pain on a pain scale must guide the use of analgesics, which are valuable in controlling the acute pain of a sickle crisis. Any joint that is acutely swollen should be supported and elevated until the swelling diminishes. Relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, and distraction are helpful for some patients. After the acute painful episode has diminished, aggressive measures should be implemented to preserve function. Physical therapy, whirlpool baths, and transcutaneous nerve stimulation are examples of such modalities.

\section*{PREVENTING AND MANAGING INFECTION}

Nursing care focuses on monitoring the patient for signs and symptoms of infection. Prescribed antibiotics should be initiated promptly, and the patient should be assessed for signs of dehydration. If the patient is to take prescribed oral antibiotics at home, he or she must understand the need to complete the entire course of antibiotic therapy and must be able to identify a feasible administration schedule.

\section*{PROMOTING COPING SKILLS}

This illness, because of its acute exacerbations that often result in chronic health problems, frequently leaves the patient feeling powerless and with decreased self-esteem. These feelings can be exacerbated by inadequate pain management. The patient's ability to use normal coping resources of physical strength, psychological stamina, and positive self-esteem is dramatically diminished. Enhancing pain management can be extremely useful in establishing a therapeutic relationship based on mutual trust. Nursing care that focuses on the patient's strengths rather than deficits can enhance effective coping skills. Providing the patient with opportunities to make decisions about daily care may increase the patient's feelings of control.

\section*{MINIMIZING DEFICIENT KNOWLEDGE}

Patients with sickle cell anemia benefit from understanding what situations can precipitate a sickle cell crisis and the steps they can take to prevent or diminish such crises. Keeping warm and maintaining adequate hydration can be very effective in diminishing the occurrence and severity of attacks. Avoiding stressful situations is more challenging. Group education may be more effective if it is carried out by members of the community who are from the same ethnic group as those with the disease.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Management measures for many of the potential complications were delineated in previous sections. Other measures follow.

\section*{Leg Ulcers}

Leg ulcers require careful management and protection from trauma and contamination. Referral to a wound care specialist may facilitate healing and assist with prevention. If leg ulcers fail to heal, skin
grafting may be necessary. Scrupulous aseptic technique is warranted to prevent nosocomial infections.

\section*{Priapism Leading to Impotence}

Male patients may develop sudden, painful episodes of priapism (persistent penile erection). The patient is taught to empty his bladder at the onset of the attack, exercise, and take a warm bath. If an episode persists longer than 3 hours, medical attention is recommended. Repeated episodes may lead to extensive vascular thrombosis, resulting in impotence.

\section*{Chronic Pain and Substance Abuse}

Many patients have considerable difficulty coping with chronic pain and repeated episodes of sickle crisis. Those who feel they have little control over their health and the physical complications that result from this illness may find it difficult to understand the importance of complying with a prescribed treatment plan. Being nonjudgmental and actively seeking involvement from the patient in establishing a treatment plan are useful strategies.

Some patients with sickle cell anemia develop problems with substance abuse. For many, this abuse results from inadequate management of acute pain during episodes of crisis. Some clinicians suggest that abuse may result from prescribing inadequate amounts of opioid analgesics for an inadequate time. The patient's pain may never be adequately relieved, promoting mistrust of the health care system and (from the patient's perspective) the need to seek care from a variety of sources when the pain is not severe. This cycle is best managed by prevention. Receiving care from a single provider over time is much more beneficial than receiving care from rotating physicians and staff in an emergency department. When crises do arise, the staff in the emergency department should be in contact with the patient's primary health care provider so that optimal management can be achieved. Once the pattern of substance abuse is established, it is very difficult to manage, but continuity of care and establishing written contracts with the patient can be useful management strategies.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Because patients with sickle cell anemia are typically diagnosed as children, parents participate in the initial education. Based on the parents' education, literacy, socioeconomic level, and interest, teaching focuses on the disease process (including some pathophysiology), treatment, and the assessment and monitoring skills for potential complications (see previous discussion). As the child ages, educational interventions with the child prepare the child to assume more responsibility for self-care.

Vascular access device management and chelation therapy can be taught to most families. Follow-up and care for patients with vascular access devices may also need to be provided by nurses in an outpatient facility or by a home care agency.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The illness trajectory of sickle cell anemia is highly varied, with unpredictable episodes of complications and crises. Care is often provided on an emergency basis, especially for some patients with pain management problems (see previous section). Nurses in all settings used by this patient population need to communicate regularly with each other. Patients need to learn which parameters are important for them to monitor and how
to monitor them. Parameters should also be given as to when to seek urgent care.

\section*{THALASSEMIA}

The thalassemias are a group of hereditary disorders associated with defective hemoglobin-chain synthesis. These anemias occur worldwide, but the highest prevalence is found in people of Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian ancestry (Hoffman et al., 2000). Thalassemias are characterized by hypochromia (an abnormal decrease in the hemoglobin content of RBCs), extreme microcytosis (smaller-than-normal RBCs), destruction of blood elements (hemolysis), and variable degrees of anemia.

In thalassemia, the production of one or more globulin chains within the hemoglobin molecule is reduced. When this occurs, the imbalance in the configuration of the hemoglobin causes it to precipitate in the erythroid precursors or the RBCs themselves. This increases the rigidity of the RBCs and thus the premature destruction of these cells.

The thalassemias are classified into two major groups according to the globin chain diminished: alpha and beta. The alphathalassemias occur mainly in people from Asia and the Middle East; the beta-thalassemias are most prevalent in Mediterranean populations but also occur in people from the Middle East or Asia. The alpha-thalassemias are milder than the beta forms and often occur without symptoms. The RBCs are extremely microcytic, but the anemia, if present, is mild.

The severity of beta-thalassemia varies depending on the extent to which the hemoglobin chains are affected. Patients with mild forms have a microcytosis and mild anemia. If left untreated, severe beta-thalassemia (thalassemia major, or Cooley's anemia) can be fatal within the first few years of life. If it is treated with regular transfusion of RBCs, patients may survive into their 20s and 30s. Patient teaching during the reproductive years should include pre-conception counseling about the risk of congenital thalassemia major.

\section*{Thalassemia Major}

Thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia) is characterized by severe anemia, marked hemolysis, and ineffective erythropoiesis (production of RBCs). With early regular transfusion therapy, growth and development through childhood are facilitated. Organ dysfunction due to iron overload results from the excessive amounts of iron obtained through the RBC transfusions. Regular chelation therapy (eg, via subcutaneous deferoxamine) has reduced the complications of iron overload and prolonged the life of these patients. This disease is potentially curable by BMT if the procedure can be performed before damage to the liver occurs (ie, during childhood).

\section*{GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY}

The abnormality in this disorder is in the G-6-PD gene; this gene produces an enzyme within the RBC that is essential for membrane stability. A few patients have inherited an enzyme so defective that they have a chronic hemolytic anemia; however, the most common type of defect results in hemolysis only when the RBCs are stressed by certain situations, such as fever or the use of certain medications. The disorder came to the attention of researchers during World War II, when some soldiers developed hemolysis while taking primaquine, an antimalarial agent. African Americans and people of Greek or Italian origin are those primarily affected by this disorder. The type of deficiency found in the Mediterranean population is more severe than that in the African Caribbean population, resulting in greater hemolysis and sometimes in life-threatening anemia. All types of G-6-PD deficiency are inherited as X-linked defects; therefore, many more men are at risk than women. In the United States, about $12 \%$ of African American males are affected. The deficiency is also common in those of Asian ancestry and in certain Jewish populations.

Medications that have hemolytic effects for people with G-6-PD deficiency are oxidant drugs. These medications include antimalarial agents (eg, chloroquine [Aralen]), sulfonamides (eg, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [Septra]), nitrofurantoin (eg, Macrodantin), common coal tar analgesics (including aspirin in high doses), thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide [HydroDIURIL], chlorothiazide [Diuril]), oral hypoglycemic agents (eg, glyburide [Micronase], metformin [Glucophage]), chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), and vitamin K (phytonadione [AquaMephyton]). In affected people, a severe hemolytic episode can result from ingestion of fava beans.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients are asymptomatic and have normal hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts most of the time. However, several days after exposure to an offending medication, they may develop pallor, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine). The reticulocyte count rises, and symptoms of hemolysis develop. Special stains of the peripheral blood may then disclose Heinz bodies (degraded hemoglobin) within the RBCs. Hemolysis is often mild and self-limited. However, in the more severe Mediterranean type of G-6-PD deficiency, spontaneous recovery may not occur and transfusions may be necessary.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis is made by a screening test or by a quantitative assay of G-6-PD.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment is to stop the offending medication. Transfusion is necessary only in the severe hemolytic state, which is more commonly seen in the Mediterranean variety of G-6-PD deficiency.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient should be educated about the disease and given a list of medications to avoid. If hemolysis does develop, nursing interventions are the same as for hemolysis from other causes.

\section*{HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS}

Hereditary spherocytosis is a relatively common (1 in 5,000 people) hemolytic anemia characterized by an abnormal permeability of the RBC membrane; this permits the cells to change into a spherical shape. These RBCs are destroyed prematurely in the spleen. The severity of this hemolytic anemia varies; jaundice can be intermittent, and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) also can occur. Surgical removal of the spleen is the principal treatment for this disorder.

\section*{IMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA}

Hemolytic anemias can result from exposure of the RBC to antibodies. Alloantibodies (ie, antibodies against the host, or "self") result from the immunization of an individual with foreign antigens (eg, the immunization of an Rh-negative person with Rh-positive blood). Alloantibodies tend to be large (IgM type) and cause immediate destruction of the sensitized RBCs, either within the blood vessel (intravascular hemolysis) or within the liver. The most common type of alloimmune hemolytic anemia in adults results from a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

Autoantibodies are developed by an individual for varying reasons. In many instances, the person's immune system is dysfunctional, so that it falsely recognizes its own RBCs as foreign and produces antibodies against them. This mechanism is seen in people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Another mechanism is a deficiency in suppressor lymphocytes, which normally prevent antibody formation against a person's own antigens. Autoantibodies tend to be of the IgG type. The RBCs are sequestered in the spleen and destroyed by the macrophages outside the blood vessel (extravascular hemolysis).

Autoimmune hemolytic anemias can be classified based on the body temperature involved when the antibodies react with the RBC antigen. Warm-body antibodies bind to RBCs most actively in warm conditions ( $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ); cold-body antibodies react in cold $\left(0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. Most autoimmune hemolytic anemias are the warm-body type. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with other disorders in most cases (eg, medication exposure, lymphoma, CLL, other malignancy, collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease, infection). In idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic states, the reason why the immune system produces the antibodies is not known. All ages and genders are equally vulnerable to this form, whereas the incidence of secondary forms is greater in people older than 45 years of age and in females.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations can vary, and they usually reflect the degree of anemia. The hemolysis may be very mild, so that the patient's marrow compensates adequately and the patient is asymptomatic. At the other extreme, the hemolysis can be so severe that the resul-
tant anemia is life-threatening. Most patients complain of fatigue and dizziness. Splenomegaly is the most common physical finding, occurring in more than $80 \%$ of patients; hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice are also common.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The laboratory tests show a low hemoglobin level and hematocrit, most often with an accompanying increase in the reticulocyte count. RBCs appear abnormal; spherocytes are common. The serum bilirubin level is elevated, and if the hemolysis is severe, the haptoglobin level is low or absent. The Coombs test (also referred to as the direct antiglobulin test [DAT]), which detects antibodies on the surface of RBCs, shows a positive result.

\section*{Medical Management}

Any possibly offending medication should be immediately discontinued. The treatment consists of high doses of corticosteroids ( $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day) until hemolysis decreases. Corticosteroids decrease the macrophage's ability to clear the antibody-coated RBCs. If the hemoglobin level returns toward normal, usually after several weeks, the corticosteroid dose can be lowered or, in some cases, tapered and discontinued. However, corticosteroids rarely produce a lasting remission. In severe cases, blood transfusions may be required. Because the antibody may react with all possible donor cells, careful blood typing is necessary, and the transfusion should be administered slowly and cautiously.

Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) removes the major site of RBC destruction; therefore, splenectomy may be performed if corticosteroids do not produce a remission. If neither corticosteroid therapy nor splenectomy is successful, immunosuppressive agents may be administered. The two immunosuppressive agents most frequently used are cyclophosphamide (eg, Cytoxan), which has a more rapid effect but more toxicity, or azathioprine (Imuran), which has a less rapid effect but less toxicity. The synthetic androgen danazol (Cyclomen, Danocrine) can be useful in some patients, particularly in combination with corticosteroids. The mechanism for this success is unclear. If corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents are used, the taper must be very gradual to prevent a rebound "hyperimmune" response and exacerbation of the hemolysis. Immunoglobulin administration is effective in about one third of patients, but the effect is transient and the medication is expensive. Transfusions may be necessary if the anemia is severe; it may be extremely difficult to cross-match samples of available units of RBCs with that of the patient.

For patients with cold-antibody hemolytic anemia, treatment may not be required, other than to advise the patient to keep warm; relocation to a warm climate may be necessary.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients may have great difficulty understanding the pathologic mechanisms underlying the disease and need repeated explanations in terms they can understand. Patients who have had a splenectomy should be vaccinated against pneumococcal infections (Pneumovax) and informed that they are permanently at greater risk for infection. Patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, particularly those with concurrent diabetes or hypertension, need careful monitoring. They must understand the need for this medication and the importance of never abruptly discontinuing it. A written explanation and a tapering schedule should be provided, and adjustments based on hemoglobin levels
should be emphasized. Similar teaching should be provided when immunosuppressive agents are used. Corticosteroid therapy is not without significant risk, and patients need to be monitored closely for complications. The short- and long-term complications of corticosteroid therapy are presented in Chart 33-4 and in Chap. 42.

> NURSING ALERT It can be difficult to cross-match blood when antibodies are present. If imperfectly cross-matched RBCs must be transfused, the nurse begins the infusion very slowly ( 10 to 15 mL over 20 to 30 minutes) and monitors the patient very closely for signs and symptoms of a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

\section*{HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS}

Hemochromatosis is a genetic condition in which iron is abnormally (excessively) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The excessive iron is deposited in various organs, particularly the liver,
myocardium, testes, thyroid, and pancreas. Eventually, the affected organs become dysfunctional. The actual incidence of hemochromatosis is unknown; however, hereditary hemochromatosis is diagnosed in $0.5 \%$ of the population in the United States (ie, 1 million people). Recent data suggest that this defect may be a common cause of diabetes (Schechter, et al., 2000). Because of to their natural loss of iron through menses, women are less affected than men.

Because the accumulation of iron in body organs occurs gradually, there often is no evidence of tissue injury until middle age. Symptoms of weakness, lethargy, arthralgia, weight loss, and loss of libido are common. The skin may be hyperpigmented with melanin deposits (occasionally hemosiderin, an iron-containing pigment) and appears bronze in color. Cardiac dysrhythmias and cardiomyopathy can occur, with resulting dyspnea and edema. Endocrine dysfunction is manifested as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism (testicular atrophy, diminished libido, and impotence). A significant effect of hemochromatosis is the

Whenever a patient begins a course of corticosteroid therapy, the potential for complications is great. Dosing regimens vary widely, depending on the underlying hematologic condition and the patient's response to the medication. For example, several chemotherapy protocols include high doses of corticosteroids for a period of several days. After that time, the medication is stopped abruptly without tapering the dosage. In other conditions, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic anemias, the corticosteroids are very carefully tapered to prevent a flare up of the underlying disease. With the exception of patients with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis, it is difficult to predict which complications will occur in a given patient. Patients who receive high doses of corticosteroids for longer than a few weeks should be screened for symptoms related to the potential complications listed here. If at all possible, patients who require long-term corticosteroid use should be switched to an alternate-day dosing schedule; this method may diminish the severity of complications that arise.

development of hepatocellular carcinoma in one third of those affected. CBC values are typically normal. The most useful laboratory findings are an elevated serum iron level and high transferrin saturation (more than $60 \%$ in men, more than $50 \%$ in women). The definitive diagnostic test is a liver biopsy. Recently, a mutation in the $H F E$ gene has been shown to occur in most patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (Gochee \& Powell, 2001). Patients who are homozygous for the gene are at high risk for development of the disorder.

\section*{Medical Management}

Therapy involves the removal of excess iron via therapeutic phlebotomy (removal of whole blood from a vein). Each unit of blood removed results in a decrease of $200-250 \mathrm{mg}$ of iron. The objective typically is to reduce the serum ferritin to less than $50 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ and the transferrin saturation to $35 \%$ or less. To achieve this, a frequent phlebotomy schedule is required ( 1 to 2 units weekly), with a gradual reduction in frequency of phlebotomies over a 1 - to 3 -year period. After 1 to 3 years, the frequency of phlebotomy can be reduced to 1 unit of blood every several months to prevent reaccumulation of iron deposits. Removal of excess iron appears to diminish the severity of diabetes and skin hyperpigmentation; cardiac function also tends to improve.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients with hemochromatosis often believe that it is important to limit their dietary intake of iron, although this management method has been shown to be very ineffective and need not be encouraged. However, it is important for these patients to avoid any additional insults to the liver, such as alcohol abuse. Serial screening tests for hepatoma are important; alpha-fetoprotein is used for this purpose. Other body systems should be monitored for signs of organ dysfunction, particularly the endocrine and cardiac systems. These systems should also be screened routinely for dysfunction so that appropriate management can be implemented quickly. Because patients with hemochromatosis require frequent phlebotomies, problems with venous access are common. Patients who are heterozygous for the $H F E$ do not develop the disease but need to be counseled that they can transmit the gene to their children.

\section*{The Polycythemias}

Polycythemia refers to an increased volume of RBCs. It is a term used when the hematocrit is elevated (to more than $55 \%$ in males, more than $50 \%$ in females). Dehydration (decreased volume of plasma) can cause an elevated hematocrit, but not typically to the level to be considered polycythemia. Polycythemia is classified as either primary or secondary.

\section*{POLYCYTHEMIA VERA}

Polycythemia vera, or primary polycythemia, is a proliferative disorder in which the myeloid stem cells seem to have escaped normal control mechanisms. The bone marrow is hypercellular, and the RBC, WBC, and platelet counts in the peripheral blood are elevated. However, the RBC elevation is predominant; the hematocrit can exceed $60 \%$. This phase can last for an extended period (10 years or longer). The spleen resumes its embryonic function of hematopoiesis and enlarges. Over time, the bone marrow may become fibrotic, with a resultant inability to produce as many cells
("burnt out" or spent phase). The disease evolves into myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis or AML in a significant proportion of patients; this form of AML is usually refractory to standard treatments (Hoffman, et al., 2000). The median survival time exceeds 15 years (Gruppo Italiano Studio Policitemia, 1995).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients typically have a ruddy complexion and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). The symptoms result from the increased blood volume (headache, dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue, paresthesias, and blurred vision) or from increased blood viscosity (angina, claudication, dyspnea, and thrombophlebitis), particularly if the patient has atherosclerotic blood vessels. Another common and bothersome problem is generalized pruritus, which may be caused by histamine release due to the increased number of basophils. Erythromelalgia, a burning sensation in the fingers and toes, may be reported and is only partially relieved by cooling.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is made by finding an elevated RBC mass (a nuclear medicine procedure), a normal oxygen saturation level, and an enlarged spleen. Other factors useful in establishing the diagnosis include elevated WBC and platelet counts. The erythropoietin level is not as low as would be expected with an elevated hematocrit; it is normal or only slightly low. Causes of secondary erythrocytosis should not be present (see later discussion).

\section*{Complications}

Patients with polycythemia vera are at increased risk for thromboses resulting in a CVA (brain attack, stroke) or heart attack (MI); thrombotic complications are the most frequent cause of death. Bleeding is also a complication, possibly due to the fact that the platelets (often very large) are somewhat dysfunctional. The bleeding can be significant and can occur in the form of nosebleeds, ulcers, and frank gastrointestinal bleeding.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objective of management is to reduce the high blood cell mass. Phlebotomy is an important part of therapy and can be performed repeatedly to keep the hematocrit within normal range. This is achieved by removing enough blood (initially 500 mL once or twice weekly) to deplete the patient's iron stores, thereby rendering the patient iron deficient and consequently unable to continue to manufacture RBCs excessively. Patients need to be instructed to avoid iron supplements, including those within multivitamin supplements. If the patient has an elevated uric acid concentration, allopurinol (Zyloprim) is used to prevent gouty attacks. Antihistamines are not particularly effective in controlling itching. If the patient develops ischemic symptoms, dipyridamole (eg, Persantine) is sometimes used. Radioactive phosphorus ( ${ }^{32} \mathrm{P}$ ) or chemotherapeutic agents (eg, hydroxyurea [Hydrea]) can be used to suppress marrow function, but they may increase the risk for leukemia. Patients receiving hydroxyurea appear to have a lower incidence of thrombotic complications; this may result from a more controlled platelet count. The use of aspirin to prevent thrombotic complications is controversial. Lowdose aspirin is frequently used in patients with cardiovascular disease, but even this dose is often avoided in patients with prior bleeding, especially bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. Aspirin
is also useful in diminishing pain associated with erythromelalgia. Anagrelide (Agrylin) inhibits platelet aggregation and can also be useful in controlling the thrombocytosis associated with polycythemia vera. Interferon alfa-2b (Intron-A) has also been studied, but it may be difficult for patients to tolerate due to the frequent side effects experienced (Tefferi et al., 2000; Lengfelder, Berger, \& Hehlmann, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse's role is primarily that of educator. Risk factors for thrombotic complications should be assessed, and patients should be instructed regarding the signs and symptoms of thrombosis. Patients with a history of bleeding are usually advised to avoid aspirin and aspirin-containing medications, because these medications alter platelet function. Minimizing alcohol intake should also be emphasized to further diminish any risk for bleeding. For pruritus, the nurse may recommend bathing in tepid or cool water, along with applications of cocoa butter-based lotions and bath products.

\section*{SECONDARY POLYCYTHEMIA}

Secondary polycythemia is caused by excessive production of erythropoietin. This may occur in response to a reduced amount of oxygen, which acts as a hypoxic stimulus, as in cigarette smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cyanotic heart disease, or in nonpathologic conditions such as high altitude. It can also result from certain hemoglobinopathies in which the hemoglobin has an abnormally high affinity for oxygen (eg, hemoglobin Chesapeake). Secondary polycythemia can also occur from neoplasms (eg, renal cell carcinoma) that stimulate erythropoietin production.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of secondary polycythemia may not be necessary; when it is, it involves treating the primary problem. If the cause cannot be corrected (eg, by treating the renal cell carcinoma or improving pulmonary function), therapeutic phlebotomy may be necessary in symptomatic patients to reduce blood viscosity and volume.

\section*{Leukopenia and Neutropenia}

Leukopenia, a condition in which there are fewer WBCs than normal, results from neutropenia (diminished neutrophils) or lymphopenia (diminished lymphocytes). Even if other types of WBCs (eg, monocytes, basophils) are diminished, their numbers are too few to reduce the total WBC count significantly. Lymphopenia (lymphocytes less than $1500 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ) can result from ionizing radiation, long-term use of corticosteroids, uremia, some neoplasms (eg, breast and lung cancers, advanced Hodgkin's disease), and some protein-losing enteropathies (in which the lymphocytes within the intestines are lost).

\section*{NEUTROPENIA}

Neutropenia (neutrophils less than $2000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ) results from decreased production of neutrophils or increased destruction of these cells (Chart 33-5). Neutrophils are essential in preventing and limiting bacterial infection. A patient with neutropenia is at increased risk for infection, both exogenous and endogenous (the gastro-

intestinal tract and skin are common endogenous sources). The risk for infection is based not only on the severity of the neutropenia (low neutrophil count), but also on the duration of the neutropenia. The actual number of neutrophils, known as the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), is determined by a simple mathematical calculation using data obtained from the CBC and differential test (Chart 33-6). The risk of infection increases proportionately with the decrease in neutrophil count. The risk is significant when the ANC is less than 1000, is high when it is less than 500 , and is almost certain when it is less than 100 . The risk

\section*{Calculating the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)}
$$\text { ANC }=\frac{\text { Total WBC count } \times(\% \text { neutrophils }+\% \text { bands })}{100}$$

Normally, the neutrophil count is greater than $2000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. The actual (or absolute) neutrophil count (ANC) is calculated using the above formula.

For example, if the total white blood cell (WBC) count is $3000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ with $72 \%$ neutrophils and $3 \%$ bands, the ANC would be calculated as follows:
$$\mathrm{ANC}=\frac{3000(72+3)}{100}=2250$$

This result is not indicative of neutropenia, because the ANC is greater than 2000 despite the low total WBC count ( $3000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ).

Conversely, in the following example, neutropenia is evident despite a normal WBC count $\left(5500 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}\right)$ with $8 \%$ neutrophils and $0 \%$ bands:
$$\mathrm{ANC}=\frac{5500(8+0)}{100}=440$$

Here, the ANC is severely low (440) despite the normal total WBC count $\left(5500 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}\right)$.

When evaluating neutropenia, it is important to calculate the ANC and not to rely solely on the total WBCs and percentage of neutrophils alone.
of developing infection increases with the length of time during which neutropenia persists, even if it is fairly mild. Conversely, even a severe neutropenia may not result in infection if the duration of the neutropenia is brief, as is often seen after chemotherapy (Chart 33-7).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

There are no definite symptoms of neutropenia until the patient becomes infected. Routine CBC with differential tests, such as those obtained after chemotherapy treatment, can reveal neutropenia before the onset of infection.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of the neutropenia varies depending on its cause. If the neutropenia is medication induced, the offending agent needs to be stopped, if possible. Treatment of an underlying neoplasm can temporarily make the neutropenia worse, but with bone marrow recovery treatment may improve it. Corticosteroids may be used if the cause is an immunologic disorder. The use of growth factors such as G-CSF or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can be effective in increasing neutrophil production when the cause of the neutropenia is decreased production. Withholding or reducing the dose of chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be required when the neutropenia is caused by these treatments; however, in the case of potentially curative therapy, administration of growth factor is considered to be preferable, so that the maximum antitumor effect can be achieved. Should the neutropenia be accompanied by fever, the patient is automatically considered to be infected and usually is admitted to the hospital. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum should be obtained, as well as a chest radiograph. To ensure adequate therapy
against the invading infectious organisms, broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated as soon as the samples for culture are obtained, although the medications may be changed after culture and sensitivity results become available.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nurses in all settings have a crucial role in assessing the severity of neutropenia and in preventing and managing infectious complications. Patient teaching is equally important, particularly in the outpatient setting, so that the patient can implement appropriate self-care measures and know when and how to seek medical care (Chart 33-8). Patients at risk for neutropenia should have blood drawn for CBCs; the frequency is based on the suspected severity and duration of the neutropenia. Nurses need to be able to calculate the ANC (see Chart 33-6) and to assess the severity of neutropenia and the risk for infection. Chart 33-9 identifies nursing interventions related to neutropenia.

\section*{Leukocytosis and the Leukemias}

The term leukocytosis refers to an increased level of WBCs in the circulation. Typically, only one specific cell type is increased. Usually, because the proportions of several types of WBCs are small (eg, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes), only an increase in neutrophils or lymphocytes can be great enough to elevate the total WBC count. Although leukocytosis can be a normal response to increased need (eg, in acute infection), the elevation in WBCs should decrease as the need decreases. A prolonged or progressively increasing elevation in WBCs is abnormal and should be evaluated. A significant cause for persistent leukocytosis is malignancy.

Hematopoiesis is characterized by a rapid, continuous turnover of cells. Normally, production of specific blood cells

\section*{Risk Factors for Development of Infection and Bleeding in Patients with Hematologic Disorders}

Risk for Infection
Severity of neutropenia: Risk of infection is proportional to duration and severity of neutropenia
Duration of neutropenia: Increased duration leads to increased risk of infection
Nutritional status: Decreased protein stores lead to decreased immune response and anergy
Deconditioning: Decreased mobility leads to decreased respiratory effort, leading to increased pooling of secretions
Lymphocytopenia; disorders of lymphoid system (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], lymphoma, myeloma): Decreased cell-mediated and humoral immunity
Invasive procedures: Break in skin integrity leads to increased opportunity for organisms to enter blood system
Hypogammaglobulinemia: Decreased antibody formation
Poor hygiene: Increased organisms on skin, mucous membranes
Poor dentition; mucositis: Decreased endothelial integrity leads to increased opportunity for organisms to enter blood system
Antibiotic therapy: Increased risk for superinfection, often fungal Certain medications: See text
Risk for Bleeding
Severity of thrombocytopenia: Risk increases when platelet count decreases; usually not a significant risk until platelet count is lower
than $20,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$; lower than $50,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ when invasive procedure performed
Duration of thrombocytopenia: Risk increases when duration increases (eg, risk is less when duration is transient after chemotherapy than when duration is permanent with poor marrow production)
Sepsis: Mechanism unknown; appears to cause increased platelet consumption
Increased intracranial pressure (eg, vomiting/coughing): Increased blood pressure leads to rupture of blood vessels
Liver dysfunction: Decreased synthesis of clotting factors
Renal dysfunction: Decreased platelet function
Dysproteinemia: Protein coats surface of platelet, leading to decreased platelet function; protein causes increased viscosity, which leads to increased stretching of capillaries and thus increased bleeding
Alcohol abuse: Suppressive effect on marrow leads to decreased platelet production, decreased platelet function; decreased liver function, resulting in decreased production of clotting factors
Splenomegaly: Increased platelet destruction; spleen traps circulating platelets
Concurrent medications: See text
from their stem cell precursors is carefully regulated according to the body's needs. If the mechanisms that control the production of these cells are disrupted, the cells can proliferate to an excessive, potentially dangerous degree. Hematopoietic malignancies are often classified according to the cells involved. Leukemia, literally "white blood," is a neoplastic proliferation of one particular cell type (granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, or megakaryocytes). The defect originates in the hematopoietic stem cell, the myeloid, or the lymphoid stem cell. The lymphomas are neoplasms of lymphoid tissue, usually derived from $B$ lymphocytes. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of the most mature form of B lymphocyte, the plasma cell.

The common feature of the leukemias is an unregulated proliferation of WBCs in the bone marrow. In acute forms (or late stages of chronic forms), the proliferation of leukemic cells leaves little room for normal cell production. There can also be a proliferation of cells in the liver and spleen (extramedullary hematopoiesis). With acute forms, there can be infiltration of other organs, such as the meninges, lymph nodes, gums, and skin. The cause of leukemia is not fully known, but there is some evidence that genetic influence and viral pathogenesis may be involved. Bone marrow damage from radiation exposure or from chemicals such as benzene and alkylating agents (eg, melphalan [Alkeran]) can cause leukemia.

The leukemias are commonly classified according to the stem cell line involved, either lymphoid or myeloid. They are also classified as either acute or chronic, based on the time it takes for symptoms to evolve and the phase of cell development that is halted (ie, with few WBCs differentiating beyond that phase).

In acute leukemia, the onset of symptoms is abrupt, often occurring within a few weeks. WBC development is halted at the blast phase, so that most WBCs are undifferentiated or are blasts. Acute leukemia progresses very rapidly; death occurs within weeks to months without aggressive treatment. In chronic leukemia, symptoms evolve over a period of months to years, and the majority of WBCs produced are mature. Chronic leukemia progresses more slowly; the disease trajectory can extend for years.

\section*{ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML)}

AML results from a defect in the hematopoietic stem cell that differentiates into all myeloid cells: monocytes, granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils), erythrocytes, and platelets. All age groups are affected; the incidence rises with age, with a peak incidence at age 60 years. AML is the most common nonlymphocytic leukemia.

The prognosis is highly variable and is not consistently based on patient or disease variables. Patients with AML have a potentially curable disease. However, patients who are older or have a more undifferentiated form of AML tend to have a worse prognosis. Those who have preexisting MDS or who had previously received alkylating agents for cancer (secondary AML) have a much worse prognosis; the leukemia tends to be more resistant to treatment, resulting in a much shorter duration of remission. With treatment, these patients survive an average of less than 1 year, with death usually a result of infection or hemorrhage. Patients receiving supportive care also usually survive less than 1 year, again dying from infection or bleeding.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Most of the signs and symptoms evolve from insufficient production of normal blood cells. Fever and infection result from neutropenia, weakness and fatigue from anemia, and bleeding tendencies from thrombocytopenia. The proliferation of leukemic cells within organs leads to a variety of additional symptoms: pain from an enlarged liver or spleen, hyperplasia of the gums, and bone pain from expansion of marrow.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The disorder develops without warning, with symptoms occurring over a period of weeks to months. CBC results show a decrease in both erythrocytes and platelets. Although the total leukocyte count can be low, normal, or high, the percentage of normal cells is usually vastly decreased. A bone marrow analysis shows an ex-

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Risk for infection secondary to impaired immunoincompetence due to:
- Diminished neutrophil count (see below) secondary to bone marrow invasion or hypocellularity secondary to medications
- Dysfunctional neutrophils (eg, secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS])
- Dysfunctional or diminished lymphocytes
- Hypogammaglobulinemia
- Diminished immune response or anergy
- Malnutrition
- Surgery or invasive procedures
- Antibiotic therapy (increased risk for superimposed infection)
-Neutropenic, infected patients often do not exhibit the classic signs of inflammation/infection (ie, redness, cloudiness of any drainage); the only initial sign may be fever (and it often occurs later in the infectious process with neutropenia).
-Skin and mucous membranes are the body's first line of defense against infection; loss of endothelial cell integrity allows organisms to enter the blood and lymph system.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{Patient}

Assess the following areas thoroughly every shift or visit (with spot checks throughout shift if hospitalized) and notify physician of any signs of infection or worsening of status:
- Skin: Check for tenderness, edema, breaks in skin integrity, moisture, drainage, lesions (especially under breasts, axillae, groin, skin folds, bony prominences, perineum); check all puncture sites (eg, intravenous sites) for signs and symptoms of inflammation/infection.
- Oral mucosa: Check for moisture, lesions, color (check palate, tongue, buccal mucosa, gums, lips, oropharynx).
- Respiratory: Check for presence of cough, sore throat; auscultate breath sounds.
- Gastrointestinal: Check for abdominal discomfort/distention, nausea, change in bowel pattern; auscultate bowel sounds.
- Genitourinary: Check for dysuria, urgency, frequency; check urine for color, clarity, odor.
- Neurologic: Check for complaints of headache, neck stiffness, visual disturbances; assess level of consciousness, orientation, behavior.
- Temperature: Check every 4 hr or every visit; call primary health care provider if temperature is $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(>101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, fever is unresponsive to acetaminophen, or patient shows a decline in hemodynamic status.

\section*{Diagnostic Studies}
- Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and differential daily (especially absolute neutrophil count [ANC], lymphocyte count).
- Call physician if ANC is $<1000$, significantly different from previous count, or whenever patient becomes symptomatic (eg, febrile).
- Monitor globulin, albumin, total protein levels.
- Monitor all culture and sensitivity reports.
- Monitor radiology reports.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Environment and Staff}
- Thorough hand hygiene must be done by everyone before entering patient's room each and every time.
- Allow no one with a cold or sore throat to care for the patient or to enter room, or come in contact with patient at home.
- Care for neutropenic patients before caring for other patients (as much as possible).
- Use private room for patient if ANC is $<1000$.
- Allow no fresh flowers (stagnant water).
- Change water in containers every shift (include $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ humidification systems every 24 hr ).
- Ensure room is cleaned daily.

\section*{Dietary}
- Provide low microbial diet.
- Eliminate fresh salads and unpeeled fresh fruits or vegetables.

\section*{Patient}
- Avoid suppositories, enemas, rectal temperatures.
- Practice deep breathing (with incentive spirometer) every 4 hr while awake.
- Ambulate; wear high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter mask if neutropenia is severe.
- Prevent skin dryness with water-soluble lubricants, especially in high-risk areas (eg, lips, corners of mouth, elbows, feet, bony prominences).

\section*{Hygiene}
- Provide meticulous total body hygiene daily (preferably with antimicrobial solution), including perineal care after every bowel movement.
- Provide thorough oral hygiene after meals and every 4 hr while awake; warm saline, or salt and soda solution, is effective; avoid use of lemon-glycerine swabs, commercial mouthwashes, and hydrogen peroxide.

\section*{Intravenous (IV) Therapy}
- Do not use plastic cannulas for peripheral IVs when ANC is <500 (if possible per agency); a central vascular access device is preferred for long-term or intensive IV therapy.
- Inspect IV sites every shift; monitor closely for any discomfort; erythema may not be present.
- Maintain meticulous IV site care.
- Cleanse skin with antimicrobial solution before venipuncture (unless patient is allergic).
- Moisture-vapor-permeable dressings are permissible with strict adherence to institutional protocol.
- Change IV tubing per institution policy, using aseptic technique.
- Administer antimicrobial agents on time.

\section*{Expected Patient Outcomes}
- Patient demonstrates an absence of infection as evidenced by an absence of fever, chills, inflammation, drainage, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, dysuria, or urinary frequency.
- Patient demonstrates an absence of infection as evidenced by the presence of vital signs within normal limits, including intact neurologic status and intact skin.

\section*{Duration of Evaluation}

Until patient is no longer neutropenic and any infection is resolved.
cess of immature blast cells (more than $30 \%$ ). AML can be further classified into seven different subgroups, based on cytogenetics, histology, and morphology (appearance) of the blasts. The actual prognosis varies somewhat between subgroups, but the clinical course and treatment differ substantially with only one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, or AML-M3). Patients with this leukemia often have significantly more problems with bleed-
ing, in that they have underlying coagulopathy and a higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

\section*{Complications}

Complications of AML include bleeding and infection, the major causes of death. The risk of bleeding correlates with the level of
platelet deficiency (thrombocytopenia). The low platelet count can result in ecchymoses (bruises) and petechiae (pinpoint red or purple hemorrhagic spots on the skin). Major hemorrhages also may develop when the platelet count drops to less than $10,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. The most common sites of bleeding are gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and intracranial. For undetermined reasons, fever and infection also increase the likelihood of bleeding.

Because of the lack of mature and normal granulocytes, patients with leukemia are always threatened by infection. The likelihood of infection increases with the degree and duration of neutropenia; neutrophil counts that persist at less than $100 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ make the chances of systemic infection extremely high. As the duration of severe neutropenia increases, the patient's risk for developing fungal infection also increases.

\section*{Medical Management}

The overall objective of treatment is to achieve complete remission, in which there is no detectable evidence of residual leukemia remaining in the bone marrow. Attempts are made to achieve remission by the aggressive administration of chemotherapy, called induction therapy, which usually requires hospitalization for several weeks. Induction therapy typically involves high doses of cytarabine (Cytosar, Ara-C) and daunorubicin (DaunoXome) or mitoxantrone (Novantrone) or idarubicin (Idamycin); sometimes etoposide (VP-16, VePesid) is added to the regimen. The choice of agents is based on the patient's physical status and history of prior antineoplastic treatment.

The aim of induction therapy is to eradicate the leukemic cells, but this is often accompanied by the eradication of normal types of myeloid cells. Thus, the patient becomes severely neutropenic (an ANC of 0 is not uncommon), anemic, and thrombocytopenic (a platelet count of less than $10,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ is common). During this time, the patient is typically very ill, with bacterial, fungal, and occasionally viral infections, bleeding, and severe mucositis, which causes diarrhea and a marked decline in the ability to maintain adequate nutrition. Supportive care consists of administering blood products (RBCs and platelets) and promptly treating infections. The use of granulocytic growth factors, either G-CSF (filgrastim [Neupogen]) or GM-CSF (sargramostim [Leukine]), can shorten the period of significant neutropenia by stimulating the bone marrow to produce leukocytes more quickly; these agents do not appear to increase the risk of producing more leukemic cells.

When the patient has recovered from the induction therapy (ie, the WBC and platelet counts have returned to normal and any infection has resolved), the patient typically receives consolidation therapy (postremission therapy). The goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual leukemia cells that are not clinically detectable, thereby diminishing the chance for recurrence. Multiple treatment cycles of various agents are used, usually containing some form of cytarabine (eg, Cytosar, Ara-C). Frequently, the patient receives one cycle of treatment that is almost the same, if not identical, to the induction treatment but uses lower dosages (therefore resulting in less toxicity).

Despite the aggressive use of chemotherapy, the likelihood of remaining in remission for a prolonged period is not great. About $70 \%$ of patients with AML experience a relapse (Hiddemann \& Buchner, 2001). A recent study of long-term survival of patients with AML found that only $11 \%$ survived 10 years or longer (Micallef et al., 2001).

Another aggressive treatment option is bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
(PBSCT). When a suitable tissue match can be obtained, the patient embarks on an even more aggressive regimen of chemotherapy (sometimes in combination with radiation therapy), with the treatment goal of destroying the hematopoietic function of the patient's bone marrow. The patient is then "rescued" with the infusion of the donor stem cells to reinitiate blood cell production. Patients who undergo PBSCT transplantation have a significant risk for problems with infection, potential graft-versus-host disease (in which the donor's lymphocytes [graft] recognize the patient's body as "foreign" and set up reactions to attack the "foreign" host), and other complications. PBSCT has been shown to cure AML in 25\% to 50\% of patients who are at high risk for relapse or who have relapsed (Radich \& Sievers, 2000).

Recent advances in understanding of the molecular biology of myeloid blast cells have resulted in a new therapeutic option. After the uncommitted stem cell differentiates into a myeloid stem cell, it expresses a specific antigen on the cell surface, called CD33. It appears that $90 \%$ of blast cells found in AML express CD33; normal hematopoietic stem cells do not express this antigen (Radich \& Sievers, 2000). Armed with that discovery, researchers developed a monoclonal antibody to target cells with the CD33 antigen. The anti-CD33 antibody is linked to a potent antitumor antibiotic, calicheamicin; this medication is called gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg). When administered, the anti-CD33 antibody binds to cells with CD33 antigens, and the calicheamicin causes cell death. Normal myeloid and megakaryocyte precursors have the CD33 antigen, so the Mylotarg destroys them. Patients develop severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia after receiving this medication. Nonetheless, Mylotarg shows promise as an effective agent against AML. In elderly patients, it appears to be somewhat less toxic than conventional induction therapy regimens.

Another important option for the patient to consider is supportive care alone. In fact, supportive care may be the only option if the patient has significant comorbidity, such as extremely poor cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic function. In such cases, aggressive antileukemia therapy is not used; occasionally, hydroxyurea (eg, Hydrea) may be used briefly to control the increase of blast cells. Patients are more commonly supported with antimicrobial therapy and transfusions as needed. This treatment approach provides the patient with some additional time at home; however, death frequently occurs within months, typically from infection or bleeding.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF TREATMENT}

The massive leukemic cell destruction from chemotherapy results in release of electrolytes and fluids within the cell into the systemic circulation. Increases in uric acid levels, potassium, and phosphate are seen; this process is referred to as tumor lysis syndrome (see Chap. 16). The increased uric acid and phosphorus levels make patients vulnerable to renal stone formation and renal colic, which can progress to acute renal failure. Hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, neuromuscular effects such as muscle cramps, weakness, spasm/tetany, confusion, and seizure. Patients require a high fluid intake, alkalization of the urine, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent crystallization of uric acid and subsequent stone formation. Gastrointestinal problems may result from the infiltration of abnormal leukocytes into the abdominal organs and from the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe mucositis are common. Because of the profound myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia typically result in serious infection and increased risk for bleeding.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient with acute leukemia is discussed at the end of the leukemia section in this chapter.

\section*{CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA}

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) arises from a mutation in the myeloid stem cell. Normal myeloid cells continue to be produced, but there is a preference for immature (blast) forms. Therefore, a wide spectrum of cell types exists within the blood, from blast forms through mature neutrophils. Because there is an uncontrolled proliferation of cells, the marrow expands into the cavities of long bones (eg, the femur), and cells are also formed in the liver and spleen (extramedullary hematopoiesis), resulting in enlargement of these organs that is sometimes painful. In $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of patients with CML, a section of DNA is found to be missing from chromosome 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome $[\mathrm{Ph} 1]$ ); it is, in fact, translocated onto chromosome 9. The specific location of these changes is on the $B C R$ gene of chromosome 22 and the $A B L$ gene of chromosome 9. When these two genes fuse ( $B C R-A B L$ gene), they produce an abnormal protein (a tyrosine kinase protein) that causes WBCs to divide rapidly. This $B C R-A B L$ gene is present in virtually all patients with this disease. CML is uncommon in people younger than 20 years of age, but the incidence increases with age (median age, 40 to 50 years).

Patients diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase have an overall median life expectancy of 3 to 5 years. During that time, they have very few symptoms and complications from the disease itself. Problems with infections and bleeding are rare. However, once the disease transforms to the acute phase (blast crisis), the overall survival time rarely exceeds several months.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical picture of CML varies. Many patients are asymptomatic, and leukocytosis is detected by a CBC performed for some other reason. The WBC count commonly exceeds $100,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. Patients with extremely high WBC counts may be somewhat short of breath or slightly confused due to decreased capillary perfusion to the lungs and brain from leukostasis (the excessive amount of WBCs inhibits blood flow through the capillaries). Patients may complain of an enlarged, tender spleen. The liver may also be enlarged. Some patients have somewhat insidious symptoms, such as malaise, anorexia, and weight loss. Lymphadenopathy is rare. There are three stages in CML: chronic, transformation, and accelerated or blast crisis. Patients have more symptoms and complications as the disease progresses.

\section*{Medical Management}

Advances in understanding of the pathology of CML at a molecular level have led to dramatic changes in its medical management. An oral formulation of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) works by blocking signals within the leukemia cells that express the $B C R-A B L$ protein, thus preventing a series of chemical reactions that cause the cell to grow and divide (Tennant, 2001; Goldman \& Melo, 2001). Gleevec appears to be more useful in the chronic phase of the illness. In clinical trials, it has been generally well tolerated. Antacids and grapefruit juice may limit drug absorption, and large doses of acetaminophen can cause hep-
atotoxicity. The long-term effects of Gleevec, its impact on survival, and the optimal length of treatment are being determined.

Conventional therapy depends on the stage of disease. In the chronic phase, the expected outcome is correction of the chromosomal abnormality (ie, conversion of the malignant stem cell population back to normal). Agents that have been used successfully for this purpose are interferon-alfa (Roferon-A) and cytosine, often in combination. These agents are administered daily as subcutaneous injections. This therapy is not benign; many patients cannot tolerate the profound fatigue, depression, anorexia, mucositis, and inability to concentrate. A less aggressive therapeutic approach focuses on reducing the WBC count to a more normal level, but does not alter cytogenetic changes. This goal can be achieved by using oral chemotherapeutic agents, typically hydroxyurea (eg, Hydrea) or busulfan (eg, Myleran). In the case of an extreme leukocytosis at diagnosis (eg, WBC count higher than $300,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ), a more emergent treatment may be required. In this instance, leukopheresis (in which the patient's blood is removed and separated, with the leukocytes withdrawn, and the remaining blood returned to the patient) can temporarily reduce the number of WBCs. An anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent (eg, daunomycin) may also be used to bring the WBC count down quickly to a safer level, where more conservative therapy can be instituted.

The transformation phase can be insidious, but it marks the process of evolution (or transformation) to the acute form of leukemia (blast crisis). In the transformation phase, the patient may complain of bone pain and may report fevers (without any obvious sign of infection) and weight loss. Even with chemotherapy, the spleen may continue to enlarge. The patient may become more anemic and thrombocytopenic; an increased basophil level is detected by the CBC. Despite its being a myeloid stem cell disease, CML will transform in up to $25 \%$ of patients to resemble not AML, but acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), with lymphoidappearing blasts (Derderian et al., 1993). Transformation into the acute phase can be gradual or rapid.

In the more acute form of leukemia (blast crisis), treatment may resemble induction therapy for acute leukemia, using the same medications as for AML or ALL. Patients whose disease evolves into a "lymphoid" blast crisis are more likely to be able to reenter a chronic phase after induction therapy. For those whose disease evolves into AML, therapy is largely ineffective in achieving a second chronic phase. Life-threatening infections and bleeding occur frequently in this phase. CML is a disease that can potentially be cured with BMT or PBSCT. Patients who receive such transplants while still in the chronic phase of the illness tend to have a greater chance for cure than those who receive them in the acute phase. The transplantation procedure may now be considered for otherwise healthy patients who are younger than 70 years of age.

\section*{ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA}

ALL results from an uncontrolled proliferation of immature cells (lymphoblasts) derived from the lymphoid stem cell. The cell of origin is the precursor to the B lymphocyte in approximately $75 \%$ of ALL cases; T-lymphocyte ALL occurs in approximately $25 \%$ of ALL cases. The $B C R-A B L$ translocation (see earlier discussion) is found in $20 \%$ of ALL blast cells. ALL is most common in young children, with boys affected more often than girls; the peak incidence is 4 years of age. After age 15 years, ALL is relatively uncommon. Increasing age appears to be associated with diminished survival (Nachman, 1999). Because of improvements in therapy for ALL, more than $80 \%$ of children survive at least

5 years. Even if relapse occurs, resumption of induction therapy can often achieve a second complete remission. Moreover, BMT may be successful even after a second relapse.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Immature lymphocytes proliferate in the marrow and crowd the development of normal myeloid cells. As a result, normal hematopoiesis is inhibited, resulting in reduced numbers of leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Leukocyte counts may be either low or high, but there is always a high proportion of immature cells. Manifestations of leukemic cell infiltration into other organs are more common with ALL than with other forms of leukemia and include pain from an enlarged liver or spleen, bone pain, and headache and vomiting (because of meningeal involvement).

\section*{Medical Management}

The expected outcome of treatment is complete remission. Lymphoid blast cells are typically very sensitive to corticosteroids and to vinca alkaloids; therefore, these medications are an integral part of the initial induction therapy. Because ALL frequently invades the central nervous system, prophylaxis with cranial irradiation or intrathecal chemotherapy (eg, methotrexate [Folex]) or both is an integral part of the treatment plan.

Treatment protocols for ALL tend to be complex, using a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents. They often include a maintenance phase, when lower doses of medications are given for up to 3 years. Despite the complexity, treatment can be provided in the outpatient setting in some circumstances until severe complications develop.

Infections are common, especially viral infections. The use of corticosteroids to treat ALL increases the patient's susceptibility to infection. Patients with ALL tend to have a better response to treatment than patients with AML do. BMT or PBSCT offers a chance for prolonged remission or even cure if the illness recurs after therapy.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient with acute leukemia is discussed at the end of the leukemia section in this chapter.

\section*{CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL)}

CLL is a common malignancy of older adults; two thirds of all patients are older than 60 years of age at diagnosis. It is the most common form of leukemia in the United States and Europe, affecting more than 120,000 people, but is rarely seen in Asia. The average survival time for patients with CLL ranges from 14 years (early stage) to 2.5 years (late stage).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

CLL typically derives from a malignant clone of B lymphocytes (T-lymphocyte CLL is rare). In contrast to the acute forms of leukemia, most of the leukemia cells in CLL are fully mature. It appears that these cells can escape apoptosis (programmed cell death), with the result being an excessive accumulation of the cells in the marrow and circulation. The antigen CD52 is prevalent on the surface of many of these leukemic B cells. The disease is classified into three or four stages (two classification systems are
in use). In the early stage, an elevated lymphocyte count is seen and can exceed $100,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. Because the lymphocytes are small, they can easily travel through the small capillaries within the circulation, and the pulmonary and cerebral complications of leukocytosis (as seen with myeloid leukemias) typically are not found in CLL.

Lymphadenopathy occurs as the lymphocytes are trapped within the lymph nodes. The nodes can become very large and are sometimes painful. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly then develop.

In later stages, anemia and thrombocytopenia may develop. Treatment is typically initiated in the later stages; earlier treatment does not appear to increase survival. Autoimmune complications can also occur at any stage, as either autoimmune hemolytic anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In the autoimmune process, the RES destroys the body's own RBCs or platelets.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many patients are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally during routine physical examinations or during the course of treatment for another disease. An increased lymphocyte count (lymphocytosis) is always present. The RBC and platelet counts may be normal or, in later stages of the illness, decreased. Enlargement of lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) is common; it can be severe and sometimes painful. The spleen can also be enlarged (splenomegaly).

Patients with CLL can develop "B symptoms," a constellation of symptoms including fevers, drenching sweating (especially at night), and unintentional weight loss. These patients have defects in their humoral and cell-mediated immune systems; therefore, infections are common. The defect in cellular immunity is evidenced by an absent or decreased reaction to skin sensitivity tests (eg, Candida, mumps), which is known as anergy. Problems with life-threatening infections are common. Viral infections, such as herpes zoster, can become widely disseminated.

\section*{Medical Management}

In early stages, CLL may require no treatment. When symptoms are severe (drenching night sweats, painful lymphadenopathy), or when the disease progresses to later stages (with resultant anemia and thrombocytopenia), chemotherapy with corticosteroids and chlorambucil (Leukeran) is often used. Other useful agents include cyclophosphamide (eg, Cytoxan), vincristine (eg, Oncovin), and doxorubicin (eg, Adriamycin). A significant number of patients who do not respond to these medications have achieved remission with fludarabine (Fludara), and this medication is increasingly being used as front-line therapy. The major side effect of fludarabine is prolonged bone marrow suppression, manifested by prolonged periods of neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Patients are then at risk for such infections as Pneumocystis carinii, Listeria, mycobacteria, herpes viruses, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). The monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan) also has efficacy in CLL therapy. It is often used in combination with other chemotherapeutic medications. Research has shown that the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (Campath) targets the CD52 antigen commonly found on CLL cells and that it is effective in clearing the marrow and circulation of these cells without affecting the stem cells. Because CD52 is present on both B and T lymphocytes, patients receiving alemtuzumab are at significant risk for infection; prophylactic use of antiviral agents and
antibiotics (eg, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [Septra]) is important and needs to continue for a minimum of 2 months after the patient stops treatment. Because bacterial infections are common in patients with CLL, intravenous treatment with immunoglobulin may be given to selected patients.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE LEUKEMIA}

\section*{Assessment}

Although the clinical picture varies with the type of leukemia involved as well as the treatment implemented, the health history may reveal a range of subtle symptoms reported by the patient before the problem is manifested by findings on physical examination. Weakness and fatigue are common manifestations, not only of the leukemia but also of the resulting complications of anemia
and infection. If the patient is hospitalized, the assessments should be performed daily, or more frequently as warranted. Because the physical findings may be subtle initially, a thorough, systematic assessment incorporating all body systems is essential. For example, a dry cough, mild dyspnea, and diminished breath sounds may indicate a pulmonary infection. However, the infection may not be seen initially on the chest x-ray. The lack of neutrophils delays the inflammatory response against the pulmonary infection, and it is the inflammatory response that causes the x-ray changes. The platelet count can become dangerously low, leaving the patient at risk for significant bleeding. The specific body system assessments are delineated in the neutropenic precautions and bleeding precautions, found in Charts 33-9 and 33-10, respectively. When serial assessments are performed, current findings are compared with previous findings to evaluate improvement or worsening.

The nurse also must closely monitor the results of laboratory studies. Flow sheets and spreadsheets are particularly useful in

\section*{Bleeding Precautions}

Nursing Diagnosis
Potential bleeding* and injury secondary to thrombocytopenia/altered coagulation due to:
- Malignant invasion in bone marrow
- Bone marrow suppression resulting from chemotherapy (particularly alkylators, antitumor antibiotics, antimetabolites) and radiation therapy
- Hypersplenism
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
- Altered coagulation

Assessment
Patient
Assess the following areas thoroughly every shift or visit (with spot checks throughout the shift if patient is hospitalized), and notify physician if there is new onset of the following and/or worsening of status:
- Integument: Petechiae (usually located on trunk, thighs), ecchymoses or hematomas, conjunctival hemorrhages, bleeding gums, bleeding at puncture sites (venipuncture, lumbar puncture, bone marrow)
- Cardiovascular: Hypotension, tachycardia, complaints of dizziness, epistaxis
- Pulmonary: Respiratory distress, tachypnea
- Gastrointestinal: Hemoptysis, abdominal distention, rectal bleeding
- Genitourinary: Vaginal or urethral bleeding
- Neurologic: Headache, blurred vision, mental status changes

Laboratory Tests
- Monitor complete blood count (CBC), platelets daily (at least); coagulation panel.
- Notify physician if platelet count is $<10,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ or if count has changed significantly from previous count (including coagulation), or whenever patient becomes symptomatic.
- Ensure patient's blood was human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typed before transfusions or chemotherapy begins if admitted for induction therapy (eg, for acute leukemia).
- Obtain 1-hour posttransfusion platelet count if warranted.
- Test all urine, emesis, stools for occult blood.
*Serious hemorrhage is unusual in mildly thrombocytopenic patients in absence of local lesions (peptic ulcer, bleeding from hemorrhoids, cystitis).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Prevent Complications
- Avoid aspirin and aspirin-containing medications or other medications known to inhibit platelet function, if possible.
- Do not give intramuscular injections.
- Do not insert indwelling catheters.
- Take no rectal temperatures; do not give suppositories, enemas.
- Use stool softeners, oral laxatives to prevent constipation.
- Use smallest possible needles when performing venipuncture.
- Apply pressure to venipuncture sites for 5 min or until bleeding has stopped.
- Permit no flossing of teeth and no commercial mouthwashes.
- Use only soft-bristled toothbrush for mouth care.
- Use only toothettes for mouth care if platelet count is $<10,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, or if gums bleed.
- Lubricate lips with water-soluble lubricant every 2 hr while awake.
- Avoid suctioning if at all possible; if unavoidable, use only gentle suctioning.
- Discourage vigorous coughing or blowing of the nose.
- Use only electric razor for shaving.
- Pad side rails as needed.
- Prevent falls by ambulating with patient as necessary.

Control Bleeding
- Apply direct pressure.
- For epistaxis, position patient in high Fowler's position; apply ice pack to back of neck and direct pressure to nose.
- Notify physician for prolonged bleeding (eg, unable to stop within 10 min ).
- Administer platelets, fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, as prescribed.

\section*{Evaluation and Expected Patient Outcomes}
- Patient demonstrates an absence of bleeding as evidenced by absence of spontaneous petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, hemoptysis, bleeding gums, conjunctival hemorrhage, vaginal bleeding, hematuria, guaiac positive stool, blurred vision, orthostatic hypotension, and prolonged bleeding from puncture sites.
- Patient demonstrates an absence of bleeding as evidenced by the presence of vital signs within normal limits and intact neurologic status.
tracking the WBC count, ANC, hematocrit, platelet, and creatinine levels, hepatic function tests, and electrolyte levels. Culture results need to be reported immediately so that appropriate antimicrobial therapy can begin or be modified.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient with acute leukemic may include:
- Risk for infection and bleeding
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to toxic effects of chemotherapy, alteration in nutrition, and impaired mobility
- Impaired gas exchange
- Impaired mucous membranes due to changes in epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract from chemotherapy or prolonged use of antimicrobial medications

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- Infection
- Bleeding
- Renal dysfunction
- Tumor lysis syndrome
- Nutritional depletion
- Mucositis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include absence of complications and pain, attainment and maintenance of adequate nutrition, activity tolerance, ability for self-care and to cope
with the diagnosis and prognosis, positive body image, and an understanding of the disease process and its treatment.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PREVENTING OR MANAGING INFECTION AND BLEEDING}

The nursing interventions related to diminishing the risk for infection and for bleeding are delineated in Charts 33-9 and 33-10.

\section*{MANAGING MUCOSITIS}

Although emphasis is placed on the oral mucosa, it is important to realize that the entire gastrointestinal mucosa can be altered, not only by the effects of chemotherapy but also from prolonged administration of antibiotics. Assessment of the oral mucosa must be thorough; therefore, dentures must be removed. Areas to assess include the palate, buccal mucosa, tongue, gums, lips, oropharynx, and the area under the tongue. In addition to identifying and describing lesions, the color and moisture of the mucosa should be noted.

Oral hygiene is very important to diminish the bacteria within the mouth, maintain moisture, and provide comfort. Soft-bristled toothbrushes should be used until the neutrophil and platelet counts become very low; at that time, sponge-tipped applicators should be substituted. Lemon-glycerin swabs and commercial mouthwashes should never be used because the glycerin and alcohol within them are extremely drying to the tissues. Simple rinses with saline (or saline and baking soda) solutions are inexpensive but effective in cleaning and moistening the oral mucosa. Because the risk of yeast or fungal infection in the mouth is great, other medications are often prescribed, such as chlorhexidine rinses (eg, Peridex) or clotrimazole troches (eg, Mycelex). The nurse reminds the patient about the importance of these medications to enhance adherence to the therapeutic regimen. Chlorhexidine rinses may discolor the teeth.

To diminish perineal-rectal complications, it is important to cleanse the perineal-rectal area thoroughly after each bowel movement. Women are instructed to cleanse the perineum from front to back. Sitz baths are a comfortable method of cleansing; the perineal-anal region and buttocks must be carefully dried afterward to minimize the chance of excoriation. Stool softeners should be used to increase the moisture of bowel movements; however, the stool texture must be monitored so that the softeners can be decreased or stopped if the stool becomes too loose.

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL INTAKE}

The disease process can increase, and sepsis further increases, the patient's metabolic rate and nutritional requirements. Nutritional intake is often reduced because of pain and discomfort associated with stomatitis. Mouth care before and after meals and administration of analgesics before eating can help increase intake. If oral anesthetics are used, the patient must be warned to chew with extreme care to avoid inadvertently biting the tongue or buccal mucosa.

Nausea should not be a major contributing factor, because recent advances in antiemetic therapy are highly effective. However, nausea can result from antimicrobial therapy, so some antiemetic therapy may still be required after the chemotherapy has been completed.

Small, frequent feedings of foods that are soft in texture and moderate in temperature may be better tolerated. Low-microbial diets are typically prescribed (avoiding uncooked fruits or vegetables and those without a peelable skin). Nutritional supplements are frequently used. Daily body weights (as well as in-
take and output measurements) are useful in monitoring fluid status.

Calorie counts are useful, as are more formal nutritional assessments. Parenteral nutrition is often required to maintain adequate nutrition.

\section*{EASING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Recurrent fevers are common in acute leukemia; at times, they are accompanied by shaking chills, which can be severe (rigors). Myalgias and arthralgias can result. Acetaminophen is typically given to decrease fever, but it does so by increasing diaphoresis. Sponging with cool water may be useful, but cold water or ice packs should be avoided because the heat cannot dissipate from constricted blood vessels. Bedclothes need frequent changing as well. Gentle back and shoulder massage may provide comfort.

Stomatitis can also cause significant discomfort. In addition to oral hygiene practices, patient-controlled analgesia can be effective in controlling the pain (see Chap. 13).

Because patients with acute leukemia require hospitalization for extensive nursing care (either during induction or consolidation therapy or during resultant complications), sleep deprivation frequently results. Nurses need to implement creative strategies that permit uninterrupted sleep for at least a few hours while still administering necessary medications on time.

With the exception of severe mucositis, less pain is associated with acute leukemia than with many other forms of cancer. However, the amount of psychologic suffering that the patient must endure can be immense. Patients greatly benefit from active listening.

\section*{DECREASING FATIGUE AND DECONDITIONING}

Fatigue is a common and oppressive problem. Nursing interventions should focus on assisting the patient to establish a balance between activity and rest. Patients with acute leukemia need to maintain some physical activity and exercise to prevent the deconditioning that results from inactivity. Use of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter mask can permit the patient to ambulate outside the room despite severe neutropenia. Although many patients lack the motivation to use them, stationary bicycles within the room can also be used. At a minimum, patients should be encouraged to sit up in a chair while awake rather than staying in bed; even this simple activity can improve the patient's tidal volume and enhance circulation. Physical therapy can also be beneficial.

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}

Febrile episodes, bleeding, and inadequate or overly aggressive fluid replacement can alter the patient's fluid status. Similarly, persistent diarrhea, vomiting, and long-term use of certain antimicrobial agents can cause significant deficits in electrolytes. Intake and output need to be measured accurately, and daily weights should also be monitored. The patient should be assessed for signs of dehydration as well as fluid overload, with particular attention to pulmonary status and the development of dependent edema. Laboratory test results, particularly electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hematocrit, should be monitored and compared with previous results. Replacement of electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, is commonly required. Patients receiving amphotericin or certain antibiotics are at increased risk for electrolyte depletion.

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-CARE}

Because hygiene measures are so important in this patient population, they must be performed by the nurse when the patient cannot do so. However, the patient should be encouraged to do as
much as possible, to preserve mobility and function as well as selfesteem. Patients may have negative feelings, even disgust that they can no longer care for themselves. Empathetic listening is helpful, as is realistic reassurance that these deficits are temporary. As the patient recovers, it is important to assist him or her to resume more self-care. Patients are usually discharged from the hospital with a central vascular access device (eg, Hickman catheter, PICC), and most patients can care for the catheter with adequate instruction and practice under observation.

\section*{MANAGING ANXIETY AND GRIEF}

Being diagnosed with acute leukemia can be extremely frightening. In many instances, the need to begin treatment is emergent, and patients have little time to process the fact that they have the illness before making decisions about therapy. Providing emotional support and discussing the uncertain future are crucial. The nurse also needs to assess how much information patients want to have regarding the illness, its treatment, and potential complications. This desire should be reassessed at intervals, because needs and interest in information change throughout the course of the disease and treatment. Priorities must be identified so that procedures, assessments, and self-care expectations are adequately explained even to those who do not wish extensive information.

Many patients become depressed and begin to grieve for the losses they feel, such as normal family functioning, professional roles and responsibilities, and social roles, as well as physical functioning. Nurses can assist patients to identify the source of the grief and encourage them to allow time to adjust to the major life changes produced by the illness. Role restructuring, in both family and professional life, may be required. Again, when possible, permitting patients to identify options and to take time making significant decisions regarding such restructuring is helpful.

Discharge from the hospital can also provoke anxiety. Although most patients are extremely eager to go home, they may lack confidence in their ability to manage potential complications and to resume their normal activity. Close communication between nurses across care settings can reassure patients that they will not be abandoned.

\section*{ENCOURAGING SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING}

Because acute leukemia is a serious, potentially life-threatening illness, the nurse may offer support to enhance the patient's spiritual well-being. The patient's spiritual and religious practices should be assessed and pastoral services offered. Throughout the patient's illness, it is important that the nurse assist the patient to maintain hope. However, that hope should be realistic and will certainly change over the course of the illness. For example, the patient may initially hope to be cured, but with repeated relapses and a change to terminal care the same patient may hope for a quiet, dignified death.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Nursing interventions for potential complications were described previously.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Most patients cope better when they have an understanding of what is happening to them. Based on their education, literacy level, and interest, teaching of patient and family should focus on
the disease (including some pathophysiology), its treatment, and certainly the significant risk for infection and bleeding (Charts 33-8 and 33-11) that results.

Management of a vascular access device can be taught to most patients or family members. Follow-up and care for the devices may also need to be provided by nurses in an outpatient facility or by a home care agency or a health care providerv.

Continuing Care. Shortened hospital stays and outpatient care have significantly altered care for patients with acute leukemia. In many instances, when the patient is clinically stable but still requires parenteral antibiotics or blood products, these procedures can be performed in an outpatient setting. Nurses in these various settings must communicate regularly. Patients need to learn which parameters are important for them to monitor, and how to monitor them. Specific instructions need to be given as to when the patient should seek care from the physician or a health care provider.

Patients and their families need to have a clear understanding of the disease and the prognosis. The nurse acts as an advocate to ensure that this information is provided. When patients no longer respond to therapy, it is important to respect their choices about treatment, including measures to prolong life and other end-of-life measures. Advance directives and living wills provide patients with some measure of control during terminal illness.

Many patients in this stage still choose to be cared for at home, and families often need support when considering this option. Coordination of home care services and instruction can help to alleviate anxiety about managing the patient's care in the home. As the patient becomes weaker, the caregivers must assume more of the patient's care. In addition, caregivers often need to be encouraged to take care of themselves, allowing time for rest and accepting emotional support. Hospice staff can assist in providing respite for family members as well as care for the patient. Patients and families also need assistance to cope with changes in their roles and responsibilities. Anticipatory grieving is an essential task during this time (see Chap. 17).

In patients with acute leukemia, death typically occurs from infection or bleeding. Family members need to have information about these complications and the measures to take should either occur. Many family members cannot cope with the care required when a patient begins to bleed actively. It is important to delineate alternatives to keeping the patient at home. Should
another option be sought, family members who may feel guilty that they could not keep the patient at home will require support from the nurse.

\section*{AGNOGENIC MYELOID METAPLASIA (AMM)}

Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM), also known as myelofibrosis, is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder that arises from neoplastic transformation of an early hematopoietic stem cell. The disease is characterized by marrow fibrosis or scarring, splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis (typically spleen, liver, or both), leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, and anemia. Some patients have suppressed WBC and platelet counts as well as anemia (pancytopenia). Patients with AMM have increased angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) within the marrow. Early forms of blood cells (including nucleated RBCs and megakaryocyte fragments) are frequently found in the circulation. AMM is a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 60 to 65 years. Survival time varies from as little as 1 year to more than 30 years; the average is 4 to 5 years (Anderson, Hamblin, \& Traynor, 1999). Heart failure, complications of marrow failure, and transformation to AML are the common causes of death.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical management is directed toward palliation, reducing symptoms related to cytopenias, splenomegaly, and hypermetabolic state. Although one third of anemic patients respond to the combination of an androgen plus a corticosteroid, the primary treatment remains RBC transfusion. Because of the prolonged requirement for RBC transfusion, iron overload is a common problem. Iron chelation therapy should be initiated for those individuals in whom survival is expected to exceed a few years (Anderson Hamblin, Traynor, 1999). Hydroxyurea is often used to control high WBC and platelet counts and to reduce the size of the spleen. Splenic irradiation or splenectomy may also be used to control the massive splenomegaly that can develop. However, both modalities render the patient at significant risk for development of infection. BMT may be a useful treatment modality in younger, otherwise healthy individuals.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The extent of splenomegaly can be profound in patients with AMM, with enlargement of the spleen that extends to the pelvic rim. This condition is extremely uncomfortable to the patient and can severely limit nutritional intake. Analgesics are often ineffective. Methods to reduce the spleen's size are usually more effective in controlling pain. Splenomegaly, coupled with a hypermetabolic state, results in weight loss (often severe) and muscle wasting. Patients benefit from very small, frequent meals of foods that are high in calories and protein. Weakness, fatigue, and altered body image are other significant problems. Energy conservation methods and active listening are important nursing interventions. Patients need to be educated about signs and symptoms of infection as well as appropriate interventions when an infection is suspected.

\section*{The Lymphomas}

The lymphomas are neoplasms of cells of lymphoid origin. These tumors usually start in lymph nodes but can involve lymphoid tissue in the spleen, the gastrointestinal tract (eg, the wall of the stomach), the liver, or the bone marrow. They are often classified according to the degree of cell differentiation and the origin of the predominant malignant cell. Lymphomas can be broadly classified into two categories: Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

\section*{HODGKIN'S DISEASE}

Hodgkin's disease is a relatively rare malignancy that has an impressive cure rate. It is somewhat more common in men than women and has two peaks of incidence: one in the early 20 s and the other after 50 years of age. Unlike other lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease is unicentric in origin in that it initiates in a single node. The disease spreads by contiguous extension along the lymphatic system. The cause of Hodgkin's disease is unknown, but a viral etiology is suspected. In fact, fragments of the EpsteinBarr virus have been found in $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ of patients; this occurs more commonly in the younger patient population (Weiss, 2000). There is a familial pattern associated with Hodgkin's disease: firstdegree relatives have a higher-than-normal frequency of the disease. There is no increased incidence documented for non-blood relatives (eg, spouses).

The malignant cell of Hodgkin's disease is the Reed-Sternberg cell, a gigantic tumor cell that is morphologically unique and is
thought to be of immature lymphoid origin. It is the pathologic hallmark and essential diagnostic criterion for Hodgkin's disease. However, the tumor is very heterogeneous and may actually contain few Reed-Sternberg cells. Repeated biopsies may be required to establish the diagnosis.

Hodgkin's disease is customarily classified into five subgroups based on pathologic analyses that reflect the natural history of the malignancy and suggest the prognosis. For example, when lymphocytes predominate, with few Reed-Sternberg cells and minimal involvement of the lymph nodes, the prognosis is much more favorable than when the lymphocyte count is low and the lymph nodes are virtually replaced by tumor cells of the most primitive type. The majority of patients with Hodgkin's disease have the types currently designated "nodular sclerosis" or "mixed cellularity." The nodular sclerosis type tends to occur more often in young women, at an earlier stage but with a worse prognosis than the mixed cellularity subgroup, which occurs more commonly in men and causes more constitutional symptoms but has a better prognosis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Hodgkin's disease usually begins as a painless enlargement of one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck. The individual nodes are painless and firm but not hard. The most common sites for lymphadenopathy are the cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal nodes; involvement of the iliac or inguinal nodes or spleen is much less common. A mediastinal mass may be seen on chest x-ray; occasionally, the mass is large enough to compress the trachea and cause dyspnea. Pruritus is common; it can be extremely distressing, and the cause is unknown. Approximately $20 \%$ of patients experience brief but severe pain after drinking alcohol (Cavalli, 1998). The pain is usually at the site of the Hodgkin's disease; again, the cause is unknown.

All organs are vulnerable to invasion by Hodgkin's disease. The symptoms result from compression of organs by the tumor, such as cough and pulmonary effusion (from pulmonary infiltrates), jaundice (from hepatic involvement or bile duct obstruction), abdominal pain (from splenomegaly or retroperitoneal adenopathy), or bone pain (from skeletal involvement). Herpes zoster infections are common. A cluster of constitutional symptoms has important prognostic implications. Referred to as "B symptoms," they include fever (without chills), drenching sweats (particularly at night), and unintentional weight loss of more than $10 \%$. "B symptoms" are found in $40 \%$ of patients and are more common in advanced disease.

A mild anemia is the most common hematologic finding. The WBC count may be elevated or decreased. The platelet count is typically normal, unless the tumor has invaded the bone marrow, suppressing hematopoiesis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the serum copper level are used by some clinicians to assess disease activity. Patients with Hodgkin's disease have impaired cellular immunity, as evidenced by an absent or decreased reaction to skin sensitivity tests (eg, Candida, mumps).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Because many manifestations are similar to those occurring with infection, diagnostic studies are performed to rule out an infectious origin for the disease. The diagnosis is made by means of an excisional lymph node biopsy and the finding of the Reed-Sternberg cell. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and the histologic type is established, it is necessary to assess the extent of the disease, a process referred to as staging.

During the health history, the nurse should assess for any "B symptoms." Physical examination requires a careful, systematic evaluation of the lymph node chains, as well as the size of the spleen and liver. A chest x-ray and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are crucial to identify the extent of lymphadenopathy within these regions. Laboratory tests include CBC, platelet count, ESR, and liver and renal function studies. A bone marrow biopsy is performed if there are signs of marrow involvement, and some physicians routinely perform bilateral biopsies. Bone scans may be performed to identify any involvement in these areas. A staging laparotomy and lymphangiography are no longer considered mandatory, primarily because of the accuracy of CT.

\section*{Medical Management}

The general intent in treating Hodgkin's disease, regardless of stage, is cure. Treatment is determined primarily by the stage of the disease, not the histologic type; however, extensive research is ongoing to target treatment regimens to histologic subtypes or prognostic features. Traditionally, early Hodgkin's disease was treated by a staging laparotomy followed by radiation therapy. Recent data show improved results and decreased complications with a short course ( 2 to 4 months) of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy in certain subsets of early-stage disease (IA and IIA); patients with early-stage disease and good prognostic features may receive radiation therapy alone (Hoppe et al., 2000). Combination chemotherapy, for example with doxorubicin (Adriamycin), bleomycin (Blenoxane), vinblastine (Velban), and dacarbazine (DTIC), referred to as ABVD, is now the standard treatment for more advanced disease (stages III and IV and all B stages).

Radiation therapy is still very useful for patients with extensive adenopathy (often termed bulky disease). In this group, residual disease often persists after the chemotherapy treatment is finished; radiation therapy to the areas of remaining adenopathy has been shown to improve survival.

Even when Hodgkin's disease does recur, the use of high doses of chemotherapeutic agents, followed by autologous BMT or stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), can be very effective in controlling the disease and extending survival time.

\section*{Long-Term Complications of Therapy}

Much is now known about the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, primarily from the large numbers of people who were cured of Hodgkin's disease by these treatments. The various complications of treatment are listed in Chart 33-12. Risk factors for other cancers should be assessed, and long-term surveillance is crucial. The potential development of a second malignancy is obviously of concern to patients, and this potential should be addressed with the patient when treatment decisions are made. However, it is important to consider that Hodgkin's disease is curable. Revised treatment approaches are aimed at diminishing the risk for complications without sacrificing the potential for cure.

\section*{NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMAS (NHLs)}

The NHLs are a heterogeneous group of cancers that originate from the neoplastic growth of lymphoid tissue. As in CLL, the neoplastic cells are thought to arise from a single clone of lymphocytes; however, in NHL, the cells may vary morphologically. Most NHLs involve malignant B lymphocytes; only $5 \%$ involve T lymphocytes. In contrast to Hodgkin's disease, the lymphoid tissues involved are largely infiltrated with malignant cells. The spread of these ma-

lignant lymphoid cells occurs unpredictably, and true localized disease is uncommon. Lymph nodes from multiple sites may be infiltrated, as may sites outside the lymphoid system (extranodal tissue).

The incidence of NHL has increased dramatically over the past decade; it is now the fourth most common type of cancer diagnosed in the United States and the fifth most common cause of cancer death (Greenlee, Hill-Horton, Murray, \& Thun, 2001; Zelenetz et al., 2000). The incidence increases with each decade of life; the average age at diagnosis is 50 to 60 years. Although no common etiologic factor has been identified, there is an increased incidence of NHL in people with immunodeficiencies or autoimmune disorders, viral infections (including Epstein-Barr virus and HIV), or exposure to pesticides, solvents, or dyes. Prognosis varies greatly among the various types of NHL. Long-term survival (more than 10 years) is commonly achieved in low-grade, localized lymphomas. Even with aggressive disease forms, cure is possible in at least one third of patients who receive aggressive treatment.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms are highly variable, reflecting the diverse nature of these diseases. With early-stage disease, or with the types that are considered more indolent, symptoms may be virtually absent or very minor, and the illness typically is not diagnosed until it progresses to a later stage, when the patient is more symptomatic. At these stages (III or IV), lymphadenopathy is noticeable. One third of patients have "B symptoms" (recurrent fever, drenching night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of $10 \%$ or more).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The actual diagnosis of NHL is categorized into a highly complex classification system based on histopathology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic analyses of the malignant cells. The specific histopathologic type of the disease has important prognostic implications. Treatment also varies and is based on these features. Indolent (less aggressive) types tend to have small cells and are distributed in a follicular pattern. Aggressive types tend to have
large or immature cells distributed through the nodes in a diffuse pattern. Staging, also an important factor, is typically based on data obtained from CT scans, bone marrow biopsies, and occasionally cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The stage is based on the site of disease and its spread to other sites. For example, in stage I disease, only one area of involvement is detected; thus, stage I disease is highly localized and may respond well to localized therapy (eg, radiation therapy). In contrast, stage IV disease is detected in at least one extranodal site. Although low-grade lymphomas may not require treatment until the disease progresses to a later stage, historically they have also been relatively unresponsive to treatment in that most therapeutic modalities did not improve overall survival. More aggressive types of NHL (eg, lymphoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma) require prompt initiation of chemotherapy; however, these types tend to be more responsive to treatment.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment is based on the actual classification of disease, the stage of disease, prior treatment (if any), and the patient's ability to tolerate therapy. If the disease is not an aggressive form and is truly localized, radiation alone may be the treatment of choice. With aggressive types of NHL, aggressive combinations of chemotherapeutic agents are given even in early stages. More intermediate forms are commonly treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy for stage I and II disease. The biologic agent interferon has been approved for the treatment of follicular lowgrade lymphomas, and an antibody to CD20, rituximab (Rituxan), has been effective in achieving partial responses in patients with recurrent low-grade lymphoma. Studies of this agent in combination with conventional chemotherapy have demonstrated an improvement in survival as well (Coiffier, 2002; Emmanouilides et al., 2000; Petryk \& Grossbard, 2000). Central nervous system involvement is also common with some aggressive forms of NHL; in this situation, cranial radiation or intrathecal chemotherapy is used in addition to systemic chemotherapy. Treatment after relapse is controversial. BMT or PBSCT may be considered for patients younger than 60 years of age (See Chap. 16).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Most of the care for patients with Hodgkin's disease or NHL is performed in the outpatient setting, unless complications occur (eg, infection, respiratory compromise due to mediastinal mass). For patients who require treatment, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are most commonly used. Chemotherapy causes systemic side effects (eg, myelosuppression, nausea, hair loss, risk for infection), whereas the side effects from radiation therapy are specific to the area being irradiated. For example, patients receiving abdominal radiation therapy may experience nausea and diarrhea but not hair loss. Regardless of the type of treatment, all patients may experience fatigue.

The risk of infection is significant for these patients, not only from treatment-related myelosuppression but also from the defective immune response that results from the disease itself. Patients need to be taught to minimize the risks for infection, to recognize signs of possible infection, and to contact the health care professional should such signs develop (see Chart 33-8).

Many lymphomas can be cured with current treatments. However, as survival rates increase, the incidence of second malignancies, particularly AML or MDS, also increases. Therefore, survivors should be screened regularly for the development of second malignancies.

Lymphoma is a highly complex constellation of diseases. When caring for the patient with lymphoma, it is extremely important to know the specific disease type, stage of disease, treatment history, and current treatment plan.

\section*{MULTIPLE MYELOMA}

Multiple myeloma is a malignant disease of the most mature form of B lymphocyte, the plasma cell. It is not classified as a lymphoma. Plasma cells secrete immunoglobulins, proteins necessary for antibody production to fight infection.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In myeloma, the malignant plasma cells produce an increased amount of a specific immunoglobulin that is nonfunctional. Functional types of immunoglobulin are still produced by nonmalignant plasma cells, but in lower-than-normal quantity. The specific immunoglobulin secreted by the myeloma cells is detectable in the blood or urine and is referred to as the monoclonal protein, or M protein. This protein serves as a useful marker to monitor the extent of disease and the patient's response to therapy. It is measured by serum or urine protein electrophoresis. Moreover, the patient's total protein level is typically elevated, again due to the production of M protein. Malignant plasma cells also secrete certain substances to stimulate the creation of new blood vessels to enhance the growth of these clusters of plasma cells; this process is referred to as angiogenesis. Occasionally the plasma cells infiltrate other tissue, in which case they are referred to as plasmacytomas. Plasmacytomas can occur in the sinuses, spinal cord, and soft tissues. Median survival time is 3 to 5 years. Death usually results from infection.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The classic presenting symptom of multiple myeloma is bone pain, usually in the back or ribs. Bone pain is reported by two thirds of all patients at diagnosis. Unlike arthritic pain, the bone pain associated with myeloma increases with movement and decreases with rest; patients may report that they have less pain on awakening but the pain intensity increases during the day. In myeloma, a substance secreted by the plasma cells, osteoclast activating factor, as well as other substances (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6]) are involved in stimulating osteoclasts. Both mechanisms appear to be involved in the process of bone breakdown. Thus, lytic lesions as well as osteoporosis may be seen on bone x-rays. (They are not well visualized on bone scans.) The bone destruction can be severe enough to cause fractures, including spinal fractures, which can impinge on the spinal cord and result in spinal cord compression. It is this bone destruction that causes significant pain.

NURSING ALERT Any elderly patient whose chief complaint is back pain, and who has an elevated total protein level, should be evaluated for possible myeloma.

If the bone destruction is fairly extensive, excessive ionized calcium is lost from the bone and enters the serum; patients may therefore become hypercalcemic (frequently manifested by excessive thirst, dehydration, constipation, altered mental status, confusion, and perhaps coma). Renal failure may also be seen; the configuration of the circulating immunoglobulin molecule (particularly the shape of lambda light chains) can damage the renal tubules.

As more and more malignant plasma cells are produced, the marrow has less space for RBC production, and the patient can become anemic. This anemia is also caused to a great extent by a diminished production of erythropoietin (a glycoprotein necessary for RBC production) by the kidney. Patients may complain of fatigue and weakness due to the anemia. In the late stage of the disease, a reduced number of WBCs and platelets may also be seen because the bone marrow is infiltrated by malignant plasma cells.

When plasma cells secrete excessive amounts of immunoglobulin, particularly IgA, the serum viscosity can be elevated. Hyperviscosity may be manifested by bleeding from the nose or mouth, headache, blurred vision, paresthesias, or heart failure.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Finding an elevated monoclonal protein spike in the serum (via serum protein electrophoresis) or urine (via urine protein electrophoresis) or light chain in the urine (sometimes referred to as Bence Jones protein) is considered to be a major criterion in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The presence of lytic bone lesions on x-ray aids in the diagnosis, as does the presence of anemia or hypercalcemia. The diagnosis of myeloma can be confirmed by bone marrow biopsy; the presence of sheets of plasma cells is the hallmark diagnostic criterion. Because the infiltration of the marrow by these malignant plasma cells is not uniform, the extent of plasma cells may not be increased in a given sample (a false-negative result).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The incidence of multiple myeloma increases with age; the disease rarely occurs in patients younger than 40 years of age. Because of the increasing older population, more patients are seeking treatment for this disease. BMT or PBSCT is an option that can prolong remission and potentially cure some patients. However, it is unavailable to most because of age limitations. Back pain, which is often a presenting symptom in this disease, should be closely investigated in elderly patients.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is no cure for multiple myeloma. Even BMT or PBSCT is considered by most authorities to extend remission rather than provide a cure. However, for many patients, it is possible to control the illness and maintain their level of functioning quite well for several years or longer. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment; corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone (Decadron), are especially effective and are often combined with other agents (such as melphalan (Alkeran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), doxorubicin (Adriamyein), vincristine (Oncouin), and BCNU (Carmustine).

Radiation therapy is very useful in strengthening a specific bone lesion, particularly one at risk for bone fracture or spinal cord compression. It is also useful in relieving bone pain and reducing the size of plasma cell tumors that occur outside the skeletal system. However, because it is a nonsystemic form of treatment, it does not diminish the source of the bone problems (ie, the production of malignant plasma cells). Therefore, radiation therapy is typically used with systemic treatment such as chemotherapy.

The biologic agent alpha-interferon has been used successfully to maintain remission in selected types of myeloma, particularly IgA type; however, its role in prolonging survival is controversial. Newer forms of bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa), have been shown to strengthen bone
in this disease (by diminishing the secretion of osteoclast activating factor) (Terpos et al., 2000), controlling bone pain and potentially preventing bone fracture. They are also effective in managing and preventing hypercalcemia. Some evidence suggests that bisphosphonates may actually have activity against the myeloma cells themselves by inhibiting a growth factor necessary for myeloma cell survival (Berenson, 2001) (see later discussion).

When patients manifest signs and symptoms of hyperviscosity, plasmapheresis may be used to lower the immunoglobulin level. Symptoms may be more useful than serum viscosity levels in determining the need for this intervention.

Recent advances in the understanding of the process of angiogenesis have resulted in new therapeutic options. The sedative thalidomide (Thalomid), initially used as an antiemetic, has significant antimyeloma effects. It inhibits cytokines necessary for new vascular generation, such as, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and for myeloma cell growth and survival, such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor), by boosting the body's immune response against the tumor and by creating favorable conditions for apoptosis of the myeloma cells. Thalidomide is effective in refractory myeloma and in "smoldering" disease states, and may prevent progression to a more active state. Thalidomide is not a typical chemotherapeutic agent and has a unique side effect profile. Fatigue, dizziness, constipation, rash, and peripheral neuropathy are commonly encountered; myelosuppression is not (Goldman, 2001). Thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnancy because of associated severe birth defects.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Pain management is very important in this patient population. NSAIDs can be very useful for mild pain, or in combination with opioid analgesics. However, care needs to be taken, because NSAIDs can cause renal dysfunction. Patients need to be educated about activity restrictions (eg, lifting no more than 10 pounds, use of proper body mechanics). Braces are occasionally needed to provide support to the spinal column.

Patients also need to be instructed about the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Maintaining mobility and hydration is important to diminish exacerbations of this complication; however, the primary cause is the disease itself. Renal function should also be monitored closely. Renal failure can become severe, and dialysis may be needed. Maintaining high urine output ( $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day ) can be very useful in preventing this complication.

Because antibody production is impaired, infections, particularly bacterial infections, are common and can be life-threatening. Patients need to be instructed in appropriate infection prevention measures (see Chart 33-8) and should be advised to contact their health care provider immediately if they have a fever or other signs and symptoms of infection. Patients should receive Pneumovax and flu vaccines. Prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes used. Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) can be useful for patients with recurrent infections.

\section*{Bleeding Disorders}

Normal hemostatic mechanisms can control bleeding from vessels and prevent spontaneous bleeding. The bleeding vessel constricts and platelets aggregate at the site, forming an unstable hemostatic plug. Circulating coagulation factors are activated on the surface of these aggregated platelets, forming fibrin, which anchors the platelet plug to the site of injury.

The failure of normal hemostatic mechanisms can result in bleeding, which is severe at times. This bleeding is commonly provoked by trauma, but in certain circumstances it can occur spontaneously. When the source is platelet or coagulation factor abnormalities, the site of spontaneous bleeding can be anywhere in the body. When the defect is caused by vascular abnormalities, the site of bleeding may be more localized. Some patients have defects in more than one hemostatic mechanism simultaneously.

In a variety of situations, the bone marrow may be stimulated to increase platelet production (thrombopoiesis). The increased production may be a reactive response, as in a compensatory response to significant bleeding, or a more general response to increase hematopoiesis, as in iron deficiency anemia. Sometimes, the increase in platelets does not result from increased production but from a loss in platelet pooling within the spleen. The spleen typically holds about one third of the circulating platelets at any time. If the spleen is lost (eg, splenectomy), the platelet reservoir is also lost, and an abnormally high amount of platelets enter the circulation. In time, the rate of thrombopoiesis slows to reestablish a more normal platelet level.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Signs and symptoms of bleeding disorders vary depending on the type of defect. A careful history and physical examination can be very useful in determining the source of the hemostatic defect. Abnormalities of the vascular system give rise to local bleeding, usually into the skin. Because platelets are primarily responsible for stopping bleeding from small vessels, patients with platelet defects develop petechiae, often in clusters; these are seen on the skin and mucous membranes but also occur throughout the body. Bleeding from platelet disorders can be severe. Unless the platelet disorder is severe, bleeding can often be stopped promptly when local pressure is applied; it does not typically recur when the pressure is released.

In contrast, coagulation factor defects do not tend to cause superficial bleeding, because the primary hemostatic mechanisms are still intact. Instead, bleeding occurs deeper within the body (eg, subcutaneous or intramuscular hematomas, hemorrhage into joint spaces). External bleeding diminishes very slowly when local pressure is applied; it often recurs several hours after pressure is removed. For example, severe bleeding may start several hours after a tooth extraction. Risk factors for bleeding are provided in Chart 33-7.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management varies based on the underlying cause of the bleeding disorder. If bleeding is significant, transfusions of blood products are indicated. The specific blood product used is determined by the underlying defect. In specific situations in which fibrinolysis is excessive, hemostatic agents such as aminocaproic acid (Amicar) can be used to inhibit this process. This agent must be used with caution, because excessive inhibition of fibrinolysis can result in thrombosis.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients who have bleeding disorders or who have the potential for development of such disorders as a result of disease or therapeutic agents must be taught to observe themselves carefully and frequently for bleeding. They need to understand the importance of avoiding activities that increase the risk of bleeding, such as
contact sports. The skin is observed for petechiae and ecchymoses (bruises) and the nose and gums for bleeding. Hospitalized patients may be monitored for bleeding by testing all drainage and excreta (feces, urine, emesis, and gastric drainage) for occult as well as obvious blood. Outpatients are often given fecal occult blood screening cards to detect occult blood in stools.

\section*{PRIMARY THROMBOCYTHEMIA}

Primary thrombocythemia (also called essential thrombocythemia) is a stem cell disorder within the bone marrow. A marked increase in platelet production occurs, with the platelet count consistently greater than $600,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. Platelet size may be abnormal, but platelet survival is typically normal. Occasionally, the platelet increase is accompanied by an increase in RBCs or WBCs or both; however, these cells are not increased to the extent that they are in polycythemia vera, CML, or myelofibrosis. Although the exact cause is unknown, primary thrombocythemia is similar to other myeloproliferative disorders, particularly polycythemia vera. Unlike the other myeloproliferative disorders, however, it rarely evolves into acute leukemia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many patients with primary thrombocythemia are asymptomatic; the illness is diagnosed as the result of finding an elevated platelet count on a CBC. Symptoms, when they do occur, result primarily from hemorrhage or vasoocclusion in the microvasculature. Symptoms may occur more when the platelet count exceeds 1 million/ $\mathrm{mm}^{3}$. However, symptoms do not always correlate with the extent to which the platelet count is elevated. Thrombosis is common and can be either arterial or venous; major thromboses occur in $15 \%$ to $40 \%$ of these patients (Jantunen et al., 2001). Because these platelets can be dysfunctional, minor or major hemorrhage can also occur. Bleeding from the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth is common, and significant gastrointestinal bleeding is also possible. Bleeding typically does not occur until the platelet count exceeds 1 million $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$.

Vasoocclusive manifestations are most frequently seen in the form of erythromelalgia. The toxic effects of platelet substances include painful burning, warmth, and redness in a localized distal area of the extremities. Neurologic manifestations may also be seen, such as numbness, tingling, and visual disturbance; these occlusive manifestations can progress to stroke and seizure and, less commonly, to myocardial infarction. The spleen may be enlarged, but usually not to a significant extent.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of primary thrombocythemia is made by ruling out other potential disorders. Iron deficiency should be excluded, because a reactive increase in the platelet count often accompanies this deficiency. The myeloproliferative disorders (CML, polycythemia vera) should also be excluded. Examination of the CBC shows markedly abnormal platelets. Analysis of the bone marrow (by aspiration and biopsy) shows a marked increase in megakaryocytes (platelet precursors) and is useful in excluding CML as a possible cause for the elevated platelet count. The disease, which affects men and women equally, tends to occur in late middle age. The median survival time exceeds 10 years.

No data reliably predict the development of complications. Risk factors for the development of thrombotic complications are
age greater than 65 years, prior thrombotic events, and long duration of thrombocytosis. Major bleeding tends to occur when the platelet count is very high.

\section*{Medical Management}

The management of primary thrombocythemia is highly controversial. The risk of significant thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications may not be increased until the platelet count exceeds 1 million $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ (Briere \& Guilmin, 2001). A careful assessment of other risk factors, such as history of peripheral vascular disease, history of tobacco use, atherosclerosis, and prior thrombotic events, should be used in making the decision as to when to initiate therapy. In younger patients with no risk factors, low-dose aspirin therapy may be sufficient to prevent thrombotic complications; however, the use of aspirin can increase the risk for hemorrhagic complications and may be considered a contraindication in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The neurologic symptoms (eg, headache and erythromelalgia) and visual symptoms of primary thrombocytopenia can be relieved by low-dose aspirin.

More aggressive measures may be required in older patients and in those with concurrent risk factors. Hydroxyurea (eg, Hydrea), a chemotherapeutic medication, is effective in lowering the platelet count. It is taken orally and causes minimal side effects other than dose-related leukopenia. However, its potential for leukogenesis is in question. The medication anagrelide (Agrylin) is more specific in lowering the platelet count than is hydroxyurea, but it has more side effects. Severe headaches cause many patients to stop taking the medication. Tachycardia and chest pain may also occur, and anagrelide is contraindicated in patients with concurrent cardiac problems. Interferon-alfa-2b (eg, Intron-A) has been shown to lower platelet counts by an unknown mechanism. The medication is administered subcutaneously at varying frequency, commonly three times per week. Significant side effects, such as fatigue, weakness, memory defects, dizziness, anemia, and liver dysfunction, limit its usefulness.

Rarely, the occlusive symptoms are so great that the platelet count must be reduced immediately. Platelet pheresis (see later discussion) can reduce the amount of circulating platelets, but only transiently. The extent by which symptoms and complications (eg, thromboses) are reduced remains unclear.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients with primary thrombocythemia need to be instructed about the accompanying risks of hemorrhage and thrombosis. Patients should be informed about signs and symptoms of thrombosis, particularly the neurologic manifestations, such as visual changes, numbness, tingling, and weakness. Risk factors for thrombosis should be assessed, and measures to diminish risk factors (particularly cessation of tobacco use) should be encouraged. Patients receiving aspirin therapy should be informed about the increased risk for bleeding. Patients who are at risk for bleeding should be instructed about medications that can alter platelet function, such as aspirin, NSAIDs, and alcohol. Patients receiving interferon therapy should be taught to self-administer the medication and manage side effects.

\section*{SECONDARY THROMBOCYTOSIS}

Increased platelet production is the primary mechanism of secondary, or reactive, thrombocytosis. The platelet count is above
normal, but, in contrast to primary thrombocythemia, an increase above 1 million/ $\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ is rare. Platelet function is normal; the platelet survival time is normal or decreased. Symptoms associated with hemorrhage or thrombosis are rare. Many disorders can cause a reactive increase in platelets, including chronic inflammatory disorders, iron deficiency, malignant disease, acute hemorrhage, and splenectomy (see previous discussion of primary thrombocythemia). Treatment is aimed at the underlying disorder. With successful management, the platelet count usually returns to normal.

\section*{THROMBOCYTOPENIA}

Thrombocytopenia (low platelet level) can result from various factors: decreased production of platelets within the bone marrow, increased destruction of platelets, or increased consumption of platelets. Causes and treatments are summarized in Table 33-5.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Bleeding and petechiae usually do not occur with platelet counts greater than $50,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, although excessive bleeding can follow surgery or other trauma. When the platelet count drops below

$20,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, petechiae can appear, along with nose and gingival bleeding, excessive menstrual bleeding, and excessive bleeding after surgery or dental extractions. When the platelet count is less than $5000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, spontaneous, potentially fatal central nervous system or gastrointestinal hemorrhage can occur. If the platelets are dysfunctional due to disease (eg, MDS) or medications (eg, aspirin), the risk of bleeding may be much greater even when the actual platelet count is not significantly reduced.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A platelet deficiency that results from decreased production (eg, leukemia, MDS) can usually be diagnosed by examining the bone marrow via aspiration and biopsy. When platelet destruction is the cause of thrombocytopenia, the marrow shows increased megakaryocytes (the cells from which the platelets originate) and normal or even increased platelet production as the body attempts to compensate for the decreased platelets in circulation. Another cause of thrombocytopenia is sequestration. Approximately one third of the circulating platelets are within the spleen, and a greatly enlarged spleen results in increased sequestration of platelets.

\section*{Medical Management}

The management for secondary thrombocytopenia is usually treatment of the underlying disease. If platelet production is impaired, platelet transfusions may raise the platelet count and stop bleeding or prevent spontaneous hemorrhage. If excessive platelet destruction occurs, transfused platelets will also be destroyed, and the platelet count will not rise. The most common cause of excessive platelet destruction is ITP (see the following discussion). In some instances splenectomy can be a useful therapeutic intervention, but often it is not a therapeutic option, for example in patients in whom the enlarged spleen is due to portal hypertension related to excessive alcohol consumption.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The interventions for a patient with thrombocytopenia are delineated in Chart 33-10.

\section*{IDIOPATHIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (ITP)}

ITP is a disease that affects people of all ages, but it is more common among children and young women. There are two forms of ITP: acute and chronic. The acute form, which occurs predominately in children, often appears 1 to 6 weeks after a viral illness. This form is self-limited; remission often occurs spontaneously within 6 months. Occasionally, corticosteroids are needed for a brief time. Chronic ITP is often diagnosed by exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Although the precise cause remains unknown, viral infections sometimes precede ITP in children. Occasionally medications such as sulfa drugs can induce ITP. Other conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or pregnancy, can also induce ITP. Anti-platelet autoantibodies that bind to the patient's platelets are found in the blood of patients with ITP. When the platelets are bound by the antibodies, the RES or tissue macrophage system
ingests the platelets, destroying them. The body attempts to compensate for this destruction by increasing platelet production within the marrow.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many patients have no symptoms, and the low platelet count (often less than $20,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, and less than $5000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ is not uncommon) is an incidental finding. Common physical manifestations are easy bruising, heavy menses, and petechiae on the extremities or trunk. Patients with simple bruising or petechiae ("dry purpura") tend to have fewer complications from bleeding than those with bleeding from mucosal surfaces, such as the gastrointestinal tract (including the mouth) and pulmonary system (eg, hemoptysis), which is termed "wet purpura." Patients with wet purpura have a greater risk for intracranial bleeding than do those with dry purpura. Despite low platelet counts, the platelets are young and very functional. They adhere to endothelial surfaces and to one another, so spontaneous bleeding does not always occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Patients may have an isolated decrease in platelets (less than $20,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ is common), but they may also have an increase in megakaryocytes (platelet precursors) within the marrow, as detected on bone marrow aspirate.

\section*{Medical Management}

The primary goal of treatment is a safe platelet count. Because the risk of bleeding typically does not increase until the platelet count is lower than $10,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, patients whose counts exceed 30,000 to $50,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ may be carefully observed without additional intervention. However, if the count is lower than $20,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, or if bleeding occurs, the goal is to improve the patient's platelet count, rather than to cure the disease. Treatment for ITP usually requires several approaches. If the patient is taking a medication that is known to cause ITP (eg, quinine, sulfacontaining medications), that medication must be stopped immediately. The mainstay of short-term therapy is the use of immunosuppressive agents. The immunosuppressants block the binding receptors on macrophages so that the platelets are not destroyed. Prednisone is the agent typically used (at a dose of $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ), and it is effective in about $75 \%$ of patients. Cyclophosphamide (eg, Cytoxan) and azathioprine (Imuran) can also be used, and dexamethasone (eg, Decadron) may be effective. Platelet counts rise within a few days after institution of corticosteroid therapy; this effect takes longer with azathioprine. Because of the associated side effects, patients cannot take high doses of corticosteroids indefinitely. It is not unusual for the platelet count to drop once the corticosteroid dose is tapered. Some patients can be successfully maintained on low doses of prednisone (eg, 2.5 to 10 mg every other day).

Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) is also commonly used to treat ITP. It is effective in binding the receptors on the macrophages; however, high doses ( $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ for 2 days) are required, and the drug is very expensive. Splenectomy is an alternative treatment but results in a normal platelet count only $50 \%$ of the time; however, many patients can maintain a "safe" platelet count of more than $30,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ after removal of the spleen. Even those who do respond to splenectomy may have recurrences of severe thrombocytopenia months or years later. Patients who
have splenectomy are permanently at risk for sepsis; these patients should receive Pneumovax, Haemophilus influenzae B, and meningococcal vaccines, preferably 2 to 3 weeks before the splenectomy is preferred. Pneumovax vaccine should be repeated at 5- to 10-year intervals.

Other options for management include use of the chemotherapy agent vincristine (Oncovin). Vincristine appears to work by blocking the receptors on the macrophages and therefore inhibiting platelet destruction; it may also stimulate thrombopoiesis. Some data support the efficacy of certain monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab) in increasing platelet counts, but more research is needed (Stasi, Pagano, Stipa, \& Amadori, 2001; Saleh et al., 2000).

Another approach to the management of chronic ITP involves the use of anti-D (eg, WinRho) in patients who are Rh(D)-positive. The actual mechanism of action is unknown. One theory is that the anti-D binds to the patient's RBCs, which are in turn destroyed by the body's macrophages. While the macrophages destroy the anti-D/RBC complex, they are not able to destroy platelets. Anti-D produces a transient decreased hematocrit and increased platelet count in many, but not all, patients with ITP. Anti-D appears to be most effective in children with ITP and least effective in patients who have undergone splenectomy.

Despite the extremely low platelet count, platelet transfusions are usually avoided. Transfusions tend to be ineffective because the patient's anti-platelet antibodies bind with the transfused platelets, causing them to be destroyed. Platelet counts can actually drop after platelet transfusion. Occasionally, transfusion of platelets may protect against catastrophic bleeding in patients with severe wet purpura. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA; Amicar) may be useful for patients with significant mucosal bleeding refractory to other treatments.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care for these patients should include an assessment of the patient's life style to determine the risk of bleeding from activity. A careful medication history should also be obtained, including use of over-the-counter medications, herbs, and nutritional supplements. The nurse must be alert for sulfa-containing medications and medications that alter platelet function (eg, medications that contain aspirin or other NSAIDs). The nurse should assess for any history of recent viral illness and reports of headache or visual disturbances (which could be initial symptoms of intracranial bleeding). Patients who are admitted to the hospital with wet purpura and low platelet counts should have a neurologic assessment incorporated into their routine vital sign measurements. No intramuscular injections or rectal medications should be administered, and rectal temperature measurements should not be performed, because they can stimulate bleeding.

Patient teaching should address signs of exacerbation of disease (petechiae, ecchymoses); how to contact appropriate health care personnel; the name and type of medication inducing ITP (if appropriate); current medical treatment (medications, tapering schedule if relevant, side effects); and the frequency of monitoring the platelet count. Patients should be instructed to avoid all agents that interfere with platelet function. The patient should avoid constipation, the Valsalva maneuver (eg, straining at stool), and flossing of the teeth. Electric razors should be used for shaving, and soft-bristled toothbrushes should replace stiff-bristled ones. Patients should also be counseled to refrain from vigorous sexual intercourse when the platelet count is less than $10,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. Patients who are receiving chronic corticosteroids are at risk for
complications including osteoporosis, proximal muscle wasting, cataract formation, and dental caries (see Chart 33-4). Bone mineral density should be monitored, and these patients may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation and bisphosphonate therapy to prevent significant bone disease.

\section*{PLATELET DEFECTS}

Quantitative platelet defects are relatively common (thrombocytopenia), but qualitative defects can also occur. With qualitative defects, the number of platelets may be normal, but the platelets do not function normally. Platelet function is most commonly evaluated by the bleeding time; however, this test is a crude measurement at best.

An important functional platelet disorder is that induced by aspirin. Even small amounts of aspirin reduce normal platelet aggregation, and the prolonged bleeding time lasts for several days after aspirin ingestion. Although this does not cause bleeding in most people, patients with a coagulation disorder (eg, hemophilia) or thrombocytopenia can have significant bleeding after taking aspirin, particularly if invasive procedures or trauma has occurred.

NSAIDs can also inhibit platelet function, but the effect is not as prolonged as with aspirin (about 5 days versus 7 to 10 days). Other causes of platelet dysfunction include end-stage renal disease, possibly from metabolic products affecting platelet function; MDS; multiple myeloma (due to abnormal protein interfering with platelet function); cardiopulmonary bypass; and other medications and substances (Chart 33-13).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Bleeding may be mild or severe. Its extent is not necessarily correlated with the platelet count or with tests that measure coagulation (prothrombin time [PT], partial thromboplastin time [PTT]). Ecchymoses are common, particularly on the extremities. Patients with platelet dysfunction may be at risk for significant bleeding after trauma or invasive procedures (eg, biopsy, dental extraction).

\section*{Medical Management}

If the platelet dysfunction is caused by medication, use of the offending medication should be stopped, if possible, particularly when bleeding occurs. If platelet dysfunction is marked, bleeding can often be prevented by transfusion of normal platelets before invasive procedures. Amniocaproic acid (EACA; Amicar) may be required to prevent significant bleeding after such procedures.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients with significant platelet dysfunction need to be instructed to avoid agents that can diminish platelet function, such as certain over-the-counter medications, herbs, nutritional supplements, and alcohol. They also need to be assisted to serve as their own advocates and to inform their health care providers (including dentists) of the underlying condition before any invasive procedure is performed, so that appropriate steps can be initiated to diminish the risk of bleeding. Bleeding precautions should be initiated as appropriate (see Chart 33-10).

\section*{HEMOPHILIA}

Two inherited bleeding disorders-hemophilia A and hemophilia B—are clinically indistinguishable, although they can be distinguished by laboratory tests. Hemophilia A is caused by a
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-430.jpg?height=1451&width=866&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=109)
genetic defect that results in deficient or defective factor VIII; hemophilia B (also called Christmas disease) stems from a genetic defect that causes deficient or defective factor IX. Hemophilia is a relatively rare disease; hemophilia A, which occurs in 1 of every 10,000 births, is three times more common than hemophilia B. Both types of hemophilia are inherited as X-linked traits, so almost all affected people are males; females can be carriers but are almost always asymptomatic. The disease is recognized in early childhood, usually in the toddler age group. However, patients with mild hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they experience severe trauma (eg, a high-school football injury) or surgery. Hemophilia occurs in all ethnic groups.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The disease, which can be severe, is manifested by hemorrhages into various parts of the body. Hemorrhage can occur even after minimal trauma. The frequency and severity of the bleeding depend on the degree of factor deficiency as well as the intensity of the precipitating trauma. For example, patients who have a mild factor VIII deficiency (ie, $6 \%$ to $50 \%$ of normal levels) rarely develop hemorrhage spontaneously; hemorrhage tends to occur
secondary to trauma. In contrast, spontaneous hemorrhages, particularly hemarthroses and hematomas, can frequently occur in patients with severe factor VIII deficiency (ie, less than $1 \%$ of normal levels). These patients require frequent factor replacement therapy.

About $75 \%$ of all bleeding in patients with hemophilia occurs into joints. The most commonly affected joints are the knees, elbows, ankles, shoulders, wrists, and hips. Patients often note pain in a joint before they are aware of swelling and limitation of motion. Recurrent joint hemorrhages can result in damage so severe that chronic pain or ankylosis (fixation) of the joint occurs. Many patients with severe factor deficiency are crippled by the joint damage before they become adults. Hematomas can be superficial or deep hemorrhages into muscle or subcutaneous tissue. With severe factor deficiency, they can occur without known trauma and progressively extend in all directions. When the hematomas occur within muscle, particularly in the extremities, peripheral nerves can be compressed. Over time, this compression results in decreased sensation, weakness, and atrophy of the area involved. Spontaneous hematuria and gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Bleeding is also common in other mucous membranes, such as the nasal passages. The most dangerous site of hemorrhage is in the head (intracranial or extracranial). Any head trauma requires prompt evaluation and treatment. Surgical procedures typically result in excessive bleeding at the surgical site. Because clot formation is poor, wound healing is also poor. Such bleeding is most commonly associated with dental extraction.

\section*{Medical Management}

In the past, the only treatment for hemophilia was infusion of fresh frozen plasma, which had to be administered in such large quantities that patients experienced fluid volume overload. Now factor VIII and factor IX concentrates are available to all blood banks. Recombinant forms of these factors have been made available and may diminish the use of factor concentrates. Patients are given concentrates when they are actively bleeding or as a preventive measure before traumatic procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, dental extraction, surgery). The patient and family are taught how to administer the concentrate intravenously at home at the first sign of bleeding. It is crucial to initiate treatment as soon as possible so that bleeding complications can be avoided. A few patients eventually develop antibodies to the concentrates, so their factor levels cannot be increased. Treatment of this problem is extremely difficult and often unsuccessful.

Aminocaproic acid (EACA; Amicar) is a fibrinolytic enzyme inhibitor that can slow the dissolution of blood clots that do form; it is very effective as an adjunctive measure after oral surgery. It is also useful in treating mucosal bleeding. Another agent, desmopressin (eg, DDAVP), induces a transient rise in factor VIII levels; the mechanism for this response is unknown. In patients with mild forms of hemophilia A, desmopressin is extremely useful, significantly reducing the amount of blood products required. However, desmopressin is not effective in patients with severe factor VIII deficiency.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Most patients with hemophilia are diagnosed as children. They often require assistance in coping with the condition because it is chronic, places restrictions on their lives, and is an inherited disorder that can be passed to future generations. From childhood, patients are helped to accept themselves and the disease and to identify the positive aspects of their lives. They are encouraged to be
self-sufficient and to maintain independence by preventing unnecessary trauma that can cause acute bleeding episodes and temporarily interfere with normal activities. As they work through their feelings about the condition and progress to accepting it, they can assume more and more responsibility for maintaining optimal health.

Patients with mild factor deficiency may not be diagnosed until adulthood if they do not experience significant trauma or surgery as children. These patients need extensive teaching about activity restrictions and self-care measures to diminish the chance of hemorrhage and complications of bleeding. The nurse should emphasize safety at home and in the workplace.

Patients with hemophilia are instructed to avoid any agents that interfere with platelet aggregation, such as aspirin, NSAIDs, herbs, nutritional supplements, and alcohol. This restriction applies to over-the-counter medications such as cold remedies. Dental hygiene is very important as a preventive measure because dental extractions are so hazardous. Applying pressure may be sufficient to control bleeding resulting from minor trauma if the factor deficiency is not severe. Nasal packing should be avoided, because bleeding frequently resumes when the packing is removed. Splints and other orthopedic devices may be useful in patients with joint or muscle hemorrhages. All injections should be avoided; invasive procedures (eg, endoscopy, lumbar puncture) should be minimized or performed after administration of appropriate factor replacement. Patients with hemophilia should be encouraged to carry or wear medical identification.

During hemorrhagic episodes, the extent of bleeding must be assessed carefully. Patients who are at risk for significant compromise (eg, bleeding into the respiratory tract or brain) warrant close observation and systematic assessment for emergent complications (eg, respiratory distress, altered level of consciousness). If the patient has had recent surgery, the nurse frequently and carefully assesses the surgical site for bleeding. Frequent vital sign monitoring is needed until the nurse is certain that there is no excessive postoperative bleeding.

Analgesics are commonly required to alleviate the pain associated with hematomas and hemorrhage into joints. Many patients report that warm baths promote relaxation, improve mobility, and lessen pain. However, during bleeding episodes, heat, which can accentuate bleeding, is avoided; applications of cold are used instead.

Although recent technology (ie, the formulation of heatsolvent or detergent-treated factor concentrates) has rendered factor VIII and IX preparations free from viruses such as HIV and hepatitis, many patients have already been exposed to these infections. These patients and their families may need assistance in coping with the diagnosis and the consequences of these infections.

Between $15 \%$ and $50 \%$ of patients with hemophilia $A$ and between $1 \%$ and $3 \%$ of patients with hemophilia $B$ develop antibodies (inhibitors) to factor concentrates, complicating factor replacement management (Lusher, 2000; White, Greenwood, Escobar, \& Frelinger, 2000). These patients may require plasmapheresis or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, particularly in the setting of significant bleeding. Patients with severe factor deficiency should be screened for antibodies, particularly before major surgery.

\section*{VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE}

Von Willebrand's disease, a common bleeding disorder affecting males and females equally, is usually inherited as a dominant trait. The disease is caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is necessary for factor VIII activity. vWF is also nec-
essary for platelet adhesion at the site of vascular injury. Although synthesis of factor VIII is normal, its half-life is shortened; therefore, factor VIII levels commonly are mildly low ( $15 \%$ to 50\% of normal).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients commonly have nosebleeds, excessively heavy menses, bleeding from cuts, and postoperative bleeding, although they do not suffer from massive soft tissue or joint hemorrhages. As the laboratory values fluctuate, so does the bleeding. For example, a careful history of prior bleeding may show little problem with postoperative bleeding on one occasion but significant bleeding from a dental extraction at another time.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Laboratory test results show a normal platelet count but prolonged bleeding time and slightly prolonged PTT. These defects are not static, and laboratory test results can vary widely within the same patient over time.

\section*{Medical Management}

Both the factor deficiency and the platelet impairment can be corrected by administration of cryoprecipitate, which contains factor VIII, fibrinogen, and factor XIII (or fresh frozen plasma, if cryoprecipitate is unavailable). Replacement continues for several days to ensure correction of the factor VIII deficiency; up to 7 to 10 days of treatment may be necessary after major surgery. Desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic vasopressin analog, can be used to prevent bleeding associated with dental or surgical procedures or to manage mild bleeding after surgery. Desmopressin provides a transient increase in factor VIII coagulant activity and may also correct the bleeding time. It can be administered as an intravenous infusion or intranasally. With major surgery or invasive procedures, both desmopressin and cryoprecipitate may be needed to prevent hemorrhage.

\section*{Acquired Coagulation Disorders}

\section*{LIVER DISEASE}

With the exception of factor VIII, most blood coagulation factors are synthesized in the liver. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction (due to cirrhosis, tumor, or hepatitis; see Chap. 39) can result in diminished amounts of the factors needed to maintain coagulation and hemostasis. Prolongation of the PT, unless it is caused by vitamin K deficiency, may indicate severe hepatic dysfunction. Although minor bleeding is common (eg, ecchymoses), these patients are also at risk for significant bleeding, related especially to trauma or surgery. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma may be required to replace clotting factors and to prevent or stop bleeding. Patients may also have life-threatening hemorrhage from peptic ulcers or esophageal varices. In these cases, replacement with fresh frozen plasma, PRBCs, and platelets is usually required.

\section*{VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY}

The synthesis of many coagulation factors depends on vitamin K . Vitamin K deficiency is typical in malnourished patients, and some antibiotics decrease the intestinal flora that produce vitamin K , depleting vitamin K stores. Administration of vitamin K (phyton-
azdione [eg, Mephyton], either orally or as a subcutaneous injection) can correct the deficiency quickly; adequate synthesis of coagulation factors is reflected by normalization of the PT.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY}

Anticoagulants are used in the treatment or prevention of thrombosis. These agents, particularly warfarin or heparin, can result in bleeding. If the PT or PTT is longer than desired and bleeding has not occurred, the medication can be stopped or the dose decreased. Vitamin K is administered for warfarin toxicity. Protamine sulfate is rarely needed for heparin toxicity, because the half-life of heparin is very short. With significant bleeding, fresh frozen plasma replaces the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Other complications of anticoagulant therapy are discussed in Chapter 31.

\section*{DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)}

DIC is not a disease but a sign of an underlying condition. DIC may be triggered by sepsis, trauma, cancer, shock, abruptio placentae, toxins, or allergic reactions (Chart 33-14). It is potentially life-threatening.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In DIC, the normal hemostatic mechanisms are altered so that a massive amount of tiny clots forms in the microcirculation. Initially, the coagulation time is normal. However, as the platelets and clotting factors are consumed to form the microthrombi, coagulation fails. Thus, the paradoxical result of excessive clotting is bleeding. The clinical manifestations of DIC are reflected in the organs, which are affected either by excessive clot formation (with resultant ischemia to all or part of the organ) or by bleeding. The bleeding is characterized by low platelet and fibrinogen levels; prolonged PT, PTT, and thrombin time; and elevated fibrin degradation products (D-dimers) (Table 33-6).

The mortality rate can exceed $80 \%$ of patients who develop DIC. Identification of patients who are at risk for DIC and recognition of the early clinical manifestations of this syndrome can result in earlier medical intervention, which may improve the prognosis. However, the primary prognostic factor is the ability to treat the underlying condition that precipitated DIC.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients with DIC may bleed from mucous membranes, venipuncture sites, and the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. The bleeding can range from minimal occult internal bleeding to profuse hem-

orrhage from all orifices. Patients may also develop organ dysfunction, such as renal failure and pulmonary and multifocal central nervous system infarctions as a result of microthromboses, macrothromboses, or hemorrhages.

During the initial process of DIC, the patient may have no new symptoms, the only manifestation being a progressive decrease in the platelet count. As the thrombosis becomes more extensive, the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of thrombosis in the organs involved. Then, as the clotting factors and platelets are consumed to form these thrombi, bleeding occurs. Initially the bleeding is subtle, but it can develop into frank hemorrhage. Signs and symptoms depend on the organs involved and are listed in Table 33-7.

\section*{Medical Management}

The most important management issue is treating the underlying cause of the DIC. Until the cause is controlled, the mechanism for DIC will persist. A second goal is to correct the secondary effects of tissue ischemia by improving oxygenation, replacing fluids, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and administering vasopressor medications. If serious hemorrhage occurs, the depleted coagulation factors and platelets may be replaced to reestablish the potential for normal hemostasis and thereby diminish bleeding. Cryoprecipitate is given to replace fibrinogen and factors V and VII; fresh frozen plasma is administered to replace other coagulation factors.

A controversial method to interrupt the thrombosis process is the use of heparin infusion. Heparin may inhibit the formation of microthrombi and thus permit perfusion of the organs (skin, kidneys, or brain) to resume. Heparin is typically reserved for the patient in whom thrombotic manifestations predominate or in whom extensive blood component replacement fails to halt the hemorrhage or increase fibrinogen and other clotting levels. When heparin is administered, bleeding may actually worsen initially until the thrombotic process is interrupted. Consumed platelets and clotting factors need to be replaced. The effectiveness of heparin can best be determined by observing for normalization of the plasma fibrinogen concentration and diminishing signs of bleeding.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)}

\section*{Assessment}

Nurses need to be aware of patients who are at risk for DIC. Sepsis and acute promyelocytic leukemia are the most common causes of DIC. Patients need to be assessed thoroughly and frequently for signs and symptoms of thrombi and bleeding and monitored for any progression of these signs (see Table 33-7).

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient with DIC may include the following:
- Risk for deficient fluid volume related to bleeding
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to ischemia or bleeding
- Potential for excess fluid volume related to excessive blood/ factor component replacement
- Ineffective tissue perfusion related to microthrombi
- Anxiety and fear of the unknown and possible death

*Because DIC is a dynamic condition, the laboratory values measured will change over time. Therefore, a progressive increase or decrease in a given laboratory value is likely to be more important than the actual value of a test at a single point in time.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Collaborative problems include the clinical conditions that precipitated the DIC. Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Renal failure
- Gangrene
- Pulmonary embolism or hemorrhage
- Altered level of consciousness
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Stroke

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Major patient goals include maintenance of hemodynamic status, maintenance of intact skin and oral mucosa, mainte-
nance of fluid balance, maintenance of tissue perfusion, enhanced coping, and absence of complications (see Plan of Nursing Care).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

See Plan of Nursing Care: The Patient with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Despite aggressive measures, the lack of renal perfusion may result in acute renal failure, sometimes necessitating dialysis. Placement of a large-bore dialysis catheter is extremely hazardous in this patient population and should be accompanied by adequate platelet and plasma transfusions.

\section*{Evaluation}

See the Plan of Nursing Care for evaluation and expected outcomes for the patient with DIC.

\section*{THROMBOTIC DISORDERS}

As in many bleeding disorders, several conditions can alter the balance within the normal hemostasis process and cause exces-
sive thrombosis. Abnormalities that predispose a person to thrombotic events include decreased clotting inhibitors within the circulation (which enhances coagulation), altered hepatic function (which may decrease production of clotting factors or clearance of activated coagulation factors), lack of fibrinolytic enzymes, and tortuous vessels (which promote platelet aggregation). Thrombosis can be caused by more than one predisposing factor. Several conditions can result from thrombosis, such as myocardial infarction (see Chap. 28), cerebral vascular accident
(CVA, brain attack, or stroke; see Chap. 62), and peripheral arterial occlusion (see Chap. 31). Several inherited or acquired deficiency conditions, including hyperhomocystinemia, antithrombin III (AT III) deficiency, Protein C deficiency, activated Protein C (APC) resistance, factor V Leiden, and Protein S deficiency can predispose a patient to repeated episodes of thrombosis; they are referred to as hypercoagulable states or thrombophilia. Table 33-8 delineates these disorders, their abnormal laboratory values, and the need for family testing.

Thrombosis requires anticoagulation therapy. The duration of therapy varies with the location and extent of the thrombosis, precipitating events (eg, trauma, immobilization), and concurrent risk factors (eg, use of oral contraceptives, tortuous blood vessels, history of thrombotic events).

\section*{HYPERHOMOCYSTINEMIA}

Increased plasma levels of homocystine are a significant risk factor not only for venous thrombosis (eg, deep venous thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism) but also for arterial thrombosis (eg, stroke, myocardial infarction). This disorder can be heredi-

tary, or it can result from a nutritional deficiency of folic acid and, to a lesser extent, of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and $\mathrm{B}_{6}$, because these vitamins are cofactors in homocystine metabolism. For unknown reasons, people who are elderly, have renal failure, or smoke tobacco may also have elevated levels of homocystine in the absence of nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins. Although a simple fasting measurement of plasma homocystine can serve as a useful screening test, people with heterozygous defects in this gene and those who are vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ deficient may have normal or minimally elevated levels. A much more sensitive method involves obtaining a second measurement 4 hours after the patient consumes methionine; the prevalence of hyperhomocystinemia is twice as great when this method is used. In hyperhomocystinemia, the endothelial lining of the vessel walls is denuded; this can precipitate unnecessary thrombus formation. Recent studies have determined that this disorder is much more common than previously thought. In a long-term epidemiologic study on nurses' health (Rimm et al., 1998), women who used dietary supplements with folic acid and vitamin $B_{6}$ were found to have a lower incidence of thrombotic conditions such as DVT. Patients who are found to have hyperhomocystinemia should receive folic acid, $\mathrm{B}_{6}$, and/or $B_{12}$ supplements and should be instructed in the rationale for their use to enhance compliance.

\section*{ANTITHROMBIN III DEFICIENCY}

Antithrombin is a protein that inhibits thrombin and certain coagulation factors. AT III deficiency is an extremely common hereditary condition that can cause venous thrombosis, particularly when the level is less than $60 \%$ of normal. Patients with AT III deficiency can develop venous thrombosis as young adults; by 50 years of age, two thirds of patients with AT III deficiency have developed a venous thrombosis. The most common sites for thrombosis are the deep veins of the leg and the mesentery. Recurrent thrombosis often occurs. There is an increased resistance to heparin anticoagulation, so these patients may require greater amounts of heparin to achieve adequate anticoagulation. Patients with ATIII deficiency should be encouraged to have their family members tested for the deficiency.

\section*{PROTEIN C DEFICIENCY}

Protein C is an enzyme that, when activated, inhibits coagulation. When levels of Protein C are deficient, the risk of thrombosis increases, and thrombosis can often occur spontaneously. Protein C deficiency is at least as prevalent as AT III deficiency, and people who are Protein C-deficient can develop thrombosis early in life, as early as 15 years of age. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but significant complication of anticoagulation management in patients with Protein C deficiency (Hoffman et al., 2000). This complication appears to result from progressive thrombosis in the capillaries within the skin; the extent of the necrosis can be extreme.

\section*{ACTIVATED PROTEIN C RESISTANCE AND FACTOR V LEIDEN MUTATION}

Activated protein C (APC) resistance is a common condition that can occur with other hypercoagulable states. APC is an anticoagulant, and resistance to APC increases the risk for venous thrombosis. A molecular defect in the factor V gene has been identified in
most (90\%) of those with APC resistance; this defect is called factor V Leiden mutation. It has been identified as the most common cause of inherited hypercoagulability in Caucasians, but its incidence appears to be much lower in other ethnic groups. Factor $V$ Leiden mutation synergistically increases the risk for thrombosis in patients with other risk factors (eg, use of oral contraceptives, hyperhomocystinemia, increased age). It does not appear that the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy in women increases the risk for thrombotic events as does the use of oral contraceptives; the dose of estrogen in the former situation is much lower than in the latter. People who are homozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation are at extremely high risk for thrombosis.

\section*{PROTEIN S DEFICIENCY}

Protein $S$ is another natural anticoagulant normally produced in the liver. APC requires Protein $S$ to inactivate certain clotting factors. When the level of Protein $S$ is deficient, this inactivation process is diminished, and the risk for thrombosis can be increased. Like patients with Protein C deficiency, those with Protein S deficiency have a greater risk for recurrent venous thrombosis at a young age, as young as 15 years.

\section*{ACQUIRED THROMBOPHILIA}

Antibodies to phospholipids are common, acquired causes for thrombophilia (hypercoagulable states). The most common antibodies present against phospholipids are either lupus or anticardiolipin antibodies. Both of these antibodies can be transient, resulting from infection or certain medications. Most thrombotic events are venous, but arterial thrombosis can occur in up to one third of the cases. Patients who persistently test positive for either antibody and who have had a thrombotic event are at significant risk for recurrent thrombosis (greater than $50 \%$ ). Recurrent thromboses tend to be of the same type-that is, venous thrombosis after an initial venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis after an initial arterial thrombosis.

Another common acquired cause for thrombophilia is cancer. Specific types of stomach, pancreatic, lung, and ovarian cancers are most commonly associated with thrombophilia. The type of thrombosis that results is unusual. Rather than deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, the thrombosis occurs in unusual sites, such as the portal, hepatic, or renal vein or the inferior vena cava. Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis can also occur. In these patients, anticoagulation can be difficult to manage in that the thrombosis can progress despite standard amounts of anticoagulation.

\section*{Medical Management}

The primary method of treating thrombotic disorders is anticoagulation. However, in thrombophilic conditions, when to treat (prophylaxis or not) and how long to treat (lifelong or not) can be controversial. Anticoagulation therapy is not without risks; the most significant risk is bleeding. Risks of anticoagulation therapy are identified in Chapter 31. The most common anticoagulant medications are identified in the following section.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Along with administering anticoagulant therapy, concerns include minimizing any risk factors that predispose a patient to
thrombosis. When risk factors (eg, immobility after surgery, pregnancy) cannot be avoided, prophylactic anticoagulation may be necessary.

Unfractionated Heparin Therapy. Heparin is a naturally occurring anticoagulant that enhances AT III and inhibits platelet function. To prevent thrombosis, heparin is typically given as a subcutaneous injection, two or three times daily. To treat thrombosis, heparin is usually administered intravenously. The therapeutic effect of heparin is monitored by serial measurements of the activated partial prothrombin time; the dose is adjusted to maintain the range at 1.5 to 2.5 times the laboratory control. Oral forms are being evaluated, but their absorption remains variable (Money \& York, 2001).

A significant potential complication of heparin-based therapy is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Antibodies are formed within the body against the heparin complex. The actual incidence of HIT is unknown, but it is thought to occur in as many as $5 \%$ patients receiving heparin (Kelton, 1999). Whereas most patients remain asymptomatic, a significant proportion of those individuals with serologic HIT develop actual thrombocytopenia. A decline in platelet count typically develops after 5 to 8 days of heparin therapy, and the platelets can drop significantly, although in most instances the level stays higher than $50,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. These patients are at increased risk for thrombosis, either venous or arterial, and the thrombosis can range from DVT to myocardial infarction, CVA (brain attack, stroke), and ischemic damage to an extremity necessitating amputation. The risk for development of HIT appears to be increased when heparin is used at higher concentrations (ie, therapeutic versus prophylactic dosage) and with preexisting comorbidity, such as underlying cardiac disease.

Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin Therapy. Low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; eg, Dalteparin, Enoxaparin) is a special form of heparin that has a more selective effect on coagulation. Based on its biochemical properties, LMWH has a longer half-life and a less variable anticoagulant response than does standard heparin. These differences permit LMWH to be safely administered only once or twice daily, without the need for laboratory monitoring for dose adjustments. The incidence of HIT is much lower when LMWH is used. In certain conditions, the use of LMWH has allowed anticoagulation therapy to be moved entirely to the outpatient setting. Many cases of uncomplicated DVT are being managed outside the hospital setting. LMWH is also being increasingly used as "bridge therapy" when patients receiving anticoagulation therapy (warfarin) require an invasive procedure (eg, biopsy, surgery). In this situation, warfarin is stopped and LMWH is used in its place until the procedure is completed. After the procedure, warfarin therapy is resumed. LMWH is discontinued after a therapeutic level of warfarin is achieved.

Warfarin (Coumadin) Therapy. Coumarin anticoagulants (warfarin; eg, Coumadin) are antagonists of vitamin K and therefore interfere with the synthesis of vitamin K -dependent clotting factors. Coumarin anticoagulants bind to albumin, are metabolized in the liver, and have an extremely long half-life. Typically, a patient is initially treated with both heparin (either the unfractionated form or LMWH) and warfarin. When the international normalized ratio (INR) reaches the desired therapeutic range, the heparin is stopped. The dosage required to maintain the thera-
peutic range (typically using an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 ) varies widely among patients and even within the same patient. Frequent monitoring of the INR is extremely important so that the dosage of warfarin can be adjusted as needed. Warfarin is affected by many medications; consultation with a pharmacist is important to assess the extent to which concurrently administered medications, herbs, and nutritional supplements may interact with warfarin. It is also affected by many foods, so patients need dietary instruction and may benefit from consultation with a dietitian when receiving warfarin therapy. See Chart 33-15 for a listing of agents that interact with warfarin.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients with thrombotic disorders should avoid activities that promote circulatory stasis (eg, immobility, crossing the legs). Exercise, especially ambulation, should be performed frequently throughout the day, particularly during long trips by car or plane.

\section*{Chart 33-15 - PHARMACOLOGY Agents That Interact with Warfarin (Coumadin)}

Although warfarin (Coumadin), an anticoagulant medication, is commonly used to treat and prevent thrombosis, many drug-drug and drug-food interactions are associated with its use. A careful medication history (including over-the-counter medications, herbs, and other substances, such as vitamins and minerals) is important when oral anticoagulation therapy is prescribed. Consultation with a pharmacist is recommended to assess the extent to which concurrent medications may affect the anticoagulant and for appropriate dosage adjustments. The following list contains a few examples of agents that interact with warfarin.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Medications that alter platelet aggregation, such as low-strength aspirin, may be prescribed. Some patients require life-long therapy with anticoagulants such as warfarin (eg, Coumadin).

Patients with thrombotic disorders, particularly those with thrombophilia, should be assessed for concurrent risk factors for thrombosis and should avoid concomitant risk factors if possible. For example, use of tobacco and nicotine products exacerbates the problem and should be avoided.

Just as for other conditions, patients with thrombotic disorders, particularly thrombophilia, should know the name of their specific condition and understand its significance. In many instances, younger patients with thrombophilia may not require prophylactic anticoagulation; however, with concomitant risk factors (eg, pregnancy), increasing age, or subsequent thrombotic events, prophylactic or lifelong anticoagulation therapy may be required. Being able to provide the health care provider with an accurate health history can be extremely useful and can help guide the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions. Patients with hereditary disorders should be encouraged to have their siblings and children tested for the disorder.

When patients with thrombotic disorders are hospitalized, frequent assessments should be performed for signs and symptoms of beginning thrombus formation, particularly in the legs (DVT) and lungs (pulmonary embolism). Ambulation or range-of-motion exercises as well as the use of elastic compression stockings should be initiated promptly to decrease stasis. Prophylactic anticoagulants are commonly prescribed.

\section*{Therapies for Blood Disorders}

\section*{SPLENECTOMY}

The surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) is sometimes necessary after trauma to the abdomen. Because the spleen is very vascular, severe hemorrhage can result if the spleen is ruptured. Under such circumstances, splenectomy becomes an emergency procedure.

Splenectomy is also a possible treatment for other hematologic disorders. For example, an enlarged spleen may be the site of excessive destruction of blood cells. If the destruction is lifethreatening, surgery may be lifesaving. This is the case in autoimmune hemolytic anemia or ITP when these disorders do not respond to more conservative measures, such as corticosteroid therapy. Some patients with severe anemia due to inherited RBC defects (eg, thalassemia) may also benefit from splenectomy.

In general, the mortality rate after splenectomy is low. Laparoscopic splenectomy can be used in selected patients, with a resultant decrease in the postoperative morbidity rate. Complications that may result from surgery are atelectasis, pneumonia, abdominal distention, and abscess formation. Although young children are at the highest risk after splenectomy, all age groups are vulnerable to overwhelming lethal infections and should receive pneumovax before undergoing this surgical procedure if possible.

Patients are instructed to seek prompt medical attention if even relatively minor symptoms of infection occur. Often, patients with high platelet counts have even higher counts after splenectomymore than 1 million $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$-which can predispose them to serious thrombotic or hemorrhagic problems. This increase is, however, transient.

\section*{THERAPEUTIC APHERESIS}

Apheresis is a Greek word meaning separation. In therapeutic apheresis (or pheresis), blood is taken from the patient and passed through a centrifuge, where a specific component is separated from the blood and removed (Table 33-9). The remaining blood is then returned to the patient. The entire system is closed, so the risk of bacterial contamination is extremely low. When platelets or WBCs are removed, the decrease in these cells within the circulation is temporary. However, the temporary decrease provides a window of time until suppressive medications (eg, chemotherapy) can have therapeutic effects. Sometimes plasma is removed rather than blood cells-typically so that specific, abnormal proteins within the plasma will be transiently lowered until a long-term therapy can be initiated.

Apheresis is also used to obtain larger amounts of platelets from a donor than can be provided from a single unit of whole blood. A unit of platelets obtained in this way is equivalent to six to eight units of platelets obtained from six to eight separate donors via standard blood donation methods. Platelet donors can have their platelets apheresed as often as every 14 days. WBCs can be obtained similarly, typically after the donor has received growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF) to stimulate the formation of additional WBCs and thereby increase the WBC count. The use of these growth factors also stimulates the release of stem cells within the circulation. Apheresis is used to harvest these stem cells (typically over a period of several days) for use in PBSCT (peripheral blood stem cell transplant; see Chap. 16).

\section*{THERAPEUTIC PHLEBOTOMY}

Therapeutic phlebotomy is the removal of a certain amount of blood under controlled conditions. Patients with elevated hematocrits (eg, those with polycythemia vera) or excessive iron absorption (eg, hemochromatosis) can usually be managed by periodically removing 1 unit (about 500 mL ) of whole blood. Eventually this process can produce iron deficiency, leaving the patient
unable to produce as many RBCs. The actual procedure for therapeutic phlebotomy is similar to that for blood donation (see later discussion).

\section*{BLOOD AND BLOOD COMPONENT THERAPY}

A single unit of whole blood contains 450 mL of blood and 50 mL of an anticoagulant. A unit of whole blood can be processed and dispensed for administration. However, it is more appropriate, economical, and practical to separate that unit of whole blood into its primary components: RBCs, platelets, and plasma (WBCs are rarely used; see later discussion). Because the plasma is removed, a unit of RBCs (packed RBCs, PRBCs) is very concentrated (hematocrit, approximately $70 \%$ ). Each component must be processed and stored differently to maximize the longevity of the viable cells and factors within it; each individual blood component has a different storage life. PRBCs are stored at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. With special preservatives, they can be stored safely for up to 42 days before they must be discarded. In contrast, platelets must be stored at room temperature because they cannot withstand cold temperatures, and they last for only 5 days before they must be discarded. To prevent clumping, platelets are gently agitated while stored. Plasma is immediately frozen to maintain the activity of the clotting factors within; it lasts for 1 year if it remains frozen. Plasma can be further pooled and processed into blood derivatives, such as albumin, immune globulin, factor VIII, and factor IX. Table 33-10 describes each blood component and how it is commonly used.

\section*{SPECIAL PREPARATIONS}

Factor VIII concentrate (antihemophilic factor) is a lyophilized, freeze-dried concentrate of pooled fractionated human plasma. It is used in treating hemophilia A. Factor IX concentrate (prothrombin complex) is similarly prepared and contains factors II,

When it is used to treat a disease that causes an increase in a specific cell type with a short life in circulation (ie, WBCs, platelets), the reduction in those cells is temporary. However, this temporary reduction permits a margin of safety while waiting for a longer-lasting treatment modality (eg, chemotherapy) to take effect.

*The composition of each type of blood component is described as well as the most common indications for using a given blood component. RBCs, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma are the blood products most commonly used. When transfusing these blood products, it is important to realize that the individual product is always "contaminated" with very small amounts of other blood products (eg, WBCs mixed in a unit of platelets). This contamination can cause some difficulties, particularly isosensitization, in certain patients.

VII, IX, and X. It is used primarily for treatment of factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B). Factor IX concentrate is also useful in treating congenital factor VII and factor X deficiencies.

Plasma albumin is a large protein molecule that usually stays within vessels and is a major contributor to plasma oncotic pressure. This protein is used to expand the blood volume of patients in hypovolemic shock and, rarely, to increase the concentration of circulating albumin in patients with hypoalbuminemia.

Immune globulin is a concentrated solution of the antibody IgG; it contains very little IgA or IgM. It is prepared from large pools of plasma. The intravenous form (IVIG) is used in various clinical situations to replace inadequate amounts of IgG in patients who are at risk for recurrent bacterial infection (eg, those with CLL, those receiving BMT or PBSCT). IVIG, in contrast to all other fractions of human blood, cells, or plasma, are able to survive being subjected to heating at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(140^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ for 10 hours to free them of viral contaminants.

\section*{Procuring Blood and Blood Products}

\section*{BLOOD DONATION}

To protect both the donor and the recipients, all prospective donors are examined and interviewed before they are allowed to donate their blood. The intent of the interview is to assess the general health status of the donor and to identify risk factors that might harm a recipient of the donor's blood. Donors should be in good health and without any of the following:
- A history of viral hepatitis at any time in the past, or a history of close contact with a hepatitis or dialysis patient within 6 months
- A history of receiving a blood transfusion or an infusion of any blood derivative (other than serum albumin) within 6 months
- A history of untreated syphilis or malaria, because these diseases can be transmitted by transfusion even years later. A
person who has been free of symptoms and off therapy for 3 years after malaria may be a donor.
- A history or evidence of drug abuse in which substances were self-injected, because many intravenous/injection drug users are hepatitis carriers and because the risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is high in this group
- A history of possible exposure to HIV; the population at risk includes people who engage in anal sex, people with multiple sexual partners, intravenous/injection drug users, sexual partners of people at risk for HIV, and people with hemophilia
- A skin infection, because of the possibility of contaminating the phlebotomy needle, and subsequently the blood itself
- A history of recent asthma, urticaria, or allergy to medications, because hypersensitivity can be transferred passively to the recipient
- Pregnancy within 6 months, because of the nutritional demands of pregnancy on the mother
- A history of tooth extraction or oral surgery within 72 hours, because such procedures are frequently associated with transient bacteremia
- A history of exposure to infectious disease within the past 3 weeks, because of the risk of transmission to the recipient
- Recent immunizations, because of the risk of transmitting live organisms (2-week waiting period for live, attenuated organisms; 1 month for rubella; 1 year for rabies)
- A history of recent tattoo, because of the risk of blood-borne infections (eg, hepatitis, HIV)
- Cancer, because of the uncertainty about transmission of the disease
- A history of whole blood donation within the past 56 days

Potential donors should be asked whether they have consumed any aspirin or aspirin-containing medications within the past 3 days. Although aspirin use does not render the donor ineligible, the platelets obtained would be dysfunctional and therefore not useful. Aspirin does not affect the RBCs or plasma obtained from the donor.

All donors are expected to meet the following minimal requirements:
- Body weight should exceed 50 kg ( 110 pounds) for a standard $450-\mathrm{mL}$ donation. Donors weighing less than 50 kg donate proportionately less blood. People younger than 17 years of age are disqualified from donation.
- The oral temperature should not exceed $37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(99.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
- The pulse rate should be regular and between 50 and 100 beats per minute.
- The systolic arterial pressure should be 90 to 180 mm Hg , and the diastolic pressure should be 50 to 100 mm Hg .
- The hemoglobin level should be at least $12.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ for women and $13.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ for men.

\section*{Directed Donation}

At times, friends and family of a patient wish to donate blood for that person. These blood donations are termed directed donations. These donations are not any safer than those provided by random donors, because directed donors may not be as willing to identify themselves as having a history of any of the risk factors that disqualify a person from donating blood.

\section*{Standard Donation}

Phlebotomy consists of venipuncture and blood withdrawal. Standard precautions are used. Donors are placed in a semirecumbent position. The skin over the antecubital fossa is carefully cleansed with an antiseptic preparation, a tourniquet is applied, and venipuncture is performed. Withdrawal of 450 mL of blood usually takes less than 15 minutes. After the needle is removed, donors are asked to hold the involved arm straight up, and firm pressure is applied with sterile gauze for 2 or 3 minutes or until bleeding stops. A firm bandage is then applied. Donors remain recumbent until they feel able to sit up, usually within a few minutes. Donors who experience weakness or faintness should rest for a longer period. Donors then receive food and fluids and are asked to remain another 15 minutes.

Donors are instructed to leave the dressing on and to avoid heavy lifting for several hours, to avoid smoking for 1 hour, to avoid drinking alcoholic beverages for 3 hours, to increase fluid intake for 2 days, and to eat a healthy meals for 2 weeks. Specimens from this donated blood are tested to detect infections and to identify the specific blood type (see later discussion).

\section*{Autologous Donation}

A patient's own blood may be collected for future transfusion; this method is useful for many elective surgeries where the potential need for transfusion is high (eg, orthopedic surgery). Preoperative donations are ideally collected 4 to 6 weeks before surgery. Iron supplements are prescribed during this period to prevent depletion of iron stores. Occasionally, erythropoietin (epoetin-alfa [Epogen, Procrit]) is given to stimulate erythropoiesis to ensure that the donor's hematocrit remains high enough to be eligible for donation. Typically, 1 unit of blood is drawn each week; the number of units obtained varies with the type of surgical procedure to be performed (ie, the amount of blood anticipated to be transfused). Phlebotomies are not performed within 72 hours of surgery. Individual blood components can also be collected.

The primary advantage of autologous transfusions is the prevention of viral infections from another person's blood. Other advantages include safe transfusion for patients with a history of transfusion reactions, prevention of alloimmunization, and avoidance of complications in patients with alloantibodies. The policy of the American Red Cross requires autologous blood to be transfused only to the donor. If the blood is not required, it can be frozen until the donor needs it in the future (for up to 10 years). The blood is never returned to the general donor supply of blood products to be used by someone else.

The disadvantage of autologous donation is that it may be performed even when the likelihood that the anticipated procedure will necessitate a transfusion is small. Needless autologous donation is expensive, takes time, and uses resources inappropriately. Moreover, in an emergency situation, the autologous units available may be inadequate, and the patient may still require additional units from the general donor supply.

Contraindications to donation of blood for autologous transfusion are acute infection, severely debilitating chronic disease, hemoglobin level less than $11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, hematocrit less than $33 \%$, unstable angina, and acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. A history of poorly controlled epilepsy may be considered a contraindication in some centers. Patients with cancer may donate for themselves.

\section*{Intraoperative Blood Salvage}

This transfusion method provides replacement for patients who are unable to donate before surgery and for those undergoing vascular, orthopedic, or thoracic surgery. During a surgical procedure, blood lost into a sterile cavity (eg, hip joint) is suctioned into a cell-saver machine. The RBCs are washed, often with saline solution, and then returned to the patient as an intravenous infusion. Salvaged blood cannot be stored, because bacteria cannot be completely removed from the blood.

\section*{Hemodilution}

This transfusion method is initiated before or after induction of anesthesia. About 1 or 2 units of blood are removed from the patient through a venous or arterial line and simultaneously replaced with a colloid or crystalloid solution. The blood obtained is then reinfused after surgery (Kreimeier \& Messmer, 2002). The advantage of this method is that the patient loses fewer RBCs during surgery, because the added intravenous solutions dilute the concentration of RBCs and lower the hematocrit. Patients who are at risk for myocardial injury, however, should not be further stressed by hemodilution.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF BLOOD DONATION}

Excessive bleeding at the donor's venipuncture site is sometimes caused by a bleeding disorder in the donor but more often results from a technique error: laceration of the vein, excessive tourniquet pressure, or failure to apply enough pressure after the needle is withdrawn.

Fainting is common after blood donation and may be related to emotional factors, a vasovagal reaction, or prolonged fasting before donation. Because of the loss of blood volume, hypotension and syncope may occur when the donor assumes an erect position. A donor who appears pale or complains of faintness should immediately lie down or sit with head lowered below the knees; he or she should be observed for another 30 minutes.

Anginal chest pain may be precipitated in patients with unsuspected coronary artery disease. Seizures can occur in donors with epilepsy, although the incidence is very low. Both angina and seizures require further medical evaluation.

Many people have the misconception that donating blood can cause AIDS and other infections. Potential donors need to be educated that the equipment used in donation is sterile, a closed system, and not reusable; they are at no risk for acquiring such infections from donating blood.

\section*{BLOOD PROCESSING}

Samples of the unit of blood are always taken immediately after donation so that the blood can be typed and tested. Each donation is tested for antibodies to HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus, type I (anti-HTLV-I/II). The blood is also tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAG) and for syphilis. Negative reactions are required for the blood to be used, and each unit of blood is labeled to certify the results. A new testing method, using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), has increased the ability to detect the presence of HCV and HIV infection, because it directly tests for genomic nucleic acids of the virus itself, rather than for the presence of antibod-
ies to the virus (Korman, Leparc \& Benson, 2001). This testing significantly shortens the "window" of inability to detect HIV and HCV from a donated unit, further ensuring the safety of the blood. Blood is also screened for CMV; if it tests positive for CMV, it can still be used, except in recipients who are negative for CMV and who are immunocompromised (eg, BMT or PBSCTrecipients).

Equally important to viral testing is accurate determination of the blood type. More than 200 antigens have been identified on the surface of RBC membranes. Of these, the most important for safe transfusion are the ABO and Rh systems. The ABO system identifies which sugars are present on the membrane of an individual's RBCs: $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, both A and B , or neither A nor B (type O ). To prevent a significant reaction, the same type of RBCs should be transfused. Previously, it was thought that in an emergency situation in which the patient's blood type was not known, type O blood could be safely transfused. This practice is no longer advised by the American Red Cross.

The Rh antigen (also called D) is present on the surface of RBCs in $85 \%$ of the population (Rh-positive). Those who lack the D antigen are called Rh-negative. RBCs are routinely tested for the $D$ antigen as well as $A B O$. Patients should receive PRBCs with a compatible Rh type.

\section*{TRANSFUSION}

Administration of blood and blood components requires knowledge of correct administration techniques and possible complications. It is very important to be familiar with the agency's policies and procedures for transfusion therapy. Methods for transfusing blood components are presented in Charts 33-16 and 33-17. Potential complications of transfusion follow.

\section*{Setting}

Although most blood transfusions are performed in the acute care setting, patients with chronic transfusion requirements often can receive transfusions in other settings. Free-standing infusion centers, ambulatory care clinics, a physician's office, and even the home may be appropriate settings for transfusion. Typically, patients who need chronic transfusions but are otherwise stable physically are appropriate candidates for outpatient therapy. Verification and administration of the blood product are performed much as in a hospital setting. Although most blood products can be transfused in the outpatient setting, the home is typically limited to transfusions of PRBCs and factor components (eg, factor VIII for patients with hemophilia).

\section*{Pretransfusion Assessment}

\section*{PATIENT HISTORY}

Patient history is an important component of the pretransfusion assessment to determine the history of previous transfusions as well as previous reactions to transfusion. The history should include the type of reaction, its manifestations, the interventions required, and whether any preventive interventions were used in subsequent transfusions. It is important to assess the number of pregnancies a woman has had, because an increased number can increase her risk for reaction due to antibodies developed from exposure to fetal circulation. Other concurrent health problems should also be noted, with careful attention to cardiac, pulmonary, and vascular disease.

Preprocedure
1. Confirm that the transfusion has been prescribed.
2. Check that patient's blood has been typed and cross-matched.
3. Verify that patient has signed a written consent form per institution policy.
4. Explain the procedure to the patient. Instruct patient in signs and symptoms of transfusion reaction (itching, hives, swelling, shortness of breath, fever, chills).
5. Take patient's temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure to establish a baseline for comparing vital signs during transfusion.
6. Use hand hysgeine and wear gloves in accordance with Standard Precautions.
7. Use a 20-gauge or larger needle for placement in a large vein. Use special tubing that contains a blood filter to screen out fibrin clots and other particulate matter. Do not vent the blood container.

\section*{Procedure}
1. Obtain the PRBCs from the blood bank after the intravenous line is started. (Institution policy may limit release to only 1 unit at a time.)
2. Double-check the labels with another nurse or physician to make sure that the ABO group and Rh type agree with the compatibility record. Check to see that the number and type on the donor blood label and on the patient's chart are correct. Check the patient's identification by asking the patient's name and checking the identification wristband.
3. Check the blood for gas bubbles and any unusual color or cloudiness. (Gas bubbles may indicate bacterial growth. Abnormal color or cloudiness may be a sign of hemolysis.)
4. Make sure PRBC transfusion is initiated within 30 min after removal of the PRBCs from the blood bank refrigerator.
5. For first 15 minutes, run the transfusion slowly-no faster than $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Observe the patient carefully for adverse effects. If no adverse effects occur during the first 15 min , increase the flow rate unless the patient is at high risk for circulatory overload.
6. Monitor closely for 15-30 min to detect signs of reaction. Monitor vital signs at regular intervals per institution policy; compare results with baseline measurements. Increase frequency of measurements based on patient's condition. Observe the patient frequently throughout the transfusion for any signs of adverse reaction, including restlessness, hives, nausea, vomiting, torso or back pain, shortness of breath, flushing, hematuria, fever, or chills. Should any adverse reaction occur, stop infusion immediately, notify physician, and follow the agency's transfusion reaction standard.
7. Note that administration time does not exceed 4 hr because of the increased risk for bacterial proliferation.
8. Be alert for signs of adverse reactions: circulatory overload, sepsis, febrile reaction, allergic reaction, and acute hemolytic reaction.
9. Change blood tubing after every 2 units transfused, to decrease chance of bacterial contamination.

\section*{Postprocedure}
1. Obtain vital signs and compare with baseline measurements.
2. Dispose of used materials properly.
3. Document procedure in patient's medical record, including patient assessment findings and tolerance to procedure.
4. Monitor patient for response to and effectiveness of the procedure.

Note: Never add medications to blood or blood products; if blood is too thick to run freely, normal saline may be added to the unit. If blood must be warmed, use an in-line blood warmer with a monitoring system.

\section*{Transfusion of Platelets or Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)}

\section*{Preprocedure}
1. Confirm that the transfusion has been prescribed.
2. Verify that patient has signed a written consent form per institution policy.
3. Explain the procedure to the patient. Instruct patient in signs and symptoms of transfusion reaction (itching, hives, swelling, shortness of breath, fever, chills).
4. Take patient's temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure to establish a baseline for comparing vital signs during transfusion.
5. Wash hands and wear gloves in accordance with Standard Precautions.
6. Use a 22-gauge or larger needle for placement in a large vein, if possible. Use appropriate tubing per institution policy (platelets often require different tubing from that used for other blood products).

\section*{Procedure}
1. Obtain the platelets or FFP from the blood bank (only after the intravenous line is started.)
2. Double-check the labels with another nurse or physician to make sure that the ABO group matches the compatibility record (not usually necessary for platelets; here only if compatible platelets are ordered). Check to see that the number and type on the donor blood label and on the patient's chart are correct. Check the patient's identification by asking the patient's name and checking the identification wristband.
3. Check the blood product for any unusual color or clumps (excessive redness indicates contamination with larger amounts of red blood cells).
4. Make sure platelets or FFP units are administered immediately after they are obtained.
5. Infuse each unit as fast as patient can tolerate to diminish platelet clumping during administration. Observe the patient carefully for adverse effects, including circulatory overload. Decrease rate of infusion if necessary.
6. Observe the patient closely throughout the transfusion for any signs of adverse reaction, including restlessness, hives, nausea, vomiting, torso or back pain, shortness of breath, flushing, hematuria, fever, or chills. Should any adverse reaction occur, stop infusion immediately, notify physician, and follow the agency's transfusion reaction standard.
7. Monitor vital signs at end of transfusion per institution policy; compare results with baseline measurements.
8. Flush line with saline after transfusion to remove blood component from tubing.

\section*{Postprocedure}
1. Obtain vital signs and compare with baseline measurements.
2. Dispose of used materials properly.
3. Document procedure in patient's medical record, including patient assessment findings and tolerance to procedure.
4. Monitor patient for response to and effectiveness of procedure. A platelet count may be ordered 1 hr after platelet transfusion to facilitate this evaluation.

\footnotetext{
Note: FFP requires ABO but not Rh compatibility. Platelets are not typically cross-matched for ABO compatibility. Never
add medications to blood or blood products.
}

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

A systematic physical assessment and measurement of baseline vital signs are important before transfusing any blood product. The respiratory system should be assessed, including careful auscultation of the lungs and for use of accessory muscles. Cardiac system assessment should include careful inspection for any edema as well as other signs of cardiac failure (eg, jugular venous distention). The skin should be observed for rashes, petechiae, and ecchymoses. The sclera should be examined for icterus. In the event of a possible transfusion reaction, a comparison of findings can help differentiate between types of reactions.

\section*{Patient Teaching}

Reviewing the signs and symptoms of a potential transfusion reaction is crucial for patients who have not received a transfusion before. Even for those patients who have received prior transfusions, a brief review of signs and symptoms of potential transfusion reactions is advised. Signs and symptoms of a possible reaction include fever, chills, respiratory distress, low back pain, nausea, pain at the intravenous site, or anything "unusual." Although a thorough review is very important, it is also important to reassure the patient that the blood is carefully tested against the patient's own blood (cross-matched) to diminish the likelihood of any untoward reaction. Such assurance can be extremely beneficial in allaying anxiety. Similarly, it can be useful to mention again the very low possibility of contracting HIV from the transfusion; this fear persists among many people.

\section*{Transfusion Complications}

Any patient who receives a blood transfusion may develop complications from that transfusion. When explaining the reasons for the transfusion, it is important to include the risks and benefits and what to expect during and after the transfusion. Patients must be informed that the supply of blood is not completely risk-free although it has been tested carefully. Nursing management is directed toward preventing complications, promptly recognizing complications if they develop, and promptly initiating measures to control any complications that occur. The following sections describe the most common or potentially severe transfusion-related complications.

\section*{FEBRILE, NONHEMOLYTIC REACTION}

The nonhemolytic reaction, caused by antibodies to donor WBCs that are still present in the unit of blood or blood component, is the most common type of transfusion reaction, accounting for more than $90 \%$ of reactions. It occurs more frequently in patients who have had previous transfusions (exposure to multiple antigens from previous blood products) and in Rh-negative women who have borne Rh-positive children (exposure to an Rhpositive fetus raises antibody levels in the mother). These reactions occur in $1 \%$ of PRBC transfusions and $20 \%$ of platelet transfusions. More than $10 \%$ of patients with a chronic transfusion requirement develop this type of reaction.

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 33-1}

\section*{Perspectives of Recipients of Blood Transfusions}

Fitzgerald, M., Hodgkinson, B., \& Thorp, D. (1999). Blood transfusion from the recipient's perspective. Journal of Clinical Nursing 8(5), 593-600.

\section*{Purpose}

The process of informed consent requires that information be provided to the patient before consent and implies that a dialogue between the patient and physicians and nurses occurs during this process. This study stemmed from previous studies examining transfusion practices in a large teaching hospital in Australia; the studies revealed that little is known about how much patients understood about the transfusion process. The purpose of this study was to more closely examine the meaning of patients' experiences with blood transfusions.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The study design employed interpretive phenomenology, a qualitative analysis process that allowed researchers to identify meanings that may have been hidden in common actions. A convenience sample of 19 patients was interviewed; subjects were asked to discuss their experience of receiving a blood transfusion, beginning with the time they were told about it. Subjects received transfusions for a variety of clinical conditions, primarily surgery, cancer, and emergency situations. The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were analyzed and themes were identified.

\section*{Findings}

Three broad themes were identified and more closely analyzed: information regarding the transfusion, reaction to receiving a transfusion, and care received during the transfusion. The focus of many of the interviews was on the information process. Physicians' explanations regarding the purpose of the transfusion were typically brief and were focused on providing factual information, particularly before the
patient's signing of the consent for the procedure. Nurses' explanations continued as the procedure progressed but tended to focus only on potential reactions. Neither physicians nor nurses tended to encourage the patient to express his or her concerns, nor sought information from the patient. Few patients could actually recall any of the factual information presented to them. Fear of infection, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, was present but was not excessive. Subjects verbalized understanding that the risk of acquiring HIV from their transfusion was very remote. Most subjects were told that the transfusion would make them feel better; in reality (and likely due to the severity of their illness/injury) such was not the case. Beyond the initial procedure by the nurse of double-checking the blood product for transfusion against the patient's identity and hanging the blood, patients did not notice any difference in the nursing care they received during the transfusion.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Findings from this study have important implications for nurses, particularly concerning the information process. Despite the focus of both physicians and nurses on providing information, patients demonstrated that they did not comprehend it well. Informational needs vary, as do learning styles. It is crucial that nurses assess their patients' level of understanding about the entire transfusion process. Not having the opportunity to deliberate on the information provided and to express concern was a common theme from the study subjects. Nurses need to make the time for patients to express their concerns and verbalize their feelings. This need exists not only for those receiving their first transfusion but also for those who have long-term transfusion requirements.

The diagnosis of a febrile, nonhemolytic reaction is made by excluding other potential causes, such as a hemolytic reaction or bacterial contamination of the blood product. The signs and symptoms of a febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reaction are chills (absent to severe) followed by fever (more than $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ elevation). The fever typically begins within 2 hours after the transfusion is begun. Although not life-threatening, the fever and particularly the chills and muscle stiffness can be frightening to the patient.

These reactions can be diminished, even prevented, by further depleting the blood component of donor WBCs; this is accomplished by a leukocyte reduction filter. The blood product may be filtered during processing, which achieves better results but is more expensive, or during the actual transfusion by adding the filter to the blood administration tubing. Antipyretics can be given to prevent fever, but routine premedication is not advised because it can mask the beginning of a more serious transfusion reaction.

\section*{ACUTE HEMOLYTIC REACTION}

The most dangerous, and potentially life threatening, type of transfusion reaction occurs when the donor blood is incompatible with that of the recipient. Antibodies already present in the recipient's plasma rapidly combine with antigens on donor RBCs, and the RBCs are hemolyzed (destroyed) in the circulation (intravascular hemolysis). The most rapid hemolysis occurs in ABO incompatibility. This reaction can occur after transfusion of as little as 10 mL of RBCs. Rh incompatibility often causes a less severe reaction. The most common causes of acute hemolytic reaction are errors in blood component labeling and patient identification that result in the administration of an ABO-incompatible transfusion.

Symptoms consist of fever, chills, low back pain, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, and anxiety. As the RBCs are destroyed, the hemoglobin is released from the cells and excreted by the kidneys; therefore, hemoglobin is present in the urine (hemoglobinuria). Hypotension, bronchospasm, and vascular collapse may result. Diminished renal perfusion results in acute renal failure, and DIC may also occur.

The reaction must be recognized promptly and the transfusion discontinued immediately. Blood and urine specimens must be obtained and analyzed for evidence of hemolysis. Treatment goals include maintaining blood volume and renal perfusion and preventing and managing DIC.

Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are preventable. Meticulous attention to detail in labeling blood samples and blood components and identifying the recipient cannot be overemphasized.

\section*{ALLERGIC REACTION}

Some patients may develop urticaria (hives) or generalized itching during a transfusion. The cause of these reactions is thought to be a sensitivity reaction to a plasma protein within the blood component being transfused. Symptoms of an allergic reaction are urticaria, itching, and flushing. The reactions are usually mild and respond to antihistamines. If the symptoms resolve after administration of an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine [eg, Benadryl]), the transfusion may be resumed. Rarely, the allergic reaction is severe, with bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and shock. These reactions are managed with epinephrine, corticosteroids, and pressor support, if necessary.

Giving the patient antihistamines before the transfusion may prevent future reactions. For severe reactions, future blood components are washed to remove any remaining plasma proteins. Leukocyte filters are not useful, because the offending plasma proteins can pass through the filter.

\section*{CIRCULATORY OVERLOAD}

If too much blood infuses too quickly, hypervolemia can occur. This condition can be aggravated in patients who already have increased circulatory volume (eg, those with heart failure). PRBCs are safer to use than whole blood. If the administration rate is sufficiently slow, circulatory overload may be prevented. For patients who are at risk for, or already in, circulatory overload, diuretics are administered after the transfusion or between units of PRBCs. Patients receiving fresh frozen plasma or even platelets may also develop circulatory overload. The infusion rate of these blood components must also be titrated to the patient's tolerance.

Signs of circulatory overload include dyspnea, orthopnea, tachycardia, and sudden anxiety. Neck vein distention, crackles at the base of the lungs, and a rise in blood pressure can also occur. If the transfusion is continued, pulmonary edema can develop, as manifested by severe dyspnea and coughing of pink, frothy sputum.

If fluid overload is mild, the transfusion can often be continued after slowing the rate of infusion and administering diuretics. However, if the overload is severe, the patient is placed in an upright position with the feet in a dependent position, the transfusion is discontinued, and the physician is notified. The intravenous line is kept patent with a very slow infusion of normal saline solution or a saline or heparin lock device to maintain access to the vein in case intravenous medications are necessary. Oxygen and morphine may be needed for severe dyspnea.

\section*{BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION}

The incidence of bacterial contamination of blood components is very low; however, administration of contaminated products puts the patient at great risk. Contamination can occur at any point during procurement or processing. Many bacteria cannot survive in the cold temperatures used to store PRBCs (platelets are at greater risk for contamination because they are stored at room temperature), but some organisms can survive cold temperatures.

Preventive measures include meticulous care in the procurement and processing of blood components. When PRBCs or whole blood is transfused, it should be administered within a 4-hour period, because warm room temperatures promote bacterial growth. A contaminated unit of blood product may appear normal, or it may have an abnormal color.

The signs of bacterial contamination are fever, chills, and hypotension. These signs may not occur until the transfusion is complete, occasionally not until several hours after the transfusion. If the condition is not treated immediately with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, shock can occur. Even with aggressive management, including vasopressor support, the mortality rate is high.

As soon as the reaction is recognized, any remaining transfusion is discontinued and the intravenous line is kept open with normal saline solution. The physician and the blood bank are notified, and the blood container is returned to the blood bank for testing and culture. Septicemia is treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics; corticosteroids and vasopressors also may be necessary.

\section*{TRANSFUSION-RELATED ACUTE LUNG INJURY}

This is a potentially fatal, idiosyncratic reaction that occurs in fewer than 1 in 5000 transfusions. Plasma antibodies (usually in the donor's plasma) that are present in the blood component stimulate the recipient's WBCs; aggregates of these WBCs form and occlude the microvasculature within the lungs. This lung injury is manifested as pulmonary edema; it can occur within 4 hours after the transfusion.

Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, acute respiratory distress (in the absence of other signs of left ventricular failure, such as elevated central venous pressure), and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Aggressive supportive therapy (oxygen, intubation, diuretics) may prevent death.

\section*{DELAYED HEMOLYTIC REACTION}

Delayed hemolytic reactions usually occur within 14 days after transfusion, when the level of antibody has been increased to the extent that a reaction can occur. The hemolysis of the RBCs is extravascular, via the RES, and occurs gradually.

Signs and symptoms of a delayed hemolytic reaction are fever, anemia, increased bilirubin level, decreased or absent haptoglobin, and possibly jaundice. Rarely is there hemoglobinuria. Generally, these reactions are not dangerous, but it is useful to recognize them, because subsequent transfusions with blood products containing these antibodies may cause a more severe hemolytic reaction. However, recognition is also difficult, because the patient may not be in a health care setting to be tested for this reaction, and even if the patient is hospitalized, the reaction may be too mild to be recognized clinically. Because the amount of antibody present can be too low to detect, it is difficult to prevent delayed hemolytic reactions. The reaction is usually mild and requires no intervention.

\section*{DISEASES TRANSMITTED BY BLOOD TRANSFUSION}

Despite the advances in donor screening and blood testing, certain diseases can still be transmitted by transfusion of blood components. The diseases in Chart 33-18 are examples of this phenomenon.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF LONG-TERM TRANSFUSION THERAPY}

The complications that have been described represent a real risk for any patient any time a unit of blood is administered. However, patients with long-term transfusion therapy (eg, those with MDS, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia) are at greater risk for infection transmission and for becoming more sensitized to donor antigens, simply because they are exposed to more units of blood and, consequently, more donors. Iron overload is a complication unique to those individuals with long-term PRBC transfusions. A summary of complications associated with long-term transfusion therapy is depicted in Table 33-11.

Iron Overload. One unit of PRBCs contains 250 mg of iron. Patients with chronic transfusion requirements can quickly acquire more iron than they can use, leading to iron overload. Over time, the excess iron deposits in the tissues and can cause

organ damage, particularly in the liver, heart, testes, and pancreas. Promptly initiating a program of iron chelation therapy (eg, with deferoxamine [Desferal]) can prevent end-organ damage from iron toxicity (Giardina \& Grady, 1995).

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT FOR TRANSFUSION REACTIONS}

If a transfusion reaction is suspected, the transfusion must be immediately stopped and the physician notified. A thorough patient assessment is crucial, because many complications have similar signs and symptoms. The following steps are taken to determine the type and severity of the reaction:
- Stop the transfusion. Maintain the intravenous line with normal saline solution through new intravenous tubing, administered at a slow rate.
- Assess the patient carefully. Compare the vital signs with those from the baseline assessment. Assess the patient's respiratory status carefully. Note the presence of adventitious breath sounds, use of accessory muscles, extent of dyspnea

In many cases, the use of WBC-filtered (eg, leukocyte-poor) blood products is standard for patients who receive long-term PRBC transfusion therapy. An aggressive chelation program initiated early in the course of therapy can prevent problems with iron overload.

(if any), and changes in mental status, including anxiety and confusion. Note any chills, diaphoresis, complaints of back pain, urticaria, and jugular vein distention.
- Notify the physician of the assessment findings, and implement any orders obtained. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status.
- Notify the blood bank that a suspected transfusion reaction has occurred.
- Send the blood container and tubing to the blood bank for repeat typing and culture. The identifying tags and numbers are verified.

If a hemolytic transfusion reaction or bacterial infection is suspected, the nurse should do the following:
- Obtain appropriate blood specimens from the patient.
- Collect a urine sample as soon as possible for a hemoglobin determination.
- Document the reaction, according to the institution's policy.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC ALTERNATIVES TO BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS}

Pharmacologic agents to stimulate production of one or more types of blood cells by the marrow are commonly used. Chart 33-19 presents examples of such pharmacologic agents.

Researchers continue to seek a blood substitute that is practical and safe. Blood substitutes previously tried have not been successful. However, newer blood substitutes focus solely on oxygen delivery, as an RBC substitute (Rabinovici, 2001). Current blood substitutes in clinical trials have distinct advantages and disadvantages compared with human RBCs. They are manufactured hemoglobin solutions that can be sterilized without destroying the blood substitute. They require no refrigeration and appear to have a long shelf-life (possibly 1 year, versus little more than 1 month for PRBCs). Perhaps more importantly, they require no cross-matching, because there is no RBC membrane to interact with antibodies in the recipient's serum. The most significant disadvantage stems from the blood substitutes extremely short life within human circulation-approximately 1 day, instead of the 30 -day life span of a conventionally trans-
fused RBC. Therefore, the use of these products would likely be limited to situations in which the need is short-term (eg, surgery, trauma). Finally, the blood substitutes are likely to be extremely expensive.

\section*{PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT) AND BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION (BMT)}

PBSCT and BMT are therapeutic modalities that offer the possibility of cure for some patients with hematologic disorders such as severe aplastic anemia, some forms of leukemia, and thalassemia. Because most hematologic disease states arise from some form of bone marrow dysfunction, an autologous transplantation (receiving one's own stem cells) is not as common an option as is allogeneic transplantation. A patient receives intensive chemotherapy (sometimes with radiation therapy as well), with the goal being complete ablation of the patient's bone marrow. Stem cells from the donor (ideally, from a matched sibling), or actual marrow from the donor, is then infused into the patient using a process similar to an RBC transfusion. The stem cells travel to the marrow and slowly begin the process of resuming hematopoiesis. The advantage of autotransplantation is the reduced likelihood of complications and mortality; however, the risk of relapse is also higher.

A relatively new strategy is based on transplantation for adoptive cell therapy using certain immune mechanisms derived from the donor's lymphocytes (Slavin et al., 2001; Margolis, Borrello, \& Flinn, 2000). In nonmyeloablative stem cell or marrow transplantation, also referred to as a "minitransplant," the conditioning regimen involves much less myelosuppression than in conventional regimens, rendering the patient immunosuppressed but for a shorter period of time. Consequently, the procedure is less toxic to the patient, and there is a significant decrease in morbidity.

After the deconditioning regimen (ie, during the time the patient is immunosuppressed), the allotransplantation is performed, using either marrow or stem cells. The goal is for the donor's lymphocytes to react against any residual malignant cells within the patient and destroy them. This process is typically augmented by

Pharmacologic Alternatives to Blood Transfusions

\section*{Growth Factors}

Recombinant technology has provided a means to produce hematopoietic growth factors necessary for the production of blood cells within the bone marrow. By increasing the body's production of blood cells, transfusions and complications resulting from diminished blood cells (eg, infection from neutropenia or transfusions) may be avoided. However, the successful use of growth factors requires functional bone marrow.

\section*{Erythropoietin}

Erythropoietin (epoetin alpha [eg, Epogen, Procrit]) is an effective alternative treatment for patients with chronic anemia secondary to diminished levels of erythropoietin, as in chronic renal disease. This medication stimulates erythropoiesis. It also has been used for patients who are anemic from chemotherapy or zidovudine (AZT) therapy and for those who have diseases involving bone marrow suppression, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The use of erythropoietin can also enable a patient to donate several units of blood for future use (eg, preoperative autologous donation). The medication can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously, although plasma levels are better sustained with the subcutaneous route. Side effects are rare, but erythropoietin can cause or exacerbate hypertension. If the anemia is corrected too quickly or is overcorrected, the elevated hematocrit can cause headache and, potentially, seizures. These adverse effects are rare except for patients with renal failure. Serial complete blood counts (CBCs) should be performed to evaluate the response to the medication. The dose and frequency of administration are titrated to the hematocrit.

\section*{Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)}

G-CSF (filgrastim [Neupogen]) is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid stem cells; a rapid increase in neutrophils is seen within the circulation. G-CSF is effective in improving transient but severe neutropenia after chemotherapy or in some forms of MDS. It is particularly useful in preventing bacterial infections that would be likely to occur with neutropenia. G-CSF is administered subcutaneously on a daily basis. The primary side effect is bone pain; this probably reflects the increase in hematopoiesis within the marrow. Serial CBCs should be performed to evaluate the response to the medication and to ensure that the rise in white blood cells is not excessive. The effect of G-CSF on myelopoiesis is short; the neutrophil count drops once the medication is stopped.

\section*{Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)}

GM-CSF (sargramostim [Leukine]) is a cytokine that is naturally produced by a variety of cells, including monocytes and endothelial cells. It works either directly or synergistically with other growth factors to stimulate myelopoiesis. GM-CSF is not as specific to neutrophils as is G-CSF; thus, an increase in erythroid (RBC) and megakaryocytic (platelet) production may also be seen. GM-CSF serves the same purpose as G-CSF. However, it may have a greater effect on macrophage function and therefore may be more useful against fungal infections, whereas G-CSF may be better used to fight bacterial infections. GM-CSF is also administered subcutaneously. Side effects include bone pain, fevers, and myalgias.

\section*{Thrombopoietin}

Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a cytokine that is necessary for the proliferation of megakaryocytes and subsequent platelet formation. Clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy of TPO in the setting of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia with few side effects (Vadhan-Raj, 2000). Further studies are ongoing to assess the efficacy of TPO in other, more chronic conditions associated with thrombocytopenia (Kuter, 2000).
infusion of the donor's lymphocytes as well (referred to as donor lymphocyte infusion, or DLI). If relapse occurs, repeated DLI has been effective in reestablishing remission in many patients. This approach has great promise, particularly in the setting of hematologic malignancy, and may provide a mechanism to increase the utility of transplantation for more patients than is possible with conventional methods.

Success of transplantation depends on tissue compatibility and the patient's tolerance of the immunosuppression that results from the ablative therapy. Patients require intensive nursing care that is directed toward preventing infection and assessing for early signs and symptoms of complications. One common complication involves the formation of lymphocytes that respond to their new host (ie, the patient) as foreign and mount a reaction against the body. This process, known as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), can involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver and can be life-threatening. In hematologic malignancies, some GVHD is actually desirable in that the donor lymphocytes can also mount a reaction against any lingering tumor cells; this process is referred to as graft-versusmalignancy. GVHD is a significant complication in nonmyeloablative transplantation therapy, as well as in conventional allotransplantation. Late complications (occurring more than 100 days after transplantation) are frequent; these patients, particularly those who receive an allogeneic transplant, require careful follow-up for years after transplantation. (See Chap. 16 for further information on GVHD)

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are working in a hematology-oncology clinic. The laboratory reports a critical study result for one of your patients with CLL: the reticulocyte count is $25 \%$. What other laboratory results would be important to review or consider? The patient is profoundly anemic; does this support your original thinking and problem solving? What medical treatment orders would you anticipate? What nursing interventions would be appropriate?
2. You are caring for a young adult patient who has had repeated hospitalizations for sickle cell crisis. What factors should be assessed to determine the patient's education, coping, and pain management needs? What is important for the patient's discharge plan?
3. You are caring for a patient diagnosed with leukemia. The family members are very concerned about the patient's risk for infection at home. What assessments will assist you to determine the patient's risk of developing an infection at home? What instructions should you give about decreasing the risks for infection? How would you alter your interventions if the family members are not fluent in English?
4. You are caring for a patient who is septic and is now receiving a transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs. The patient's temperature spikes to $38.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ after half of the second unit has been transfused. What are the possible causes of the fever? What are the appropriate nursing interventions?

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT}

The GI tract is a 23- to 26-foot-long pathway that extends from the mouth through the esophagus, stomach, and intestines to the anus (Fig. 34-1). The esophagus is located in the mediastinum in the thoracic cavity, anterior to the spine and posterior to the trachea and heart. This collapsible tube, which is about 25 cm (10 inches) in length, becomes distended when food passes through it. It passes through the diaphragm at an opening called the diaphragmatic hiatus.

The remaining portion of the GI tract is located within the peritoneal cavity. The stomach is situated in the upper portion of the abdomen to the left of the midline, just under the left diaphragm. It is a distensible pouch with a capacity of approximately 1500 mL . The inlet to the stomach is called the esophagogastric junction; it is surrounded by a ring of smooth muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (or cardiac sphincter), which, on contraction, closes off the stomach from the esophagus. The stomach can be divided into four anatomic regions: the cardia (entrance), fundus, body, and pylorus (outlet). Circular smooth muscle in the wall of the pylorus forms the pyloric sphincter and controls the opening between the stomach and the small intestine.

The small intestine is the longest segment of the GI tract, accounting for about two thirds of the total length. It folds back and forth on itself, providing approximately 7000 cm of surface area for secretion and absorption, the process by which nutrients enter the bloodstream through the intestinal walls. The small intestine is divided into three anatomic parts: the upper part, called the duodenum; the middle part, called the jejunum; and the lower part, called the ileum. The common bile duct, which allows for the passage of both bile and pancreatic secretions, empties into the duodenum at the ampulla of Vater. The junction between the small and large intestine, the cecum, is located in the right lower portion of the abdomen. The ileocecal valve is located at this junction. It controls the passage of intestinal contents into the large intestine and prevents reflux of bacte-
ria into the small intestine. The vermiform appendix is located near this junction.

The large intestine consists of an ascending segment on the right side of the abdomen, a transverse segment that extends from right to left in the upper abdomen, and a descending segment on the left side of the abdomen. The terminal portion of the large intestine consists of two parts: the sigmoid colon and the rectum. The rectum is continuous with the anus. A network of striated muscle that forms both the internal and the external anal sphincters regulates the anal outlet.

The GI tract receives blood from arteries that originate along the entire length of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Of particular importance are the gastric artery and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Oxygen and nutrients are supplied to the stomach by the gastric artery and to the intestine by the mesenteric arteries (Fig. 34-2). Blood is drained from these organs by veins that merge with others in the abdomen to form a large vessel called the portal vein. Nutrient-rich blood is then carried to the liver. The blood flow to the GI tract is about $20 \%$ of the total cardiac output and increases significantly after eating.

Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic portions of the autonomic nervous system innervate the GI tract. In general, sympathetic nerves exert an inhibitory effect on the GI tract, decreasing gastric secretion and motility and causing the sphincters and blood vessels to constrict. Parasympathetic nerve stimulation causes peristalsis and increases secretory activities. The sphincters relax under the influence of parasympathetic stimulation. The only portions of the tract that are under voluntary control are the upper esophagus and the external anal sphincter.

\section*{FUNCTION OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM}

All cells of the body require nutrients. These nutrients are derived from the intake of food that contains proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, and cellulose fibers and other vegetable matter of no nutritional value. The primary digestive functions of the GI tract are the following:
- To break down food particles into the molecular form for digestion

\section*{Glossary}
absorption: phase of the digestive process that occurs when small molecules, vitamins, and minerals pass through the walls of the small and large intestine and into the bloodstream
amylase: an enzyme that aids in the digestion of starch
anus: last section of the GI tract; outlet for waste products from the system
chyme: mixture of food with saliva, salivary enzymes, and gastric secretions that is produced as the food passes through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach
digestion: phase of the digestive process that occurs when digestive enzymes and secretions mix with ingested food and when proteins, fats, and sugars are broken down into their component smaller molecules
elimination: phase of digestive process that occurs after digestion and absorption, when waste products are evacuated from the body
esophagus: collapsible tube connecting the mouth to the stomach, through which food passes as it is ingested
fibroscopy (gastrointestinal): intubation of a part of the GI system with a flexible, lighted tube to assist in diagnosis and treatment of diseases of that area
hydrochloric acid: acid secreted by the glands in the stomach; mixes with chyme to break it down into absorbable molecules and to aid in the destruction of bacteria
ingestion: phase of the digestive process that occurs when food is taken into the GI tract via the mouth and esophagus
intrinsic factor: a gastric secretion that combines with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ so that the vitamin can be absorbed
large intestine: the portion of the GI tract into which waste material from the small intestine passes as absorption continues and elimination begins; consists of several
parts-ascending segment, transverse segment, descending segment, sigmoid colon, and rectum
lipase: an enzyme that aids in the digestion of fats
mouth: first portion of the GI tract, through which food is ingested
pepsin: a gastric enzyme that is important in protein digestion
small intestine: longest portion of the GI tract, consisting of three parts-duodenum, jejunum, and ileum-through which food mixed with all secretions and enzymes passes as it continues to be digested and begins to be absorbed into the bloodstream
stomach: distensible pouch into which the food bolus passes to be digested by gastric enzymes
trypsin: enzyme that aids in the digestion of protein

- To absorb into the bloodstream the small molecules produced by digestion
- To eliminate undigested and unabsorbed foodstuffs and other waste products from the body

After food is ingested, it is propelled through the GI tract, coming into contact with a wide variety of secretions that aid in its digestion, absorption, or elimination from the GI tract.

\section*{Chewing and Swallowing}

The process of digestion begins with the act of chewing, in which food is broken down into small particles that can be swallowed and mixed with digestive enzymes. Eating-or even the sight, smell, or taste of food-can cause reflex salivation. Saliva is secreted from three pairs of glands: the parotid, the submaxillary, and the sublingual glands. Approximately 1.5 L of saliva is se-
creted daily. Saliva is the first secretion that comes in contact with food. Saliva contains the enzyme ptyalin, or salivary amylase, which begins the digestion of starches (Table 34-1). Saliva also contains mucus and water, which help to lubricate the food as it is chewed, thereby facilitating swallowing.

Swallowing begins as a voluntary act that is regulated by a swallowing center in the medulla oblongata of the central nervous system. As food is swallowed, the epiglottis moves to cover the tracheal opening and prevent aspiration of food into the lungs. Swallowing, which propels the bolus of food into the upper esophagus, thus ends as a reflex action. The smooth muscle in the wall of the esophagus contracts in a rhythmic sequence from the upper esophagus toward the stomach to propel the bolus of food along the tract. During this process of esophageal peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes and permits the bolus of food to enter the stomach. Subsequently, the lower esophageal sphincter closes tightly to prevent reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.

\section*{Gastric Function}

The stomach stores and mixes the food with secretions. It secretes a highly acidic fluid in response to the presence or anticipated ingestion of food. This fluid, which may have a pH as low as 1 , derives its acidity from the hydrochloric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$ secreted by the
glands of the stomach. The function of this gastric secretion is two-fold: to break down food into more absorbable components and to aid in the destruction of most ingested bacteria. The stomach can produce about 2.4 L per day of these gastric secretions. Gastric secretions also contain the enzyme pepsin, which is important for initiating protein digestion. Intrinsic factor is also secreted by the gastric mucosa. This compound combines with dietary vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ so that the vitamin can be absorbed in the ileum. In the absence of intrinsic factor, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ cannot be absorbed and pernicious anemia results (see Chapter 33).

Peristaltic contractions in the stomach propel its contents toward the pylorus. Because large food particles cannot pass through the pyloric sphincter, they are churned back into the body of the stomach. In this way, food in the stomach is agitated mechanically and broken down into smaller particles. Food remains in the stomach for a variable length of time, from a half-hour to several hours, depending on the size of food particles, the composition of the meal, and other factors. Peristalsis in the stomach and contractions of the pyloric sphincter allow the partially digested food to enter the small intestine at a rate that permits efficient absorption of nutrients. This food mixed with gastric secretions is called chyme. Hormones, neuroregulators, and local regulators found in the gastric secretions control the rate of gastric secretions and influence gastric motility (Table 34-2).

\section*{Small Intestine Function}

The digestive process continues in the duodenum. Secretions in the duodenum come from the accessory digestive organs-the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder-and the glands in the wall of the intestine itself. These secretions contain digestive enzymes and bile. Pancreatic secretions have an alkaline pH because of high concentrations of bicarbonate. This neutralizes the acid entering the duodenum from the stomach. The pancreas also secretes digestive enzymes, including trypsin, which aids in digesting protein; amylase, which aids in digesting starch; and lipase, which

aids in digesting fats. Bile (secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder) aids in emulsifying ingested fats, making them easier to digest and absorb.

The intestinal glands secrete mucus, hormones, electrolytes, and enzymes. The mucus coats the cells and protects the mucosa from injury by HCl . Hormones, neuroregulators, and local regulators found in these intestinal secretions control the rate of intestinal secretions and also influence GI motility. Intestinal secretions total approximately $1 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of pancreatic juice, $0.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of bile, and $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of secretions from the glands of the small intestine. Tables 34-1 and 34-2 summarize the actions of digestive enzymes and GI regulatory substances.

Two types of contractions occur regularly in the small intestine: segmentation contractions and intestinal peristalsis. Segmentation contractions produce mixing waves that move the intestinal contents back and forth in a churning motion. Intestinal peristalsis propels the contents of the small intestine toward the colon. Both movements are stimulated by the presence of chyme.

Food, initially ingested in the form of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, is broken down into absorbable particles (constituent nutrients) by the process of digestion. Carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides (eg, sucrose, maltose, galactose) and monosaccharides (eg, glucose, fructose). Glucose is the major carbohydrate that the tissue cells use as fuel. Proteins are broken down into amino acids and peptides. Ingested fats are emulsified into monoglycerides and fatty acids. These smaller molecules are then ready to be absorbed. Chyme stays in the small intestine for 3 to 6 hours, allowing for continued breakdown and absorption of nutrients.

Small, finger-like projections called villi are present throughout the entire intestine and function to produce digestive en-
zymes as well as to absorb nutrients. Absorption is the primary function of the small intestine. Vitamins and minerals are not digested but rather absorbed essentially unchanged. Absorption begins in the jejunum and is accomplished by both active transport and diffusion across the intestinal wall into the circulation. Absorption of different nutrients takes place at different locations in the small intestine. Iron and calcium absorption takes place in the duodenum. Fats, proteins, carbohydrates, sodium, and chloride are absorbed in the jejunum. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and bile salts are absorbed in the ileum. Magnesium, phosphate, and potassium are absorbed throughout the small intestine (Society of Gastroenterologic Nursing and Associates, 1998).

\section*{Colonic Function}

Within 4 hours after eating, residual waste material passes into the terminal ileum and passes slowly into the proximal portion of the colon through the ileocecal valve. This valve, which is normally closed, helps prevent colonic contents from refluxing into the small intestine. With each peristaltic wave of the small intestine, the valve opens briefly and permits some of the contents to pass into the colon.

Bacteria make up a major component of the contents of the large intestine. They assist in completing the breakdown of waste material, especially of undigested or unabsorbed proteins and bile salts. Two types of colonic secretions are added to the residual material: an electrolyte solution and mucus. The electrolyte solution is chiefly a bicarbonate solution that acts to neutralize the end products formed by the colonic bacterial action. The mucus protects the colonic mucosa from the interluminal contents and also provides adherence for the fecal mass.

Slow, weak peristaltic activity moves the colonic contents slowly along the tract. This slow transport allows efficient reabsorption of water and electrolytes, which is the primary purpose of the colon. Intermittent strong peristaltic waves propel the contents for considerable distances. This generally occurs after another meal is eaten, when intestine-stimulating hormones are released. The waste materials from a meal eventually reach and distend the rectum, usually in about 12 hours. As much as one fourth of the waste materials from a meal may still be in the rectum 3 days after the meal was ingested.

\section*{Waste Products of Digestion}

Feces consist of undigested foodstuffs, inorganic materials, water, and bacteria. Fecal matter is about $75 \%$ fluid and $25 \%$ solid material. The composition is relatively unaffected by alterations in diet, because a large portion of the fecal mass is of nondietary origin, derived from the secretions of the GI tract. The brown color of the feces results from the breakdown of bile by the intestinal bacteria. Chemicals formed by intestinal bacteria (especially indole and skatole) are responsible in large part for the fecal odor. Gases formed contain methane, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia, among others. The GI tract normally contains approximately 150 mL of these gases, which are either absorbed into the portal circulation and detoxified by the liver or expelled from the rectum as flatus.

Elimination of stool begins with distention of the rectum, which reflexively initiates contractions of the rectal musculature and relaxes the normally closed internal anal sphincter. The internal sphincter is controlled by the autonomic nervous system; the external sphincter is under the conscious control of the cerebral cortex. During defection, the external anal sphincter voluntarily relaxes to allow colonic contents to be expelled. Normally, the external anal sphincter is maintained in a state of tonic contraction. Thus, defecation is seen to be a spinal reflex (involving the parasympathetic nerve fibers) that can be inhibited voluntarily by keeping the external anal sphincter closed. Contracting the abdominal muscles (straining) facilitates emptying of the colon. The average frequency of defection in humans is once daily, but the frequency varies among individuals.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

The nurse begins by taking a complete history, focusing on symptoms common to GI dysfunction. These symptoms include pain, indigestion, intestinal gas, nausea and vomiting, hematemesis, and changes in bowel habits and stool characteristics. Information about any previous GI disease is important. The nurse notes past and current medication use and any previous treatment or surgery. Information pertaining to medications is of particular interest because medications are a frequent cause of GI symptoms. The nurse takes a dietary history to assess nutritional status. Questioning about the use of tobacco and alcohol includes details about type and amount. The nurse and patient discuss changes in appetite or eating patterns and any examples of unexplained weight gain or loss over the past year. The nurse also assesses the stool characteristics. The nurse records all abnormal findings and reports them to the physician. It is important to include in the history questions about psychosocial, spiritual, or cultural factors that may be affecting the patient.

\section*{Pain}

Pain can be a major symptom of GI disease. The character, duration, pattern, frequency, location, distribution of referred pain (Fig. 34-3), and time of the pain vary greatly depending on the underlying cause. Other factors, such as meals, rest, defecation, and vascular disorders, may directly affect this pain.

\section*{Indigestion}

Upper abdominal discomfort or distress associated with eating (commonly called indigestion) is the most common symptom of patients with GI dysfunction. The basis for this abdominal distress may be the patient's own gastric peristaltic movements. Bowel movements may or may not relieve the pain. Indigestion can result from disturbed nervous system control of the stomach

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 34-3 Common sites of referred abdominal pain.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-458.jpg?height=797&width=1261&top_left_y=1818&top_left_x=721}
\end{figure}
or from a disorder in the GI tract or elsewhere in the body. Fatty foods tend to cause the most discomfort, because they remain in the stomach longer than proteins or carbohydrates do. Coarse vegetables and highly seasoned foods can also cause considerable distress.

\section*{Intestinal Gas}

The accumulation of gas in the GI tract may result in belching (the expulsion of gas from the stomach through the mouth) or flatulence (the expulsion of gas from the rectum). It is through belching that swallowed air is expelled quickly when it reaches the stomach. Usually, gases in the small intestine pass into the colon and are released as flatus. Patients often complain of bloating, distention, or being "full of gas." Excessive flatulence may be a symptom of gallbladder disease or food intolerance.

\section*{Nausea and Vomiting}

Vomiting is another major symptom of GI disease. Vomiting is usually preceded by nausea, which can be triggered by odors, activity, or food intake. The emesis, or vomitus, may vary in color and content. It may contain undigested food particles or blood (hematemesis). When vomiting occurs soon after hemorrhage, the emesis is bright red. If blood has been retained in the stomach, it takes on a coffee-ground appearance because of the action of the digestive enzymes.

\section*{Change in Bowel Habits and Stool Characteristics}

Changes in bowel habits may signal colon disease. Diarrhea (an abnormal increase in the frequency and liquidity of the stool or in daily stool weight or volume) commonly occurs when the contents move so rapidly through the intestine and colon that there is inadequate time for the GI secretions to be absorbed. Diarrhea is sometimes associated with abdominal pain or cramping and nausea or vomiting. Constipation (a decrease in the frequency of stool, or stools that are hard, dry, and of smaller volume than normal) may be associated with anal discomfort and rectal bleeding. See Chapter 38 for further discussion of diarrhea and constipation.

The characteristics of the stool can vary greatly. Stool is normally light to dark brown. However, many circumstances, including the ingestion of certain foods and medications, can change the appearance of stool (Table 34-3). Blood in the stool can present in various ways and must be investigated. If blood is shed in sufficient quantities into the upper GI tract, it produces a tarry-black color

(melena). Blood entering the lower portion of the GI tract or passing rapidly through it will appear bright or dark red. Lower rectal or anal bleeding is suspected if there is streaking of blood on the surface of the stool or if blood is noted on toilet tissue. Other common abnormalities in stool characteristics that the patient may describe during the health history include the following:
- Bulky, greasy, foamy stools that are foul in odor; stool color is gray, with a silvery sheen
- Light gray or clay-colored stool, caused by the absence of urobilin
- Stool with mucus threads or pus that may be visible on gross inspection of the stool
- Small, dry, rock-hard masses called scybala; sometimes streaked with blood from rectal trauma as they pass through the rectum
- Loose, watery stool that may or may not be streaked with blood

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

The physical examination includes assessment of the mouth, abdomen, and rectum. The mouth, tongue, buccal mucosa, teeth, and gums are inspected, and ulcers, nodules, swelling, discoloration, and inflammation are noted. People with dentures should remove them during this part of the examination to allow good visualization.

The patient lies supine with knees flexed slightly for inspection, auscultation, palpation, and percussion of the abdomen (Fig. 34-4). The nurse performs inspection first, noting skin changes and scars from previous surgery. It also is important to note the contour and symmetry of the abdomen, to identify any localized bulging, distention, or peristaltic waves.

The nurse performs auscultation before percussion and palpation (which can increase intestinal motility and thereby change bowel sounds) and notes the character, location, and frequency of bowel sounds. The nurse assesses bowel sounds in all four quadrants using the diaphragm of the stethoscope; the high-pitched and gurgling sounds can be heard best in this manner. It is important to document the frequency of the sounds, using the terms normal (sounds heard about every 5 to 20 seconds), hypoactive (one or two sounds in 2 minutes), hyperactive ( 5 to 6 sounds heard in less than 30 seconds), or absent (no sounds in 3 to 5 minutes).

The nurse notes tympany or dullness during percussion. Use of light palpation is appropriate for identifying areas of tenderness or swelling; the nurse may use deep palpation to identify masses in any of the four quadrants. If the patient identifies any area of discomfort, the nurse can assess for rebound tenderness. To elicit rebound tenderness, the nurse exerts pressure over the area and then releases it quickly. It is important to note any pain experienced on withdrawal of the pressure. The nurse notes any abnormal finding in relation to the surface landmarks (xiphoid process, costal margins, anterior iliac spine, and symphysis pubis) or in relation to the four quadrants commonly used to describe the abdomen (right upper quadrant, RUQ; right lower quadrant, RLQ; left upper quadrant, LUQ; and left lower quadrant, LLQ) (Bickley \& Hoekelman, 1999).

The final part of the examination is inspection of the anal and perineal area. The nurse should inspect and palpate areas of excoriation or rash, fissures or fistula openings, or external hemorrhoids. A digital rectal examination can be performed to note any areas of tenderness or mass.

\end{figure}

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

Blood tests are ordered initially. Common blood tests include complete blood count (CBC), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides. Test findings may reveal alterations in basal metabolic function and may indicate the severity of a disorder.

Many other modalities are available for diagnostic assessment of the GI tract. The majority of these tests and procedures are performed on an outpatient basis in special units designed for this purpose (eg, endoscopy or GI laboratory). The nurse supports and educates patients who are undergoing diagnostic evaluation, whether in an inpatient or an outpatient setting. Patients who require such tests frequently are anxious, elderly, or debilitated. The preparation for many of these studies includes fasting, the use of laxatives or enemas, and ingestion or injection of a contrast agent or a radiopaque dye. These preparatory measures are poorly tolerated by weak and many elderly patients and have the potential to cause fluid and electrolyte imbalances. If further assessment or treatment is needed after any outpatient procedure, the patient may be admitted to the hospital.

Specific nursing interventions for each test are provided later in this chapter. General nursing interventions for the patient who is having GI diagnostic assessment include the following:
- Providing general information about a healthy diet and the nutritional factors that can cause GI disturbances; after a diagnosis has been confirmed, the nurse provides information about specific nutrients that should be included in the diet
- Providing needed information about the test and the activities required of the patient
- Providing instructions about postprocedure care and activity restrictions
- Alleviating anxiety
- Helping the patient cope with discomfort
- Encouraging family members or others to offer emotional support to the patient during the diagnostic testing
- Assessing for adequate hydration before, during, and immediately after the procedure, and providing education about maintenance of hydration

\section*{STOOL TESTS}

Basic examination of the stool includes inspecting the specimen for consistency and color and testing for occult (not visible) blood. Special tests, including tests for fecal urobilinogen, fat, nitrogen, parasites, pathogens, food residues, and other substances, require that the specimen be sent to the laboratory.

Stool samples are usually collected on a random basis unless a quantitative study (eg, fecal fat, urobilinogen) is to be performed. Random specimens should be sent promptly to the laboratory for analysis. The quantitative 24 - to 72 -hour collections must be kept refrigerated until they are taken to the laboratory. Some stool collections require the patient to follow a special diet or to refrain from taking certain medications before the collection. It is important to follow test guidelines closely for accurate results.

Fecal occult blood testing is one of the most commonly performed stool tests. It can be useful in initial screening for several
disorders. It tests only for the presence of blood, so other followup testing is required. It is most frequently used in cancer screening programs and for early cancer detection (Chart 34-1). The test can be performed at the bedside, in the laboratory, or at home. It tests for heme, the iron-containing portion of the hemoglobin molecule that is altered during transit through the intestines.

Probably the most widely used occult blood test is the Hematest. It is inexpensive and noninvasive, and it carries no risk to the patient. It should not, however, be performed when there is hemorrhoidal bleeding. The test can be performed at home as well as in the doctor's office. The patient provides a stool specimen, and the physician smears it on a dry, guaiac-impregnated paper slide. If the test is done at home, the patient mails the slide to the physician in an envelope provided for that purpose. The stool specimen is then examined for occult blood. Serial 3- to 6-day testing is recommended. The test is not perfect, because certain factors interfere with its sensitivity and specificity. False-positive results may occur if the patient has eaten rare meat, liver, poultry, turnips, broccoli, cauliflower, melons, salmon, sardines, or horseradish within 7 days before testing. Medications that can cause gastric irritation, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin, colchicine, corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and anticoagulants, may also cause false-positive results. Extensive research has demonstrated that therapeutic doses of iron preparations do not cause false-positive results. Ingestion of vitamin C from supplements or foods can cause false-negative results. Therefore, a careful assessment of the patient's diet and medication regimen is essential to reduce incorrect interpretation of results (Ahmed, 2000).

Other occult blood tests that may yield more specific and more sensitive readings include Hematest II SENSA and HemoQuant. Immunologic tests are more specific to human hemoglobin and decrease the problem of dietary interference. Hemoporphyrin assays detect the broadest range of blood derivatives, but a strict

\section*{Chart 34-1 \\ Health Promotion: Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening}

For adults older than 50 years of age, one of the screening approaches below should be followed:
If low-to-average risk (asymptomatic):
- Digital rectal examination annually
- Fecal occult blood testing annually

AND
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years

If moderate risk (colorectal cancer in family members):
- Digital rectal examination annually
- Fecal occult blood testing annually

AND
- Colonoscopy every 5-10 years (if there is a history of polypectomy, colonoscopy in 1 year and then every 5 years)
If high risk (family history of hereditary disease or inflammatory bowel disease):
- Digital rectal examination annually
- Fecal occult blood testing annually
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 1-2 years

OR
- Colonoscopy every 1-2 years
- Genetic testing

dietary protocol is essential. Immunochemical tests using antihuman antibodies that are extremely sensitive to human hemoglobin are also available.

\section*{BREATH TESTS}

The hydrogen breath test was developed to evaluate carbohydrate absorption. It also is used to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth in the intestine and short bowel syndrome. This test determines the amount of hydrogen expelled in the breath after it has been produced in the colon (on contact of galactose with fermenting bacteria) and absorbed into the blood.

Urea breath tests detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria that can live in the mucosal lining of the stomach and cause peptic ulcer disease. The patient takes a capsule of carbonlabeled urea and then provides a breath sample 10 to 20 minutes later. Because H. pylori metabolizes urea rapidly, the labeled carbon is absorbed quickly; it can then be measured as carbon dioxide in the expired breath to determine whether H. pylori is present. The patient is instructed to avoid antibiotics or loperamide (Pepto-Bismol) for 1 month before the test; sucralfate (Carafate) and omeprazole (Prilosec) for 1 week before the test; and cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid) for 24 hours before urea breath testing. H. pylori also can be detected by assessing serum antibody levels.

\section*{ABDOMINAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY}

Ultrasonography is a noninvasive diagnostic technique in which high-frequency sound waves are passed into internal body structures and the ultrasonic echoes are recorded on an oscilloscope as they strike tissues of different densities. During abdominal ultrasonography, an image of the abdominal organs and structures is produced on the oscilloscope. This procedure is generally used to indicate the size and configuration of abdominal structures. It is particularly useful in the detection of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and appendicitis. Most recently this technique has proven useful in diagnosing acute colonic diverticulitis.

Advantages of abdominal ultrasonography are that it requires no ionizing radiation, there are no noticeable side effects, and it is relatively inexpensive. One disadvantage is that it cannot be used to examine structures that lie behind bony tissue, because bone prevents sound waves from passing to deeper structures. Gas and fluid in the abdomen or air in the lungs also prevent transmission of ultrasound.

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a specialized enteroscopic procedure that aids in the diagnosis of GI disorders by providing direct imaging of a target area. A small high-frequency ultrasonic transducer is mounted at the tip of the fiberoptic scope so that a transintestinal study can be completed. This procedure gives results with better quality resolution and definition than regular ultrasound imaging. It helps in staging of a tumor, including size, spread, and whether the tumor is operable. It is useful in evaluating transmural changes in the bowel wall that occur in ulcerative colitis. Intestinal gas, bone, and thick layers of adipose tissue (all of which hamper conventional ultrasonography) are not problems when this technique is used.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The patient fasts for 8 to 12 hours before the test to decrease the amount of gas in the bowel. If gallbladder studies are being performed, the patient should eat a fat-free meal the evening before
the test. If barium studies are to be performed, the nurse should make sure they are scheduled after this test; otherwise, the barium will interfere with the transmission of the sound waves.

\section*{DNA TESTING}

Researchers have refined methods for genetic risk assessment, preclinical diagnosis, and prenatal diagnosis to identify persons who are at risk for certain GI disorders (eg, gastric cancer, lactose deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer). In some cases, DNA testing allows practitioners to prevent (or minimize) disease, by intervening before its onset, and to improve therapy. Persons who are identified as at risk for certain GI disorders may choose to undergo genetic counseling to learn about the disease; to understand options for preventing and treating the disease; and to receive support in coping with the situation (Yamada, 1999). Persons at risk for colon cancer often are targeted for DNA testing because it can provide a head start on this preventable cancer.

\section*{IMAGING STUDIES}

Imaging studies include x-ray and contrast studies, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and scintigraphy (radionuclide imaging).

\section*{Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Study}

X-rays can delineate the entire GI tract after the introduction of a contrast agent. A radiopaque liquid (eg, barium sulfate) is commonly used. The patient ingests this tasteless, odorless, nongranular, and completely insoluble (hence, not absorbable) powder in the form of a thick or thin aqueous suspension for the purpose of studying the upper GI tract (upper GI series or barium swallow). The upper GI series enables the examiner to detect or exclude anatomic or functional derangement of the upper GI organs or sphincters. It also aids in the diagnosis of ulcers, varices, tumors, regional enteritis, and malabsorption syndromes. The procedure may be extended to examine the duodenum and small bowel (small bowel follow-through).

The patient swallows barium under direct fluoroscopic examination. As the barium descends into the stomach, the position, patency, and caliber of the esophagus are visualized, enabling the examiner to detect or exclude any anatomic or functional derangement of that organ. Fluoroscopic examination next extends to the stomach as its lumen fills with barium, allowing observation of stomach motility, thickness of the gastric wall, the mucosal pattern, patency of the pyloric valve, and the anatomy of the duodenum. Multiple x-ray films are obtained during the procedure, and additional images may be taken at intervals for up to

24 hours to evaluate the rate of gastric emptying. Small bowel xrays taken while the barium is passing through that area allow for observation of the motility of the small bowel. Obstructions, ileitis, and diverticula can be detected if present.

Variations of the upper GI study include double-contrast studies and enteroclysis. The double-contrast method of examining the upper GI tract involves administration of a thick barium suspension to outline the stomach and esophageal wall, after which tablets that release carbon dioxide in the presence of water are given. This technique has the advantage of showing the esophagus and stomach in finer detail, permitting signs of early superficial neoplasms to be noted.

Enteroclysis is a very detailed, double-contrast study of the entire small intestine that involves the continuous infusion, through a duodenal tube, of 500 to 1000 mL of a thin barium sulfate suspension. Methylcellulose is then infused into the small intestine through the tube. The barium and methylcellulose fill the intestinal loops and are observed continuously by fluoroscopy and viewed at frequent intervals as they progress through the jejunum and the ileum. This process (even with normal motility) can take up to 6 hours. The procedure aids in the diagnosis of partial small-bowel obstructions or diverticula.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The patient may need to maintain a low-residue diet for several days before the test. He or she should receive nothing by mouth after midnight before the test. The physician may prescribe a laxative to clean out the intestinal tract. Because smoking can stimulate gastric motility, the nurse discourages the patient from smoking on the morning before the examination. In addition, the nurse withholds all medications.

Follow-up care is needed after any of the upper GI procedures to ensure that the patient has completely eliminated the ingested barium. Fluids must be increased to facilitate evacuation of stool and barium. The nurse monitors the patient's stools until they return to their normal color (the barium will look like clay). A laxative or enema may be needed.

\section*{Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Study}

When barium is instilled rectally to visualize the lower GI tract, the procedure is called a barium enema. The purpose of a barium enema is to detect the presence of polyps, tumors, and other lesions of the large intestine and to demonstrate any abnormal anatomy or malfunction of the bowel.

The radiopaque substance is instilled rectally in the radiology department during fluoroscopy. If the patient has been prepared adequately and the colon has been evacuated completely, the contour of the entire colon, including the cecum and appendix (if patent), is clearly visible and the motility of each portion may be observed readily. The procedure usually takes about 15 to 30 minutes, during which time x-ray images are taken.

Other means for visualizing the colon include double-contrast studies and a water-soluble contrast study. A double-contrast or air-contrast barium enema involves the instillation of a thicker barium solution, followed by the instillation of air. The patient may feel some cramping or discomfort with this process. This test provides a contrast between the air-filled lumen and the bariumcoated mucosa, allowing easier detection of smaller lesions.

If active inflammatory disease, fistulas, or perforation of the colon is suspected, a water-soluble iodinated contrast agent (eg, Gastrografin) can be used. The procedure is the same as for a bar-
ium enema; however, the patient must be assessed for allergy to iodine or contrast agent. The contrast agent is eliminated readily after the procedure, so there is no need for postprocedure laxatives. Some diarrhea may occur in a few patients until the contrast agent has been totally eliminated.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Preparing the patient includes emptying and cleansing the lower bowel. This often necessitates a low-residue diet 1 to 2 days before the test (the preparation required by different radiology departments may vary); a clear liquid diet and a laxative the evening before; nothing by mouth after midnight; and cleansing enemas until returns are clear the following morning. The nurse should make sure that barium enemas are scheduled before any upper GI studies. If the patient has active inflammatory disease of the colon, enemas are contraindicated. Barium enema also is contraindicated in patients with signs of perforation or obstruction; instead, a water-soluble contrast study may be performed in these situations. Active GI bleeding may prohibit the use of laxatives and enemas.

The nurse administers an enema or laxative after these tests to facilitate barium removal. Increasing fluid intake also will assist in eliminating the barium. As with any barium study, the nurse monitors the patient for complete elimination of the barium.

\section*{Computed Tomography}

CT provides cross-sectional images of abdominal organs and structures. Multiple x-ray images are taken from many different angles, digitized in the computer, reconstructed, and then viewed on a computer monitor. Indications for abdominal CT scanning are diseases of the liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, and pelvic organs. CT is a valuable tool for detecting and localizing many inflammatory conditions in the colon, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Because the adequacy of detail in the test depends on the presence of fat, this diagnostic tool is not useful for very thin, cachectic patients. The procedure is completely painless, but radiation doses are considerable. Because a scanning time of 5 seconds is required, motion artifacts produced by heartbeat and respiration cannot be avoided, resulting in pictures that are less than clear.

New, continuous-motion (helical or spiral), three-dimensional CT scans have been developed that provide very detailed pictures of the GI organs and vasculature (Yamada, 1999). Colonography can be completed in minutes. It involves inserting a thin, strawlike tube into the colon and inflating the bowel with air to generate a computer image of the intestine. There is little discomfort, and sedation is not needed.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The patient should not eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The practitioner may prescribe an intravenous or oral contrast agent. Therefore, the nurse should question the patient about contrast dye allergies. If barium studies are to be performed, it is important to schedule them after CT scanning, so as not to interfere with imaging.

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

MRI is used in gastroenterology to supplement ultrasonography and CT scanning. It is a noninvasive technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce an image of the area being
studied. The use of oral contrast agents to enhance the image has increased the application of this technique for the diagnosis of GI diseases. It is useful in evaluating abdominal soft tissues as well as blood vessels, abscesses, fistulas, neoplasms, and other sources of bleeding.

The physiologic artifacts of heartbeat, respiration, and peristalsis may create a less-than-clear image. Newer, fast-imaging MRI techniques help to eliminate these physiologic motion artifacts. MRI is contraindicated for patients with permanent pacemakers, artificial heart valves and defibrillators, implanted insulin pumps, or implanted transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices, because the magnetic field could cause malfunction. MRI is also contraindicated for patients with internal metal devices (eg, aneurysm clips) or intraocular metallic fragments.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The patient should not eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test. Before the test, the patient must remove all jewelry and other metals. The patient lies in a machine that constructs an image based on the magnetic field created between the machine and the structures scanned. The entire procedure takes 30 to 90 minutes.

It is important to warn patients that the close-fitting scanners used in many MRI facilities may induce feelings of claustrophobia and that the machine will make a knocking sound during the procedure. Open MRIs that are less close-fitting eliminate the claustrophobia that many patients experience.

\section*{Scintigraphy}

Scintigraphy (radionuclide testing) relies on the use of radioactive isotopes (ie, technetium, iodine, and indium) to reveal displaced anatomic structures, changes in organ size, and the presence of neoplasms or other focal lesions, such as cysts or abscesses.

Scintigraphic scanning is also used to measure the uptake of tagged red blood cells and leukocytes. Tagging of red blood cells and leukocytes by injection of a radionuclide is performed to define areas of inflammation, abscess, blood loss, or neoplasm. A sample of blood is removed, mixed with a radioactive substance, and reinjected into the patient. Abnormal concentrations of blood cells are then detected at 24 - and 48-hour intervals.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Motility Studies}

Radionuclide testing also is used to assess gastric emptying and colonic transit time. For gastric emptying studies, the liquid and solid components of a meal are tagged with radionuclide markers. After the patient ingests the meal, the patient is positioned under a scintiscanner, which measures the rate of passage of the radioactive substance out of the stomach. This is useful in diagnosing disorders of gastric motility. Radionuclide evaluation of gastric emptying is now preferred over intubation methods because it gives more defined results (Phillips \& Wingate, 1998). This procedure is helpful for evaluating any functional cause of gastric emptying, but its most common clinical uses at this time are in the evaluation of diabetic gastroparesis and of the rapid emptying process in the dumping syndrome.

Colonic transit studies are used to evaluate colonic motility instances of chronic constipation and obstructive defecation syndromes. This is usually an outpatient study. The patient is given a capsule containing 20 radionuclide markers and instructions to follow a regular diet and normal daily activities. Abdominal x-rays are taken every 24 hours until all markers are passed. This process usually takes 4 to 5 days, but in the presence of severe constipation it may take as long as 10 days. People with chronic diarrhea may be evaluated at 8 -hour intervals. The amount of time it takes for the radioactive material to move through the colon indicates colonic motility.

\section*{ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES}

Endoscopic procedures used in GI tract assessment include fibroscopy/esophagogastroduodenoscopy, anoscopy, proctoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, small-bowel enteroscopy, and endoscopy through ostomy.

\section*{Upper Gastrointestinal Fibroscopy/ Esophagogastroduodenoscopy}

Fiberscopes are flexible scopes equipped with fiberoptic lenses. Fibroscopy of the upper GI tract allows direct visualization of the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa through a lighted endoscope (gastroscope) (Fig. 34-5). This procedure,

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 34-5 Patient undergoing gastroscopy.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-464.jpg?height=668&width=1122&top_left_y=1891&top_left_x=860}
\end{figure}
called esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), is especially valuable when esophageal, gastric, or duodenal abnormalities or inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious processes are suspected. This procedure also can be used to evaluate esophageal and gastric motility and to collect secretions and tissue specimens for further analysis.

The gastroenterologist views the GI tract through a viewing lens and can take still or video photographs through the scope to document findings. Electronic video endoscopes also are available that attach directly to a video processor, converting the electronic signals into pictures on a television screen. This allows larger and continuous viewing capabilities, as well as the simultaneous recording of the procedure.

Side-viewing flexible scopes are used to visualize the common bile duct and the pancreatic and hepatic ducts through the ampulla of Vater in the duodenum. This procedure, called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), uses the endoscope in combination with radiographic techniques to view the ductal structures of the biliary tract. ERCP is helpful in evaluating jaundice, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumors, common duct stones, and biliary tract disease. ERCP is described further in Chapter 40.

Upper GI fibroscopy also can be a therapeutic procedure when it is combined with other procedures. Therapeutic endoscopy can be used to remove common bile duct stones, dilate strictures, and treat gastric bleeding and esophageal varices. Laser-compatible scopes can be used to provide laser therapy for upper GI neoplasms. Sclerosing solutions can be injected through the scope in an attempt to control upper GI bleeding.

After the patient is sedated, the endoscope is lubricated with a water-soluble lubricant and passed smoothly and slowly along the back of the mouth and down into the esophagus. The gastroenterologist views the gastric wall and the sphincters, and then advances the endoscope into the duodenum for further examination. Biopsy forceps to obtain tissue specimens or cytology brushes to obtain cells for microscopic study can be passed through the scope. The procedure usually takes about 30 minutes.

The patient may experience nausea, gagging, or choking. Use of topical anesthetics and moderate sedation makes it important to monitor and maintain the oral airway during and after the procedure. Finger or ear oximeters are used to monitor oxygen saturation, and supplemental oxygen may be used if needed. Emergency equipment must be readily available. Precautions must be taken to protect the scope, because the fiberoptic bundles can be broken if the scope is bent at an acute angle. The patient wears a mouth guard to keep from biting the scope.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The patient should not eat or drink for 6 to 12 hours before the examination. Patient preparation includes helping the patient spray or gargle with a local anesthetic, and administering midazolam (Versed) intravenously just before the scope is introduced. Midazolam is a sedative that provides moderate sedation and relieves anxiety during the procedure. The nurse also may administer atropine to reduce secretions, and may give glucagon, if needed and prescribed, to relax smooth muscle. The nurse positions the patient on the left side to facilitate saliva drainage and to provide easy access for the endoscope. After the procedure, the nurse instructs the patient not to eat or drink until the gag reflex returns (in 1 to 2 hours), to prevent aspiration of food or fluids into the lungs. The nurse places the patient in the Simms position until he or she is awake and then places the patient in the semi-Fowler's position until ready for discharge. After gastroscopy,
assessment by the nurse includes observing for signs of perforation, such as pain, bleeding, unusual difficulty swallowing, and an elevated temperature. The nurse monitors the pulse and blood pressure for changes that can occur with sedation. The nurse can test the gag reflex by placing a tongue blade onto the back of the throat to see whether gagging occurs. After the patient's gag reflex has returned, the nurse can offer lozenges, saline gargle, and oral analgesics to relieve minor throat discomfort. Patients who were sedated for the procedure must stay on bed rest until fully alert. After moderate sedation, the patient must be accompanied and transported home if the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. The nurse instructs the patient not to drive for 10 to 12 hours if sedation was used.

\section*{Anoscopy, Proctoscopy, and Sigmoidoscopy}

The lower portion of the colon also can be viewed directly to evaluate rectal bleeding, acute or chronic diarrhea, or change in bowel patterns and to observe for ulceration, fissures, abscesses, tumors, polyps, or other pathologic processes. Rigid or flexible fiberoptic scopes can be used. The anoscope is a rigid scope that is used to examine the anus and lower rectum. Proctoscopes and sigmoidoscopes are rigid scopes that are used to inspect the rectum and the sigmoid colon.

Flexible scopes have largely replaced the rigid scopes for routine examinations. The flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscope (Fig. 34-6) permits the colon to be examined up to 40 to 50 cm ( 16 to 20 inches) from the anus, much more than the 25 cm ( 10 inches) that can be visualized with the rigid sigmoidoscope. The flexible scope has many of the same capabilities as the scopes used for the upper GI study, including the use of still or video images to document findings.

For rigid scope procedures, the patient assumes the knee-chest position at the edge of the bed or the examining table. With the back inclined at about a 45 -degree angle, the patient is properly positioned for the introduction of an anoscope, proctoscope, or

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-465.jpg?height=808&width=845&top_left_y=1709&top_left_x=1030}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 34-6 Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy. The flexible scope is advanced past the proximal sigmoid and then into the descending colon.}
\end{figure}
sigmoidoscope. During the examination, it is important to keep the patient informed about the progress of the examination and to explain that the pressure exerted by the instrument will create the urge to have a bowel movement.

For flexible scope procedures, the patient assumes a comfortable position on the left side with the right leg bent and placed anteriorly. Again, it is important to keep the patient informed throughout the examination and to explain the sensations associated with the examination. Biopsies and polypectomies can be performed during this procedure. Biopsy is performed with small biting forceps introduced through the endoscope; one or more small pieces of tissue may be removed. If rectal or sigmoid polyps are present, they may be removed with a wire snare, which is used to grasp the pedicle, or stalk. An electrocoagulating current is then used to sever the polyp and prevent bleeding. It is extremely important that all excised tissue be placed immediately in moist gauze or in an appropriate receptacle, labeled correctly, and delivered without delay to the pathology laboratory for examination.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

These examinations require only limited bowel preparation, including a warm tap water or Fleet's enema until returns are clear. Dietary restrictions usually are not necessary, and sedation usually is not required. During the procedure, the nurse monitors vital signs, skin color and temperature, pain tolerance, and vagal response (Society of Gastroenterologic Nursing and Associates, 2000). After the procedure, the nurse monitors the patient for rectal bleeding and signs of intestinal perforation (ie, fever, rectal drainage, abdominal distention, and pain). On completion of the examination, the patient can resume regular activities and dietary practices.

\section*{Fiberoptic Colonoscopy}

Direct visual inspection of the colon to the cecum is possible by means of a flexible fiberoptic colonoscope (Fig. 34-7). These scopes have the same capabilities as those used for esophagogastro-
duodenoscopy; however, they are larger in diameter and longer. Still and video recordings can be used to document the procedure and findings.

This procedure is used commonly as a diagnostic aid and screening device. It is most frequently used for cancer screening (see Chart 34-1) and for surveillance in patients with previous colon cancer or polyps. In addition, tissue biopsies can be obtained as needed, and polyps can be removed and evaluated. Other uses of colonoscopy include the evaluation of patients with diarrhea of unknown cause, occult bleeding, or anemia; further study of abnormalities detected on barium enema; and diagnosis, clarification, and determination of the extent of inflammatory or other bowel disease.

Therapeutically, the procedure can be used to remove all visible polyps with a special snare and cautery through the colonoscope. Many colon cancers begin with adenomatous polyps of the colon; therefore, one goal of colonoscopic polypectomy is early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. This procedure also can be used to treat areas of bleeding or stricture. Use of bipolar and unipolar coagulators, use of heater probes, and injections of sclerosing agents or vasoconstrictors are all possible during this procedure. Laser-compatible scopes provide laser therapy for bleeding lesions or colonic neoplasms. Bowel decompression can also be completed during the procedure.

Colonoscopy is performed while the patient is lying on the left side with the legs drawn up toward the chest. The patient's position may be changed during the test to facilitate advancement of the scope. The procedure usually takes about 1 hour. Discomfort may result from instillation of air to expand the colon or from insertion and moving of the scope. Biopsy forceps or a cytology brush may be passed through the scope to obtain specimens for histology and cytology examinations. Potential complications of colonoscopy include cardiac dysrhythmias and respiratory depression resulting from the medications administered, vasovagal reactions, and circulatory overload or hypotension resulting from overhydration or underhydration during bowel preparation. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient's cardiac and respiratory function continuously. Oxygen saturation is monitored with a

\begin{figure}

finger or ear oximeter. Supplemental oxygen should be used as necessary.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The success of the procedure depends on how well the colon is prepared. Adequate colon cleansing provides optimal visualization and decreases the time needed for the procedure. First, the patient should limit the intake of liquids for 24 to 72 hours before the examination. Then, cleansing of the colon can be accomplished in various ways. The physician may prescribe a laxative for two nights before the examination and a Fleet's or saline enema until the return runs clear the morning of the test. More frequently, however, polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solutions (Golytely, Colyte, NuLytely) are used as intestinal lavages for effective cleansing of the bowel. The patient maintains a clear liquid diet starting at noon the day before the procedure. Then the patient ingests lavage solutions orally at intervals over 3 to 4 hours. If necessary, the nurse can give this solution through a feeding tube if the patient is unable to swallow. Patients with a colostomy can receive this same bowel preparation. With the use of lavage solutions, bowel cleansing is fast (rectal effluent is clear in about 4 hours) and is tolerated fairly well by most patients. Side effects of the electrolyte solutions include nausea, bloating, cramps or abdominal fullness, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and hypothermia (patients are often told to drink the preparation as cold as possible to make it more palatable). The side effects are especially problematic for elderly patients, and sometimes they have difficulty ingesting the required volume of solution. The use of lavage solutions is contraindicated in patients with intestinal obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease.

Additional nursing actions include the following:
- Instructing the patient not to take routine medications when the lavage solution is ingested; the medications will not be digested and therefore will be ineffective
- Advising the diabetic patient to consult with his or her physician about medication adjustment to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia resulting from dietary modifications required in preparation for the test
- Instructing all patients, especially the elderly, to maintain adequate fluid, electrolyte, and caloric intake while undergoing bowel cleansing
Special precautions must be taken for some patients. Implantable defibrillators and pacemakers are at high risk for malfunction if electrosurgical procedures (ie, polypectomy) are performed in conjunction with colonoscopy. A cardiologist should be consulted before the test is performed, and the defibrillator should be turned off. These patients require careful cardiac monitoring during the procedure. Colonoscopy cannot be performed if there is a suspected or documented colon perforation, acute severe diverticulitis, or fulminant colitis. Therapeutic colonoscopy may be contraindicated in patients with coagulopathies and in those receiving anticoagulation therapy, because of the high risk for excessive bleeding during and after the procedure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), aspirin, ticlopidine, and pentoxifylline must be discontinued before the test and for 2 weeks after the procedure. Patients taking coumadin or heparin must consult the physician for specific instructions. Those with prosthetic heart valves or a history of endocarditis require prophylactic antibiotics before the procedure.

Informed consent is obtained before the test. The patient receives nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight before the test,
but most medications can be taken with a small amount of water; the physician should be consulted about medication use. Before the examination, the nurse may administer intravenously an opioid analgesic or a sedative (eg, midazolam) to provide moderate sedation and relieve anxiety during the procedure. Glucagon may be used, if needed, to relax the colonic musculature and to reduce spasm during the test. Elderly or debilitated patients may require a reduced dosage of these medications to decrease the risks of oversedation and cardiopulmonary complications.

During the procedure, the nurse monitors for changes in oxygen saturation, vital signs, color and temperature of the skin, level of consciousness, abdominal distention, vagal response, and pain intensity. After the procedure, patients who were sedated are maintained on bed rest until fully alert. Some will have abdominal cramps caused by increased peristalsis stimulated by the air insufflated into the bowel during the procedure. Immediately after the test, the nurse observes the patient for signs and symptoms of bowel perforation (eg, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain or distention, fever, focal peritoneal signs). If midazolam was used, the nurse explains its amnesic effects. It is important to provide written instructions, because the patient may be unable to recall verbal information. If the procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, someone must accompany and transport the patient home. After a therapeutic procedure, the nurse instructs the patient to report any bleeding to the physician.

\section*{Small-Bowel Enteroscopy}

Technology for the use of the small-caliber transnasal endoscope to allow direct inspection of the wall of the small intestine continues to be developed. Two methods are being used at this time: the "push" and the "pull" endoscope methods. The "pull" endoscope is very long and flexible and has a balloon at its tip. When inflated, the balloon tip advances the scope by peristalsis through the small intestine. Reglan may be administered intravenously to assist passage. This procedure takes up to 10 hours to complete. The patient may be kept in the recovery area or sent home during this period. Once the scope has entered the distal ileum, the balloon is deflated and the tube is retracted slowly while the endoscopist examines the intestinal wall. "Push" endoscopes have been designed to be smaller in caliber and longer in length, while still allowing the use of biopsy forceps and probes (Lightdale, 2000). These two methods are especially useful in the evaluation of patients who have continued bleeding even after extensive diagnostic testing has identified no other problem area. They can also be used when biopsy of the small bowel is needed to diagnose malabsorption syndromes.

\section*{Endoscopy Through Ostomy}

Endoscopy using a flexible endoscope through an ostomy stoma is useful for visualizing a segment of the small or large intestine. It may be indicated to evaluate an anastomosis, to screen for recurrent disease, or to visualize and treat bleeding in a segment of the bowel. Nursing interventions are similar to those for other endoscopic procedures.

\section*{MANOMETRY AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC STUDIES}

Manometry and electrophysiologic studies are methods for evaluating patients with GI motility disorders. The manometry test measures changes in intraluminal pressures and the coordination
of muscle activity in the GI tract. The pressures can be recorded manually, on a physiograph, or on a computer.

Esophageal manometry is used to detect motility disorders of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. Patients must refrain from eating or drinking for 8 to 12 hours before the test. Medications that could have a direct affect on motility (eg, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergic agents, sedatives) are withheld for 24 to 48 hours. A pressure-sensitive catheter is inserted through the nose and is connected to a transducer and a video recorder. The patient then swallows small amounts of water while the resultant pressure changes are recorded.

Gastroduodenal, small-intestine, and colonic manometry are used to evaluate delayed gastric emptying and gastric and intestinal motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome or atonic colon. This is often an ambulatory outpatient procedure lasting 24 to 72 hours. Anorectal manometry measures the resting tone of the internal anal sphincter and the contractibility of the external anal sphincter. It is helpful in evaluating patients with chronic constipation or fecal incontinence and is useful in biofeedback for the treatment of fecal incontinence. It can be performed in conjunction with rectal sensory functioning tests. Phospho-Soda or a saline cleansing enema is administered 1 hour before the test. Positioning for the test is either the prone or the lateral position.

A rectal sensory function test is used to evaluate rectal sensory function and neuropathy. A catheter and balloon are passed into the rectum, and the balloon is inflated until the patient feels distention. Then the tone and pressure of the rectum and anal sphincter are measured. The results are especially helpful in the evaluation of patients with chronic constipation, diarrhea, or incontinence.

Electrogastrography, an electrophysiologic study, also may be performed to assess gastric motility disturbances. Electrodes are placed over the abdomen, and gastric electrical activity is recorded for up to 24 hours. Patients may exhibit rapid, slow, or irregular waveform activity. Electrogastrography can be useful in detecting motor or nerve dysfunction in the stomach.

\section*{Defecography}

Defecography measures anorectal function. Very thick barium paste is instilled into the rectum, and then fluoroscopy is performed to assess the function of the rectum and anal sphincter while the patient attempts to expel the barium. The test requires no preparation. The use of scintigraphic techniques to measure rectal emptying of radioisotope-labeled artificial stool can provide more quantitative information.

Electromyographic (EMG) studies can supplement anorectal manometry to measure the integrity and function of the anal sphincters in an effort to treat functional bowel incontinence and constipation.

\section*{GASTRIC ANALYSIS, GASTRIC ACID STIMULATION TEST, AND pH MONITORING}

Analysis of the gastric juice yields information about the secretory activity of the gastric mucosa and the presence or degree of gastric retention in patients thought to have pyloric or duodenal obstruction. It is also useful for diagnosing diseases such as ZollingerEllison syndrome.

The patient is kept NPO for 8 to 12 hours before the procedure. Any medications that affect gastric secretions are withheld for 24 to 48 hours before the test. Smoking is not allowed on the morning before the test, because it increases gastric secretions. A small nasogastric tube with a catheter tip marked at various points is inserted through the nose. When the tube is at a point slightly less than 50 cm ( 21 inches) distant, it should be within the stomach, lying along the greater curvature. Once in place, the tube is secured to the patient's cheek and the patient is placed in a semireclining position. The entire stomach contents are aspirated by gentle suction into a syringe, and gastric samples are collected every 15 minutes for the next hour.

The gastric acid stimulation test usually is performed in conjunction with gastric analysis. Histamine or pentagastrin is administered subcutaneously to stimulate gastric secretions. It is important to inform the patient that this injection may produce a flushed feeling. The nurse monitors blood pressure and pulse frequently to detect hypotension. Gastric specimens are collected after the injection every 15 minutes for 1 hour and are labeled to indicate the time of specimen collection after histamine injection. The volume and pH of the specimen are measured. In certain instances, cytologic study by the Papanicolaou technique may be used to determine the presence or absence of malignant cells. Enzyme analysis of the gastric juice may be indicated.

Important diagnostic information to be gained from gastric analysis includes the ability of the mucosa to secrete HCl . This ability is altered in various disease states, including
- Pernicious anemia-patients with this disease secrete no acid under basal conditions or after stimulation
- Severe chronic atrophic gastritis or gastric cancer-patients with these diseases secrete little or no acid
- Peptic ulcer-patients with peptic ulcers secrete some acid
- Duodenal ulcers-patients with duodenal ulcers usually secrete an excess amount of acid

Esophageal reflux of gastric acid may be diagnosed by ambulatory pH monitoring. The patient is NPO for 6 hours before the test, and all medications affecting gastric secretions are withheld for 24 to 36 hours before the test. A probe that measures pH is placed through the nose and into position about 5 inches above the lower esophageal sphincter. It is connected to an external recording device and is worn for 24 hours while the patient continues his or her normal daily activities. The end result is a computer analysis and graphic display of the results. This test allows for the direct correlation between chest pain and reflux episodes (Wolfe, 2000).

A Bernstein test may be performed to evaluate complaints of acid-related chest or epigastric pain. HCl is instilled through a small feeding tube positioned in the esophagus. This is done to try to elicit reported chest pain. Resultant signs and symptoms are compared with the usual symptoms the patient reports. However, since the advent of ambulatory pH monitoring, this previously popular evaluation tool is used infrequently (Wolfe, 2000).

\section*{LAPAROSCOPY (PERITONEOSCOPY)}

Laparoscopy can be used for the diagnosis of GI disease. This procedure is performed through a small incision in the abdominal wall. Special fiberoptic laparoscopes allow direct visualization of the organs and structures within the abdomen, permitting visualization and identification of any growths, anomalies, and inflammatory processes. In addition, biopsy samples can be taken from the structures and organs as necessary. This procedure can
be used to evaluate peritoneal disease, chronic abdominal pain, abdominal masses, and gallbladder and liver disease. However, laparoscopy has not become an important diagnostic modality in patients with acute abdominal pain, because less invasive tools (ie, CT and MRI) are readily available (Wolfe, 2000). Laparoscopy usually requires general anesthesia and sometimes requires that the stomach and bowel be decompressed. Gas (usually carbon dioxide) is insufflated into the peritoneal cavity to create a working space for visualization. One of the most positive benefits of this procedure is that after visualization of a problem, excision (eg, removal of the gallbladder) can then be performed at the same time, if appropriate.

\section*{Pathophysiologic and Psychological Considerations}

Abnormalities of the GI tract are numerous and represent every type of major pathology that can affect other organ systems, including bleeding, perforation, obstruction, inflammation, and cancer. Congenital, inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, and neoplastic lesions have been encountered in every portion, and at every site, along the length of the GI tract. As with all other organ systems, the GI tract is subject to circulatory disturbances, faulty nervous system control, and aging.

Apart from the many organic diseases to which the GI tract is susceptible, there are many extrinsic factors that can interfere with its normal function and produce symptoms. Stress and anxiety, for example, often find their chief expression in indigestion, anorexia, or motor disturbances of the intestines, sometimes producing constipation or diarrhea. In addition to the state of mental health, physical factors such as fatigue and an inadequate or abruptly changed dietary intake can markedly affect the GI tract. When assessing and instructing the patient, the nurse should consider the variety of mental and physical factors that affect the function of the GI tract.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Normal physiologic changes of the GI system that occur with aging are identified in the accompanying Gerontologic Considerations box. The nurse should carefully assess and monitor signs and symptoms related to these changes. Age-related changes in the mouth include loss of teeth, diminished number of taste buds, decreased production of saliva, and atrophy of gingival tissue. These changes cause difficulty in chewing and swallowing. Changes in the esophagus include decreased muscle tone and weakness in the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to reflux and heartburn.

Decreased gastric motility leads to delayed gastric emptying. Atrophy of the mucosa causes a decrease in HCl production, and this can lead to food intolerances, malabsorption, or decrease in vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorption. Changes in the small and large intestine are evidenced largely by decreased motility and decreased transit time, which lead to complaints of indigestion and constipation. Other changes lead to decreased absorption of nutrients (dextrose, fats, calcium, and iron) in the large intestine. The nerve supply to the anal sphincter is sometimes impaired, causing fecal incontinence (Luekenotte, 2000).

Small Intestine
- Atrophy of muscle and mucosal surfaces
- Thinning of villi and epithelial cells

Large Intestine

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are caring for a 24 -year-old male patient who was admitted for acute abdominal pain. He has just arrived from the emergency room and is being scheduled for tests this afternoon. What laboratory tests would you expect to be ordered? He is scheduled for a CT and ultrasound in 2 hours. What preparation is needed for these tests? What preprocedure education is needed?
2. A 58-year-old patient assigned to you this morning has just left to go to the Endoscopy Suite, where she will undergo a colonoscopy. You know that your patient will receive moderate sedation during the procedure and that she will be returned to your care once she is fully alert. What should you anticipate in the course of recovery for your patient after the colonoscopy? What medications might be used for the moderate sedation, and what effects of those medications would you expect to see during the recovery period? Describe the potential complications that could occur and what you will monitor. What are the goals for care during this period?

\section*{Management of Patients With Oral and Esophageal Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with conditions of the oral cavity.
2. Describe the relationship of dental hygiene and dental problems to nutrition.
3. Describe the nursing management of patients with abnormalities of the lips, gums, teeth, mouth, and salivary glands.
4. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with cancer of the oral cavity.
5. Identify the physical and psychosocial long-term needs of patients with oral cancer.
6. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients undergoing neck dissection.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with conditions of the esophagus.
8. Describe the various conditions of the esophagus and their clinical manifestations and management.

Beecause digestion normally begins in the mouth, adequate nutrition is related to good dental health and the general condition of the mouth. Any discomfort or adverse condition in the oral cavity can affect a person's nutritional status. Changes in the oral cavity may influence the type and amount of food ingested as well as the degree to which food particles are properly mixed with salivary enzymes. Disease of the mouth or tongue can interfere with speech and thus affect communication and self-image. Esophageal problems related to swallowing can also adversely affect food and fluid intake, thereby jeopardizing general health and well-being. Given the close relationship between adequate nutritional intake and the structures of the upper gastrointestinal tract (lips, mouth, teeth, pharynx, esophagus), health teaching can help prevent disorders associated with these structures.

The oral cavity, which includes the lips, mouth, and gums, is subject to many disorders and diseases. Table 35-1 reviews common abnormalities, their possible causes, and nursing management. As identified in a report by the U.S. Surgeon General in 2000 , oral health is a very important component of a person's physical and psychological sense of well-being. Severe periodontal disease affects approximately $14 \%$ of adults 45 to 64 years of age and $23 \%$ of adults 65 to 74 years of age (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2000).

\section*{Disorders of the Teeth}

\section*{DENTAL PLAQUE AND CARIES}

Tooth decay is an erosive process that begins with the action of bacteria on fermentable carbohydrates in the mouth, which produces acids that dissolve tooth enamel. The extent of damage to the teeth depends on the following:
- The presence of dental plaque
- The strength of the acids and the ability of the saliva to neutralize them
- The length of time the acids are in contact with the teeth
- The susceptibility of the teeth to decay

Dental plaque is a gluey, gelatin-like substance that adheres to the teeth. The initial action that causes damage to a tooth occurs under dental plaque.

Dental decay begins with a small hole, usually in a fissure (a break in the tooth's enamel) or in an area that is hard to clean. Left unchecked, the affected area penetrates the enamel into the dentin. Because dentin is not as hard as enamel, decay progresses more rapidly and in time reaches the pulp. When the blood, lymph vessels, and nerves are exposed, they become infected and an abscess may form, either within the tooth or at the tip of the root. Soreness and pain usually occur with an abscess. As the in-
fection continues, the patient's face may swell, and there may be pulsating pain. The dentist can determine by x-ray studies the extent of damage and the type of treatment needed. Treatment for dental caries includes fillings, dental implants, and extractions. If treatment is not successful, the tooth may need to be extracted. In general, dental decay is associated with young people, but older adults are subject to decay as well, particularly from drug-induced or age-related oral dryness (see the accompanying Gerontologic Considerations box).

\section*{Prevention}

Measures used to prevent and control dental caries include practicing effective mouth care, reducing the intake of starches and sugars (refined carbohydrates), applying fluoride to the teeth or drinking fluoridated water, refraining from smoking, controlling diabetes, and using pit and fissure sealants (Chart 35-1).

\section*{MOUTH CARE}

Healthy teeth must be conscientiously and effectively cleaned on a daily basis. Brushing and flossing are particularly effective in mechanically breaking up the bacterial plaque that collects around teeth.

Normal mastication (chewing) and the normal flow of saliva also aid greatly in keeping the teeth clean. Because many ill patients do not eat adequate amounts of food, they produce less saliva, which in turn reduces this natural tooth cleaning process. The nurse may need to assume the responsibility for brushing the patient's teeth. In any case, merely wiping the patient's mouth and teeth with a swab is ineffective. The most effective method is mechanical cleansing (brushing). If brushing is impossible, it is better to wipe the teeth with a gauze pad, then have the patient swish an antiseptic mouthwash several times before expectorating into an emesis basin. A soft-bristled toothbrush is more effective than a sponge or foam stick. The lips may be coated with a watersoluble gel to prevent drying.

\section*{DIET}

Dental caries may be prevented by decreasing the amount of sugar and starch in the diet. Patients who snack should be encouraged to choose less cariogenic alternatives, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, cheeses, or plain yogurt.

\section*{FLUORIDATION}

Fluoridation of public water supplies has been found to decrease dental caries. Some areas of the country have natural fluoridation; other communities have added fluoride to public water supplies. Fluoridation may be achieved also by having a dentist apply a concentrated gel or solution to the teeth, adding fluoride to home
achalasia: absent or ineffective peristalsis (wavelike contraction) of the distal esophagus accompanied by failure of the esophageal sphincter to relax in response to swallowing
dysphagia: difficulty swallowing gastroesophageal reflux: back-flow of gastric or duodenal contents into the esophagus

\section*{PIT AND FISSURE SEALANTS}

The occlusal surfaces of the teeth have pits and fissures, areas that are prone to caries. Some dentists apply a special coating to fill and

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations \\ Oral Problems}

Many medications taken by the elderly cause dry mouth, which is uncomfortable, impairs communication, and increases the risk of oral infection. These medications include the following:
- Diuretics
- Antihypertensive medications
- Anti-inflammatory agents
- Antidepressant medications

Poor dentition can exacerbate problems of aging, such as
- Decreased food intake
- Loss of appetite
- Social isolation
- Increased susceptibility to systemic infection (from periodontal disease)
- Trauma to the oral cavity secondary to thinner, less vascular oral mucous membranes
seal these areas from potential exposure to cariogenic processes. These sealants last up to 7 years.

\section*{DENTOALVEOLAR ABSCESS OR PERIAPICAL ABSCESS}

Periapical abscess, more commonly referred to as an abscessed tooth, involves the collection of pus in the apical dental periosteum (fibrous membrane supporting the tooth structure) and
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-474.jpg?height=126&width=176&top_left_y=2008&top_left_x=1120)

\section*{Chart 35-1 - PATIENT EDUCATION Preventive Oral Hygiene}
- Brush teeth using a soft toothbrush at least two times daily. Hold toothbrush at a 45-degree angle between the brush and the gums and teeth. A small brush is better than a large brush. Gums and tongue surface should be brushed.
- Floss at least once daily.
- Use an antiplaque mouth rinse.
- Visit a dentist at least every 6 months, or when you have a chipped tooth, a lost filling, an oral sore that persists longer than 2 weeks, or a toothache.
- Avoid alcohol and tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco.
- Maintain adequate nutrition and avoid sweets.
- Replace toothbrush at first signs of wear, usually every 2 months.
the tissue surrounding the apex of the tooth (where it is suspended in the jaw bone). The abscess has two forms: acute and chronic. Acute periapical abscess is usually secondary to a suppurative pulpitis (a pus-producing inflammation of the dental pulp) that arises from an infection extending from dental caries. The infection of the dental pulp extends through the apical foramen of the tooth to form an abscess around the apex.

Chronic dentoalveolar abscess is a slowly progressive infectious process. It differs from the acute form in that the process may progress to a fully formed abscess without the patient's knowing it. The infection eventually leads to a "blind dental abscess," which is really a periapical granuloma. It may enlarge to as much as 1 cm in diameter. It is often discovered on x-ray films and is treated by extraction or root canal therapy, often with apicectomy (excision of the apex of the tooth root).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The abscess produces a dull, gnawing, continuous pain, often with a surrounding cellulitis and edema of the adjacent facial structures, and mobility of the involved tooth. The gum opposite the apex of the tooth is usually swollen on the cheek side. Swelling and cellulitis of the facial structures may make it difficult for the patient to open the mouth. In well-developed abscesses, there may be a systemic reaction, fever, and malaise.

\section*{Management}

In the early stages of an infection, a dentist or dental surgeon may perform a needle aspiration or drill an opening into the pulp chamber to relieve tension and pain and to provide drainage. Usually, the infection will have progressed to a periapical abscess. Drainage is provided by an incision through the gingiva down to the jawbone. Pus (purulent material) escapes under pressure. This procedure is commonly performed in the dentist's office, but it may be performed in an outpatient surgery center or a same-day surgery department. After the inflammatory reaction has subsided, the tooth may be extracted or root canal therapy performed. Antibiotics may be prescribed.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse assesses the patient for bleeding after treatment and instructs the patient to use a warm saline or warm water mouth rinse to keep the area clean. The patient is also instructed to take antibiotics and analgesics as prescribed, to advance from a liquid diet to a soft diet as tolerated, and to keep follow-up appointments.

\section*{MALOCCLUSION}

Malocclusion is a misalignment of the teeth of the upper and lower dental arcs when the jaws are closed. Malocclusion can be inherited or acquired (from thumb-sucking, trauma, or some medical conditions). Malocclusion makes the teeth difficult to clean and can lead to decay, gum disease, and excess wear on supporting bone and gum tissues. About $50 \%$ of the population has some form of malocclusion. Correction of malocclusion requires an orthodontist with special training, a patient who is motivated and cooperative, and adequate time. Most treatments begin when the patient has shed the last primary tooth and the last permanent successor has erupted, usually at about 12 or 13 years of age, but treatment may occur in adulthood. Preventive orthodontics may be started at age 5 years if malocclusion is diagnosed early. The need for teeth
straightening in adolescence is reduced if preventive orthodontics is started with the primary teeth.

\section*{Management}

People with malocclusion have an obviously misaligned bite or crooked, crowded, widely spaced, or protruding teeth. To realign the teeth, the orthodontist gradually forces the teeth into a new location by using wires or plastic bands (braces). These devices may be unattractive, but this psychological burden must be overcome if good results are to be achieved. In the final phase of treatment, a retaining device is worn for several hours each day to support the tissues as they adjust to the new alignment of the teeth.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient must practice meticulous oral hygiene, and the nurse encourages the patient to persist in this important part of the treatment. An adolescent undergoing orthodontic correction who is admitted to the hospital for some other problem may have to be reminded to continue wearing the retainer (if it does not interfere with the problem requiring hospitalization).

\section*{Disorders of the Jaw}

Abnormal conditions affecting the mandible (jaw) and of the temporomandibular joint (which connects the mandible to the temporal bone at the side of the head in front of the ear) include congenital malformation, fracture, chronic dislocation, cancer, and syndromes characterized by pain and limited motion. Temporomandibular disorders and jaw surgery (a treatment common in many structural abnormalities or cancer of the jaw) are presented in this section.

\section*{TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDERS}

Temporomandibular disorders are categorized as follows (National Oral Health Information Clearinghouse, 2000):
- Myofascial pain-a discomfort in the muscles controlling jaw function and in neck and shoulder muscles
- Internal derangement of the joint-a dislocated jaw, a displaced disc, or an injured condyle
- Degenerative joint disease-rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis in the jaw joint
Diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders remain somewhat ambiguous, but the condition is thought to affect about 10 million people in the United States. Misalignment of the joints in the jaw and other problems associated with the ligaments and muscles of mastication are thought to result in tissue damage and muscle tenderness. Suggested causes include arthritis of the jaw, head injury, trauma or injury to the jaw or joint, stress, and malocclusion (although research does not support malocclusion as a cause).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients have pain ranging from a dull ache to throbbing, debilitating pain that can radiate to the ears, teeth, neck muscles, and facial sinuses. They often have restricted jaw motion and locking of
the jaw. They may hear clicking and grating noises, and chewing and swallowing may be difficult. Depression may occur in response to these symptoms.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is based on the patient's subjective symptoms of pain, limitations in range of motion, dysphagia, difficulty chewing, difficulty with speech, or hearing difficulties. Magnetic resonance imaging, x-ray studies, and an arthrogram may be performed.

\section*{Management}

Although some practitioners think the role of stress in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders is overrated, patient education in stress management may be helpful (to reduce grinding and clenching of teeth). Patients may also benefit from range-of-motion exercises. Pain management measures may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with the possible addition of opioids, muscle relaxants, or mild antidepressants. Occasionally, a bite plate or splint (plastic guard worn over the upper and lower teeth) may be worn to protect teeth from grinding; however, this is a short-term therapy. Conservative and reversible treatment is recommended. If irreversible surgical options are recommended, the patient is encouraged to seek a second opinion.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Correction of mandibular structural abnormalities may require surgery involving repositioning or reconstruction of the jaw. Simple fractures of the mandible without displacement, resulting from a blow on the chin, and planned surgical interventions, as in the correction of long or short jaw syndrome, may require treatment by these means. Jaw reconstruction may be necessary in the aftermath of trauma from a severe injury or cancer, both of which can cause tissue and bone loss.

Mandibular fractures are usually closed fractures. Rigid plate fixation (insertion of metal plates and screws into the bone to approximate and stabilize the bone) is the current treatment of choice in many cases of mandibular fracture and in some mandibular reconstructive surgery procedures. Bone grafting may be performed to replace structural defects using bones from the patient's own ilium, ribs, or cranial sites. Rib tissue may also be harvested from cadaver donors.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient who has had rigid fixation should be instructed not to chew food in the first 1 to 4 weeks after surgery. A liquid diet is recommended, and dietary counseling should be obtained to ensure optimal caloric and protein intake.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

The patient needs specific guidelines for mouth care and feeding. Any irritated areas in the mouth should be reported to the physician. The importance of keeping scheduled appointments for assessing the stability of the fixation appliance is emphasized.

Consultation with a dietitian may be indicated so that the patient and family can learn about foods that are high in essential nutrients and ways in which these foods can be prepared so that they can be consumed through a straw or spoon, while remaining palatable. Nutritional supplements may be recommended.

\section*{Disorders of the Salivary Glands}

The salivary glands consist of the parotid glands, one on each side of the face below the ear; the submandibular and sublingual glands, both in the floor of the mouth; and the buccal gland, beneath the lips. About 1200 mL of saliva are produced daily. The glands' primary functions are lubrication, protection against harmful bacteria, and digestion.

\section*{PAROTITIS}

Parotitis (inflammation of the parotid gland) is the most common inflammatory condition of the salivary glands, although inflammation can occur in the other salivary glands as well. Mumps (epidemic parotitis), a communicable disease caused by viral infection and most commonly affecting children, is an inflammation of a salivary gland, usually the parotid.

Elderly, acutely ill, or debilitated people with decreased salivary flow from general dehydration or medications are at high risk for parotitis. The infecting organisms travel from the mouth through the salivary duct. The organism is usually Staphylococcus aureus (except in mumps). The onset of this complication is sudden, with an exacerbation of both the fever and the symptoms of the primary condition. The gland swells and becomes tense and tender. The patient feels pain in the ear, and swollen glands interfere with swallowing. The swelling increases rapidly, and the overlying skin soon becomes red and shiny.

Preventive measures are essential and include advising the patient to have necessary dental work performed before surgery. In addition, maintaining adequate nutritional and fluid intake, good oral hygiene, and discontinuing medications (eg, tranquilizers, diuretics) that can diminish salivation may help prevent the condition. If parotitis occurs, antibiotic therapy is necessary. Analgesics may also be prescribed to control pain. If antibiotic therapy is not effective, the gland may need to be drained by a surgical procedure known as parotidectomy. This procedure may be necessary to treat chronic parotitis.

\section*{SIALADENITIS}

Sialadenitis (inflammation of the salivary glands) may be caused by dehydration, radiation therapy, stress, malnutrition, salivary gland calculi (stones), or improper oral hygiene. The inflammation is associated with infection by S. aureus, Streptococcus viridans, or pneumococcus. In hospitalized or institutionalized patients the infecting organism may be methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (McQuone, 1999). Symptoms include pain, swelling, and purulent discharge. Antibiotics are used to treat infections. Massage, hydration, and corticosteroids frequently cure the problem. Chronic sialadenitis with uncontrolled pain is treated by surgical drainage of the gland or excision of the gland and its duct.

\section*{SALIVARY CALCULUS (SIALOLITHIASIS)}

Sialolithiasis, or salivary calculi (stones), usually occurs in the submandibular gland. Salivary gland ultrasonography or sialography (x-ray studies filmed after the injection of a radiopaque substance into the duct) may be required to demonstrate obstruction of the duct by stenosis. Salivary calculi are formed mainly from calcium phosphate. If located within the gland, the calculi are irregular and vary in diameter from 3 to 30 mm . Calculi in the duct are small and oval.

Calculi within the salivary gland itself cause no symptoms unless infection arises; however, a calculus that obstructs the gland's duct causes sudden, local, and often colicky pain, which is abruptly relieved by a gush of saliva. This characteristic symptom is often disclosed in the patient's health history. On physical assessment, the gland is swollen and quite tender, the stone itself can be palpable, and its shadow may be seen on x-ray films.

The calculus can be extracted fairly easily from the duct in the mouth. Sometimes, enlargement of the ductal orifice permits the stone to pass spontaneously. Occasionally lithotripsy, a procedure that uses shock waves to disintegrate the stone, may be used instead of surgical extraction for parotid stones and smaller submandibular stones. Lithotripsy requires no anesthesia, sedation, or analgesia. Side effects can include local hemorrhage and swelling. Surgery may be necessary to remove the gland if symptoms and calculi recur repeatedly.

\section*{NEOPLASMS}

Although they are uncommon, neoplasms (tumors or growths) of almost any type may develop in the salivary gland. Tumors occur more often in the parotid gland. The incidence of salivary gland tumors is similar in men and women. Risk factors include prior exposure to radiation to the head and neck. Diagnosis is based on the health history and physical examination and the results of fine needle aspiration biopsy.

Management of salivary gland tumors evokes controversy, but the common procedure involves partial excision of the gland, along with all of the tumor and a wide margin of surrounding tissue. Dissection is carefully performed to preserve the seventh cranial nerve (facial nerve), although it may not be possible to preserve the nerve if the tumor is extensive. If the tumor is malignant, radiation therapy may follow surgery. Radiation therapy alone may be a treatment choice for tumors that are thought to be contained or if there is risk of facial nerve damage from surgical intervention. Chemotherapy is usually used for palliative purposes. Local recurrences are common, and the recurrent growth usually is more aggressive than the original. It has also been observed that patients with salivary gland tumors have an increased incidence of second primary cancers (Bull, 2001).

\section*{Cancer of the Oral Cavity}

Cancers of the oral cavity, which can occur in any part of the mouth or throat, are curable if discovered early. These cancers are associated with the use of alcohol and tobacco. The combination of alcohol and tobacco seems to have a synergistic carcinogenic effect. About $95 \%$ of cases of oral cancer occur in people older than 40 years of age, but the incidence is increasing in men younger than age 30 because of the use of smokeless tobacco, especially snuff (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002).

Cancer of the oral cavity accounts for less than $2 \%$ of all cancer deaths in the United States. Men are afflicted more often than women; however, the incidence of oral cancer in women is increasing, possibly because they use tobacco and alcohol more frequently than they did in the past. The 5-year survival rate for cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx is $55 \%$ for whites and $33 \%$ for African Americans. Of the 7400 annual deaths from oral cancer, the distribution by site is estimated as follows: tongue, 1700; mouth, 2000; pharynx, 2100; other, 1600 (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures, 2002).

Chronic irritation by a warm pipestem or prolonged exposure to the sun and wind may predispose a person to lip cancer. Predisposing factors for other oral cancers are exposure to tobacco (including smokeless tobacco), ingestion of alcohol, dietary deficiency, and ingestion of smoked meats.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Malignancies of the oral cavity are usually squamous cell cancers. Any area of the oropharynx can be a site for malignant growths, but the lips, the lateral aspects of the tongue, and the floor of the mouth are most commonly affected.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many oral cancers produce few or no symptoms in the early stages. Later, the most frequent symptom is a painless sore or mass that will not heal. A typical lesion in oral cancer is a painless indurated (hardened) ulcer with raised edges. Tissue from any ulcer of the oral cavity that does not heal in 2 weeks should be examined through biopsy. As the cancer progresses, the patient may complain of tenderness; difficulty in chewing, swallowing, or speaking; coughing of blood-tinged sputum; or enlarged cervical lymph nodes.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic evaluation consists of an oral examination as well as an assessment of the cervical lymph nodes to detect possible metastases. Biopsies are performed on suspicious lesions (those that have not healed in 2 weeks). High-risk areas include the buccal mucosa and gingiva for people who use snuff or smoke cigars or pipes. For those who smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, high-risk areas include the floor of the mouth, the ventrolateral tongue, and the soft palate complex (soft palate, anterior and posterior tonsillar area, uvula, and the area behind the molar and tongue junction).

\section*{Medical Management}

Management varies with the nature of the lesion, the preference of the physician, and patient choice. Surgical resection, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these therapies may be effective.

In cancer of the lip, small lesions are usually excised liberally; larger lesions involving more than one third of the lip may be more appropriately treated by radiation therapy because of superior cosmetic results. The choice depends on the extent of the lesion and what is necessary to cure the patient while preserving the best appearance. Tumors larger than 4 cm often recur.

Cancer of the tongue may be treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy to preserve organ function and maintain quality of life. A combination of radioactive interstitial implants (surgical implantation of a radioactive source into the tissue adjacent to or at the tumor site) and external beam radiation may be used. If the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, the surgeon may perform a neck dissection. Surgical treatments leave a less functional tongue; surgical procedures include hemiglossectomy (surgical removal of half of the tongue) and total glossectomy (removal of the tongue).

Often cancer of the oral cavity has metastasized through the extensive lymphatic channel in the neck region (Fig. 35-1), requiring a neck dissection and reconstructive surgery of the oral

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
cavity. A common reconstructive technique involves use of a radial forearm free flap (a thin layer of skin from the forearm along with the radial artery).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse assesses the patient's nutritional status preoperatively, and a dietary consultation may be necessary. The patient may require enteral (through the intestine) or parenteral (intravenous) feedings before and after surgery to maintain adequate nutrition. If a radial graft is to be performed, an Allen test on the donor arm must be performed to ensure that the ulnar artery is patent and can provide blood flow to the hand after removal of the radial artery. The Allen test is performed by asking the patient to make a fist and then manually compressing the ulnar artery. The patient is then asked to open the hand into a relaxed, slightly flexed position. The palm will be pale. Pressure on the ulnar artery is released. If the ulnar artery is patent, the palm will flush within about 3 to 5 seconds.

Postoperatively, the nurse assesses for a patent airway. The patient may be unable to manage oral secretions, making suctioning necessary. If grafting was included in the surgery, suctioning must be performed with care to prevent damage to the graft. The graft is assessed postoperatively for viability. Although color should be assessed (white may indicate arterial occlusion, and blue mottling may indicate venous congestion), it can be difficult to assess the graft by looking into the mouth. A Doppler ultrasound device may be used to locate the radial pulse at the graft site and to assess graft perfusion.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH CONDITIONS OF THE ORAL CAVITY}

\section*{Assessment}

Obtaining a health history allows the nurse to determine the patient's learning needs concerning preventive oral hygiene and to identify symptoms requiring medical evaluation. The history includes questions about the patient's normal brushing and flossing routine; frequency of dental visits; awareness of any lesions or irritated areas in the mouth, tongue, or throat; recent history of sore throat or bloody sputum; discomfort caused by certain foods; daily food intake; use of alcohol and tobacco, including smokeless chewing tobacco; and the need to wear dentures or a partial plate. For more information about dentures, see the accompanying Gerontologic Considerations box.

A careful physical assessment follows the health history. Both the internal and the external structures of the mouth and throat are inspected and palpated. Dentures and partial plates are removed to ensure a thorough inspection of the mouth. In general, the examination can be accomplished by using a bright light source (penlight) and a tongue depressor. Gloves are worn to palpate the tongue and any abnormalities.

\section*{LIPS}

The examination begins with inspection of the lips for moisture, hydration, color, texture, symmetry, and the presence of ulcerations or fissures. The lips should be moist, pink, smooth, and symmetric. The patient is instructed to open the mouth wide; a tongue blade is then inserted to expose the buccal mucosa for an assessment of color and lesions. Stensen's duct of each parotid gland is visible as a small red dot in the buccal mucosa next to the upper molars.

\section*{GUMS}

The gums are inspected for inflammation, bleeding, retraction, and discoloration. The odor of the breath is also noted. The hard palate is examined for color and shape.

\section*{TONGUE}

The dorsum (back) of the tongue is inspected for texture, color, and lesions. A thin white coat and large, vallate papillae in a "V" formation on the distal portion of the dorsum of the tongue are

\section*{gerontologic considerations \\ Denture Care}

Many older adults wear dentures. Mouth care and regular checkups remain part of the denture-wearing older adult's health promotion activities.
- Brush dentures twice a day.
- Remove dentures at night and soak them in water or a denture product. (Never put dentures in hot water, because they may warp.)
- Rinse mouth with warm salt water in the morning, after meals, and at bedtime.
- Clean well under partial dentures, where food particles tend to get caught.
- Consume nonsticky foods that have been cut into small pieces; chew slowly.
- See dentist regularly to assess and readjust fit.
normal findings. The patient is instructed to protrude the tongue and move it laterally. This provides the examiner with an opportunity to estimate the tongue's size as well as its symmetry and strength (to assess the integrity of the 12th cranial nerve [hypoglossal]).

Further inspection of the ventral surface of the tongue and the floor of the mouth is accomplished by asking the patient to touch the roof of the mouth with the tip of the tongue. Any lesions of the mucosa or any abnormalities involving the frenulum or superficial veins on the undersurface of the tongue are assessed for location, size, color, and pain. This is a common area for oral cancer, which presents as a white or red plaque, an indurated ulcer, or a warty growth.

A tongue blade is used to depress the tongue for adequate visualization of the pharynx. It is pressed firmly beyond the midpoint of the tongue; proper placement avoids a gagging response. The patient is told to tip the head back, open the mouth wide, take a deep breath, and say "ah." Often this flattens the posterior tongue and briefly allows a full view of the tonsils, uvula, and posterior pharynx (Fig. 35-2). These structures are inspected for color, symmetry, and evidence of exudate, ulceration, or enlargement. Normally, the uvula and soft palate rise symmetrically with a deep inspiration or "ah"; this indicates an intact vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve).

A complete assessment of the oral cavity is essential because many disorders, such as cancer, diabetes, and immunosuppressive conditions resulting from medication therapy or AIDS, may be manifested by changes in the oral cavity. The neck is examined for enlarged lymph nodes (adenopathy).

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on all the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Impaired oral mucous membrane related to a pathologic condition, infection, or chemical or mechanical trauma (eg, medications, ill-fitting dentures)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-479.jpg?height=842&width=840&top_left_y=1718&top_left_x=117}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 35-2 Structures of the mouth, including the tongue and palate.}
\end{figure}
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inability to ingest adequate nutrients secondary to oral or dental conditions
- Disturbed body image related to a physical change in appearance resulting from a disease condition or its treatment
- Fear of pain and social isolation related to disease or change in physical appearance
- Pain related to oral lesion or treatment
- Impaired verbal communication related to treatment
- Risk for infection related to disease or treatment
- Deficient knowledge about disease process and treatment plan

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include improved condition of the oral mucous membrane, improved nutritional intake, attainment of a positive self-image, relief of pain, identification of alternative communication methods, prevention of infection, and understanding of the disease and its treatment.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING MOUTH CARE}

The nurse instructs the patient in the importance and techniques of preventive mouth care. If a patient cannot tolerate brushing or flossing, an irrigating solution of 1 teaspoon of baking soda to 8 ounces of warm water, half-strength hydrogen peroxide, or normal saline solution is recommended. The nurse reinforces the need to perform oral care and provides such care to patients who are unable to provide it for themselves.

If a bacterial or fungal infection is present, the nurse administers the appropriate medications and instructs the patient in how to administer the medications at home. The nurse monitors the patient's physical and psychological response to treatment.

Xerostomia, dryness of the mouth, is a frequent sequela of oral cancer, particularly when the salivary glands have been exposed to radiation or major surgery. It is also seen in patients who are receiving psychopharmacologic agents, patients with HIV infection, and patients who cannot close the mouth and as a result become mouth-breathers. To minimize this problem, the patient is advised to avoid dry, bulky, and irritating foods and fluids, as well as alcohol and tobacco. The patient is also encouraged to increase intake of fluids (when not contraindicated) and to use a humidifier during sleep. The use of synthetic saliva, a moisturizing antibacterial gel such as Oral Balance, or a saliva production stimulant such as Salagen may be helpful.

Stomatitis, or mucositis, which involves inflammation and breakdown of the oral mucosa, is often a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Prophylactic mouth care is started when the patient begins receiving treatment; however, mucositis may become so severe that a break in treatment is necessary. If a patient receiving radiation therapy has poor dentition, extraction of the teeth before radiation treatment in the oral cavity is often initiated to prevent infection. Many radiation therapy centers recommend the use of fluoride treatments for patients receiving radiation to the head and neck.

\section*{ENSURING ADEQUATE FOOD AND FLUID INTAKE}

The patient's weight, age, and level of activity are recorded to determine whether nutritional intake is adequate. A daily calorie count may be necessary to determine the exact quantity of food and fluid ingested. The frequency and pattern of eating are recorded to determine whether any psychosocial or physiologic factors are

affecting ingestion. The nurse recommends changes in the consistency of foods and the frequency of eating, based on the disorder and the patient's preferences. Consultation with a dietitian can be helpful. The goal is to help the patient attain and maintain desirable body weight and level of energy, as well as to promote the healing of tissue.

\section*{SUPPORTING A POSITIVE SELF-IMAGE}

A patient who has a disfiguring oral condition or has undergone disfiguring surgery may experience an alteration in self-image. The patient is encouraged to verbalize the perceived change in body appearance and to realistically discuss actual changes or losses. The nurse offers support while the patient verbalizes fears and negative feelings (withdrawal, depression, anger). The nurse listens attentively and determines whether the patient's needs are primarily psychosocial or cognitive-perceptual. This determination will help the nurse to individualize a plan of care. The patient's strengths, achievements, and positive attributes are reinforced.

The nurse should determine the patient's anxieties concerning relationships with others. Referral to support groups, a psychiatric liaison nurse, a social worker, or a spiritual advisor may be useful in helping the patient to cope with anxieties and fears. Emphasizing that the patient's worth is not diminished by a physical change in a body part can be a helpful approach. The patient's progress toward development of positive self-esteem is documented. The nurse should be alert to signs of grieving and should record emotional changes. By providing acceptance and support, the nurse encourages the patient to verbalize feelings.

\section*{MINIMIZING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Oral lesions can be painful. Strategies to reduce pain and discomfort include avoiding foods that are spicy, hot, or hard (eg, pretzels, nuts). The patient is instructed about mouth care. It may be necessary to provide the patient with an analgesic such as viscous lidocaine (Xylocaine Viscous $2 \%$ ) or opioids, as prescribed. The nurse can reduce the patient's fear of pain by providing information about pain control methods.

\section*{PROMOTING EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION}

Verbal communication may be impaired by radical surgery for oral cancer. It is therefore vital to assess the patient's ability to communicate in writing before surgery. Pen and paper are provided postoperatively to patients who can use them to communicate. A communication board with commonly used words or pictures is obtained preoperatively and given after surgery to patients who cannot write so that they may point to needed items. A speech therapist is also consulted postoperatively.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Leukopenia (a decrease in white blood cells) may result from radiation, chemotherapy, AIDS, and some medications used to treat HIV infection. Leukopenia reduces defense mechanisms, increasing the risk for infections. Malnutrition, which is also common among these patients, may further decrease resistance to infection. If the patient has diabetes, the risk of infection is further increased.

Laboratory results should be evaluated frequently and the patient's temperature checked every 4 to 8 hours for an elevation that may indicate infection. Visitors who might transmit microorganisms are prohibited because the patient's immunologic system is depressed. Sensitive skin tissues are protected from trauma to maintain skin integrity and prevent infection. Aseptic technique is necessary when changing dressings. Desquamation (shedding of the epidermis) is a reaction to radiation therapy that causes dryness and itching and can lead to a break in skin integrity and subsequent infection.

As described earlier, adequate nutrition is helpful in preventing infection. Signs of wound infection (redness, swelling, drainage, tenderness) are reported to the physician. Antibiotics may be prescribed prophylactically.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient who is recovering from treatment of an oral condition is instructed about mouth care, nutrition, prevention of infection, and signs and symptoms of complications (Chart 35-2). Methods of preparing nutritious foods that are seasoned according to the patient's preference and at the preferred temperature are explained. For some patients, it may be more convenient to use commercial baby foods than to prepare liquid and soft diets. The patient who cannot take foods orally may receive enteral or parenteral nutrition; the administration of these feedings is explained and demonstrated to the patient and the care provider.

For patients with cancer, instructions are provided in the use and care of any prostheses. The importance of keeping dressings clean is emphasized, as is the need for conscientious oral hygiene.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The need for ongoing care in the home depends on the patient's condition. The patient, the family members or others responsible for home care, the nurse, and other health care professionals (eg, speech therapist, nutritionist, psychologist) work together to prepare an individual plan of care.

If suctioning of the mouth or tracheostomy tube is required, the necessary equipment is obtained and the patient and care providers
are taught how to use it. Considerations include the control of odors and humidification of the home to keep secretions moist. The patient and the care providers are taught how to assess for obstruction, hemorrhage, and infection and what actions to take if they occur. The home care nurse may provide physical care, monitor for changes in the patient's physical status (eg, skin integrity, nutritional status, respiratory function), and assess the adequacy of pain control measures. The nurse also assesses the patient's and family's ability to manage incisions, drains, and feeding tubes and the use of recommended strategies for communication. The ability of the patient and family to accept physical, psychological, and role changes is assessed and addressed.

Follow-up visits to the physician are important to monitor the patient's condition and to determine the need for modifications in treatment and general care. The nurse reinforces instructions in an effort to promote the patient's self-care and comfort.

Because patients and their family members and health care providers tend to focus on the most obvious needs and issues, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of continuing health promotion and screening practices. Those patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past are educated about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers.

\section*{Neck Dissection}

Malignancies of the head and neck include those of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinus, and larynx (Fig. 35-3). (Laryngeal cancer is

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-481.jpg?height=1019&width=867&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=1025}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 35-3 Anatomy of the head and neck.}
\end{figure}
presented in Chapter 22.) These cancers account for fewer than $5 \%$ of all cancers. Depending on the location and stage, treatment may consist of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, or a combination of these modalities. Deaths from malignancies of the head and neck are primarily attributable not to recurrence at the primary site but to local-regional metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes in the neck. This often occurs by way of the lymphatics before the primary lesion has been treated. This local-regional metastasis is not amenable to surgical resection and responds poorly to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

A radical neck dissection involves removal of all cervical lymph nodes from the mandible to the clavicle and removal of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, and spinal accessory muscle on one side of the neck. The associated morbidities include shoulder drop and poor cosmesis (visible neck depression). Modified radical neck dissection, which preserves one or more of the nonlymphatic structures, is used more often. A selective neck dissection (in comparison to a radical dissection) preserves one or more of the lymph node groups, the internal jugular vein, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the spinal accessory nerve (Fig. 35-4).

Reconstructive techniques may be performed with a variety of grafts. A cutaneous flap (skin and subcutaneous tissue), such as the deltopectoral flap, may be used. A more frequently used graft for head and neck reconstruction is a myocutaneous flap (subcutaneous tissue, muscle and skin). The pectoralis major muscle is usually used. A microvascular free flap may be used for large defects. This involves the transfer of muscle, skin, or bone with an artery and vein to the area of reconstruction, using microinstrumentation. Areas used for a free flap include the scapula, the radial area of the forearm, or the fibula. The fibula, which provides a larger bone area, may be used if mandibular reconstruction is involved.

\end{figure}

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING A NECK DISSECTION}

\section*{Assessment}

Preoperatively, the patient's physical and psychological preparation for major surgery is assessed, along with his or her knowledge of the preoperative and postoperative procedures. Postoperatively, the patient is assessed for complications such as altered respiratory status, wound infection, and hemorrhage. As healing occurs, neck range of motion is assessed to determine whether there has been a decrease in range of motion due to nerve or muscle damage.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge about preoperative and postoperative procedures
- Ineffective airway clearance related to obstruction by mucus, hemorrhage, or edema
- Acute pain related to surgical incision
- Risk for infection related to surgical intervention secondary to decreased nutritional status, or immunosuppression from chemotherapy or radiation therapy
- Impaired tissue integrity secondary to surgery and grafting
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to disease process or treatment
- Situational low self-esteem related to diagnosis or prognosis
- Impaired verbal communication secondary to surgical resection
- Impaired physical mobility secondary to nerve injury

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential postoperative complications that may develop include the following:
- Hemorrhage
- Chyle fistula
- Nerve injury

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include participation in the treatment plan, maintenance of respiratory status, absence of infection, viability of the graft, maintenance of adequate intake of food and fluids, effective coping strategies, attainment of comfort, effective communication, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROVIDING PREOPERATIVE PATIENT EDUCATION}

Before surgery, the patient should be informed about the nature and extent of the surgery, and what the postoperative period will be like. The patient is encouraged to ask questions and to express concerns about the upcoming surgery and the expected results. During this exchange, the nurse has an opportunity to assess the patient's coping abilities, answer questions, and develop a plan for offering assistance. A sense of mutual understanding and rapport will make the postoperative experience less traumatic for the patient. The patient's expressions of concern, anxieties, and fears can guide the nurse in providing support postoperatively.

\section*{PROVIDING GENERAL POSTOPERATIVE CARE}

The general postoperative nursing interventions are similar to those presented in Chapter 20. For the patient who has had extensive neck surgery, specific postoperative interventions include maintenance of a patent airway and continuous assessment of respiratory status, wound care and oral hygiene, maintenance of adequate nutrition, and observation for hemorrhage or nerve injury.

\section*{MAINTAINING THE AIRWAY}

After the endotracheal tube or airway has been removed and the effects of the anesthesia have worn off, the patient may be placed in Fowler's position to facilitate breathing and promote comfort. This position also increases lymphatic and venous drainage, facilitates swallowing, and decreases venous pressure on the skin flaps.

In the immediate postoperative period, the nurse assesses for stridor (coarse, high-pitched sound on inspiration) by listening frequently over the trachea with a stethoscope. This finding must be reported immediately because it indicates obstruction of the airway. Signs of respiratory distress, such as dyspnea, cyanosis, changes in mental status, and changes in vital signs, are assessed because they may suggest edema, hemorrhage, inadequate oxygenation, or inadequate drainage.

Pneumonia may occur in the postoperative phase if pulmonary secretions are not removed. Coughing and deep breathing are encouraged to aid in the removal of secretions. The patient should assume a sitting position, with the nurse supporting the neck so that the patient can bring up excessive secretions. If this is ineffective, the patient's respiratory tract may have to be suctioned. Care is taken to protect the suture lines during suctioning. If a tracheostomy tube is in place, suctioning is performed through the tube. The patient may also be instructed on use of Yankauer suction (tonsil tip suction) to remove oral secretions. Temperature should not be taken orally.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Pain and the patient's fear of pain are assessed and managed. Patients with head and neck cancer often report less pain than patients with other types of cancer; however, the nurse needs to be aware that each person's pain experience is individual. The nurse administers analgesics as prescribed and assesses their effectiveness.

\section*{PROVIDING WOUND CARE}

Wound drainage tubes are usually inserted during surgery to prevent the collection of fluid subcutaneously. The drainage tubes are connected to portable suction device (eg, Jackson-Pratt), and the container is emptied periodically. Between 80 and 120 mL of serosanguineous secretions may drain over the first 24 hours. Excessive drainage may be indicative of a chyle fistula or hemorrhage (see later discussion). If dressings are present, they may need to be reinforced from time to time. Dressings are observed for evidence of hemorrhage and constriction, which impairs respiration and perfusion of the graft. The graft is assessed for color and temperature, and for the presence of a pulse if applicable, to determine viability. The graft should be pale pink and warm to the touch. The surgical incisions are also assessed for infection, which is reported immediately. Prophylactic antibiotics may be prescribed.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Nutritional status is assessed preoperatively; early intervention to correct nutritional imbalances may decrease the risk of postoperative complications. Frequently, nutrition is less than optimal because of inadequate intake, and the patient often requires enteral or parenteral supplements preoperatively to attain a positive nitrogen balance. This therapy may need to be continued postoperatively if the patient cannot take enough nutrients by mouth. Supplements (eg, Ensure, Sustacal) that are nutritionally dense may help reestablish a positive nitrogen balance. They may be taken enterally by mouth, by nasogastric feeding tube, or by gastrostomy feeding tube. (See the Plan of Nursing Care for further discussion.)

The patient who is able to chew may take food by mouth; the level of the patient's chewing ability will determine whether some diet modification (eg, soft, pureed, or liquid foods) is necessary. Food preferences should also be discussed with the patient. Oral care before eating may enhance the patient's appetite, and oral care after eating is important to prevent infection and dental caries. Most patients are able to maintain and gain weight.

\section*{SUPPORTING COPING MEASURES}

Preoperatively, information about the planned surgery is given to the patient and family. The psychological postoperative nursing intervention is aimed at supporting the patient who has had a change in body image or who has major concerns regarding the prognosis. The patient may have difficulty communicating and may be concerned about his or her ability to breathe and swallow normally. The nurse enlists the support of family or friends in encouraging and reassuring the patient that adjusting to the results of this surgery will take time.

The person who has had extensive neck surgery often is sensitive about his or her appearance. This can occur when the operative area is covered by bulky dressings, when the incision line is visible, or later after healing has occurred but the appearance of the neck and possibly the lower face has been significantly altered. If the nurse accepts the patient's appearance and expresses a positive, optimistic attitude, the patient is more likely to be encouraged. The patient also needs an opportunity to express concerns regarding the success of the surgery and the prognosis. The American Cancer Society may be a resource to provide a volunteer to meet with the patient either preoperatively or postoperatively.

People with cancer of the head and neck frequently have used alcohol or tobacco before surgery; postoperatively, the patient is encouraged to abstain from these substances. Alternative methods of coping need to be explored. A referral to Alcoholics Anonymous may be appropriate.

\section*{PROMOTING EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION}

If a laryngectomy was performed, the nurse explores other methods of communicating with the patient and obtains a consultation with a speech/language therapist. Alternatives to verbal communication may include use of a pencil and paper or pointing to needed items on a picture pad. Alternative speech techniques, such as an electrolarynx (a mechanical device held against the neck) or esophageal speech, may be taught by a speech/language therapist.

\section*{MAINTAINING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Excision of muscles and nerves results in weakness at the shoulder that can cause shoulder drop, a forward curvature of the shoulder. Many problems can be avoided with a conscientious exercise program. These exercises are usually begun after the drains have been removed and the neck incision is sufficiently healed. The purpose of the exercises depicted in Figure 35-5 is to promote maximal shoulder function and neck motion after surgery. Physical therapists and occupational therapists can assist patients in performing these exercises.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Hemorrhage}

Hemorrhage may occur from carotid artery rupture as a result of necrosis of the graft or damage to the artery itself from tumor or infection. The following measures are indicated:
- Vital signs are assessed. Tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension may indicate hemorrhage and impending hypovolemic shock.
- The patient is instructed to avoid the Valsalva maneuver to prevent stress on the graft and carotid artery.
- Signs of impending rupture, such as high epigastric pain or discomfort, are reported.

FIGURE 35-5 Three rehabilitation exercises after head and neck surgery. The objective is to regain maximum shoulder function and neck motion after neck surgery. From Exercise for Radical Neck Surgery Patients. Head and Neck Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Hospital, New York, NY.
- Dressings and wound drainage are observed for excessive bleeding.
- If hemorrhage occurs, assistance is summoned immediately.
- Hemorrhage requires the continuous application of pressure to the bleeding site or major associated vessel.
- Although some advocate placing the patient in modified Trendelenburg position to maintain blood pressure, others recommend that the head of the patient's bed be elevated to maintain airway patency and prevent aspiration.
- A controlled, calm manner will allay the patient's anxiety.
- The surgeon is notified immediately, because a vascular or ligature tear requires surgical intervention.

\section*{Chyle Fistula}

A chyle fistula (milk-like drainage from the thoracic duct into the thoracic cavity) may develop as a result of damage to the thoracic duct during surgery. The diagnosis is made if there is excess drainage which has a $3 \%$ fat content and a specific gravity of 1.012 or greater. Treatment of a small leak ( 500 mL or less) includes application of a pressure dressing and a diet of mediumchain fatty acids or parenteral nutrition. Surgical intervention to repair the damaged duct is necessary for larger leaks.

\section*{Nerve Injury}

Nerve injury can occur if the cervical plexus or spinal accessory nerves are severed during surgery. Because lower facial paralysis may occur as a result of injury to the facial nerve, this complication is observed for and reported. Likewise, if the superior laryngeal nerve is damaged, the patient may have difficulty swallowing liquids and food because of the partial lack of sensation of the glottis. Speech therapy may be indicated to assist with the problems related to nerve injury.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient and care provider will require instructions about management of the wound, the dressing, and any drains that remain in place. Patients who require oral suctioning or who have a tracheostomy may be very anxious about their care at home; the transition to home can be eased if the care provider is given several opportunities to demonstrate the ability to meet the patient's needs (Chart 35-3).

If the patient cannot take food by mouth, detailed instructions and demonstration of enteral or parenteral feedings will be required. Education in techniques of effective oral hygiene is also important.

\section*{Continuing Care}

A referral for home care nursing may be necessary in the early period after discharge. The nurse will assess healing, ensure that feedings are being administered properly, and detect any complications. The home care nurse assesses the patient's adjustment to changes in physical appearance and status, ability to communicate, and ability to eat normally. Physical and speech therapy also may be continued at home.

The patient is given information regarding local support groups such as "I Can Cope" or "New Voice Club," if indicated. The local chapter of the American Cancer Society may be contacted for information and equipment needed for the patient.

The Plan of Nursing Care presents an overview of the care of a patient undergoing a neck dissection.

\section*{Disorders of the Esophagus}

The esophagus is a mucus-lined, muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It begins at the base of the pharynx and ends about 4 cm below the diaphragm. Its ability to transport food and fluid is facilitated by two sphincters. The upper esophageal sphincter, also called the hypopharyngeal sphincter, is located at the
junction of the pharynx and the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter, also called the gastroesophageal sphincter, is located at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach. An incompetent lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux (backward flow) of gastric contents. There is no serosal layer of the esophagus; therefore, if surgery is necessary, it is more difficult to perform suturing or anastomosis.

\section*{DYSPHAGIA}

Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) is the most common symptom of esophageal disease. This symptom may vary from an uncomfortable feeling that a bolus of food is caught in the upper esophagus (before it eventually passes into the stomach) to acute pain on swallowing (odynophagia). Obstruction of food (solid and soft) and even liquids may occur anywhere along the esophagus. Often the patient can indicate that the problem is located in the upper, middle, or lower third of the esophagus.

There are many pathologic conditions of the esophagus, including motility disorders (achalasia, diffuse spasm), gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernias, diverticula, perforation, foreign bodies, chemical burns, benign tumors, and carcinoma.

\section*{ACHALASIA}

Achalasia is absent or ineffective peristalsis of the distal esophagus, accompanied by failure of the esophageal sphincter to relax in response to swallowing. Narrowing of the esophagus just above the stomach results in a gradually increasing dilation of the esophagus in the upper chest. Achalasia may progress slowly and occurs most often in people 40 years of age or older.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The primary symptom of achalasia is difficulty in swallowing both liquids and solids. The patient has a sensation of food sticking in the lower portion of the esophagus. As the condition progresses, food is commonly regurgitated, either spontaneously or intentionally by the patient to relieve the discomfort produced by prolonged distention of the esophagus by food that will not pass into the stomach. The patient may also complain of chest pain and heartburn (pyrosis). Pain may or may not be associated with eating. There may be secondary pulmonary complications from aspiration of gastric contents.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

X-ray studies show esophageal dilation above the narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction. Barium swallow, computed tomography

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective airway clearance related to obstruction secondary to edema, hemorrhage, or inadequate wound drainage
Goal: Maintenance of normal respiratory function
1. Place the patient in Fowler's position.
1. Fowler's position facilitates expansion of the lungs because the diaphragm is pulled downward and the abdominal viscera are pulled away from the lungs. Breathing is promoted. This position also increases lymphatic and venous drainage, decreases swallowing, and decreases venous pressure on the graft. Regurgitation and aspiration of stomach contents are prevented postoperatively.
2. Monitor vital signs according to postoperative routine.
3. Auscultate breath sounds as needed. In the immediate postoperative period, place the stethoscope over the trachea to assess for stridor.
4. Encourage deep breathing and coughing. Place the patient in a sitting position and support the neck area with both hands.
5. Suction the airway as needed using sterile technique and a soft catheter.
6. Provide humidified air or oxygen if the patient has a tracheostomy.
2. Edema, hemorrhage, or inadequate drainage will alter heart rate and respirations. Tachypnea and restlessness may indicate respiratory distress.
3. Abnormal breath sounds may indicate ineffective ventilation, decreased perfusion, and fluid accumulation. Stridor, a harsh, high-pitched sound primarily heard on inspiration, indicates airway obstruction.
4. Deep breathing before coughing promotes expansion of the airways and a more forceful cough. The coughing mechanism assists airway cilia with removal of secretions. Splinting the incision during coughing reduces strain and promotes the expulsion of secretions by allowing deeper inspirations.
5. Suctioning assists in removal of secretions that the patient may be unable to cough up, thereby assisting with maintaining a patent airway.
6. Keeps secretions thin.
- Achieves a normal respiratory rate
- Breathes comfortably
- Avoids use of accessory muscles of respiration
- Maintains vital signs within normal range
- Shows evidence of normal breath sounds
- Coughs effectively
- Maintains a patent airway
- Does not develop a mucus plug

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for infection}

Goal: Absence of infection
1. Instruct the patient in preoperative and postoperative oral hygiene using slightly alkaline solutions such as 8 oz of water mixed with 1 teaspoon of baking soda, or normal saline solution, every 4 hours.
2. Monitor wound suction drainage.
1. Oral care decreases oral bacteria, thereby decreasing the risk of bacterial infection postoperatively. Hydrogen peroxide should not be used, because it may break down fresh granulation tissue.
2. Suction drainage negates the need for pressure dressings because the skin flaps are pulled down tightly. Drainage should be $80-120 \mathrm{~mL}$ of serosanguineous secretions for the first 24 hours; then the secretions should decrease daily. Continuous bloody drainage indicates small vessel oozing.
- Patient performs oral hygiene preoperatively and postoperatively every 4 hours
- Mouth remains clean
- Wound drains less than 200 mL of serosanguineous drainage on the first postoperative day
- No hematoma at skin graft
- Serosanguineous drainage is within normal limits
- Dressing remains intact with no constriction of airway or blood flow
- Wound and surrounding skin remain clean and free of infection
- Patient is afebrile with normal respirations and a normal heart rate
- Patient is alert and aware of surroundings

Nursing Diagnosis: Impaired skin integrity
Goal: Maintenance of intact skin and viability of graft
1. Assess condition of graft for viability.
1. Cyanotic, cool graft indicates possible
- Graft is pale pink in color and warm to necrosis. (Pale graft indicates arterial touch thrombosis; purple graft indicates venous
- Tissue blanches to gentle touch congestion.)
- Graft has pulse via Doppler ultrasound

2. Infected wound interferes with healing
- Patient does not have wound infection infection. and threatens the viability of the graft.

Nursing Diagnosis: Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to anorexia and dysphagia
Goal: Attainment/maintenance of adequate nutrition
1. Assess nutritional status preoperatively, consult with dietitian.
2. Administer tube feedings as prescribed. Keep head of bed elevated during feeding to prevent aspiration. Monitor for signs of tracheoesophageal fistula (feeding in tracheal secretions).
3. Provide oral hygiene before and after meals.
4. Assist with oral intake:
a. Offer easily chewed foods; mash or blenderize if necessary.
b. Suggest that the head be tilted to the unaffected side when swallowing.
c. Inquire whether privacy is desired when eating.
d. Provide altered eating utensils as needed.
1. Poor nutritional status preoperatively impairs wound healing and increases potential for infection.
2. A nasogastric tube may be in place for several days to administer enteral feedings.
3. Oral hygiene enhances appetite.
4. Soft-textured foods facilitate swallowing. Passage of food may be tolerated better when the head is tilted to the unaffected side. Self-feeding difficulties may cause embarrassment and interfere with intake quantity.
- Does not have weight loss greater than $10 \%$ of body weight. (If weight loss is greater than $10 \%$, supplements are given to maintain/increase weight and obtain positive nitrogen balance.)
- Tolerates tube feedings
- No signs of aspiration
- No sign of fistula
- Expresses a desire for food
- Swallows food easily
- Is comfortable eating alone or with others

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Situational low self-esteem and body image related to changes in appearance and alterations}
in communication

\section*{Goal: Attainment of positive self-image}

\section*{1. Assist the patient to communicate effectively:}
a. Provide materials for writing messages.
b. Make certain that the call bell is readily accessible.
c. Develop nonverbal ways to communicate (eg, finger-tapping, sign language, sign board).
d. Consult speech/language therapist.
2. Encourage verbalization of fears:
a. Provide time to listen.
b. Project a positive, optimistic attitude.
c. Reinforce reality.
d. Collaborate with family members to elicit their support and encouragement.
e. Consult support groups such as New Voice Club through the American Cancer Society.
3. Observe for facial paralysis.
4. Observe for excessive drooling.
5. Check for normal shoulder position and function.
6. Provide information on clothing/cosmetics to deemphasize physical defects (offer information on "Look Good, Feel Better" program through American Cancer Society).
1. Temporary hoarseness is common after neck surgery. A tracheostomy may be performed, and verbal communication may not be possible. Communication with head movement may be impossible because of incisional pain and need to maintain position of neck for graft. A speech/language therapist may assist with other forms of communication, such as esophageal speech or electrolarynx.
2. Listening conveys acceptance and encourages further verbalization. An optimistic approach conveys interest and hope. Honesty will promote a trusting relationship. This includes confirming cosmetic and functional limitations. Family members or significant others can provide valuable support to the patient.
3. Injury to facial nerve will cause lower facial paralysis.
4. Damage to the hypoglossal nerve will result in excessive drooling and decreased ability to swallow.
5. Damage to the spinal accessory nerve will result in drooping of the shoulder. Rehabilitation exercises are begun after the incision is healed.
6. Physical appearance may be enhanced through use of cosmetics or clothing.
- Recognizes that hoarseness is temporary
- Develops alternative forms of communication
- Willingly conveys fears and concerns
- Accepts prognosis with realistic limitations
- Accepts support as offered
- Absence of facial paralysis
- Absence of drooling and dysphagia
- Maintains normal shoulder function
- Verbalizes methods to enhance physical appearance
(CT) of the esophagus, and endoscopy may be used for diagnosis; however, the diagnosis is confirmed by manometry, a process in which the esophageal pressure is measured by a radiologist or gastroenterologist.

\section*{Management}

The patient should be instructed to eat slowly and to drink fluids with meals. As a temporary measure, calcium channel blockers and nitrates have been used to decrease esophageal pressure and improve swallowing. Injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to quadrants of the esophagus via endoscopy has been helpful because it inhibits the contraction of smooth muscle. Periodic injections are required to maintain remission. If these methods are unsuccessful, pneumatic (forceful) dilation or surgical separation of the muscle fibers may be recommended (Streeter, 1999; Annese et al., 2000).

Achalasia may be treated conservatively by pneumatic dilation to stretch the narrowed area of the esophagus (Fig. 35-6). Pneumatic dilation has a high success rate. Although perforation is a
potential complication, its incidence is low. The procedure can be painful; therefore, moderate sedation in the form of an analgesic or tranquilizer, or both, is administered for the treatment. The patient is monitored for perforation. Complaints of abdominal tenderness and fever may be indications of perforation (see later discussion).

Achalasia may be treated surgically by esophagomyotomy (Fig. 35-7). The procedure usually is performed laparoscopically, either with a complete lower esophageal sphincter myotomy and an antireflux procedure (see later discussion of fundoplasty), or without an antireflux procedure. The esophageal muscle fibers are separated to relieve the lower esophageal stricture. Although patients with a history of achalasia have a slightly higher incidence of esophageal cancer, long-term follow-up with esophagoscopy for early detection has not proved beneficial.

\section*{DIFFUSE SPASM}

Diffuse spasm is a motor disorder of the esophagus. The cause is unknown, but stressful situations can produce contractions of the

\begin{figure}

\caption{FIGURE 35-6 Treatment of achalasia by the conservative approach. (A-C) The dilator is passed, guided by a previously inserted guidewire. (D) When the balloon is in proper position, it is distended by pressure sufficient to dilate the narrowed area of the esophagus.}
\end{figure}
esophagus. It is more common in women and usually manifests in middle age.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Diffuse spasm is characterized by difficulty or pain on swallowing (dysphagia, odynophagia) and by chest pain similar to that of coronary artery spasm.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Esophageal manometry, which measures the motility of the esophagus and the pressure within the esophagus, indicates that
simultaneous contractions of the esophagus occur irregularly. Diagnostic x-ray studies after ingestion of barium show separate areas of spasm.

\section*{Management}

Conservative therapy includes administration of sedatives and long-acting nitrates to relieve pain. Calcium channel blockers have also been used to manage diffuse spasm. Small, frequent feedings and a soft diet are usually recommended to decrease the esophageal pressure and irritation that lead to spasm. Dilation performed by bougienage (use of progressively sized flexible dilators), pneumatic dilation, or esophagomyotomy may be necessary if the pain becomes intolerable.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-489.jpg?height=826&width=1302&top_left_y=1789&top_left_x=106}

Separation of the muscular fibers relieves the narrowing at the lower end of the esophagus and permits the patient to swallow normally again.}
\end{figure}

\section*{HIATAL HERNIA}

The esophagus enters the abdomen through an opening in the diaphragm and empties at its lower end into the upper part of the stomach. Normally, the opening in the diaphragm encircles the esophagus tightly, and the stomach lies completely within the abdomen. In a condition known as hiatus (or hiatal) hernia, the opening in the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes becomes enlarged, and part of the upper stomach tends to move up into the lower portion of the thorax. Hiatal hernia occurs more often in women than men. There are two types of hiatal hernias: sliding and paraesophageal. Sliding, or type I, hiatal hernia occurs when the upper stomach and the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) are displaced upward and slide in and out of the thorax (Fig. 35-8A). About $90 \%$ of patients with esophageal hiatal hernia have a sliding hernia. A paraesophageal hernia occurs when all or part of the stomach pushes through the diaphragm beside the esophagus (see Fig. 35-8B). Paraesophageal hernias may be further classified as types II, III, or IV, depending on the extent of herniation, with type IV having the greatest herniation.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient with a sliding hernia may have heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia, but at least $50 \%$ of patients are asymptomatic. Sliding hiatal hernia is often implicated in reflux. The patient with a paraesophageal hernia usually feels a sense of fullness after eating or may be asymptomatic. Reflux usually does not occur, because the gastroesophageal sphincter is intact. The complications of hemorrhage, obstruction, and strangulation can occur with any type of hernia.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is confirmed by x-ray studies, barium swallow, and fluoroscopy.

\section*{Management}

Management for an axial hernia includes frequent, small feedings that can pass easily through the esophagus. The patient is advised
not to recline for 1 hour after eating, to prevent reflux or movement of the hernia, and to elevate the head of the bed on 4 - to 8 -inch ( 10 - to $20-\mathrm{cm}$ ) blocks to prevent the hernia from sliding upward. Surgery is indicated in about $15 \%$ of patients. Medical and surgical management of a paraesophageal hernia is similar to that for gastroesophageal reflux; however, paraesophageal hernias may require emergency surgery to correct torsion (twisting) of the stomach or other body organ that leads to restriction of blood flow to that area.

\section*{DIVERTICULUM}

A diverticulum is an outpouching of mucosa and submucosa that protrudes through a weak portion of the musculature. Diverticula may occur in one of the three areas of the esophagus-the pharyngoesophageal or upper area of the esophagus, the midesophageal area, or the epiphrenic or lower area of the esophagusor they may occur along the border of the esophagus intramurally.

The most common type of diverticulum, which is found three times more frequently in men than in women, is Zenker's diverticulum (also known as pharyngoesophageal pulsion diverticulum or a pharyngeal pouch). It occurs posteriorly through the cricopharyngeal muscle in the midline of the neck. It is usually seen in people older than 60 years of age. Other types of diverticula include midesophageal, epiphrenic, and intramural diverticula.

Midesophageal diverticula are uncommon. Symptoms are less acute, and usually the condition does not require surgery. Epiphrenic diverticula are usually larger diverticula in the lower esophagus just above the diaphragm. They are thought to be related to the improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter or to motor disorders of the esophagus. Intramural diverticulosis is the occurrence of numerous small diverticula associated with a stricture in the upper esophagus.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms experienced by the patient with a pharyngoesophageal pulsion diverticulum include difficulty swallowing, fullness in the neck, belching, regurgitation of undigested food, and gurgling

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_5286f39576be9eab02b8g-490.jpg?height=709&width=1697&top_left_y=1786&top_left_x=243}

\end{figure}
noises after eating. The diverticulum, or pouch, becomes filled with food or liquid. When the patient assumes a recumbent position, undigested food is regurgitated, and coughing may be caused by irritation of the trachea. Halitosis and a sour taste in the mouth are also common because of the decomposition of food retained in the diverticulum.

Symptoms produced by midesophageal diverticula are less acute. One third of patients with epiphrenic diverticula are asymptomatic, and the remaining two thirds complain of dysphagia and chest pain. Dysphagia is the most common complaint of patients with intramural diverticulosis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A barium swallow may be performed to determine the exact nature and location of a diverticulum. Manometric studies are often performed for patients with epiphrenic diverticula to rule out a motor disorder. Esophagoscopy usually is contraindicated because of the danger of perforation of the diverticulum, with resulting mediastinitis (inflammation of the organs and tissues that separate the lungs). Blind insertion of a nasogastric tube should be avoided.

\section*{Management}

Because pharyngoesophageal pulsion diverticulum is progressive, the only means of cure is surgical removal of the diverticulum. During surgery, care is taken to avoid trauma to the common carotid artery and internal jugular veins. The sac is dissected free and amputated flush with the esophageal wall. In addition to a diverticulectomy, a myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle is often performed to relieve spasticity of the musculature, which otherwise seems to contribute to a continuation of the previous symptoms. Postoperatively, the patient may have a nasogastric tube inserted at the time of surgery. The surgical incision must be observed for evidence of leakage from the esophagus and a developing fistula. Food and fluids are withheld until x-ray studies show no leakage at the surgical site. The diet begins with liquids and progresses as tolerated.

Surgery is indicated for epiphrenic and midesophageal diverticula only if the symptoms are troublesome and becoming worse. Treatment consists of a diverticulectomy and long myotomy. Intramural diverticula usually regress after the esophageal stricture is dilated.

\section*{PERFORATION}

The esophagus is not an uncommon site of injury. Perforation may result from stab or bullet wounds of the neck or chest, trauma from motor vehicle crash, caustic injury from a chemical burn (described later), or inadvertent puncture by a surgical instrument during examination or dilation.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient has persistent pain followed by dysphagia. Infection, fever, leukocytosis, and severe hypotension may be noted. In some instances, signs of pneumothorax are observed.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic x-ray studies and fluoroscopy are used to identify the site of the injury.

\section*{Management}

Because of the high risk of infection, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is initiated. A nasogastric tube is inserted to provide suction and to reduce the amount of gastric juice that can reflux into the esophagus and mediastinum. Nothing is given by mouth; nutritional needs are met by parenteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition is preferred to gastrostomy because the latter might cause reflux into the esophagus.

Surgery may be necessary to close the wound, and postoperative nutritional support then becomes a primary concern. Depending on the incision site and the nature of surgery, the postoperative nursing management is similar to that for patients who have had thoracic or abdominal surgery.

\section*{FOREIGN BODIES}

Many swallowed foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without the need for medical intervention. However, some swallowed foreign bodies (eg, dentures, fish bones, pins, small batteries, items containing mercury or lead) may injure the esophagus or obstruct its lumen and must be removed. Pain and dysphagia may be present, and dyspnea may occur as a result of pressure on the trachea. The foreign body may be identified by x-ray film. Perforation may have occurred (see earlier discussion).

Glucagon, because of its relaxing effect on the esophageal muscle, may be injected intramuscularly. An endoscope (with a covered hood or overtube) may be used to remove the impacting food or object from the esophagus. A mixture consisting of sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid may be used to increase intraluminal pressure by the formation of a gas. Caution must be used with this treatment because there is risk of perforation.

\section*{CHEMICAL BURNS}

Chemical burns of the esophagus may be caused by undissolved medications in the esophagus. This occurs more frequently in the elderly than it does among the general adult population. A chemical burn may also occur after swallowing of a battery, which may release caustic alkaline. Chemical burns of the esophagus occur most often when a patient, either intentionally or unintentionally, swallows a strong acid or base (eg, lye). This patient is emotionally distraught as well as in acute physical pain. An acute chemical burn of the esophagus may be accompanied by severe burns of the lips, mouth, and pharynx, with pain on swallowing. There may be difficulty in breathing due to either edema of the throat or a collection of mucus in the pharynx.

The patient, who may be profoundly toxic, febrile, and in shock, is treated immediately for shock, pain, and respiratory distress. Esophagoscopy and barium swallow are performed as soon as possible to determine the extent and severity of damage. The patient is given nothing by mouth, and intravenous fluids are administered. A nasogastric tube may be inserted by the physician. Vomiting and gastric lavage are avoided to prevent further exposure of the esophagus to the caustic agent. The use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and minimize subsequent scarring and stricture formation is of questionable value. The value of the prophylactic use of antibiotics for these patients has also been questioned; however, these treatments continue to be prescribed (Schaffer \& Herbert, 2000).

After the acute phase has subsided, the patient may need nutritional support via enteral or parenteral feedings. The patient may require further treatment to prevent or manage strictures of the esophagus. Dilation by bougienage may be sufficient, but dilation treatment may need to be repeated periodically. (In bougienage,
cylindrical rubber tubes of different sizes, called bougies, are advanced into the esophagus via the oral cavity. Progressively larger bougies are used to dilate the esophagus. The procedure usually is performed in the endoscopy suite or clinic by the gastroenterologist.) For strictures that do not respond to dilation, surgical management is necessary. Reconstruction may be accomplished by esophagectomy and colon interposition to replace the portion of esophagus removed.

\section*{GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE}

Some degree of gastroesophageal reflux (back-flow of gastric or duodenal contents into the esophagus) is normal in both adults and children. Excessive reflux may occur because of an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter, pyloric stenosis, or a motility disorder. The incidence of reflux seems to increase with aging.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may include pyrosis (burning sensation in the esophagus), dyspepsia (indigestion), regurgitation, dysphagia or odynophagia (difficulty swallowing, pain on swallowing), hypersalivation, and esophagitis. The symptoms may mimic those of a heart attack. The patient's history aids in obtaining an accurate diagnosis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic testing may include an endoscopy or barium swallow to evaluate damage to the esophageal mucosa. Ambulatory 12- to 36-hour esophageal pH monitoring is used to evaluate the degree of acid reflux. Bilirubin monitoring (Bilitec) is used to measure bile reflux patterns. Exposure to bile can cause mucosal damage (Aronson, 2000; Stein et al., 1999).

\section*{Management}

Management begins with teaching the patient to avoid situations that decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure or cause esophageal irritation. The patient is instructed to eat a low-fat diet; to avoid caffeine, tobacco, beer, milk, foods containing peppermint or spearmint, and carbonated beverages; to avoid eating or drinking 2 hours before bedtime; to maintain normal body weight; to avoid tight-fitting clothes; to elevate the head of the bed on 6-to 8 -inch ( $15-$ to $20-\mathrm{cm}$ ) blocks; and to elevate the upper body on pillows. If reflux persists, the patient may be given medications such as antacids or histamine receptor blockers. Proton pump inhibitors (medications that decrease the release of gastric acid, such as lansoprazole [Prevacid] or rabeprazole [Aciphex]) may be used; however, there is concern that these products may increase intragastric bacterial growth and the risk for infection. In addition, the patient may receive prokinetic agents, which accelerate gastric emptying. These agents include bethanechol (Urecholine), domperidone (Motilium), and metoclopramide (Reglan). Metoclopramide has central nervous system complications with long-term use. The use of pectin-based products is now being studied (Aronson, 2000).

If medical management is unsuccessful, surgical intervention may be necessary. Surgical management involves a fundoplication (wrapping of a portion of the gastric fundus around the sphincter area of the esophagus). Fundoplication may be performed by laparoscopy.

\section*{BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS}

It is believed that long-standing untreated GERD may result in a condition known as Barrett's esophagus. This has been identi-
fied as a precancerous condition that, if left untreated, can result in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which has a poor prognosis. It is more common among middle-aged white men; however, the incidence is increasing among women and among African Americans.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient complains of symptoms of GERD, notably frequent heartburn. The heartburn is a result of reflux, which eventually causes changes in the cells lining the lower esophagus. The patient may also complain of symptoms related to peptic ulcers or esophageal stricture, or both.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is performed. This usually reveals an esophageal lining that is red rather than pink. Biopsies are taken, and the cells resemble those of the intestine.

\section*{Management}

Monitoring varies depending on the amount of cell changes. Some physicians may recommend a repeat EGD in 6 to 12 months if there are minor cell changes. Medical and surgical management is similar to that for GERD. Because this is a condition that is increasing in incidence, research is underway to determine the best monitoring and surgical interventions (Mueller et al., 2000; Stein et al., 1999).

\section*{BENIGN TUMORS OF THE ESOPHAGUS}

Benign tumors can arise anywhere along the esophagus. The most common lesion is a leiomyoma (tumor of the smooth muscle), which can occlude the lumen of the esophagus. Most benign tumors are asymptomatic and are distinguished from cancerous lesions by a biopsy. Small lesions are excised during esophagoscopy; lesions that occur within the wall of the esophagus may require treatment via a thoracotomy.

\section*{CANCER OF THE ESOPHAGUS}

In the United States, carcinoma of the esophagus occurs more than three times as often in men as in women. It is seen more frequently in African Americans than in Caucasians and usually occurs in the fifth decade of life. Cancer of the esophagus has a much higher incidence in other parts of the world, including China and northern Iran (Greenlee, 2001; Castell \& Richter, 1999).

Chronic irritation is a risk factor for esophageal cancer. In the United States, cancer of the esophagus has been associated with ingestion of alcohol and with the use of tobacco. There seems to be an association between GERD and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. People with Barrett's esophagus (which is caused by chronic irritation of mucous membranes due to reflux of gastric and duodenal contents) have a higher incidence of esophageal cancer (Stein, 1999).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Esophageal cancer is usually of the squamous cell epidermoid type; however, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is increasing in the United States. Tumor cells may spread beneath the esophageal mucosa or directly into, through, and beyond the muscle layers into the lymphatics. In the latter stages,
obstruction of the esophagus is noted, with possible perforation into the mediastinum and erosion into the great vessels.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many patients have an advanced ulcerated lesion of the esophagus before symptoms are manifested. Symptoms include dysphagia, initially with solid foods and eventually with liquids; a sensation of a mass in the throat; painful swallowing; substernal pain or fullness; and, later, regurgitation of undigested food with foul breath and hiccups. The patient first becomes aware of intermittent and increasing difficulty in swallowing. As the tumor progresses and the obstruction becomes more complete, even liquids cannot pass into the stomach. Regurgitation of food and saliva occurs, hemorrhage may take place, and progressive loss of weight and strength occurs from starvation. Later symptoms include substernal pain, persistent hiccup, respiratory difficulty, and foul breath. The delay between the onset of early symptoms and the time when the patient seeks medical advice is often 12 to 18 months. Anyone with swallowing difficulties should be encouraged to consult a physician immediately.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Although new endoscopic techniques are being studied for screening and diagnosis of esophageal cancer, currently diagnosis is confirmed most often by EGD with biopsy and brushings. Bronchoscopy usually is performed, especially in tumors of the middle and the upper third of the esophagus, to determine whether the trachea has been affected and to help determine whether the lesion can be removed. Endoscopic ultrasound or mediastinoscopy is used to determine whether the cancer has spread to the nodes and other mediastinal structures. Cancer of the lower end of the esophagus may be caused by adenocarcinoma of the stomach that extends upward into the esophagus.

\section*{Medical Management}

If esophageal cancer is found at an early stage, treatment goals may be directed toward cure; however, it is often found in late stages, making relief of symptoms the only reasonable goal of therapy. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of these modalities, depending on the extent of the disease.

Standard surgical management includes a total resection of the esophagus (esophagectomy) with removal of the tumor plus a wide tumor-free margin of the esophagus and the lymph nodes in the area. The surgical approach may be through the thorax or the abdomen, depending on the location of the tumor. When tumors occur in the cervical or upper thoracic area, esophageal continuity may be maintained by free jejunal graft transfer, in which the tumor is removed and the area is replaced with a portion of the jejunum (Fig. 35-9). A segment of the colon may be used, or the stomach can be elevated into the chest and the proximal section of the esophagus anastomosed to the stomach.

Tumors of the lower thoracic esophagus are more amenable to surgery than are tumors located higher in the esophagus, and gastrointestinal tract integrity is maintained by anastomosing the lower esophagus to the stomach.

Surgical resection of the esophagus has a relatively high mortality rate because of infection, pulmonary complications, or leakage through the anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient will have a nasogastric tube in place that should not be manipulated. The patient is given nothing by mouth until x-ray studies confirm that the anastomosis is secure and not leaking.

The vascular structures are also anastomosed. A portion of the graft may be externalized through the neck wound to evaluate graft viability.}
\end{figure}

Preoperative radiation therapy or chemotherapy, or both, may be used; however, treatment is based on type of cell, tumor spread, and patient condition.

Palliative treatment may be necessary to keep the esophagus open, to assist with nutrition, and to control saliva. Palliation may be accomplished with dilation of the esophagus, laser therapy, placement of an endoprosthesis (stent), radiation, or chemotherapy. Because the ideal method of treating esophageal cancer has not yet been found, treatment is individually determined.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Intervention is directed toward improving the patient's nutritional and physical condition in preparation for surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. A program to promote weight gain based on a high-calorie and high-protein diet, in liquid or soft form, is provided if adequate food can be taken by mouth. If this is not possible, parenteral or enteral nutrition is initiated. Nutritional status is monitored throughout treatment. The patient is informed about the nature of the postoperative equipment that will be used, including that required for closed chest drainage, nasogastric suction, parenteral fluid therapy, and gastric intubation. Immediate postoperative care is similar to that provided for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. After recovering from the effects of anesthesia, the patient is placed in a low Fowler's position, and later in a Fowler's position, to assist in preventing reflux of gastric secretions. The patient is observed carefully for regurgitation and dyspnea. A common postoperative complication is aspiration pneumonia. The patient's temperature is monitored to detect any elevation that may indicate aspiration or seepage of fluid through the operative site into the mediastinum.

If jejunal grafting has been performed, the nurse checks for graft viability hourly for at least the first 12 hours. To make the graft visible, the surgeon usually brings a portion of the jejunum to the exterior neck by way of a small incision. Moist gauze covers the external portion of the graft. The gauze is removed briefly to assess the graft for color and to assess for the presence of a pulse by means of Doppler ultrasonography.

If an endoprosthesis has been placed or an anastomosis has been performed, a functioning continuum will exist between the throat and the stomach. Immediately after surgery, the nasogastric tube should be marked for position, and the physician is notified if displacement occurs. The nurse does not attempt to reinsert a displaced nasogastric tube, because damage to the anastomosis may occur. The nasogastric tube is removed 5 to 7 days after surgery, and a barium swallow is performed to assess for any anastomotic leak before the patient is allowed to eat.

Once feeding begins, the nurse encourages the patient to swallow small sips of water and, later, small amounts of pureed food. When the patient is able to increase food intake to an adequate amount, parenteral fluids are discontinued. If an endoprosthesis is used, it may easily become obstructed if food is not chewed sufficiently. After each meal, the patient remains upright for at least 2 hours to allow the food to move through the gastrointestinal tract. It is a challenge to encourage the patient to eat, because appetite is usually poor. Family involvement and home-cooked favorite foods may help the patient to eat. Antacids may help those with gastric distress.

If radiation is part of the therapy, the patient's appetite is further depressed and esophagitis may occur, causing pain when food is eaten. Liquid supplements may be more easily tolerated.

Often, in either the preoperative or the postoperative period, an obstructed or nearly obstructed esophagus causes difficulty with excess saliva, so that drooling becomes a problem. Oral suction may be used if the patient is unable to handle oral secretions, or a wicktype gauze may be placed at the corner of the mouth to direct secretions to a dressing or emesis basin. The possibility that the patient may aspirate saliva into the tracheobronchial tree and develop pneumonia is of great concern.

When the patient is ready to go home, the family is instructed about how to promote nutrition, what observations to make, what measures to take if complications occur, how to keep the patient comfortable, and how to obtain needed physical and emotional support.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A CONDITION OF THE ESOPHAGUS}

\section*{Assessment}

Emergency conditions of the esophagus (perforation, chemical burns) usually occur in the home or away from medical help and require emergency medical care. The patient is treated for shock and respiratory distress and transported as quickly as possible to a medical facility. Foreign bodies in the esophagus do not pose an immediate threat to life unless pressure is exerted on the trachea, resulting in dyspnea or interfering with respiration, or unless there is leakage of caustic alkali from a battery. Educating the public to prevent inadvertent swallowing of foreign bodies or corrosive agents is a major health issue.

For nonemergency symptoms, a complete health history may reveal the nature of the esophageal disorder. The nurse asks about the patient's appetite. Has it remained the same, increased, or decreased? Is there any discomfort with swallowing? If so, does it occur only with certain foods? Is it associated with pain? Does a change in position affect the discomfort? The patient is asked to describe the pain. Does anything aggravate it? Are there any other symptoms that occur regularly, such as regurgitation, nocturnal regurgitation, eructation (belching), heartburn, substernal pressure, a sensation that food is sticking in the throat, a feeling of becoming full after eating a small amount of food, nausea, vom-
iting, or weight loss? Are the symptoms aggravated by emotional upset? If the patient reports any of these symptoms, the nurse asks about the time of their occurrence, their relationship to eating, and factors that relieve or aggravate them (eg, position change, belching, antacids, vomiting).

This history also includes questions about past or present causative factors, such as infections and chemical, mechanical, or physical irritants; the degree to which alcohol and tobacco are used; and the amount of daily food intake. The nurse determines whether the patient appears emaciated and auscultates the patient's chest to determine whether pulmonary complications exist.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to difficulty swallowing
- Risk for aspiration related to difficulty swallowing or to tube feeding
- Acute pain related to difficulty swallowing, ingestion of an abrasive agent, tumor, or frequent episodes of gastric reflux
- Deficient knowledge about the esophageal disorder, diagnostic studies, medical management, surgical intervention, and rehabilitation

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include attainment of adequate nutritional intake, avoidance of respiratory compromise from aspiration, relief of pain, and increased knowledge level.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{ENCOURAGING ADEQUATE NUTRITIONAL INTAKE}

The patient is encouraged to eat slowly and to chew all food thoroughly so that it can pass easily into the stomach. Small, frequent feedings of nonirritating foods are recommended to promote digestion and to prevent tissue irritation. Sometimes liquid swallowed with food helps the food pass through the esophagus. Food should be prepared in an appealing manner to help stimulate the appetite. Irritants such as tobacco and alcohol should be avoided. A baseline weight is obtained, and daily weights are recorded. The patient's intake of nutrients is assessed.

\section*{DECREASING RISK OF ASPIRATION}

The patient who has difficulty swallowing or difficulty handling secretions should be kept in at least a semi-Fowler's position to decrease the risk of aspiration. The patient can be instructed in the use of oral suction to decrease the risk of aspiration further.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Small, frequent feedings are recommended, because large quantities of food overload the stomach and promote gastric reflux. The patient is advised to avoid any activities that increase pain, and to remain upright for 1 to 4 hours after each meal to prevent reflux. The head of the bed should be placed on 4- to 8-inch (10- to 20cm) blocks. Eating before bedtime is discouraged.

The patient is advised that excessive use of over-the-counter antacids can cause rebound acidity. Antacid use should be directed by the primary care provider, who can recommend the daily, safe dose needed to neutralize gastric juices and prevent esophageal

irritation. Histamine ${ }_{2}$ antagonists are administered as prescribed to decrease gastric acid irritation.

\section*{PROVIDING PATIENT EDUCATION}

The patient is prepared physically and psychologically for diagnostic tests, treatments, and possible surgical intervention. The principal nursing interventions include reassuring the patient and discussing the procedures and their purposes. Some disorders of the esophagus evolve over time, whereas others are the result of trauma (eg, chemical burns, perforation). In instances of trauma, the emotional and physical preparation for treatment is more difficult because of the short time available and the circumstances of the injury. Treatment interventions must be evaluated continually; the patient is given sufficient information to participate in care and diagnostic tests. If endoscopic diagnostic methods are used, the patient is instructed regarding the moderate sedation that will be used during the procedure. If procedures are being performed on an outpatient basis with the use of moderate sedation, the patient is instructed to have someone available to drive him or her home after the procedure. If surgery is required, immediate and long-term evaluation is similar to that for a patient undergoing thoracic surgery.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The self-care required of the patient depends on the nature of the disorder and on the surgery or treatment measures used (eg, diet, positioning, medications). If an ongoing condition exists, the nurse helps the patient plan for needed physical and psychological adjustments and for follow-up care (Chart 35-4).

Special equipment, such as suction or enteral or parenteral feeding devices, may be required. The patient may need assistance in planning meals, using medications as prescribed, and resuming activities. Education about nutritional requirements and how to measure the adequacy of nutrition is important. Elderly and debilitated patients in particular often need assistance and education in ways to adjust to their limitations and to resume activities that are important to them.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Patients with chronic esophageal conditions require an individualized approach to their management at home. Foods may need to be prepared in a special way (blenderized foods, soft foods), and the patient may need to eat more frequently (eg, four to six small servings per day). The medication schedule is adjusted to the patient's daily activities as much as possible. Analgesic medications and antacids can usually be taken as needed every 3 to 4 hours.

Postoperative home health care focuses on nutritional support, management of pain, and respiratory function. Some patients are discharged from the hospital with enteral feeding by means of a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube or parenteral nutrition. The patient and care provider need specific instructions regarding management of the equipment and treatments. Home care visits by a nurse may be necessary to assess the patient's care and the care provider's ability to provide the necessary care. (See Chapter 36 for more information about parenteral nutrition and management of the patient with a gastrostomy.) For some patients, a multidisciplinary team comprising a dietitian, a social worker, and family members is helpful. Hospice care is appropriate for some patients.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are interviewing a patient in the medical clinic. The patient is complaining of difficulty swallowing as well as indigestion. Describe how you would continue to assess this patient to obtain the additional information that is
needed. Identify the various factors that may be causing this patient's symptoms.
2. You are caring for two postoperative patients. One patient is being treated for cancer of the mouth, the other for cancer of the esophagus. How will the nutritional care of these two patients differ? Describe the communication needs and psychosocial needs of these patients.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Intubation and Special Nutritional Modalities}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the purposes and types of GI intubation.
2. Discuss nursing management of the patient who has a nasogastric or nasoenteric tube.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient receiving an enteral feeding.
4. Explain the preoperative and postoperative care of the patient with a gastrostomy.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with a gastrostomy.
6. Identify the purposes and uses of parenteral nutrition.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient receiving parenteral nutrition.
8. Describe the nursing measures used to prevent complications from parenteral nutrition.

$T_{h}$his chapter presents several topics related to gastrointestinal (GI) intubation. Nursing management topics relate to managing the care of patients with nasogastric (NG) and nasoenteric tubes and gastrostomies, providing tube feedings, and teaching points related to home health care and nutritional therapy. In addition, parenteral nutrition is presented, including general indications for this nutritional modality and nursing care of patients receiving these support measures.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Intubation}

GI intubation is the insertion of a rubber or plastic tube into the stomach, the duodenum (first section of the small intestine), or the intestine. The tube may be inserted through the mouth, the nose, or the abdominal wall. The tubes can be short, medium, or long, depending on their intended use; nasogastric (NG) tubes are short, nasoduodenal tubes are of medium length, and nasoenteric tubes are long. GI intubation may be performed for the following reasons:
- To decompress the stomach and remove gas and fluid
- To lavage the stomach and remove ingested toxins
- To diagnose disorders of GI motility and other disorders
- To administer medications and feedings
- To treat an obstruction
- To compress a bleeding site
- To aspirate gastric contents for analysis

A variety of tubes are used for decompression, aspiration, and lavage. The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is a type of NG tube used to treat bleeding esophageal varices (see Chapter 39). Orogastric tubes are large-bore tubes with wide proximal outlets for removal of particles of ingested substances (eg, pills); they are primarily used in emergency departments. Various other tubes are used to administer feedings and medications. The tubes are made of various materials (rubber, polyurethane, silicone), and they vary in length
( 90 cm to 3 m [ 3 to 10 ft ]), in size ( 6 to 18 French [Fr]), in purpose, and in placement in the GI tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum) (Table 36-1). Any solution administered through a tube is either poured through a syringe or delivered by a drip mechanism regulated by gravity or by an electric pump. Aspiration (suctioning) to remove gas and fluids is accomplished with the use of a syringe, an electric suction machine, or a wall suction outlet.

\section*{SHORT TUBES}

An NG tube or short tube is introduced through the nose into the stomach, often before or during esophageal or stomach surgery. Commonly used short tubes include the Levin tube and the gastric sump tube. Short tubes are used in adults primarily to remove fluid and gas from the upper GI tract or to obtain a specimen of gastric contents for laboratory studies. They are occasionally used for the short-term ( 3 to 4 weeks) administration of medications or feedings.

\section*{Levin Tube}

The Levin tube has a single lumen (the hollow part of the tube), ranges from 14 to 18 Fr in size, and is made of plastic or rubber with openings near its tip. It is 125 cm (50 in) long. Circular markings at specific points on the tube serve as guides for insertion. A marking is made on the tube to indicate the midpoint. The tube is advanced cautiously until this marking reaches the patient's nostril, suggesting that the tube is in the stomach. Placement is checked by observing the characteristics of the aspirate and by testing the $\mathbf{p H}$ (which varies according to the source of the aspirate). Seeing the tube on an x-ray study is the only sure way to verify its location. The Levin tube is connected to low intermittent suction ( 30 to 40 mm Hg ). Intermittent suction is used to avoid erosion or tearing of the stomach lining, which can result from constant adherence of the tube's lumen to the mucosal lining of the stomach.

\section*{Gastric Sump}

The gastric sump (Salem) tube is a radiopaque, clear plastic, double-lumen NG tube used to decompress the stomach and keep it empty. It is 120 cm ( 48 in ) long and is passed into the stomach in the same way as the Levin tube. The inner, smaller tube vents the larger suction-drainage tube to the atmosphere by means of an opening at the distal end of the tube. The sump tube can protect gastric suture lines because, when used properly, it maintains the force of suction at the drainage openings, or outlets, at less than 25 mm Hg , the level of capillary fragility. The small vent tube (known as the blue pigtail) controls this action. These tubes are connected to low continuous suction. The suction lumen is irrigated as prescribed to maintain patency.

To prevent reflux of gastric contents through the vent lumen (blue pigtail), the vent lumen is kept above the patient's waist; otherwise it will act as a siphon. A one-way antireflux valve seated in the blue pigtail prevents the reflux of gastric contents out the vent lumen (Fig. 36-1). The valve is removed after irrigation of the suction lumen, and 20 mL of air is injected to reestablish a buffer of air between the gastric contents and the valve.

\section*{MEDIUM TUBES}

Medium-length nasoenteric tubes are used for feeding. Feeding tubes placed in the duodenum are 160 cm ( 60 in ) long; feeding tubes placed in the jejunum (portion of the small intestine adjacent to the duodenum) are 175 cm ( 66 in ) long. They can be inserted at the time of surgery or before surgery, by interventional radiologists assisted by fluoroscopy or at the bedside. If the tube is inserted at the bedside, placement is verified by radiography.

After insertion, the tip of the tube will initially be in the stomach; it usually takes 24 hours for the tube to pass through the stomach and into the intestines.

NURSING ALERT Having the patient lie on the right side facilitates passage, because gravity and peristaltic motion will move the weighted tube into the duodenum.

Polyurethane or silicone rubber feeding tubes have narrow diameters ( 6 to 12 Fr ) and tungsten tips (rather than mercuryfilled bags); some have a water-activated lubricant that makes it easier to insert the tube. The tubing may kink when a stylet is not used, particularly if the patient is uncooperative or unable to swallow. Feeding tubes with a stylet are inserted with caution in patients who are predisposed to esophageal puncture, such as elderly and frail patients with thin tissues. These tubes are advanced in the same way as an NG tube; that is, with the patient in Fowler's position. If this is not feasible, the patient is placed on the right side.

\section*{LONG TUBES}

A long nasoenteric tube is introduced through the nose and passed through the esophagus and stomach into the intestinal tract. It is used to aspirate intestinal contents so that gas and fluid do not distend the intestine; this is called decompression. Three major nasoenteric tubes used for aspiration and decompression are the Miller-Abbott tube, the Harris tube, and the Cantor tube. These tubes are used to relieve obstruction of the small intestine. They are also used prophylactically; they may be inserted the night before GI surgery to prevent postoperative obstruction.

EIGURE 36-1 Gastric sump tube (Salem) equipped with a one-way antireflux valve that allows air to enter and prevents gastric contents from escaping. The antireflux valve is designed with a pressure activated air buffer (PAAB). The buffer is activated (1) and the valve closes (2) when pressure from gastric contents enters the tubing.

Because peristalsis is either stopped or slowed for 24 to 48 hours after surgery as a result of anesthesia and visceral manipulation, NG or nasoenteric suction is used to evacuate fluids and flatus so that vomiting is prevented, tension is reduced along the incision line, and obstruction is prevented. Usually, the tube remains in place until peristalsis returns, as evidenced by the resumption of bowel sounds and the passage of flatus.

\section*{Miller-Abbott Tube}

The Miller-Abbott tube is a double-lumen rubber tube that is 300 cm ( 10 ft ) long and 12, 14, 16, or 18 Fr in size. One lumen is used to introduce mercury, water, or saline into the balloon at the end of the tube for weighting of the tube; the other lumen is used for aspiration. Before the tube is inserted, the balloon should be tested and its capacity measured; then it should be deflated completely. The tube should be lubricated sparingly and chilled well (chilling causes the tube to become stiff and facilitates its passage) before the tip is inserted through the patient's nose. Markings on the tube indicate the distance it has been passed. Before removal, the balloon at the end of the lumen must be completely deflated.

\section*{Harris Tube}

The Harris tube is a single-lumen ( 14 Fr ), mercury-weighted tube of about $180 \mathrm{~cm}(6 \mathrm{ft})$. This tube has a metal tip that is lu-
bricated and introduced through the nose. The mercuryweighted bag follows. The weight of the mercury promotes the passage of the bag by gravity. This tube is used solely for suction and irrigation. Usually, a Y-tube is attached to the end of the Harris tube. The suction is applied to one side of the Y and the other side is clamped, except when irrigation of the tube is being performed.

\section*{Cantor Tube}

The Cantor tube is $300 \mathrm{~cm}(10 \mathrm{ft})$ long and has a $16-\mathrm{Fr}$ lumen. Its distinguishing feature is that it is larger than the other long tubes. It has a $4-$ or $5-\mathrm{mL}$ bag at the extreme end of the rubber tubing; mercury, water or saline is introduced into this bag to weight the tube. Before the tube is inserted, the bag is wrapped around the tube. After the tube is lubricated, it is advanced through the nose and into the esophagus (Fig. 36-2). The patient assumes a sitting position and may be offered sips of water to facilitate passage of the tube. Fluoroscopy helps to verify that the tube has passed into the duodenum.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING NASOGASTRIC OR NASOENTERIC INTUBATION}

Nursing interventions include the following:
- Instructing the patient about the purpose of the tube and the procedure required for inserting and advancing it
- Describing the sensations to be expected during tube insertion
- Inserting the NG tube and assisting with insertion of the nasoenteric tube
- Confirming the placement of the NG tube
- Advancing the nasoenteric tube
- Monitoring the patient and maintaining tube function
- Providing oral and nasal hygiene and care
- Monitoring for potential complications
- Removing the tube

\section*{Providing Instruction}

Before the patient is intubated, the nurse explains the purpose of the tube; this information may assist the patient to be cooperative and tolerant of what is often an unpleasant procedure. The general activities related to inserting the tube are then reviewed, including the fact that the patient may have to breathe through the mouth and that the procedure may cause gagging until the tube has passed the area of the gag reflex.

\section*{Inserting the Tube}

Before inserting the tube, the clinician determines how much tubing will be needed to reach the stomach or the small intestine. A mark is made on the tube to indicate the desired length. This length is determined by measuring the distance from the tip of the nose to the earlobe, and from the earlobe to the xiphoid process, then adding 6 inches for NG placement or 8 to 10 inches for intestinal placement (Fig. 36-3).

While the tube is being inserted, the patient usually sits upright with a towel spread bib-fashion over the chest. Tissue wipes are made available. Privacy and adequate light are provided. The physician may swab the nostril and spray the oropharynx with
