\section*{Conditions of the Prostate}

\section*{PROSTATITIS}

Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland caused by infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma) or other conditions (eg, urethral stricture, prostatic hyperplasia). E. coli is the most commonly isolated organism. Microorganisms are usually carried to the prostate from the urethra. Prostatitis may be classified as bacterial or abacterial, depending on the presence or absence of microorganisms in the prostatic fluid.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of prostatitis may include perineal discomfort, burning, urgency, frequency, and pain with or after ejaculation. Prostatodynia (pain in the prostate) is manifested by pain on voiding or perineal pain without evidence of inflammation or bacterial growth in the prostate fluid.

Acute bacterial prostatitis may produce sudden fever and chills and perineal, rectal, or low back pain. Urinary symptoms, such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, and nocturia (urination during the night), may occur. Some patients do not have symptoms. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a major cause of relapsing urinary tract infection in men. Symptoms are usually mild, consisting of frequency, dysuria, and occasionally urethral discharge. High temperature and chills are uncommon.

Complications of prostatitis may include swelling of the prostate gland and urinary retention. Other complications include epididymitis, bacteremia, and pyelonephritis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of prostatitis requires a careful history, culture of prostate fluid or tissue, and occasionally a histologic examination of the tissue. To locate the source of a lower genitourinary infection (bladder neck, urethra, prostate), it is necessary to collect a divided urinary specimen for segmental urine culture. After cleaning the glans penis and retracting the foreskin (if present), the patient voids 10 to 15 mL of urine into a container. This represents urethral urine. Without interrupting the urinary stream, he collects 50 to 75 mL of urine in a second container; this represents bladder urine.

If the patient does not have acute prostatitis, the physician immediately performs a prostatic massage and collects any prostatic fluid that is expressed into a third container. If it is not possible to collect prostatic fluid, the patient voids a small quantity of urine. The specimen may contain the bacteria present in the prostatic fluid. Urinalysis after prostate examination commonly reveals many white blood cells.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of therapy for acute bacterial prostatitis is to avoid the complications of abscess formation and septicemia. A broadspectrum antibiotic agent (to which the causative organism is sen-
sitive) is administered for 10 to 14 days. Intravenous administration of the agent may be necessary to achieve high serum and tissue levels; the agent may be administered at home. The patient is encouraged to remain on bed rest to alleviate symptoms quickly. Comfort is promoted with analgesic agents (to relieve pain), antispasmodic medications and bladder sedatives (to relieve bladder irritability), sitz baths (to relieve pain and spasm), and stool softeners (to prevent pain from straining).

Chronic bacterial prostatitis is difficult to treat because most antibiotics diffuse poorly from the plasma into the prostatic fluid. Nevertheless, antibiotics may be prescribed, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) or a fluoroquinolone. Continuous therapy with low-dose antibiotics to suppress the infection may also be indicated. The patient is advised that the urinary tract infection may recur and is taught to recognize its symptoms. In addition, treatment for chronic prostatitis may include reducing the retention of prostatic fluid by ejaculation through sexual intercourse or masturbation. Other treatments include antispasmodics, sitz baths, stool softeners, and evaluation of sexual partners to reduce the possibility of crossinfection. The treatment of nonbacterial prostatitis is directed toward relieving symptoms.

\section*{Nursing Management}

If the patient experiences symptoms of acute prostatitis (fever, severe pain and discomfort, inability to urinate, malaise), he may be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Nursing management includes administration of prescribed antibiotics and provision of comfort measures, including prescribed analgesic agents and sitz baths.

The patient with chronic prostatitis is usually treated on an outpatient basis and needs to be instructed about the importance of continuing antibiotic therapy.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse instructs the patient to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics. If intravenous antibiotics are to be administered at home, the nurse instructs the patient and family about correct and safe administration. Arrangements for home care to oversee administration may be needed. Hot sitz baths ( 10 to 20 minutes) may be taken several times daily. Fluids are encouraged to satisfy thirst but are not "forced" because an effective medication level must be maintained in the urine. Foods and liquids that have diuretic action or that increase prostatic secretions, such as alcohol, coffee, tea, chocolate, cola, and spices, should be avoided. During periods of acute inflammation, sexual arousal and intercourse should be avoided.

To minimize discomfort, the patient should avoid sitting for long periods. Medical follow-up is necessary for at least 6 months to 1 year because prostatitis caused by the same or different organisms can recur.

\section*{BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA (ENLARGED PROSTATE)}

In many patients older than 50 years, the prostate gland enlarges, extending upward into the bladder and obstructing the outflow of urine by encroaching on the vesical orifice. This condition is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the enlargement, or hypertrophy, of the prostate. BPH is one of the most common pathologic conditions in older men (McConnell, 1998).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Examination reveals a prostate gland that is large, rubbery, and nontender. The cause is uncertain, but evidence suggests that hormones initiate hyperplasia of the supporting stromal tissue and the glandular elements in the prostate (McConnell, 1998). The hypertrophied lobes may obstruct the vesical neck or prostatic urethra, causing incomplete emptying of the bladder and urinary retention. As a result, a gradual dilation of the ureters (hydroureter) and kidneys (hydronephrosis) can occur. Urinary tract infections may result from urinary stasis, because some urine remains in the urinary tract and serves as a medium for infective organisms.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The obstructive and irritative symptom complex (referred to as prostatism) includes increased frequency of urination, nocturia, urgency, hesitancy in starting urination, abdominal straining with urination, a decrease in the volume and force of the urinary stream, interruption of the urinary stream, dribbling (urine dribbles out after urination), a sensation that the bladder has not been completely emptied, acute urinary retention (when more than 60 mL of urine remains in the bladder after urination), and recurrent urinary tract infections. Ultimately, azotemia (accumulation of nitrogenous waste products) and renal failure can occur with chronic urinary retention and large residual volumes. Generalized symptoms may also be noted, including fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort. Other disorders producing similar symptoms include urethral stricture, prostate cancer, neurogenic bladder, and urinary bladder stones.

A physical examination with DRE and diagnostic studies may be performed to determine the degree to which the prostate is enlarged, the presence of any changes in the bladder wall, and the efficiency of renal function. These tests may include urinalysis and urodynamic studies to assess urine flow. Renal function tests, including serum creatinine levels, may be performed to determine if there is renal impairment from prostatic back-pressure and to evaluate renal reserve. Complete blood studies are performed. Because hemorrhage is a major complication of prostate surgery, all clotting defects must be corrected. A high percentage of patients with BPH have cardiac or respiratory complications, or both, because of their age; therefore, cardiac and respiratory function is also assessed.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment plan depends on the cause of BPH, the severity of the obstruction, and the patient's condition. If the patient is admitted on an emergency basis because he cannot void, he is immediately catheterized. The ordinary catheter may be too soft and pliable to advance through the urethra into the bladder. In such cases, a thin wire called a stylet is introduced (by a urologist) into the catheter to prevent the catheter from collapsing when it encounters resistance. In severe cases, metal catheters with a pronounced prostatic curve may be used. Sometimes an incision is made into the bladder (a suprapubic cystostomy) to provide drainage.

Although prostatectomy (described later in the chapter) to remove the hyperplastic prostatic tissue is frequently performed, other treatment options are available. These include "watchful waiting," transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP), balloon dilation, alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, transurethral
laser resection, transurethral needle ablation, and microwave thermotherapy (Lepor, 1998; Mebust, 1998; McCullough, 1998). Watchful waiting is the appropriate treatment for many patients because the likelihood of progression of the disease or the development of complications is unknown. Patients are monitored periodically for severity of symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, and diagnostic urologic tests.

Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers (eg, terazosin [Hytrin]) relax the smooth muscle of the bladder neck and prostate. These agents help to reduce obstructive symptoms in many patients.

Because the hormonal component of BPH has been identified, one method of treatment involves hormonal manipulation with antiandrogen agents, such as finasteride (Proscar). In clinical studies, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride have been effective in preventing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). With decreased levels of DHT, suppression of glandular cell activity and decreases in prostate size have been demonstrated. Side effects of these medications include gynecomastia (breast enlargement), erectile dysfunction, and flushing.

With ultrasound guidance, resection of the prostate can be accomplished with lasers. The treated tissue either vaporizes or becomes necrotic and sloughs. This treatment is delivered in the outpatient setting and generally results in less postoperative bleeding than a traditional surgical prostatectomy.

Transurethral needle ablation uses low-level radiofrequencies to produce localized heat to destroy prostate tissue while sparing the urethra, nerves, muscles, and membranes. The radiofrequencies are delivered by thin needles placed into the prostate gland from a catheter. The body then resorbs the dead tissue.

In microwave thermotherapy, heat is applied to the hypertrophied prostatic tissue. A transurethral probe is inserted into the urethra, and microwaves are carefully directed to the prostate tissue. A water-cooling system helps to minimize damage to the urethra and decreases the discomfort from the procedure. The tissue becomes necrotic and sloughs.

Saw palmetto is a botanical remedy used for symptoms of mild to moderate BPH such as urinary frequency and decreased force of urine stream (Gerber, 2000; Marks, Partin, Epstein et al., 2000; Wilt, Ishani, Stark et al., 1998). It is theorized that saw palmetto works by interfering with the conversion of testosterone to DHT. In addition, saw palmetto may directly block the ability of DHT to stimulate prostate cell growth. It should not be used with finasteride or medications containing estrogen.

\section*{CANCER OF THE PROSTATE}

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men other than nonmelanoma skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in American men older than 55 years of age (Greenlee et al., 2001). About one in five men in the United States develop prostate cancer. It is estimated that 189,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 30,200 deaths occur annually (American Cancer Society, 2002). Prostate cancer rates are twice as high in African American men than in Caucasian men, and African American men are more likely to die of prostate cancer than men in any other racial or ethnic group. To address this issue, Agho and Lewis (2001) assessed knowledge of prostate cancer and the use of prostate cancer screening services among 108 African American men. The men were unable to answer most of the 21 questions on the test with more than $70 \%$ accuracy, although individuals younger than 40 years of age were
more knowledgeable than older men. Despite their increased risk for prostate cancer, only $47 \%$ of the men in the sample who were 40 years or older had prostate cancer screening as part of their annual physical examination. Knowledge about prostate cancer was found to be negatively correlated with education, age, and income. A culturally sensitive promotional campaign has been identified as an important strategy to increase awareness of the racial disparities in the incidence of prostate cancer and mortality rates. Nurses are in an ideal position to use these research findings to improve the health of African American men by teaching and counseling them about prostate cancer, screening, and treatment.

Risk factors for prostate cancer include increasing age: the incidence of prostate cancer increases rapidly after the age of 50 years, and more than $70 \%$ of cases occur in men over 65 years of age. African American men have the highest incidence of prostate cancer in the world. Prostate cancer is common in the United States and northwestern Europe but is rare in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America. A familial predisposition may occur in 5\% to $10 \%$ of cases of prostate cancer. Having a father or brother with prostate cancer doubles the risk; the risk increases further if several relatives have had prostate cancer and if the relatives were young at diagnosis. A diet high in red meat and fat increases the risk for prostate cancer (American Cancer Society, 2002). Large-scale studies are in progress to determine if prostate cancer can be prevented by use of selected supplements or finasteride (Proscar).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Cancer of the prostate in its early stages rarely produces symptoms. The symptoms that develop from urinary obstruction occur late in the disease. This cancer tends to vary in its course. If the neoplasm is large enough to encroach on the bladder neck, signs and symptoms of urinary obstruction occur: difficulty and frequency of urination, urinary retention, and decreased size and force of the urinary stream. Other symptoms may include blood in the urine or semen and painful ejaculation. Hematuria may result if the cancer invades the urethra or bladder, or both. Prostate cancer can metastasize to bone and lymph nodes. Symptoms related to metastases include backache, hip pain, perineal and rectal discomfort, anemia, weight loss, weakness, nausea, and oliguria (decreased urine output). Unfortunately, these symptoms may be the first indications of prostate cancer.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

When prostate cancer is detected early, the likelihood of cure is high. Every man older than 40 years of age should have a DRE as part of his regular health checkup. Routine repeated rectal palpation of the gland (preferably by the same examiner) is important because early cancer may be detected as a nodule within the substance of the gland or as an extensive hardening in the posterior lobe. The more advanced lesion is "stony hard" and fixed. DRE also provides useful clinical information about the rectum, anal sphincter, and quality of stool.

\section*{Impact of Prostate Cancer}

Fitch, M. I., Gray, R., Franssen, E., \& Johnson, B. (2000). Men's perspectives on the impact of prostate cancer:
Implications for oncology nurses. Oncology Nursing Forum, 27(8), 1255-1263.

\section*{Purpose}

This study was conducted to describe the experience of and support used by men with prostate cancer and to compare those with recurrent prostate cancer and those without recurrent disease.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This was a descriptive study of men with prostate cancer: 120 men with recurrent prostate cancer and 845 men without recurrent prostate cancer living in Canada. Consecutive subjects were recruited through urology offices and self-help groups. A 52-item survey developed by the researchers was used to obtain information from the subjects.

Descriptive data analysis addressed demographic characteristics, problems experienced, assistance received for problems, factors surrounding emotional support (eg, satisfaction with communication, satisfaction with information received, benefits of self-help groups), and impact of illness and treatment on lifestyle (including relationships with partners, children, and friends; employment opportunities and work life; financial status; leisure time activities; mental health; and household responsibilities). The two groups were compared on relevant variables.

\section*{Findings}

Men in both groups reported physical and psychological problems, although the incidence of these problems was higher in men with recurrent disease. Sexual dysfunction was the most frequently identified problem in both groups, but among those with recurrent disease, a significantly higher percentage reported problems with side effects, pain, and anger. Although few men reported having difficulty talking with their health care providers, $10 \%$ of men with recurrent disease
had trouble doing so compared to $2 \%$ of those without recurrent disease ( $p<0.025$ ). The percentage of men with recurrent disease who reported dissatisfaction with the information that was provided was higher in the areas of possible side effects or symptoms ( $31 \%$ vs. $14 \%$, $p<0.005$ ) and medical condition ( $25 \%$ vs. $10 \%, p<0.005$ ) than that of men without recurrent disease. Men in both groups indicated that they received inadequate help with problems such as side effects, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, and pain.

Overall, family and friends were the most frequent sources of support when men needed to talk, followed by medical professionals and self-help groups. The subjects also identified the need for more information about possible emotional reactions to the disease, how to arrange to speak to another man with prostate cancer, alternative therapies, diet and nutrition.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses should conduct early and ongoing comprehensive patient assessments, including physical as well as psychosocial components, to determine patient needs so that they can provide timely and effective interventions. Patients at high risk of experiencing psychosocial difficulties include those who do not have the social networks available to discuss their experiences. To enhance coping with the consequences of prostate cancer and its treatment, particularly in those with recurrent disease, nurses need to teach patients about the disease and provide an opportunity for them to discuss their concerns. In addition, assessment findings will help guide the creation and provision of effective interventions. Referral to self-help groups may be indicated, particularly in the absence of social support from family and friends.

The diagnosis of prostate cancer is confirmed by a histologic examination of tissue removed surgically by transurethral resection, open prostatectomy, or transrectal needle biopsy. Fineneedle aspiration is a quick, painless method of obtaining prostate cells for cytologic examination. The procedure is helpful for determining the stage of disease as well.

Most prostate cancers are diagnosed when a man seeks medical attention for symptoms of urinary obstruction or after abnormalities are found by DRE. Incidentally detected cancer with transurethral resection of the prostate for clinically benign disease and prostatism occurs in $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of patients. Rarely do patients have other signs and symptoms, such as azotemia (nitrogen compounds in the blood), weakness, anemia, or bone pain.

PSA, a neutral serine protease, is produced by the normal and neoplastic ductal epithelium of the prostate and secreted into the glandular lumen (Brawer, Cheli, Neaman et al., 2000; Kalish \& McKinlay, 1999). A simple blood test can be used to measure PSA levels. The concentration of PSA in the blood is proportional to the total prostatic mass. Although the PSA level indicates the presence of prostate tissue, it does not necessarily indicate malignancy. PSA testing is routinely used to monitor the patient's response to cancer therapy and to detect local progression and early recurrence of prostate cancer. The combination of DRE and PSA testing appears to be a cost-effective method for detecting prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends that, beginning at age 50, an annual DRE and PSA measurement be offered to men who have a life expectancy of at least 10 years and to younger men (age 45 years or older) who are at high risk. Risk factors include strong familial predisposition (two or more affected primary relatives) and African American race (Smith et al., 2000).

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) studies are indicated for men who have elevated PSA levels and abnormal DRE findings. TRUS studies help in detecting nonpalpable prostate cancers and assist with staging localized prostate cancer. Needle biopsies of the prostate are commonly guided by TRUS.

Other tests include bone scans to detect metastatic bone disease, skeletal x-rays to identify bone metastases, excretory urography to detect changes caused by ureteral obstruction, renal function tests, and computed tomography (CT) scans or lymphangiography to identify metastases in the pelvic lymph nodes.

The radiolabeled monoclonal antibody Capromab Pendetide with Indium-111 (ProstaScint) is an antibody that is attracted to the prostate-specific membrane antigen found on prostate cancer cells (Narayan et al., 2000). The radioactive element attached to the antibody is then visible with scanning, allowing detection of disease spread. This study is used to detect spread of prostate cancer in the lymph nodes or other parts of the body in newly diagnosed men who have apparently localized prostate cancer and who are thought to be at high risk for metastasis. In addition, men who have undergone a prostatectomy and who develop a rising PSA level may also be evaluated with this study.

\section*{Sexual Complications}

Men with prostate cancer commonly experience sexual dysfunction before the diagnosis is made. Each treatment (see discussion that follows) for prostate cancer further increases the incidence of sexual problems. With nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, the chance of recovering erections is better for men who are younger and in whom both neurovascular bundles are spared. Hormonal therapy also affects the central nervous system mechanisms that mediate sexual desire and arousability.

Sildenafil (Viagra) has been found to be effective for treating erectile dysfunction in younger men after radical retropubic pros-
tatectomy, especially if the neurovascular bundles were preserved (Zagaja, Mhoon, Aikens et al., 2000). In addition, sildenafil can improve erectile function in men with partial or moderate erectile dysfunction following radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer (Zelefsky, 1999).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment is based on the stage of the disease and the patient's age and symptoms. Partin and associates (1997) combined PSA level with the clinical stage and pathologic grade of the tumor to create a nomogram to predict the pathologic stage of localized prostate cancer. This nomogram can be useful in making treatment decisions and predicting treatment outcomes. Nursing care of the patient with cancer of the prostate is summarized in the Plan of Nursing Care.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

A radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles) remains the standard surgical procedure for patients who have early-stage, potentially curable disease and a life expectancy of 10 years or more (Carroll et al., 2001). Sexual importence follows radical prostatectomy, and $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of patients have various degrees of urinary incontinence (Bishoff, Motley, Optenberg et al., 1998).

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

If prostate cancer is detected in its early stage, the treatment may be curative radiation therapy: either teletherapy with a linear accelerator or interstitial irradiation (implantation of radioactive seeds of iodine or palladium), also referred to as brachytherapy (Carroll et al., 2001). Teletherapy involves about 6 to 7 weeks of daily (5 days/week) radiation treatments. Interstitial seed implantation is performed under anesthesia. About 80 to 100 seeds are placed with ultrasound guidance, and the patient returns home after the procedure. Exposure of others to radiation is minimal, but close contact with pregnant women and infants should be avoided for up to 2 months. Radiation safety guidelines include straining urine for seeds and using a condom during sexual intercourse for 2 weeks after implantation to catch seeds that may pass through the urethra.

Side effects, which usually are transitory, include inflammation of the rectum, bowel, and bladder (proctitis, enteritis, and cystitis) due to their proximity to the prostate and the radiation doses (Horwitz \& Hanks, 2000; Krumholtz et al., 2000; Ragde, Grado, Nadir et al., 2000). Irritation of the bladder and urethra from radiation therapy can cause pain with urination and during ejaculation until the irritation subsides. There is a greater preservation of sexual potency, however, with radiation therapy than with surgery. For locally advanced prostate cancer, hormonal treatments before and during radiation therapy are frequently used to improve local control and disease-free survival (Lue, 2000).

\section*{HORMONAL THERAPY}

Hormonal therapy is one method used to control rather than cure prostate cancer (Carroll et al., 2001). In the early 1940s, it was determined that most prostate cancers were androgendependent and could be controlled by androgen withdrawal. Hormonal therapy for advanced prostate cancer suppresses androgenic stimuli to the prostate by decreasing the circulating plasma testosterone levels or interrupting the conversion to or

Goal: Ability to resume/enjoy modified sexual functioning
1. Determine from nursing history what effect patient's medical condition is having on his sexual functioning.
2. Inform patient of the effects of prostate surgery, orchiectomy (when applicable), chemotherapy, irradiation, and hormonal therapy on sexual function.
3. Include his partner in developing understanding and in discovering alternative, satisfying close relations with each other.
1. Usually decreased libido and, later, impotence may be experienced.
2. Treatment modalities may alter sexual function, but each is evaluated separately with regard to its effect on a particular patient.
3. Often the bonds between a couple are strengthened with new appreciation and support that had not been evident before the current illness.
- Describes the reasons for changes in sexual functioning
- Discusses with appropriate health care personnel alternative approaches and methods of sexual expression
- Includes partner in discussions related to changes in sexual function

Nursing Diagnosis: Pain related to progression of disease and treatment modalities
Goal: Relief of pain
1. Evaluate nature of patient's pain, its location and intensity using pain rating scale.
2. Avoid activities that aggravate or worsen pain.
3. Because pain is usually related to bone metastasis, ensure that patient's bed has a bed board on a firm mattress. Also, protect the patient from falls/injuries.
4. Provide support for affected extremities.
5. Prepare patient for radiation therapy if prescribed.
6. Administer analgesics or opioids at regularly scheduled intervals as prescribed.
7. Initiate bowel program to prevent constipation.
1. Determining nature and causes of pain and its intensity helps to select proper relief modality and provide baseline for later comparison.
2. Bumping the bed is an example of an action that can intensify the patient's pain.
3. This will provide added support and is more comfortable. Protecting the patient from injury protects him from additional pain.
4. More support, coupled with reduced movement of the part, helps in pain control.
5. Radiation therapy may be effective in controlling pain.
6. Analgesics alter perception of pain and provide comfort. Regularly scheduled analgesics around the clock rather than PRN provide more consistent pain relief.
7. Opioid analgesics and inactivity contribute to constipation.
- Reports relief of pain
- Expects exacerbations, reports their quality and intensity, and obtains relief
- Uses pain relief strategies appropriately and effectively
- Identifies strategies to avoid complications of analgesic use

binding of dihydrotestosterone. As a result, the prostatic epithelium atrophies (decreases). This effect is accomplished either by orchiectomy (removal of the testes) or by the administration of medications.

Orchiectomy lowers plasma testosterone levels because about $93 \%$ of circulating testosterone is of testicular origin ( $7 \%$ is from the adrenal glands). As a result, the testicular stimulus required for continued prostatic growth is removed, resulting prostatic atrophy. Although orchiectomy does not cause the side effects associated with other hormonal therapies, it carries a significant emotional impact.

Estrogen therapy, usually in the form of diethylstilbestrol (DES), has long been used to inhibit the gonadotropins responsible for testicular androgenic activity, thereby removing the androgenic hormone that promotes the growth of the malignancy. DES relieves symptoms of advanced prostate cancer, reduces tumor size, decreases pain from metastatic nodules, and pro-
motes well-being. However, DES significantly increases the risk for thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Other side effects of estrogen therapy include impotence, decreased libido, difficulty in achieving orgasm, decreased sperm production, and gynecomastia (enlargement of breasts in men).

Newer hormonal therapies include the luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists (leuprolide [Lupron] and goserelin [Zoladex]) and antiandrogen agents, such as flutamide (Eulexin). LH-RH suppresses testicular androgen, whereas flutamide causes adrenal androgen suppression (Carroll et al., 2001). Cyproterone acetate is a synthetic progesterone derivative that provides effective, competitive inhibition of androgens at the target cells. In contrast to estrogen, the newer hormonal agents are associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular side effects, gynecomastia, and decreased sexual function. Hot flushing can occur with orchiectomy or LH-RH agonist therapy because these
agents increase hypothalamic activity, which stimulates the thermoregulatory centers of the body.

\section*{OTHER THERAPIES}

Cryosurgery of the prostate is used to ablate prostate cancer in patients who could not physically tolerate surgery or in those with recurrent prostate cancer. Transperineal probes are inserted into the prostate under ultrasound guidance to freeze the tissue directly. Chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide, may also be used.

Keeping the urethral passage patent may require repeated transurethral resections. When this is impractical, catheter drainage is instituted by way of the suprapubic or transurethral route.

For men with advanced prostate cancer, palliative measures are indicated. Although cure is unlikely with advanced prostate cancer, many men survive for long intervals apparently free of metastatic disease. If prostate cancer metastasizes to the bones, these bone lesions can be very painful. Opioid and nonopioid medications are used to control the pain. In addition, externalbeam radiation therapy can be delivered to skeletal lesions to relieve pain. Radiopharmaceuticals, such as strontium-89 and samarium153, can also be intravenously injected to treat multiple sites of bone metastases (Cherney, 2000). Antiandrogen therapies are used in an effort to reduce the circulating androgens. If antiandrogen therapies are not effective, medications such as prednisone and mitoxantrone have been effective in reducing pain and improving quality of life. With advanced prostate cancer, blood transfusions are administered to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels when bone marrow is replaced by tumor.

\section*{THE PATIENT UNDERGOING PROSTATE SURGERY}

Prostate surgery may be indicated for the patient with BPH or prostate cancer. The objectives before prostate surgery are to assess the patient's general health status and to establish optimal renal function. Prostate surgery should be performed before acute urinary retention develops and damages the upper urinary tract and collecting system or, in the case of prostate cancer, before cancer progresses.

\section*{Surgical Procedures}

Several approaches can be used to remove the hypertrophied portion of the prostate gland: transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), suprapubic prostatectomy, perineal prostatectomy, retropubic prostatectomy, and transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) (Table 49-3). In these approaches, the surgeon removes all hyperplastic tissue, leaving behind only the capsule of the prostate. The transurethral approaches (TURP, TUIP) are closed procedures; the other three are open procedures (ie, a surgical incision is required). The procedure chosen depends on the underlying disorder, the patient's age and physical status, and patient preference.

\section*{TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION OF THE PROSTATE}

TURP, the most common procedure used, can be carried out through endoscopy. The surgical and optical instrument is introduced directly through the urethra to the prostate, which can then be viewed directly. The gland is removed in small chips with an electrical cutting loop (Fig. 49-4A). This procedure, which requires no incision, may be used for glands of varying size and is
ideal for patients who have small glands and those who are considered poor surgical risks.

This approach usually requires an overnight hospital stay. Strictures are more frequent, and repeated procedures may be necessary because the residual prostatic tissue can grow back. TURP rarely causes erectile dysfunction, but it may cause retrograde ejaculation because removing the prostatic tissue at the bladder neck can cause the seminal fluid to flow backward into the bladder rather than forward through the urethra during ejaculation.

\section*{SUPRAPUBIC PROSTATECTOMY}

Suprapubic prostatectomy is one method of removing the gland through an abdominal incision. An incision is made into the bladder, and the prostate gland is removed from above (see Fig. $49-4 B$ ). Such an approach can be used for a gland of any size, and few complications occur, although blood loss may be greater than with the other methods. Another disadvantage is the need for an abdominal incision, with the concomitant hazards of any major abdominal surgical procedure.

\section*{PERINEAL PROSTATECTOMY}

Perineal prostatectomy involves removing the gland through an incision in the perineum (see Fig. 49-4C). This approach is practical when other approaches are not possible and is useful for an open biopsy. Postoperatively, the wound may easily become contaminated because the incision is near the rectum. Incontinence, impotence, and rectal injury are more likely with this approach.

\section*{RETROPUBIC PROSTATECTOMY}

Retropubic prostatectomy, another technique, is more common than the suprapubic approach. The surgeon makes a low abdominal incision and approaches the prostate gland between the pubic arch and the bladder without entering the bladder (see Fig. $49-4 D$ ). This procedure is suitable for large glands located high in the pelvis. Although blood loss can be better controlled and the surgical site is easier to visualize, infections can readily start in the retropubic space.

\section*{TRANSURETHRAL INCISION OF THE PROSTATE}

Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) is another procedure used in treating BPH. An instrument is passed through the urethra (see Fig. 49-4E). One or two incisions are made in the prostate and prostate capsule to reduce the prostate's pressure on the urethra and to reduce urethral constriction. TUIP is indicated when the prostate gland is small ( 30 g or less) and is an effective treatment for many cases of BPH. TUIP can be performed on an outpatient basis and has a lower complication rate than other invasive prostate procedures (Mebust, 1998).

\section*{LAPAROSCOPIC RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY}

Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a method recently developed in France. Although not yet widespread in the United States, it is anticipated that this procedure will be widely used in place of more extensive surgery for patients with localized prostate cancer. The laparoscopic approach provides better visualization of the surgical site and surrounding areas. Preliminary data suggest that patients who undergo this procedure have less bleeding and reduced need for blood transfusion, a shorter hospital stay, less postoperative pain, and more rapid return to normal activity compared to open radical prostatectomy (Rassweiler, Sentker, Seemann et al., 2001). Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes.

\section*{Complications}

Complications depend on the type of prostatectomy performed and may include hemorrhage, clot formation, catheter obstruction, and sexual dysfunction. All prostatectomies carry a risk of impotence because of potential damage to the pudendal nerves. In most instances, sexual activity may be resumed in 6 to 8 weeks, the time required for the prostatic fossa to heal. During ejaculation, the seminal fluid goes into the bladder and is excreted with the urine. (The anatomic changes in the posterior urethra lead to retrograde ejaculation.) A vasectomy may be performed during surgery to prevent infection from spreading from the prostatic urethra through the vas and into the epididymis.

After total prostatectomy (usually for cancer), impotence almost always results. For the patient who does not want to give up sexual activity, options are available to produce erections sufficient for sexual intercourse: prosthetic penile implants, negativepressure (vacuum) devices, and pharmacologic interventions (see earlier discussion in this chapter).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING PROSTATECTOMY}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse assesses how the underlying disorder (BPH or prostate cancer) has affected the patient's lifestyle. Has he been reasonably active for his age? What is his presenting urinary problem (described in his own words)? Has he experienced decreased force of urinary flow, decreased ability to initiate voiding, urgency, frequency, nocturia, dysuria, urinary retention, hematuria? Does the patient report associated problems, such as back pain, flank pain, and lower abdominal or suprapubic discomfort? If he reports such discomfort, possible causes include infection, retention, and renal colic. Has he experienced erectile dysfunction or changes in frequency or enjoyment of sexual activity?

The nurse obtains further information about the patient's family history of cancer and heart or kidney disease, including

hypertension. Has he lost weight? Does he appear pale? Can he raise himself out of bed and return to bed without assistance? Can he perform usual activities of daily living? This information will help in determining how soon he will return to normal activities after prostatectomy.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE NURSING DIAGNOSES}
- Anxiety about surgery and its outcome
- Acute pain related to bladder distention
- Deficient knowledge about factors related to the disorder and the treatment protocol

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE NURSING DIAGNOSES}
- Acute pain related to the surgical incision, catheter placement, and bladder spasms
- Deficient knowledge about postoperative care and management

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, the potential complications may include the following:
- Hemorrhage and shock
- Infection
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Catheter obstruction
- Sexual dysfunction

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major preoperative goals for the patient may include reduced anxiety and learning about his prostate disorder and the perioperative experience. The major postoperative goals may include maintenance of fluid volume balance, relief of pain and discomfort, ability to perform self-care activities, and absence of complications.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

The patient is frequently admitted to the hospital on the morning of surgery. Because contact with the patient may be limited before surgery, the nurse must establish communication with the patient to assess his understanding of the diagnosis and of the planned surgical procedure. The nurse clarifies the nature of the surgery and expected postoperative outcomes. In addition, the nurse familiarizes the patient with the pre- and postoperative routines and initiates measures to reduce anxiety. Because the patient may be sensitive and embarrassed discussing problems related to the genitalia and sexuality, the nurse provides privacy and establishes a trusting and professional relationship. Guilt feelings often surface if the patient falsely assumes a cause-and-effect relationship between sexual practices and his current problems. He is encouraged to verbalize his feelings and concerns.

\section*{RELIEVING DISCOMFORT}

If discomfort is present before the day of surgery, the patient is placed on bed rest, analgesic agents are administered, and measures to relieve anxiety are initiated. If the patient is hospitalized, the nurse monitors the patient's voiding patterns, watches for bladder distention, and assists with catheterization if indicated. An indwelling catheter is inserted if the patient has continuing urinary retention or if laboratory test results indicate azotemia (accumulation of nitrogenous waste products in the blood). The catheter can help to decompress the bladder gradually over several days, especially if the patient is elderly and hypertensive and has diminished renal function or an excessive amount of urinary retention that has existed for many weeks. For a few days after the bladder begins draining, the blood pressure may fluctuate and renal function may decline. If the patient cannot tolerate a urinary catheter, he is prepared for a cystostomy (see Chaps. 44 and 45).

\section*{PROVIDING INSTRUCTION}

Before surgery, the nurse reviews with the patient the anatomy of the affected parts and their function in relation to the urinary and reproductive system, using diagrams and other teaching aids if indicated. This is often done either during the preadmission testing visit or in the urologist's office. The nurse explains what will take place as the patient is prepared for diagnostic tests and then for surgery (depending on the kind of prostatectomy planned). The nurse describes the type of incision, which varies with the type of surgical approach (directly over the bladder, low on the abdomen, or in the perineal area; in the case of a transurethral procedure, no incision will be made). The patient is informed about the type of urinary drainage system that is expected, the type of anesthesia, and the recovery room procedure. The amount of information given is based on the patient's needs and questions. Procedures expected during the immediate perioperative period are explained, questions are answered, and support is provided. In addition, the patient is instructed about postoperative use of medications for pain management.

\section*{PREPARING THE PATIENT}

When the patient is scheduled for a prostatectomy, the preoperative preparation described in Chapter 18 is provided. Elastic compression stockings are applied before surgery and are particularly important for prevention of deep vein thrombosis if the patient is placed in a lithotomy position during surgery. An enema is usually administered at home the evening before surgery or the morning of surgery to prevent postoperative straining, which can induce bleeding.

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID BALANCE}

During the postoperative period, the patient is at risk for imbalanced fluid volume because of the irrigation of the surgical site during and after surgery. With irrigation of the urinary catheter to prevent its obstruction by blood clots, fluid may be absorbed through the open surgical site and retained, increasing the risk for excessive fluid retention, fluid imbalance, and water intoxication. The urine output and the amount of fluid used for irrigation must be closely monitored to determine if irrigation fluid is being retained and to ensure an adequate urine output. The patient also is monitored for electrolyte imbalances (ie, hyponatremia), rising blood pressure, confusion, and respiratory distress. The risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalance is increased in elderly patients with preexisting cardiovascular or respiratory disease. These signs and symptoms are documented and reported to the surgeon.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

After a prostatectomy, the patient is assisted to sit and dangle his legs over the side of the bed on the day of surgery. The next morning, he is assisted to ambulate. If pain occurs, the cause and location are determined. It may be related to the incision or may be the result of excoriation of the skin at the catheter site. It may be in the flank area, indicating a kidney problem, or it may be due to bladder spasms. Bladder irritability can initiate bleeding and result in clot formation, leading to urinary retention.

Patients experiencing bladder spasms may note an urgency to void, a feeling of pressure or fullness in the bladder, and bleeding from the urethra around the catheter. Medications that relax the smooth muscles can help to ease the spasms, which can be intermittent and severe; these medications include flavoxate (Urispas) and oxybutynin (Ditropan). Warm compresses to the pubis or sitz baths may also relieve the spasms.

The nurse monitors the drainage tubing and irrigates the system as prescribed to relieve any obstruction that may cause discomfort. Usually, the catheter is irrigated with 50 mL of irrigating fluid at a time. It is important to make sure that the same amount is recovered in the drainage receptacle. Securing the catheter drainage tubing to the leg or abdomen can help to decrease tension on the catheter and prevent bladder irritation. Discomfort may be caused by dressings that are too snug, saturated with drainage, or improperly placed. Analgesic agents are administered as prescribed.

When ambulatory, the patient is encouraged to walk but not to sit for prolonged periods because this increases intra-abdominal pressure and the possibility of discomfort and bleeding. Prune juice and stool softeners are provided to ease bowel movements and to prevent excessive straining. An enema, if prescribed, is administered with caution to avoid rectal perforation.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

After prostatectomy, the patient is monitored for major complications such as hemorrhage, infection, deep vein thrombosis, catheter obstruction, and sexual dysfunction.

\section*{Hemorrhage}

The immediate dangers after a prostatectomy are bleeding and hemorrhagic shock. This risk is increased with BPH because a hyperplastic prostate gland is very vascular. Bleeding may occur from the prostatic bed. Bleeding may also result in the formation of clots, which then obstruct urine flow. The drainage normally begins as reddish-pink and then clears to a light pink within 24 hours after surgery. Bright-red bleeding with increased viscosity and numerous clots usually indicates arterial bleeding. Venous blood appears darker and less viscous. Arterial hemorrhage usually requires surgical intervention (eg, suturing of bleeders or transurethral coagulation of bleeding vessels), whereas venous bleeding may be controlled by applying prescribed traction to the catheter so that the balloon holding the catheter in place applies pressure to the prostatic fossa. The surgeon applies traction by securely taping the catheter to the patient's thigh.

Nursing management includes strategies to stop the bleeding and to prevent or reverse hemorrhagic shock. If blood loss is extensive, fluids and blood component therapy may be administered. If hemorrhagic shock occurs, treatments described in Chapter 15 are initiated.

Nursing interventions include close monitoring of vital signs; administering medications, intravenous fluids, and blood component therapy as prescribed; maintaining an accurate record of intake and output; and careful monitoring of drainage to ensure adequate urine flow and patency of the drainage system. The patient who experiences hemorrhage and his family are often anxious and benefit from explanations and reassurance about the event and the procedures that are performed.

\section*{Infection}

After perineal prostatectomy, the surgeon usually changes the dressing on the first postoperative day. Further dressing changes may become the nurse's responsibility. Careful aseptic technique is used because the possibility for infection is great. Dressings can be held in place by a double-tailed, T-binder bandage or a padded athletic supporter. The tails cross over the incision to give double thickness, and then each tail is drawn up on either side of the scrotum to the waistline and fastened.

Rectal thermometers, rectal tubes, and enemas are avoided because of the risk for injury to and bleeding in the prostatic fossa. After the perineal sutures are removed, the perineum is cleansed as indicated. A heat lamp may be directed to the perineal area to promote healing. The scrotum is protected with a towel while the heat lamp is in use. Sitz baths are also used to promote healing.

Urinary tract infections and epididymitis are possible complications after prostatectomy. The patient is assessed for their occurrence; if they occur, the nurse administers antibiotics as prescribed.

Because the risk for infection continues after discharge from the hospital, the patient and family need to be instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection (fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency). The patient and family are instructed to contact the urologist if these symptoms occur.

\section*{Deep Vein Thrombosis}

Because patients undergoing prostatectomy have a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, the
physician may prescribe prophylactic (preventive) low-dose heparin therapy. The nurse assesses the patient frequently after surgery for manifestations of DVT and applies elastic compression stockings to reduce the risk for DVT and pulmonary embolism. Nursing and medical management of DVT and pulmonary embolism are detailed in Chapters 31 and 23, respectively. The patient who is receiving heparin must be closely monitored for excessive bleeding.

\section*{Obstructed Catheter}

After a TUR, the catheter must drain well; an obstructed catheter produces distention of the prostatic capsule and resultant hemorrhage. Furosemide (Lasix) may be prescribed to promote urination and initiate postoperative diuresis, thereby helping to keep the catheter patent.

The nurse observes the lower abdomen to ensure that the catheter has not become blocked. An overdistended bladder presents a distinct, rounded swelling above the pubis.

The drainage bag, dressings, and incisional site are examined for bleeding. The color of the urine is noted and documented; a change in color from pink to amber indicates reduced bleeding. Blood pressure, pulse, and respirations are monitored and compared with baseline preoperative vital signs to detect hypotension. The nurse also observes the patient for restlessness, cold sweats, pallor, any drop in blood pressure, and an increasing pulse rate.

Drainage of the bladder may be accomplished by gravity through a closed sterile drainage system. A three-way drainage system is useful in irrigating the bladder and preventing clot formation (Fig. 49-5). Continuous irrigation may be used with TUR. Some urologists leave an indwelling catheter attached to a dependent drainage system. Gentle irrigation of the catheter may be prescribed to remove any obstructing clots.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-013.jpg?height=1016&width=864&top_left_y=1541&top_left_x=1025}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 49-5 A three-way system for bladder irrigation.}
\end{figure}

If the patient complains of pain, the tubing is examined. The drainage system is irrigated, if indicated and prescribed, to clear any obstruction. Usually, the catheter is irrigated with 50 mL of irrigating fluid at a time. The amount of fluid recovered in the drainage bag must equal the amount of fluid injected. Overdistention of the bladder is avoided because it can induce secondary hemorrhage by stretching the coagulated blood vessels in the prostatic capsule.

The nurse maintains an intake and output record, including the amount of fluid used for irrigation.

The drainage tube (not the catheter) is taped to the shaved inner thigh to prevent traction on the bladder. If a cystostomy catheter is in place, it is taped to the abdomen. The nurse explains the purpose of the catheter to the patient and assures him that the urge to void results from the presence of the catheter and from bladder spasms. He is cautioned not to pull on the catheter because this causes bleeding and subsequent catheter blockage, which leads to urinary retention.

\section*{Complications With Catheter Removal}

After the catheter is removed (usually when the urine appears clear), urine may leak around the wound for several days in patients who have undergone perineal, suprapubic, and retropubic surgery. The cystostomy tube may be removed before or after the urethral catheter is removed. Some urinary incontinence may occur after catheter removal, and the patient is informed that this is likely to subside in time.

\section*{Sexual Dysfunction}

Depending on the type of surgery, the patient may experience sexual dysfunction related to erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and fatigue. These issues may become a concern of the patient soon after surgery or in the weeks to months during rehabilitation. Erectile dysfunction may occur following prostate surgery. Several options to restore erectile function are discussed with the patient by the surgeon or urologist. These options may include medications, surgically placed implants, or negativepressure devices. A decrease in libido may also occur following surgery and is usually related to the impact of the surgery on the man's body. Reassurance that the usual level of libido will return following recuperation from surgery is often helpful to the patient and his partner. The patient may also experience fatigue during rehabilitation from surgery. This fatigue may also decrease his libido and alter his enjoyment of usual activities.

Nursing interventions include assessing for the presence of sexual dysfunction following surgery. Providing a private and confidential environment to discuss issues of sexuality is important. The emotional challenges of prostate surgery and its consequences need to be carefully explored with the patient and his partner. Providing the opportunity to discuss these issues can be very beneficial to the patient. For patients who demonstrate significant problems adjusting to their sexual dysfunction, a referral to a sex therapist may be indicated.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient undergoing prostatectomy may be discharged within several days. The length of the hospital stay depends on the type of prostatectomy performed. Patients undergoing a perineal prostatectomy are hospitalized for 3 to 5 days. If a retropubic or suprapubic prostatectomy is performed, the hospital stay is 5 to 7 days. The patient and family require instructions about how to
manage the drainage system, how to assess for complications, and how to promote recovery. Verbal and written instructions are provided about the need to maintain the drainage system and to monitor urinary output, about wound care, and about strategies to prevent complications, such as infection, bleeding, and thrombosis. They are informed about signs and symptoms that should be reported to the physician (eg, blood in urine, decreased urine output, fever, change in wound drainage, calf tenderness).

As the patient recovers and drainage tubes are removed, he may become discouraged and depressed because he cannot regain bladder control immediately. Moreover, urinary frequency and burning may occur after the catheter is removed. Teaching the following exercises may help the patient regain urinary control:
- Tense the perineal muscles by pressing the buttocks together; hold this position; relax. This exercise can be performed 10 to 20 times each hour while sitting or standing.
- Try to interrupt the urinary stream after starting to void; wait a few seconds and then continue to void.

Perineal exercises should continue until the patient gains full urinary control. The patient is instructed to urinate as soon as he feels the first urge to do so. It is important for the patient to know that regaining urinary control is a gradual process; he may continue to "dribble" after being discharged from the hospital, but the dribbling should gradually diminish (within up to 1 year). Lining underwear with absorbent pads can help to minimize embarrassing stains on clothing. The urine may be cloudy for several weeks after surgery but should clear as the prostate area heals.

While the prostatic fossa heals ( 6 to 8 weeks), the patient should avoid activities that produce Valsalva effects (straining at stool, heavy lifting) because this increases venous pressure and may produce hematuria. He should avoid long motor trips and strenuous exercise, which increase the tendency to bleed. He should also know that spicy foods, alcohol, and coffee may cause bladder discomfort. The patient is cautioned to drink enough fluids to avoid dehydration, which increases the tendency for a blood clot to form and obstruct the flow of urine. Signs of complications, such as bleeding, passage of blood clots, a decrease in the urinary stream, urinary retention, or urinary tract infection symptoms, should be reported to the physician (Chart 49-3).

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care may be indicated if the patient is elderly or has other health problems, if the patient and family cannot provide care in the home, or if the patient lives alone without available supports. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical status (cardiovascular and respiratory status, fluid and nutritional status, patency of the urinary drainage system, wound and nutritional status) and provides catheter and wound care, if indicated. The nurse reinforces previous teaching and assesses the ability of the patient and family to manage required care. The home care nurse encourages the patient to ambulate and to carry out perineal exercises as prescribed. The patient may need to be reminded that return of bladder control may take time.

The patient is reminded about the importance of participating in routine health screening and other health promotion activities. If the prostatectomy was performed to treat prostate cancer, the patient and family are also instructed about the importance of follow-up and monitoring with the physician.

\section*{Conditions Affecting the Testes and Adjacent Structures}

\section*{UNDESCENDED TESTIS (CRYPTORCHIDISM)}

Cryptorchidism is a congenital condition characterized by failure of one or both of the testes to descend into the scrotum. One or both testes may be absent. The testis may be located in the abdominal cavity or inguinal canal. If the testis does not descend as the boy matures, a surgical procedure known as orchiopexy is performed to position it properly. An incision is made over the in-
guinal canal, and the testis is brought down and anchored in the scrotum.

\section*{ORCHITIS}

Orchitis is an inflammation of the testes (testicular congestion) caused by pyogenic, viral, spirochetal, parasitic, traumatic, chemical, or unknown factors. Mumps is one such factor. Mumps vaccination is recommended for postpubertal men who have not been infected. When postpubertal men contract mumps, about one in five develops some form of orchitis 4 to 7 days after the jaw and neck swell. The testis may show some atrophy. In the past, sterility and impotence often resulted. Today, a man who has never had mumps and who is exposed to the disease receives gamma-globulin immediately; the disease is likely to be less severe, with minimal or no complications.

\section*{Medical Management}

If the cause of orchitis is bacterial, viral, or fungal, therapy is directed at the specific infecting organism. Rest, elevation of the scrotum, ice packs to reduce scrotal edema, antibiotics, analgesic agents, and anti-inflammatory medications are recommended.

\section*{EPIDIDYMITIS}

Epididymitis is an infection of the epididymis that usually descends from an infected prostate or urinary tract. It may also develop as a complication of gonorrhea. In men younger than age 35, the major cause of epididymitis is Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection passes upward through the urethra and the ejaculatory duct and then along the vas deferens to the epididymis.

The patient complains of unilateral pain and soreness in the inguinal canal along the course of the vas deferens and then develops pain and swelling in the scrotum and the groin. The epididymis becomes swollen and extremely painful; the patient's temperature is elevated. The urine may contain pus (pyuria) and bacteria (bacteriuria), and the patient may experience chills and fever.

\section*{Medical Management}

If the patient is seen within the first 24 hours after onset of pain, the spermatic cord may be infiltrated with a local anesthetic agent to relieve pain. If the epididymitis is from a chlamydial infection, the patient and his sexual partner must be treated with antibiotics. The patient is observed for abscess formation as well. If no
improvement occurs within 2 weeks, an underlying testicular tumor should be considered. An epididymectomy (excision of the epididymis from the testis) may be performed for patients with recurrent, incapacitating episodes of epididymitis or for those with chronic, painful conditions. With long-term epididymitis, the passage of sperm may be obstructed. If the obstruction is bilateral, infertility may result.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient is placed on bed rest, and the scrotum is elevated with a scrotal bridge or folded towel to prevent traction on the spermatic cord and to promote venous drainage and relieve pain. Antimicrobial agents are administered as prescribed until the acute inflammation subsides. Intermittent cold compresses to the scrotum may help ease the pain. Later, local heat or sitz baths may help resolve the inflammation. Analgesic medications are administered for pain relief as prescribed.

The nurse instructs the patient to avoid straining, lifting, and sexual stimulation until the infection is under control. He should continue taking analgesic agents and antibiotics as prescribed and using ice packs if necessary to relieve discomfort. He needs to know that it may take 4 weeks or longer for the epididymis to return to normal.

\section*{TESTICULAR CANCER}

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men 15 to 35 years of age. Although testicular cancer occurs most often between the ages of 15 and 40, it can occur in males of any age. It is a highly treatable and usually curable form of cancer. An estimated 7,500 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year, and approximately 400 die from testicular cancer annually (American Cancer Society, 2002).

The testicles contain several types of cells, each of which may develop into one or more types of cancer. The type of cancer determines the appropriate treatment and affects the prognosis. Testicular cancers are classified as germinal or nongerminal (stromal); secondary testicular cancers may also occur.

\section*{Germinal Tumors}

Over 90\% of all cancers of the testicle are germinal; geminal tumors may be further classified as seminomas or nonseminomas. About half of all geminal tumors are seminomas, or tumors that develop from the sperm-producing cells of the testes. Nonseminoma germinal cell tumors tend to develop earlier in life than seminomas, usually occurring in men in their 20s. Examples of nonseminomas include teratocarcinomas, choriocarcinomas, yolk sac carcinomas, and embryonal carcinomas. Seminomas tend to remain localized, whereas nonseminomatous tumors grow quickly.

\section*{Nongerminal Tumors}

Testicular cancer may also develop in the supportive and hormoneproducing tissues, or stroma, of the testicles. These tumors account for about $4 \%$ of testicular tumors in adults and $20 \%$ of testicular tumors in children. The two main types of stromal tumors are Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors. Although these tumors infrequently spread beyond the testicle, a small number of these tumors metastasize and tend to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

\section*{Secondary Testicular Tumors}

Secondary testicular tumors are those that have metastasized to the testicle from other organs. Lymphoma is the most common cause of secondary testicular cancer. Cancers may also spread to the testicles from the prostate gland, lung, skin (melanoma), kidney, and other organs. The prognosis for these cancers is usually poor because these cancers generally also spread to other organs. Treatment depends on the specific type of cancer (American Cancer Society, 2002).

\section*{Risk Factors}

The risk for testicular cancer is several times greater in men with any type of undescended testis than in the general population (Bosl, Bajorin, Scheinfeld et al., 2001). Risk factors include a family history of testicular cancer and cancer of one testicle, which increases the risk for the other testicle. Race and ethnicity have been identified as risk factors: Caucasian American men have a five times greater risk than that of African American men and more than double the risk of Asian American men. Occupational hazards, including exposure to chemicals encountered in mining, oil and gas production, and leather processing, have been suggested as possible risk factors. Prenatal exposure to DES may also be a risk factor, but evidence is not strong (American Cancer Society, 2002). Vasectomy, once considered a possible risk factor, has been shown in recent studies not to be a risk factor (Cox, Sneyd, Paul et al., 2002).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms appear gradually, with a mass or lump on the testicle and generally painless enlargement of the testis. The patient may complain of heaviness in the scrotum, inguinal area, or lower abdomen. Backache (from retroperitoneal node extension), abdominal pain, weight loss, and general weakness may result from metastasis. Enlargement of the testis without pain is a significant diagnostic finding. Testicular tumors tend to metastasize early, spreading from the testis to the lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and to the lungs.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Monthly testicular self-examinations (TSEs) are effective in detecting testicular cancer (Chart 49-4). Teaching men of all ages to perform TSE is an important health promotion intervention for early detection of testicular cancer. Since testicular cancer occurs most often in young adults, testicular self-examination should begin during adolescence.

Human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein are tumor markers that may be elevated in patients with testicular cancer. (Tumor markers are substances synthesized by the tumor cells and released into the circulation in abnormal amounts.) Tumor marker levels in the blood are used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring the response to treatment. Other diagnostic tests include intravenous urography to detect any ureteral deviation caused by a tumor mass; lymphangiography to assess the extent of tumor spread to the lymphatic system; ultrasound to determine the presence and size of the testicular mass; and CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to determine the extent of the disease in the lungs, retroperitoneum, and pelvis. Microscopic analysis of tissue is the only definitive way to determine if

\section*{Chart 49-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION}

\section*{Testicular Self-Examination}

Testicular self-examination (TSE) is to be performed once a month. The test is neither difficult nor timeconsuming. A convenient time is usually after a warm bath or shower when the scrotum is more relaxed.

1. Use both hands to palpate the testis. The normal testicle is smooth and uniform in consistency.
2. With the index and middle fingers under the testis and the thumb on top, roll the testis gently in a horizontal plane between the thumb and fingers (A).
3. Feel for any evidence of a small lump or abnormality.
4. Follow the same procedure and palpate upward along the testis (B).
5. Locate and palpate the epididymis (C), a cord-like structure on the top and back of the testicle that stores and transports sperm. Also locate and palpate the spermatic cord.
6. Repeat the examination for the other testis, epididymis, and spermatic cord. It is normal to find that one testis is larger than the other.
7. If you find any evidence of a small, pea-like lump or if the testis is swollen (possibly from an infection or tumor), consult your physician.
cancer is present but is usually performed at the time of surgery rather than as a part of the diagnostic workup to reduce the risk of promoting spread of the cancer (American Cancer Society, 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

Testicular cancer is one of the most curable solid tumors. The goals of management are to eradicate the disease and achieve a cure. Treatment selection is based on the cell type and the anatomic extent of the disease. The testis is removed by orchiectomy through an inguinal incision with a high ligation of the spermatic cord. A gel-filled prosthesis can be implanted. After unilateral orchiectomy for testicular cancer, most patients experience no impairment of endocrine function. Other patients, however, have decreased hormonal levels, suggesting that the unaffected testis is not functioning at normal levels. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection to prevent lymphatic spread of the cancer may be performed after orchiectomy. Although libido and orgasm are usually unimpaired after retroperitoneal lymph node
dissection, the patient may develop ejaculatory dysfunction with resultant infertility. Thus, sperm banking before surgery may be considered (Agarwa, 2000; Zapzalka et al., 1999).

Postoperative irradiation of the lymph nodes from the diaphragm to the iliac region is used in treating seminomas. Radiation is delivered only to the affected side; the other testis is shielded from radiation to preserve fertility. Radiation is also used for patients whose disease does not respond to chemotherapy or for whom lymph node surgery is not recommended. Lymphangiograms and CT scans are used to determine spread of the disease to the lymph nodes.

Testicular carcinomas are highly responsive to chemotherapy. (Bosl et al., 2001) Chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens results in a high percentage of complete remissions. Good results may be obtained by combining different types of treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Even with disseminated testicular cancer, the prognosis is favorable, and the disease is probably curable because of advances in diagnosis and treatment.

A patient with a history of one testicular tumor has a greater chance of developing subsequent tumors. Follow-up studies include chest x-rays, excretory urography, radioimmunoassay of human chorionic gonadotropins and alpha-fetoprotein levels, and examination of lymph nodes to detect recurrent malignancy.

Long-term side effects associated with treatments for testicular cancer include kidney damage, hearing problems, gonadal damage, neurological changes, and rarely secondary cancers (Kollmannsberger, Kuzcyk, Mayer et al., 1999). Research on treatment regimens with less toxicity and the use of cytoprotectants is ongoing.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management includes assessment of the patient's physical and psychological status and monitoring the patient for response to and possible effects of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (see Chap. 16). Pre- and postoperative care is described in Chapters 18 and 19, respectively. In addition, because the patient may have difficulty coping with his condition, issues related to body image and sexuality are addressed. He needs encouragement to maintain a positive attitude during what may be a long course of therapy. He also needs to know that radiation therapy will not necessarily prevent him from fathering children, nor does unilateral excision of a testis necessarily decrease virility. The nurse reminds the patient about the importance of performing TSE and keeping follow-up appointments with the physician. The patient is also encouraged to participate in health promotion and health screening activities.

\section*{HYDROCELE}

A hydrocele is a collection of fluid, generally in the tunica vaginalis of the testis, although it may also collect within the spermatic cord. The tunica vaginalis becomes widely distended with fluid. Hydrocele can be differentiated from a hernia by transillumination; a hydrocele transmits light, whereas a hernia does not. Hydrocele may be acute or chronic. Acute hydrocele may occur in association with acute infectious diseases of the epididymis or as a result of local injury or systemic infectious diseases, such as mumps. The cause of chronic hydrocele is unknown.

Usually, therapy is not required. Treatment is necessary only if the hydrocele becomes tense and compromises testicular circulation or if the scrotal mass becomes large, uncomfortable, or embarrassing. In the surgical treatment of hydrocele, an incision is made through the wall of the scrotum down to the distended tunica vaginalis. The sac is resected or, after being opened, is sutured together to collapse the wall. Postoperatively, the patient wears an athletic supporter for comfort and support. The major complication is hematoma in the loose scrotal tissues.

\section*{VARICOCELE}

A varicocele is an abnormal dilation of the veins of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum (the network of veins from the testis and the epididymis that constitute part of the spermatic cord). Varicoceles usually occur in the veins on the upper portion of the left testicle in adults. In some men, a varicocele has been associated with infertility. Few, if any, subjective symptoms may be produced by the enlarged spermatic vein, and no treatment is required unless fertility is a concern. Symptomatic varicocele (pain, tenderness, and discomfort in the inguinal region) is corrected surgically by ligating the external spermatic vein at the inguinal area. An ice pack
may be applied to the scrotum for the first few hours after surgery to relieve edema. The patient then wears a scrotal supporter.

\section*{VASECTOMY}

Vasectomy, or male sterilization, is the ligation and transection of part of the vas deferens, with or without removal of a segment of the vas deferens. To prevent the passage of the sperm from the testes, the vas deferens is exposed through a surgical opening in the scrotum or a puncture using a sharp, curved hemostat (Fig. 49-6). The severed ends are occluded with ligatures or clips, or the lumen of each vas deferens is sealed by cautery. The spermatozoa, which are manufactured in the testes, cannot travel up the vas deferens after this surgery.

Because seminal fluid is manufactured predominantly in the seminal vesicles and prostate gland, which are unaffected by vasectomy, no noticeable decrease occurs in the amount of ejaculate even though it contains no spermatozoa. Because the sperm cells have no exit, they are resorbed into the body. This procedure has no effect on sexual potency, erection, ejaculation, or production of male hormones and provides no protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

Couples who were worried about pregnancy resulting from contraceptive failure often report a decrease in concern and an increase in spontaneous sexual arousal after vasectomy. Concise and factual preoperative explanations may minimize or relieve the patient's concerns related to masculinity. Although a relationship between vasectomy and autoimmune disorders and prostatic cancer has been suggested, there is no clinical evidence of either.

The patient is advised that he will be sterile but that potency will not be altered after a bilateral vasectomy. As with any surgical procedure, a surgical consent form must be signed. On rare occasions, a spontaneous reanastomosis of the vas deferens occurs, making it possible to impregnate a partner.

Complications of vasectomy include scrotal ecchymoses and swelling, superficial wound infection, vasitis (inflammation of the vas deferens), epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, hematomas, and spermatic granuloma. A spermatic granuloma is an inflammatory response to the collection of sperm leaking into the scrotum from the severed end of the proximal vas deferens. This can initiate recanalization of the vas deferens, making pregnancy possible.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-018.jpg?height=477&width=872&top_left_y=1861&top_left_x=1113)

EIGURE 49-6 A vasectomy is a resection of the vas deferens to prevent passage of sperm from the testes to the urethra during ejaculation. (A) An incision or small puncture is made to expose the vas deferens. (B) The vas deferens is isolated and severed. (C) The severed ends are occluded with ligatures or clips, or the lumen of each vas is sealed by electrocautery and the incision is sutured closed. (Suturing may not be required if a puncture approach has been used.)

\section*{Nursing Management}

Ice bags are applied intermittently to the scrotum for several hours after surgery to reduce swelling and to relieve discomfort. The nurse advises the patient to wear cotton, Jockey-type briefs for added comfort and support. He may become greatly concerned about the discoloration of the scrotal skin and superficial swelling. These are temporary conditions that occur frequently after vasectomy and may be relieved by sitz baths.

Sexual intercourse may be resumed as desired, although fertility remains for a varying time after vasectomy until the spermatozoa stored distal to the severed vas deferens have been evacuated. Other methods of contraception should be used until infertility is confirmed by an examination of ejaculate. Some physicians examine a specimen 4 weeks after the vasectomy to determine sterility; others examine two consecutive specimens 1 month apart; and still others consider a patient sterile after 36 ejaculations.

\section*{Vasovasostomy (Sterilization Reversal)}

Microsurgical techniques are used to reverse a vasectomy (vasovasostomy), thus restoring patency to the vas deferens. Many men have sperm in their ejaculate after a reversal, and $40 \%$ to $75 \%$ can impregnate a partner.

\section*{Banking Sperm}

Storing fertile semen in a sperm bank before a vasectomy is an option for men who face an unforeseen life event that may cause them to want to father a child at a later time. In addition, if a man is about to undergo a procedure or treatment (eg, radiation therapy to the pelvis or chemotherapy) that may affect his fertility, sperm banking may be considered. This procedure usually requires several visits to the facility where the sperm is stored under hypothermic conditions. The semen is produced by masturbation and collected in a sterile container for storage.

\section*{Conditions Affecting the Penis}

\section*{HYPOSPADIAS AND EPISPADIAS}

Hypospadias and epispadias are congenital anomalies of the urethral opening. In hypospadias, the urethral opening is a groove on the underside of the penis. In epispadias, the urethral opening is on the dorsum. These anatomic abnormalities may be repaired by various types of plastic surgery, usually when the boy is very young.

\section*{PHIMOSIS}

Phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin is constricted so that it cannot be retracted over the glans, can occur congenitally or from inflammation and edema. With the trend away from routine circumcision of newborns, early instruction should be given about cleansing the prepuce. If the preputial area is not cleaned, normal secretions accumulate, causing inflammation (balanitis), which can lead to adhesions and fibrosis. The thickened secretions become encrusted with urinary salts and calcify, forming calculi in the prepuce. In elderly men, penile carcinoma may develop. Phimosis is corrected by circumcision (see later discussion).

Paraphimosis is a condition in which the foreskin is retracted behind the glans and, because of narrowness and subsequent
edema, cannot be returned to its usual position (covering the glans). Paraphimosis is treated by firmly compressing the glans to reduce its size and then pushing the glans back while simultaneously moving the prepuce forward (manual reduction). Circumcision is usually indicated after the inflammation and edema subside.

\section*{CANCER OF THE PENIS}

Penile cancer occurs in men older than age 60 and represents about $0.5 \%$ of malignancies in men in the United States (Stadler, Vogelzang, Elwell \& Jones, 2000). In some countries, however, the incidence is $10 \%$ to $12 \%$. Since most penile cancers occur in uncircumcised men, it has been suggested that the etiology of this cancer may be the irritative effect of smegma and poor hygiene. However, the "protective" effect of circumcision is seen only in males who are circumcised in the neonatal period; circumcision that occurs at puberty or after does not confer the same benefit (Herr et al., 2001). Cancer of the penis appears on the skin of the penis as a painless, wartlike growth or ulcer. Cancer of the penis can involve the glans, the coronal sulcus under the prepuce, the corporal bodies, the urethra, and regional or distant lymph nodes. Bowen's disease is a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the penile shaft. Typically, a man delays seeking treatment for more than a year, probably because of guilt, embarrassment, or ignorance.

\section*{Prevention}

Circumcision in infancy almost eliminates the possibility of penile cancer because chronic irritation and inflammation of the glans penis predispose to penile tumors (Herr et al., 2001; Pettaway \& Dinney, 2001; Schoen et al., 2000). In uncircumcised men, personal hygiene is an important preventive measure.

\section*{Medical Management}

Smaller lesions involving only the skin may be controlled by excision (Herr et al., 2001). Topical chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil cream is an option in selected patients. Radiation therapy is used to treat small squamous cell carcinomas of the penis or for palliation in advanced tumors or lymph node metastasis. Partial penectomy (removal of the penis) is preferred to total penectomy if possible; about $40 \%$ of patients can then participate in sexual intercourse and stand for urination. The shaft of the penis can still respond to sexual arousal with an erection and has the sensory capacity for orgasm and ejaculation. Total penectomy is indicated when the tumor is not amenable to conservative treatment. After a total penectomy, the patient may still experience orgasm with stimulation of the perineum and scrotal area.

\section*{PRIAPISM}

Priapism is an uncontrolled, persistent erection of the penis that causes the penis to become large, hard, and painful. It occurs from either neural or vascular causes, including sickle cell thrombosis, leukemic cell infiltration, spinal cord tumors or injury, and tumor invasion of the penis or its vessels. It may also occur with use of medications that affect the central nervous system, antihypertensive agents, antidepressant medications, and substances injected into the penis to treat erectile dysfunction. This condition may result in gangrene and often results in impotence, whether treated or not.

Priapism is a urologic emergency. The goal of therapy is to improve venous drainage of the corpora cavernosa to prevent is-
chemia, fibrosis, and impotence. The initial treatment is directed at relieving the erection and includes bed rest and sedation. The corpora may be irrigated with an anticoagulant, which allows stagnant blood to be aspirated. Shunting procedures to divert the blood from the turgid corpora cavernosa to the venous system (corpora cavernosa-saphenous vein shunt) or into the corpus spongiosum-glans penis compartment may be attempted.

\section*{PEYRONIE'S DISEASE}

Peyronie's disease involves the buildup of fibrous plaques in the sheath of the corpus cavernosum. These plaques are not visible when the penis is relaxed. When erect, however, curvature of the penis occurs that can be painful and can make sexual intercourse difficult or impossible. Peyronie's disease primarily occurs in middle-aged and older men. Although the plaques may shrink over time, surgical removal of the plaques may be necessary.

\section*{URETHRAL STRICTURE}

Urethral stricture is a condition in which a section of the urethra is narrowed. It can occur congenitally or from a scar along the urethra. Traumatic injury to the urethra (for example, from instrumentation or infections) can result in strictures. Treatment involves dilation of the urethra or, in severe cases, urethrotomy (surgical removal of the stricture).

\section*{CIRCUMCISION}

Circumcision is the excision of the foreskin, or prepuce, of the glans penis. It is usually performed in infancy. In adults, it is part of the treatment for phimosis, paraphimosis, and recurrent infections of the glans and foreskin and may be performed at the personal desire of the patient.

Postoperatively, a petrolatum (Vaseline) gauze dressing is applied and changed as indicated. The patient is observed for bleeding. Because considerable pain may occur after circumcision, analgesic agents are administered as needed.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. During a community health fair, you are approached by a 49-year-old African American man who asks you about his risks for prostate cancer. Develop a plan to address this issue with him at the health fair and provide the rationale for your plan. How would your responses differ if you saw the patient during an office visit to follow up an elevated PSA test result?
2. One of your patients, a 44-year-old man with multiple sclerosis, asks you about Viagra. What information would you give him about Viagra, and what teaching approach would you use? How would your approach differ if your patient were a 56 -year-old man with long-standing diabetes? If your patient were a 68 -year-old man with coronary artery disease?
3. You are caring for two patients who have undergone prostatectomy. One has had surgery to treat BPH and the other to treat prostate cancer. How would your care differ for these two patients? How would the patient's underlying disorder alter your hospital care and your discharge planning?
4. A 34-year-old man is seeking treatment for an STD. When you are obtaining the health history, he reports that this is his fifth or sixth episode of STD. In addition to assisting with medical management and follow-up, what other interventions would you consider for this patient? What strategies would you suggest to him to reduce his risk for subsequent STDs and the risk of transmitting an STD to his sexual partner? How would your teaching differ if the patient revealed that he had sex with men only?
5. During a routine pre-employment physical examination, a 23-year-old man is found to have a mass in the left testicle. He dismisses its significance, saying that it is nothing to be concerned about and that he cannot interrupt his plans to have it evaluated, as he will be getting married in a month and beginning a new job. What information would you provide to the patient at this time? What explanation would you give to him about the evaluation of the testicular mass and possible outcomes?

\section*{Assessment of Immune Function}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the body's general immune responses.
2. Discuss the stages of the immune response.
3. Differentiate between cellular and humoral immune responses.
4. Describe the effects of the following variables on function of the immune system: age, gender, nutrition, psychoneuroimmunology, concurrent illness, cancer, medications, and radiation.
5. Use assessment parameters for determining the status of immune function.

$T_{h}$he immune system functions as the body's defense mechanism against invasion. The term immunity refers to the body's specific protective response to an invading foreign agent or organism. Immune function is affected by age and by a variety of other factors, such as central nervous system function, emotional status, medications, the stress of illness, trauma, and surgery. Dysfunctions involving the immune system occur across the life span. Many are genetically based; others are acquired. The term immunopathology refers to the study of diseases resulting from dysfunctions within the immune system. Disorders of the immune system may stem from excesses or deficiencies of immunocompetent cells, alterations in the function of these cells, immunologic attack on self-antigens, or inappropriate or exaggerated responses to specific antigens (Table 50-1).

To gain insight into immunopathology and the growing number of immunologic-based disorders and to assess and care for people with immunologic disorders, the nurse needs a sound knowledge base of the immune system and how it functions.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM}

The immune system comprises cells and molecules with specialized roles in defending against infection and invasion by other organisms. Its major components include the bone marrow, the white blood cells (WBCs) produced by the bone marrow, and the lymphoid tissues. Lymphoid tissues include the thymus gland, the spleen, the lymph nodes, the tonsils and adenoids, and similar tissues in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive systems (Fig. 50-1).

\section*{Bone Marrow}

The bone marrow is the production site of the WBCs involved in immunity (Fig. 50-2). Like other blood cells, lymphocytes are generated from stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells. De-

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 50-1 - Immune System Disorders} \\
\hline DISORDER & DESCRIPTION \\
\hline Autoimmunity & Normal protective immune response paradoxically turns against or attacks the body, leading to tissue damage \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Immune deficiencies} \\
\hline Primary & Deficiency results from improper development of immune cells or tissues, usually with a genetic basis \\
\hline Secondary & Deficiency results from some interference with an already developed immune system \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
scendants of stem cells become lymphocytes, the B lymphocytes (B cells), and the T lymphocytes ( T cells) (Fig. 50-3). B lymphocytes mature in the bone marrow and then enter the circulation. T lymphocytes move from the bone marrow to the thymus, where they mature into several kinds of cells capable of different functions.

\section*{Lymphoid Tissues}

The spleen, composed of red and white pulp, acts somewhat like a filter. The red pulp is the site where old and injured red blood cells are destroyed. The white pulp contains concentrations of lymphocytes. The lymph nodes are distributed throughout the body. They are connected by lymph channels and capillaries, which remove foreign material from the lymph before it enters the bloodstream. The lymph nodes also serve as centers for immune cell proliferation. The remaining lymphoid tissues, such as the tonsils and adenoids and other mucoid lymphatic tissues,
agglutination: clumping effect occurring when an antibody acts as a cross-link between two antigens
antibody: a protein substance developed by the body in response to and interacting with a specific antigen
antigen: substance that induces the production of antibodies
apoptosis: programmed cell death that results from the digestion of DNA by endonucleases
B cells: cells that are important in producing circulating antibodies
cellular immune response: the immune system's third line of defense, involving the attack of pathogens by T cells
complement: series of enzymatic proteins in the serum that, when activated, destroy bacteria and other cells
cytokines: generic term for non-antibody proteins that act as intercellular mediators, as in the generation of immune response
cytotoxic T cells: lymphocytes that lyse cells infected with virus; also play a role in graft rejection
genetic engineering: emerging technology designed to enable replacement of missing or defective genes
helper T cells: lymphocytes that attack foreign invaders (antigens) directly
humoral immune response: the immune system's second line of defense; often termed the antibody response
immunity: the body's specific protective response to an invading foreign agent or organism
immunopathology: study of diseases resulting in dysfunctions within the immune system
immunoregulation: complex system of checks and balances that regulates or controls immune responses
interferons: proteins formed when cells are exposed to viral or foreign agents; capable of activating other components of the immune system
lymphokines: substances released by sensitized lymphocytes when they contact specific antigens
memory cells: cells that are responsible for recognizing antigens from previous exposure and mounting an immune response
natural killer cells (NK cells): lymphocytes that defend against microorganisms and malignant cells
null lymphocytes: lymphocytes that destroy antigens already coated with the antibody
opsonization: the coating of antigen-antibody molecules with a sticky substance to facilitate phagocytosis
phagocytic cells: cells that engulf, ingest, and destroy foreign bodies or toxins
phagocytic immune response: the immune system's first line of defense, involving white blood cells that have the ability to ingest foreign particles
stem cells: precursors of all blood cells; reside primarily in bone marrow
suppressor T cells: lymphocytes that decrease B-cell activity to a level at which the immune system is compatible with life

\section*{IMMUNE FUNCTION: DEFENSES AND RESPONSES}

There are two general types of immunity: natural (innate) and acquired (adaptive). Natural immunity is a nonspecific immunity present at birth. Acquired or specific immunity develops after birth. Natural immune responses to a foreign invader are very similar from one encounter to the next regardless of the number of times the invader is encountered; in contrast, acquired responses increase in intensity with repeated exposure to the invading agent (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a). Although each type of immunity plays a distinct role in defending the body against harmful invaders, the various components usually act in an interdependent manner.

\section*{Natural Immunity}

Natural (innate) immunity provides a nonspecific response to any foreign invader, regardless of the invader's composition. The basis of natural defense mechanisms is the ability to distinguish between friend and foe or "self" and "nonself." Such natural mechanisms
include physical and chemical barriers, the action of WBCs, and inflammatory responses.

\section*{PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL BARRIERS}

Physical surface barriers include intact skin and mucous membranes, which prevent pathogens from gaining access to the body, and the cilia of the respiratory tract along with coughing and sneezing responses, which act to filter and clear pathogens from the upper respiratory tract before they can invade the body further. Chemical barriers, such as acidic gastric secretions, mucus, enzymes in tears and saliva, and substances in sebaceous and sweat secretions, act in a nonspecific way to destroy invading bacteria and fungi. Viruses are countered by other means, such as interferon. Interferon, one type of biologic response modifier, is a nonspecific viricidal protein naturally produced by the body that is capable of activating other components of the immune system.

\section*{WHITE BLOOD CELL ACTION}

WBCs, or leukocytes, participate in both the natural and the acquired immune responses. Granular leukocytes, or granulocytes (so called because of granules in their cytoplasm), fight invasion by foreign bodies or toxins by releasing cell mediators, such as histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins, and engulfing the foreign bodies or toxins. Granulocytes include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.

Neutrophils (also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or PMNs, because their nuclei have multiple lobes) are the first cells to arrive at the site where inflammation occurs. Eosinophils and basophils, other types of granulocytes, increase in number during allergic reactions and stress responses. Nongranular leukocytes include monocytes or macrophages (referred to as histiocytes when they enter tissue spaces) and lymphocytes. Monocytes also function as phagocytic cells, engulfing, ingesting, and destroying greater numbers and quantities of foreign bodies or toxins than granulocytes. Lymphocytes, consisting of B cells and T cells, play major roles in humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. About $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of lymphocytes in the blood are T cells, and about $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ are B cells (Porth, 2002).

\section*{INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE}

The inflammatory response is a major function of the natural (nonspecific or innate) immune system elicited in response to tissue injury or invading organisms. Chemical mediators assist this response by minimizing blood loss, walling off the invading organism, activating phagocytes, and promoting formation of fibrous scar tissue and regeneration of injured tissue. (The inflammatory response is discussed further in Chap. 6.)

Dysfunction of the natural immune system can occur when the immune components are inactivated or when they remain active long after their effects are beneficial. Immunodeficiencies are characterized by inactivation or impairment of immune components, and disorders with an inflammatory component (eg, asthma, allergy, arthritis) are characterized by persistent inflammatory responses (Medahitov \& Janeway, 2000). The immune system's recognition of one's own tissues as "foreign" rather than as self is the basis for many autoimmune disorders.

\section*{Acquired Immunity}

Acquired (adaptive) immunity-immunologic responses acquired during life but not present at birth-usually develops as a result of prior exposure to an antigen through immunization (vaccination) or by contracting a disease, both of which generate a protective

immune response. Weeks or months after exposure to the disease or vaccine, the body produces an immune response that is sufficient to defend against the disease upon re-exposure to it.

The two types of acquired immunity are known as active and passive. In active acquired immunity, the immunologic defenses are developed by the person's own body. This immunity generally lasts many years or even a lifetime.

Passive acquired immunity is temporary immunity transmitted from another source that has developed immunity through previous disease or immunization. For example, immune globulin and antiserum, obtained from the blood plasma of people with acquired immunity, are used in emergencies to provide immunity to diseases when the risk for contracting a specific disease is great and there is not enough time for a person to develop adequate active immunity. For example, immune globulin may be administered to those exposed to hepatitis. Immunity resulting from the transfer of antibodies from the mother to an infant in utero or through breastfeeding is another example of passive immunity. Active and passive acquired immunity involve humoral and cellular (cell-mediated) immunologic responses (described later in this chapter) (Ada, 2001).

\section*{Response to Invasion}

When the body is invaded or attacked by bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens, it has three means of defending itself:
- The phagocytic immune response
- The humoral or antibody immune response
- The cellular immune response

The first line of defense, the phagocytic immune response, involves the WBCs (granulocytes and macrophages), which have the ability to ingest foreign particles. These cells move to the point of attack, where they engulf and destroy the invading agents. Phagocytes also remove the body's own dying or dead cells. Cells in necrotic tissue that are dying release substances that trigger an inflammatory response. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the body's way of destroying unwanted cells such as cancer cells or cells that die a natural death. Apoptosis involves the digestion of DNA by endonucleases, resulting in the cells being targeted for phagocytosis (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a).

Unlike macrophages, eosinophils are only weakly phagocytic. On activation, eosinophils probably kill parasites by releasing specific chemical mediators into the extracellular fluid. Additionally, they secrete leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and various cytokines (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a).

A second protective response, the humoral immune response (sometimes called the antibody response), begins with the B lymphocytes, which can transform themselves into plasma cells that manufacture antibodies. These antibodies, highly specific proteins, are transported in the bloodstream and attempt to disable

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
the invaders. The third mechanism of defense, the cellular immune response, also involves the T lymphocytes, which can turn into special cytotoxic (or killer) T cells that can attack the pathogens themselves.

The part of the invading or attacking organism that is responsible for stimulating antibody production is called an antigen (or an immunogen). For example, an antigen can be a small patch of proteins on the outer surface of the microorganism. Not all antigens are naturally immunogenic and must be coupled to other molecules to stimulate the immune response. A single bacterium, even a single large molecule, such as a toxin (diphtheria or tetanus toxin), may have several such antigens, or markers, on its surface, thus inducing the body to produce a number of different antibodies. Once produced, an antibody is released into the bloodstream and carried to the attacking organism. There it combines with the antigen, binding with it like an interlocking piece of a jigsaw puzzle (Fig. 50-4). There are four well-defined stages in an immune response: recognition, proliferation, response, and effector.

\section*{RECOGNITION STAGE}

Recognition of antigens as foreign, or nonself, by the immune system is the initiating event in any immune response. The body

Fehder, W. P., \& Gennaro, S. G. (1998). Immune alterations associated with epidural anesthesia for labor and delivery. Maternal Child Health Nursing, 23(6), 292-299

\section*{Purpose}

Epidural anesthesia is a common form of analgesia and anesthesia used for women in labor. Although epidural anesthesia is regarded as safe, the results of studies have suggested that epidural anesthesia may be associated with alterations in white blood cell counts. The purpose of this study was to determine if epidural anesthesia is associated with alterations in immune profile or immune function in healthy postpartum women.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

In this prospective study, the convenience sample included two groups of healthy postpartum women. They were assessed for differences in immune profile and immune function based upon whether they received epidural anesthesia during labor and delivery. Twenty-one subjects had received no epidural anesthesia. Forty-seven subjects had received epidural anesthesia for their deliveries.

Sixty-eight women who agreed to participate in the study and met inclusion criteria underwent laboratory testing for immune profile and immune function studies. This was done within 24 hours after delivery. The data collected included measures that specifically assessed immune phenotypic profile, lymphocyte proliferative response, and NK lysis assays.

\section*{Findings}

No differences were noted in immune profile or immune function in women who received epidural anesthesia in labor versus those who did not.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

This study demonstrated that white blood cell count and other phenotypic measures of leukocytes are not affected by epidural anesthesia. It is suggested that the epidural anesthesia technique does not alter immune response in postpartum women, although studies with larger samples are warranted. Efforts to support the immune response in women who receive epidural anesthesia should be comparable to women who do not receive epidural anesthesia.
must first recognize invaders as foreign before it can react to them. The body accomplishes recognition using lymph nodes and lymphocytes for surveillance. Lymph nodes are widely distributed internally throughout the body and in the circulating blood, and externally near the body's surfaces. They continuously discharge small lymphocytes into the bloodstream. These lymphocytes patrol the tissues and vessels that drain the areas served by that node.

Lymphocytes recirculate from the blood to lymph nodes and from the lymph nodes back into the bloodstream, in a neverending series of patrols. Some circulating lymphocytes can survive for decades. Some of these small, hardy cells maintain their solitary circuits for the person's lifetime.

The exact way in which circulating lymphocytes recognize antigens on foreign surfaces is not known; however, recognition is thought to depend on specific receptor sites on the surface of the lymphocytes. Macrophages play an important role

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-029.jpg?height=816&width=730&top_left_y=349&top_left_x=267}

\caption{EIGURE 50-4 Antibody specificity. Antibodies are produced by B-cell lymphocytes to bind with specific antigens.}
\end{figure}
in helping the circulating lymphocytes process the antigens. Both macrophages and neutrophils have receptors for antibodies and complement; as a result, the coating of microorganisms with antibodies, complement, or both enhances phagocytosis. The engulfed microorganisms are then subjected to a wide range of toxic intracellular molecules. When foreign materials enter the body, a circulating lymphocyte comes into physical contact with the surfaces of these materials. Upon contact, the lymphocyte, with the help of macrophages, either removes the antigen from the surface or in some way picks up an imprint of its structure, which comes into play with subsequent re-exposure to the antigen.

In a streptococcal throat infection, for example, the streptococcal organism gains access to the mucous membranes of the throat. A circulating lymphocyte moving through the tissues of the neck comes in contact with the organism. The lymphocyte, familiar with the surface markers on the cells of its own body, recognizes the antigens on the microbe as different (nonself) and the streptococcal organism as antigenic (foreign). This triggers the second stage of the immune response-proliferation.

\section*{PROLIFERATION STAGE}

The circulating lymphocyte containing the antigenic message returns to the nearest lymph node. Once in the node, the sensitized lymphocyte stimulates some of the resident dormant T and B lymphocytes to enlarge, divide, and proliferate. T lymphocytes differentiate into cytotoxic (or killer) T cells, whereas B lymphocytes produce and release antibodies. Enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck in conjunction with a sore throat is one example of the immune response.

\section*{RESPONSE STAGE}

In the response stage, the changed lymphocytes function either in a humoral or a cellular fashion. The production of antibodies by the B lymphocytes in response to a specific antigen begins the humoral response. Humoral refers to the fact that the antibodies are released into the bloodstream and so reside in the plasma (fluid fraction of the blood).

With the initial cellular response, the returning sensitized lymphocytes migrate to areas of the lymph node (other than those areas containing lymphocytes programmed to become plasma cells). Here, they stimulate the residing lymphocytes to become cells that will attack microbes directly rather than through the action of antibodies. These transformed lymphocytes are known as cytotoxic (killer) T cells. The T stands for thymus, signifying that during embryologic development of the immune system, these T lymphocytes spent time in the thymus of the developing fetus, where they were genetically programmed to become T lymphocytes rather than the antibody-producing B lymphocytes. Viral rather than bacterial antigens induce a cellular response. This response is manifested by the increasing number of T lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) seen in the blood smears of people with viral illnesses, such as infectious mononucleosis. (Cellular immunity is discussed in further detail later in this chapter.)

Most immune responses to antigens involve both humoral and cellular responses, although one usually predominates. For example, during transplantation rejection, the cellular response predominates, whereas in the bacterial pneumonias and sepsis, the humoral response plays the dominant protective role (Chart 50-1).

\section*{EFFECTOR STAGE}

In the effector stage, either the antibody of the humoral response or the cytotoxic (killer) T cell of the cellular response reaches and couples with the antigen on the surface of the foreign invader. The coupling initiates a series of events that in most instances results in the total destruction of the invading microbes or the complete neutralization of the toxin. The events involve an interplay of antibodies (humoral immunity), complement, and action by the cytotoxic $T$ cells (cellular immunity). Figure 50-5 summarizes the stages of the immune response.

\section*{Cherpt $50-1$ \\ Role of Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses}

Whereas B-cell antibodies are distinctive components of the humoral immune response, cytotoxic T cells are distinguishing components of the cellular immune response. Some specific roles of B cells and T cells are as follows:
Humoral Responses (B Cells)
- Bacterial phagocytosis and lysis
- Anaphylaxis
- Allergic hay fever and asthma
- Immune complex disease
- Bacterial and some viral infections

Cellular Responses (T Cells)
- Transplant rejection
- Delayed hypersensitivity (tuberculin reaction)
- Graft-versus-host disease
- Tumor surveillance or destruction
- Intracellular infections
- Viral, fungal, and parasitic infections

\end{figure}

\section*{Humoral Immune Response}

The humoral response is characterized by production of antibodies by the B lymphocytes in response to a specific antigen. Although the B lymphocyte is ultimately responsible for the production of antibodies, both the macrophages of natural immunity and the special T -cell lymphocytes of cellular immunity are involved in recognizing the foreign substance and in producing antibodies.

\section*{ANTIGEN RECOGNITION}

Several theories exist about the mechanisms by which the B lymphocytes recognize the invading antigen and respond by producing antibodies. This is probably because the B lymphocytes recognize invading antigens in more than one way and respond in several ways as well. Additionally, the B lymphocytes appear to respond to some antigens by triggering antibody formation directly. In response to other antigens, however, they need the assistance of T cells to trigger antibody formation.

T cells (or T lymphocytes), part of a surveillance system dispersed throughout the body, recycle through the general circulation, tissues, and lymphatic system. With the assistance of macrophages, the T lymphocytes are believed to recognize the antigen of a foreign invader. The T lymphocyte picks up the antigenic message, or "blueprint," of the antigen and returns to the nearest lymph node with that message.

Production of B Lymphocytes. B lymphocytes stored in the lymph nodes are subdivided into thousands of clones, each responsive to a single group of antigens having almost identical characteristics. When the antigenic message is carried back to the lymph node, specific clones of the B lymphocyte are stimulated to enlarge, divide, proliferate, and differentiate into plasma cells capable of producing specific antibodies to the antigen. Other B lymphocytes differentiate into B-lymphocyte clones with a memory for the antigen. These memory cells are responsible for the more exaggerated and rapid immune response in a person who is repeatedly exposed to the same antigen.

\section*{ROLE OF ANTIBODIES}

Antibodies are large proteins called immunoglobulins because they are found in the globulin fraction of the plasma proteins. All immunoglobulins are glycoproteins and contain a certain amount of carbohydrate. The carbohydrate concentration, which ranges from approximately $3 \%$ to $13 \%$, is dependent upon the class of the antibody. Each antibody molecule consists of two subunits, each of which contains a light and a heavy peptide chain (Fig. 50-6). The subunits are held together by a chemical link composed of disulfide bonds. Each subunit has a portion that serves as a binding site for a specific antigen referred to as the Fab fragment. This site provides the "lock" portion that is highly specific for an antigen. An additional portion, known as the Fc fragment, allows the antibody molecule to take part in the complement system.

Antibodies defend against foreign invaders in several ways, and the type of defense employed depends on the structure and composition of both the antigen and the immunoglobulin. The antibody molecule has at least two combining sites, or Fab fragments. One antibody can act as a cross-link between two antigens, causing them to bind or clump together. This clumping effect, referred to as agglutination, helps clear the body of the in-

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 50-6 An antibody molecule. The Fab fragment serves as the binding site for a specific antigen. The Fc fragment initiates classic complement activation.}
\end{figure}
vading organism by facilitating phagocytosis. Some antibodies assist in removing offending organisms through opsonization. In this process, the antigen-antibody molecule is coated with a sticky substance that also facilitates phagocytosis.

Antibodies also promote the release of vasoactive substances, such as histamine and slow-reacting substance, two of the chemical mediators of the inflammatory response.

Antibodies do not function in isolation but rather mobilize other components of the immune system to defend against the invader. Their usual role is to focus components of the natural immune system on the invader. This includes activation of the complement system and activation of phagocytosis (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a).

Types of Immunoglobulins. The body can produce five different types of immunoglobulins. (Immunoglobulins are commonly designated by the abbreviation Ig.) Each of the five types, or classes, is identified by a specific letter of the alphabet (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM). Classification is based on the chemical structure and biologic role of the individual immunoglobulin. The following list summarizes major characteristics of the immunoglobulins:

\section*{IgG (75\% of Total Immunoglobulin)}
- Appears in serum and tissues (interstitial fluid)
- Assumes a major role in bloodborne and tissue infections
- Activates the complement system
- Enhances phagocytosis
- Crosses the placenta

\section*{IgA (15\% of Total Immunoglobulin)}
- Appears in body fluids (blood, saliva, tears, breast milk, and pulmonary, gastrointestinal, prostatic, and vaginal secretions)
- Protects against respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary infections
- Prevents absorption of antigens from food
- Passes to neonate in breast milk for protection

\section*{IgM (10\% of Total Immunoglobulin)}
- Appears mostly in intravascular serum
- Appears as the first immunoglobulin produced in response to bacterial and viral infections
- Activates the complement system

\section*{IgD (0.2\% of Total Immunoglobulin)}
- Appears in small amounts in serum
- Possibly influences B-lymphocyte differentiation, but role is unclear

\section*{IgE (0.004\% of Total Immunoglobulin)}
- Appears in serum
- Takes part in allergic and some hypersensitivity reactions
- Combats parasitic infections

\section*{ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY BINDING}

The portion of the antigen involved in binding with the antibody is referred to as the antigenic determinant. The binding of the Fab fragment (antibody-binding site) to the antigenic determinant can be likened to a lock-and-key situation (Fig. 50-7). The most efficient immunologic responses occur when the antibody and antigen fit exactly. Poor fit can occur with an antibody that was produced in response to a different antigen. This phenomenon is known as cross-reactivity. For example, in acute rheumatic fever, the antibody produced against Streptococcus pyogenes in the upper respiratory tract may cross-react with the patient's heart tissue, leading to heart valve damage.

\end{figure}

\section*{Cellular Immune Response}

Whereas the B lymphocytes are responsible for humoral immunity, the T lymphocytes (or T cells) are primarily responsible for cellular immunity. Stem cells continuously migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus gland, where they develop into T cells. T cells continue to develop in the thymus gland, despite partial degeneration of the thymus gland that occurs at puberty (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a). By spending time in the thymus, these cells are programmed to become T cells rather than antibody-producing B lymphocytes. Several types of T cells exist, each with designated roles in the defense against bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and malignant cells. $T$ cells attack foreign invaders directly rather than by producing antibodies.

Cellular reactions are initiated by the binding of an antigen with an antigen receptor located on the surface of a T cell. This may occur with or without the assistance of macrophages. The T cells then carry the antigenic message, or blueprint, to the lymph nodes, where the production of other T cells is stimulated. Some T cells remain in the lymph nodes and retain a memory for the antigen. Other T cells migrate from the lymph nodes into the general circulatory system and ultimately to the tissues, where they remain until they either come in contact with their respective antigens or die.

\section*{ROLE OF T LYMPHOCYTES}

Two major categories of effector T cells are helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. These cells participate in destroying foreign organisms. Other T cells include suppressor T cells and memory T cells. T cells interact closely with B cells, indicating that humoral and cellular immune responses are not separate, unrelated processes but rather branches of the immune response that can and do affect each other.

Helper T cells are activated upon recognition of antigens and stimulate the rest of the immune system. When activated, helper T cells secrete cytokines that attract and activate B cells, cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system. Separate subpopulations of helper T cells produce different types of cytokines and determine whether the immune response will be the production of antibodies or a cell-mediated immune response. Helper T cells produce lymphokines, one category of cytokines. These lymphokines activate other T cells (interleukin-2 [IL-2]), natural and cytotoxic T cells (interferongamma), and other inflammatory cells (tumor necrosis factor). Helper T cells produce IL-4 and IL-5, lymphokines that activate $B$ cells to grow and differentiate (Table 50-2).

Cytotoxic T cells (killer T cells) attack the antigen directly by altering the cell membrane and causing cell lysis (disintegration) and releasing cytolytic enzymes and cytokines. Lymphokines can recruit, activate, and regulate other lymphocytes and WBCs. These cells then assist in destroying the invading organism. Delayedtype hypersensitivity is an example of an immune reaction that protects the body from antigens through the production and release of lymphokines and is discussed in more detail later.

Another type of cell, the suppressor $\mathbf{T}$ cell, has the ability to decrease B-cell production, thereby keeping the immune response at a level that is compatible with health (eg, sufficient to fight infection adequately without attacking the body's healthy tissues). Memory cells are responsible for recognizing antigens from previous exposure and mounting an immune response (Table 50-3).

\section*{ROLES OF NULL LYMPHOCYTES AND NATURAL KILLER CELLS}

Null lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells are other lymphocytes that assist in combating organisms. These are distinct from B cells and T cells and lack the usual characteristics of B cells and T cells. Null lymphocytes, a subpopulation of lymphocytes, destroy antigens already coated with antibody. These cells have special Fc receptor sites on their surfaces that allow them to couple with the Fc end of antibodies (antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity).

Natural killer cells, another subpopulation of lymphocytes, defend against microorganisms and some types of malignant cells. NK cells are capable of directly killing invading organisms and producing cytokines. The helper T cells contribute to the differentiation of null and NK cells.

\section*{Complement System}

Circulating plasma proteins, which are made in the liver and activated when an antibody couples with its antigen, are known as complement. These proteins interact sequentially with one another in a cascade or "falling domino" effect. This complement cascade alters the cell membranes on which antigen and antibody complex forms, permitting fluid to enter the cell and leading eventually to cell lysis and death. In addition, activated complement molecules attract macrophages and granulocytes to areas of antigen-antibody reactions. These cells continue the body's defense by devouring the antibody-coated microbes and by releasing bacterial agents.

Complement plays an important role in the immune response. Destruction of an invading or attacking organism or toxin is not achieved merely by the binding of the antibody and antigens; it also requires activation of complement, the arrival of killer T cells, or the attraction of macrophages. Complement has three major physiologic functions: defending the body against bacterial infection,

bridging natural and acquired immunity, and disposing of immune complexes and the byproducts associated with inflammation (Walport, 2001a). Complement-mediated immune responses are summarized in Table 50-4.

There are several ways to activate the complement system: the classic pathway, the alternate pathway, and the lectin pathway (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a).

\section*{CLASSIC PATHWAY OF COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION}

The classic pathway (the first method discovered) is activated by antigen-antibody complexes; it begins when antibody binds to a cell surface and ends with lysis of the cell. It involves the reaction of the first of the circulating complement proteins $\left(\mathrm{C}_{1}\right)$ with the receptor site of the Fc portion of an antibody molecule after formation of an antigen-antibody complex. The activation of the first complement component then activates all the other components in the following sequence: $\mathrm{C}_{4}, \mathrm{C}_{2}, \mathrm{C}_{3}, \mathrm{C}_{5}, \mathrm{C}_{6}, \mathrm{C}_{7}, \mathrm{C}_{8}$, and $\mathrm{C}_{9}$. (The components are named in the sequence in which they were discovered.)

\section*{ALTERNATE AND LECTIN PATHWAYS}

The alternate and lectin pathways of complement activation are activated without the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. These pathways can be initiated by the release of bacterial products, such as endotoxins. When complement is activated without the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, the process bypasses the first three components ( $\mathrm{C}_{1}, \mathrm{C}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ ) and begins
with $\mathrm{C}_{3}$. Whatever the method of activation, once activated, the complement destroys cells by altering or damaging the cell membrane of the antigen, by chemically attracting phagocytes to the antigen (chemotaxis), and by rendering the antigen more vulnerable to phagocytosis (opsonization). The complement system enhances the inflammatory response by releasing vasoactive substances.

Complement components, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators all contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, as do chemokines, a group of cytokines. The activated neutrophils pass through the vessel walls to accumulate at the site of infection, where they phagocytose complementcoated microbes (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a).

This response is usually therapeutic and can be lifesaving if the cell attacked by the complement system is a true foreign invader, such as a streptococcal or staphylococcal organism. If that cell, however, is in reality part of the person-a cell of the brain or liver, the tissue lining the blood vessels, or the cells of a transplanted organ or skin graft, for example-the result can be devastating disease and even death. The result of the immune response-the vigorous attack on any material identified as foreign, the deadliness of the struggle-is obvious in the purulent material, or pus (the remains of microbes, granulocytes, macrophages, T-cell lymphocytes, plasma proteins, complement, and antibodies), that accumulates in wound infections and abscesses. In addition, many autoimmune diseases (ie, systemic lupus erythematosus) and disorders characterized by chronic infection

(ie, hepatitis C, bacterial endocarditis) and necrosis (myocardial infarction, stroke) are thought to be due in part to continued or chronic activation of complement, which in turn causes chronic inflammation (Walport, 2001b).

and platelets have complement receptors and as a result play an important role in the clearance of immune complexes that consist of antigen, antibody, and components of the complement system (Delves \& Roitt, 2000a).

\section*{Role of Interferons}

Biologic response modifiers, such as the interferons, are under investigation to determine their roles in the immune system and their potential therapeutic effects in disorders characterized by disturbed immune responses. Interferons have antiviral and antitumor properties. In addition to responding to viral infection, they are produced by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages in response to antigens. They are thought to modify the immune response by suppressing antibody production and cellular immunity. They also facilitate the cytolytic role of macrophages and NK cells. Interferons are undergoing extensive testing to evaluate their effectiveness in treating tumors and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Some interferons are already used to treat immune-related disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis) and chronic inflammatory conditions (eg, chronic hepatitis).

\section*{Advances in Immunology}

\section*{GENETIC ENGINEERING}

One of the more remarkable technologies that is evolving is genetic engineering, which involves the use of recombinant DNA technology. Two facets exist with this technology. The first permits scientists to combine genes from one type of organism with genes of a second organism. This type of technology allows cells and microorganisms to manufacture proteins, monokines and lymphokines, which can alter and enhance immune system function. The second facet of recombinant DNA technology involves gene therapy. For example, if a particular gene is abnormal or missing, a recombinant gene can be inserted onto a virus particle. When the virus splices its genes, it will automatically insert the missing gene, which theoretically will correct the situation and revitalize the immune system in an immune deficiency disorder. These genes can be carried via harmless viruses, inactivated retroviruses, grafted onto a protein carrier, or hidden in fat globules that are known as liposomes (Delves \& Roitt, 2000b). Extensive research into recombinant DNA technology and gene therapy is ongoing.

\section*{STEM CELLS}

Stem cell research also is underway. The stem cell is known as a precursor cell that continually replenishes the body's entire supply of both red and white cells. Stem cells represent only a small portion of all types of bone marrow cells. Research conducted with mouse models has demonstrated that once the immune system has been destroyed experimentally, it can be completely restored with the implantation of just a few purified stem cells. Stem cell transplantation has been carried out in humans with certain types of immune dysfunction, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Parslow, Stites, Terr \& Imboden, 2001). Clinical trials using stem cells are underway in patients with a variety of disorders with an autoimmune component, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and multiple sclerosis (Davidson \& Diamond, 2001).

\section*{IMMUNOREGULATION}

A successful immune response eliminates the inciting antigen. Once the antigen that has stimulated the immune response is eliminated, the response returns to a nearly normal level. This process, known as immunoregulation, balances and counterbalances the immune response. For example, autoimmune diseases can be better controlled by suppressing areas of the immune system that are overactive and boosting those areas that are underactive. Immunoregulation research holds the promise of preventing graft rejection and aiding the body in dispersing cells that are cancerous or infected (Delves \& Roitt, 2000b).

\section*{Assessment}

An assessment of immune function begins with a health history and physical examination. The history should note the patient's age along with information about past and present conditions and events that may provide clues to the status of the patient's immune system. Areas to be addressed include nutritional status; infections and immunizations; allergies; disorder and disease states, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, and chronic illnesses; surgery; medications; and blood transfusions. Physical assessment includes palpation of the lymph nodes and examination of the skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, cardiovascular, and neurosensory systems (Chart 50-2).

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

\section*{Age}

Age is an important factor to elicit from the patient as people at the extremes of the life span are more likely to develop problems related to immune system functioning than are those in their middle years (Table 50-5).

\section*{Gerontological Considerations}

The frequency and severity of infections are increased in elderly people, possibly due to a decreased ability to respond adequately to invading organisms. Both the production and the function of T and B lymphocytes may be impaired. Responses to antigen stimulation may be altered, with increasing proportions of lymphocytes becoming unresponsive with age (Porth, 2002). The incidence of autoimmune diseases also increases with aging, possibly from a decreased ability of antibodies to differentiate between self and nonself. Failure of the surveillance system to recognize mutant, or abnormal, cells may be responsible for the high incidence of cancer associated with increasing age.

Declining function of various organ systems associated with increasing age also contributes to impaired immunity. Decreased gastric secretions and motility allow normal intestinal flora to proliferate and produce infection, causing gastroenteritis and diarrhea. Decreased renal circulation, filtration, absorption, and excretion contribute to risk for urinary tract infections. Moreover, prostatic enlargement and neurogenic bladder can impede urine passage and subsequently bacterial clearance through the urinary system. Urinary stasis, common in elderly people, permits the growth of microorganisms. Exposure to tobacco and environmental toxins impairs pulmonary function. Prolonged exposure to these agents decreases the elasticity of lung tissue, the effec-

tiveness of cilia, and the ability to cough effectively. These impairments hinder the removal of infectious organisms and toxins, increasing the elderly person's susceptibility to pulmonary infections and cancers.

Finally, with aging, the skin becomes thinner and less elastic. Peripheral neuropathy and the accompanying decreased sensation and circulation may lead to stasis ulcers, pressure ulcers, abrasions, and burns. Impaired skin integrity predisposes the aging person to infection from organisms that are part of normal skin flora.

\section*{Nutrition}

The nurse assesses the patient's nutritional status, including caloric intake as well as the type of calories that the patient is consuming. Adequate nutrition is essential for optimal functioning of the immune system. Inadequate intake of vitamins that are essential for DNA and protein synthesis may lead to protein-calorie deficiency and subsequently to impaired immune function. Vitamins also

help in the regulation of cell proliferation and maturation of immune cells. Excess or deficiency of trace elements (ie, copper, iron, manganese, selenium, or zinc) in the diet generally suppresses immune function.

Fatty acids are the building blocks that make up the structural components of cell membranes. Lipids are precursors of vitamins A, $\mathrm{D}, \mathrm{E}$, and K as well as cholesterol. Both excess and deficiency of fatty acids have been found to suppress immune function.

Depletion of protein reserves results in atrophy of lymphoid tissues, depression of antibody response, reduction in the number of circulating $T$ cells, and impaired phagocytic function. As a result, susceptibility to infection is greatly increased. During periods of infection and serious illness, nutritional requirements may be exaggerated further, potentially contributing to depletion of protein, fatty acid, vitamin, and trace elements and an even greater risk of impaired immune response and sepsis.

\section*{Infection and Immunization}

The patient is asked about immunizations (including those received recently and those received in childhood) and the usual childhood diseases. Known past or present exposure to tuberculosis is assessed, and the dates and results of any tuberculin tests (purified protein derivative [PPD] or tine test) and chest x-rays are obtained. Recent patient exposure to any infections and the exposure dates are elicited. It is important for the nurse to assess whether the patient has been exposed to any sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$, and E infections, and HIV infection. A history of sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, HPV infection, and chlamydia, can alert the nurse that the patient may have been exposed to HIV infection or hepatitis. A history of past and present
infections and the dates and types of treatments that were used, along with a history of any multiple persistent infections, fevers of unknown origin, lesions or sores, or any type of drainage, are obtained.

\section*{Allergy}

The patient is asked about history of any allergies, including types of allergens (pollens, dust, plants, cosmetics, food, medications, vaccines), the symptoms experienced, and seasonal variations in occurrence or severity in the symptoms. A history of testing and treatments that the patient has received or is currently receiving for these allergies and the effectiveness of the treatments is obtained. All medication and food allergies are listed on an allergy alert sticker and placed on the front of the patient's health record or chart to alert others to the possibility of these allergies. Continued assessment for potential allergic reactions in this patient is vital.

\section*{Disorders and Diseases}

\section*{AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS}

The patient is asked about any autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis. The onset, severity, remissions and exacerbations, functional limitations, treatments that the patient has received or is currently receiving, and the effectiveness of the treatments are described. Although most autoimmune disorders are individually rare, together they affect approximately 5\% of the U.S. population. The occurrence of different autoimmune diseases within a family strongly suggests a genetic predisposition to more than one autoimmune disease (Davidson \& Diamond, 2001).

In general, autoimmune disorders are more common in females than in males. This is believed to be the result of the activity of the sex hormones. The ability of sex hormones to modulate immunity has been well established. There is evidence that estrogen modulates the activity of T lymphocytes (especially suppressor cells), whereas androgens act to preserve IL-2 production and suppressor cell activity. The effects of sex hormones on B cells are less pronounced. Estrogen activates the autoimmune-associated B-cell population that expresses the CD5 marker (an antigenic marker on the B cell). Estrogen tends to enhance immunity, whereas androgen tends to be immunosuppressive.

\section*{NEOPLASTIC DISEASE}

A history of cancer in the patient is obtained, along with the type of cancer and date of diagnosis. Dates and results of any cancer screening tests are also obtained.

Immunosuppression contributes to the development of cancers; however, cancer itself is immunosuppressive. Large tumors can release antigens into the blood, and these antigens combine
with circulating antibodies and prevent them from attacking the tumor cells. Furthermore, tumor cells may possess special blocking factors that coat tumor cells and prevent destruction by killer T lymphocytes. During the early development of tumors, the body may fail to recognize the tumor antigens as foreign and subsequently fail to initiate destruction of the malignant cells. Hematologic cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, are associated with altered production and function of WBCs and lymphocytes.

All treatments that the patient has received or is currently receiving, such as radiation or chemotherapy, are identified and documented in the health history. Radiation destroys lymphocytes and decreases the population of cells required to replace them. The size or extent of the irradiated area determines the extent of immunosuppression. Whole-body irradiation may leave the patient totally immunosuppressed. Chemotherapy also destroys immune cells and causes immunosuppression.

A family history of cancer is obtained. If there is a family history of cancer, the type of cancer, age of onset, and relationship (maternal or paternal) of the patient to the affected family member is noted. (See Genetics in Nursing Practice.)

- Ataxia-telangiectasia
- Bloom syndrome
- Common variable immunodeficiency
- Fanconi anemia
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Inquire about rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus in other family members in several generations.
- Inquire about ethnic background (eg, Bloom syndrome is common among individuals of Ashkenazi heritage).
- Assess family history for closely related members with immune deficiency.
- Determine the age of onset of symptoms in affected family members (eg, for SCID, symptoms of pneumonia and unresponsive candidiasis are evident within the first 3 months of life).

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- In children, assess for other clinical signs of immune dysfunction, including failure to thrive, growth retardation, developmental delays, pallor, irritability.
- Assess skin for cutaneous telangiectases (spider-like blood vessels in ataxia telangiectasia, or as in Bloom syndrome in a butterfly pattern on the nose and cheeks).
- Assess for hyperpigmentation, short stature, and other organ involvement seen in Fanconi anemia.

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether DNA mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on affected family members.
- If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of genetic testing and gene-based interventions.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to families with newly diagnosed geneticrelated immune disorders.
- Participate in management and coordination of care of patients with genetic conditions and individuals predisposed to develop or pass on a genetic condition.

\section*{CHRONIC ILLNESS AND SURGERY}

The health assessment includes a history of chronic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus, renal disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The onset and severity of illnesses, as well as treatment that the patient is receiving for the illness, are obtained. Chronic illness may contribute to immune system impairments in various ways. Renal failure is associated with a deficiency in circulating lymphocytes. In addition, immune defenses may be altered by acidosis and uremic toxins. In diabetes, an increased incidence of infection has been associated with vascular insufficiency, neuropathy, and poor control of serum glucose levels. Recurrent respiratory tract infections are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a result of altered inspiratory and expiratory function and ineffective airway clearance. Additionally, a history of surgical removal of the spleen, lymph nodes, or thymus or a history of organ transplantation is noted because these conditions may place the patient at risk for impaired immune function.

\section*{SPECIAL PROBLEMS}

Conditions such as burns and other forms of injury and infection may contribute to altered immune system function. Major burns or other factors cause impaired skin integrity and compromise the body's first line of defense. Loss of large amounts of serum with burn injuries depletes the body of essential proteins, including immunoglobulins. The physiologic and psychological stressors associated with surgery or injury stimulate cortisol release from the adrenal cortex; increased serum cortisol also contributes to suppression of normal immune responses.

\section*{Medications and Blood Transfusions}

A list of past and present medications is obtained. In large doses, antibiotics, corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and anesthetics can cause immune suppression (Table 50-6).

A history of blood transfusions is obtained because previous exposure to foreign antigens through transfusion may be associated with abnormal immune function. Additionally, although the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission through blood transfusion is extremely low in patients who received a transfusion after 1985 (the year that testing of blood for HIV was initiated in the United States), a risk still exists.

The patient is also asked about use of herbal agents and over-the-counter medications. Because many of these products have not been subjected to rigorous testing, not all of their effects have been identified. It is important, therefore, to ask patients about their use of these substances and to document their use.

\section*{Lifestyle and Other Factors}

Like any other body system, the immune system functions depend on other body systems. A detailed history of smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary intake and nutritional status, amount of perceived stress, injection drug use, sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases, and occupational or residential exposure to radiation or pollutants is obtained. Poor nutritional status, smoking, excessive consumption of alcohol, injection drug use, sexually transmitted diseases, and exposure to environmental radiation and pollutants have been associated with impaired immune function and are assessed in the patient history.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGIC FACTORS}

The assessment also addresses psychoneuroimmunologic factors. It is thought that the immune response is regulated and modulated in part by neuroendocrine influences. Lymphocytes and macrophages have receptors capable of responding to neurotransmitters and endocrine hormones. Lymphocytes can produce and secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone and endorphin-like
compounds. Neurons in the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, can recognize prostaglandins, interferons, and interleukins as well as histamine and serotonin, which are released during the inflammatory process. Like all other biologic systems functioning in the interest of homeostasis, the immune system is integrated with other psychophysiologic processes and is subject to regulation and modulation by the brain.

Conversely, the immune processes can affect neural and endocrine function, including behavior. Thus, the interaction of the nervous system and immune system appears to be bidirectional. Growing evidence indicates that measurable immune system parameters can be influenced by biobehavioral strategies involving selfregulation. Examples of these strategies are relaxation and imagery techniques, biofeedback, humor, hypnosis, and conditioning. The assessment should address the patient's general psychological status and the patient's use of these strategies.

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

On physical examination (see Chart 50-2), the skin and mucous membranes are assessed for lesions, dermatitis, purpura (subcutaneous bleeding), urticaria, inflammation, or any discharge. Any signs of infection are noted. The patient's temperature is recorded, and the patient is observed for chills and sweating. The anterior and posterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes are palpated for enlargement; if palpable nodes are detected, the location, size, consistency, and reports of tenderness upon palpation are noted. Joints are assessed for tenderness and swelling and for limited range of motion. The patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurosensory status is evalu-
ated for signs and symptoms indicative of immune dysfunction. The patient's nutritional status, level of stress, and coping ability are also assessed, along with his or her age and any functional limitations or disabilities.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

A series of blood tests and skin tests and a bone marrow biopsy may be performed to evaluate the patient's immune competence. Specific laboratory and diagnostic tests are discussed in greater detail along with specific disease processes in subsequent chapters in this unit. Laboratory and diagnostic tests used to evaluate immune competence are summarized in Chart 50-3.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse needs to be aware that patients undergoing evaluation for possible immune system disorders experience not only physical pain and discomfort with certain types of diagnostic procedures, but many psychological reactions as well. For example, patients may fear test results that demonstrate decreased immune function that makes them more prone to certain infections, cancers, and other disorders. It is the nurse's role to counsel, educate, and support patients throughout the diagnostic process. Further, many patients may be extremely anxious about the results of diagnostic tests and the possible implications of those results for their employment, insurance, and personal relationships. This is an opportune time for the nurse to provide counseling and education should these interventions be warranted.

\section*{Selected Tests for Evaluating Immunologic Status}

Various laboratory tests may be performed to assess immune system activity or dysfunction. The studies assess leukocytes and lymphocytes, humoral immunity, cellular immunity, phagocytic cell function, complement activity, hypersensitivity reactions, specific antigenantibodies, or HIV infection.

\title{
Management of Patients With Immunodeficiency
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Compare the different types of primary immunodeficiency disorders, addressing causes, clinical manifestations, management, possible complications, and available treatments.
2. Discuss the possible management of patients with immunodeficiency disorders.
3. Describe the nursing management of the patient with an immunodeficiency.
4. Identify the teaching points necessary for a patient with an immunodeficiency.
$I_{m}$ deficiency disorders may be caused by a defect or deficiency in phagocytic cells, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, or the complement system. The specific symptoms and their severity, age of onset, and prognosis depend on the immune system components affected and their degree of functional impairment. Regardless of the underlying cause, the cardinal symptoms of immunodeficiency include chronic or recurrent severe infections, infections caused by unusual organisms or organisms that are normal body flora, poor response to treatment of infections, and chronic diarrhea. In addition, the patient is susceptible to a variety of secondary disorders, including cancer (Buckley, 2000).

Immunodeficiencies may be classified as either primary or secondary and by the components of the immune system that are affected. Primary immunodeficiency diseases are genetic in origin and are caused by intrinsic defects in the cells of the immune system. This is in contrast to secondary immunodeficiencies such as AIDS, caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Knowledge of the immune system and of the possibility of secondary disorders, skillful assessment and management, and sensitivity and responsiveness to the learning needs of the patient and caregiver are the essential elements for effective nursing care.

\section*{Primary Immunodeficiencies}

Primary immunodeficiencies, rare disorders with genetic origins, are seen primarily in infants and young children. To date, more than 95 immunodeficiencies of genetic origin have been identified (Buckley, 2000). Symptoms usually develop early in life after protection from maternal antibodies decreases. Without treatment, infants and children with these disorders seldom survive to adulthood. These disorders may involve one or more components of the immune system. Symptoms of immune deficiency diseases are related to the role that the deficient component normally plays (Table 51-1).

\section*{PHAGOCYTIC DYSFUNCTION}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A variety of primary defects of phagocytes may occur; nearly all of them are genetic in origin and affect the innate immune system. In some types of phagocytic disorders, the neutrophils are impaired so that they cannot exit the circulation and travel to sites of infection. As a result the patient cannot mount a normal inflammatory response against pathogenic organisms (Lekstrom-Himes \& Gallin, 2002). In some disorders, the neutrophil count may be very low; in others, it may be very high because the neutrophils remain in the vascular system.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Phagocytic cell disorders are manifested by an increased incidence of bacterial and fungal infections due to normally nonpathogenic organisms (Lekstrom-Himes \& Gallin, 2002). People with these disorders may also develop fungal infections from Candida organisms and viral infections from herpes simplex or herpes zoster virus. These patients experience recurrent furunculosis, cutaneous abscesses, chronic eczema, bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic otitis media, and sinusitis. In one type of phagocytic disorder, hyperimmunoglobulinemia E (HIE) syndrome, formerly known as Job syndrome, white blood cells cannot produce an inflammatory response to the skin infections; this results in deep-seated cold abscesses that lack the classic signs and symptoms of inflammation (redness, heat, and pain).

While patients with phagocytic cell disorders may be asymptomatic, severe neutropenia may be accompanied by deep and painful mouth ulcers, gingivitis, stomatitis, and cellulitis. Death from overwhelming infection occurs in about $10 \%$ of patients with severe neutropenia. Chronic granulomatous disease, another type of primary phagocytic disorder, produces recurrent or persistent infections of the soft tissues, lungs, and other organs; these are resistant to aggressive treatment with antibiotics (Lekstrom-Himes \& Gallin, 2002).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is based on the history, signs and symptoms, and laboratory analysis of the cytocidal (causing the death of cells) activity of the phagocytic cells by the nitroblue tetrazolium reductase test (see Chart 50-3 in Chap. 50). A history of recurrent infection and fever in a child and occasionally in an adult is an important key to the diagnosis. Failure of an infection to resolve with usual treatment is also an important indicator (Lekstrom-Himes \& Gallin, 2002). See Chart 51-1 for a summary of warning signs of primary immunodeficiency disorders.

\section*{Medical Management}

Because the signs and symptoms of infection are often blunted because of an impaired inflammatory response, early diagnosis and treatment of infectious complications can be lifesaving (Lekstrom-Himes \& Gallin, 2002). Management of phagocytic cell disorders includes treating bacterial infections with prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Additional treatment for fungal and viral infections is often needed. Granulocyte transfusions, although used, are seldom successful because of the short half-life of the cells. Treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may
agammaglobulinemia: disorder marked by an almost complete lack of immunoglobulins or antibodies
angioneurotic edema: condition marked by development of urticaria and an edematous area of skin, mucous membranes, or viscera
ataxia: uncoordinated muscle movement
ataxia-telangiectasia: autosomal recessive disorder affecting T - and B-cell immunity primarily seen in children and resulting in a degenerative brain disease
hypogammaglobulinemia: lack of one or more of the five immunoglobulins; caused by B-cell deficiency
immunocompromised host: person with a secondary immunodeficiency and associated immunosuppression
panhypoglobulinemia: general lack of immunoglobulins in the blood severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID): disorder involving a complete absence of humoral and cellular
immunity resulting from an X-linked or autosomal genetic abnormality
telangiectasia: vascular lesions caused by dilated blood vessels
thymic hypoplasia: T-cell deficiency that occurs when the thymus gland fails to develop normally during embryogenesis; also known as DiGeorge syndrome
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: immunodeficiency characterized by thrombocytopenia and the absence of T and B cells

prove successful because these proteins draw nonlymphoid stem cells from the bone marrow and hasten their maturation.

\section*{B-CELL DEFICIENCIES}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Two types of inherited B-cell deficiencies exist. The first type results from lack of differentiation of B-cell precursors into mature B cells. As a result, plasma cells are lacking, and the germinal centers from all lymphatic tissues disappear, leading to a complete lack of antibody production against invading bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Infants born with this disorder suffer from severe infections starting soon after birth. This syndrome is called sex-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's disease) because all antibodies disappear from the patient's plasma. B cells in the peripheral blood and the immunoglobulins $\operatorname{IgG}, \operatorname{IgM}, \operatorname{IgA}$, IgD , and IgE are low or absent. The prevalence of this disorder is approximately 1 case per 100,000 population (Parslow, Stites, Terr \& Imboden, 2001).

The second type of B-cell deficiency results from a lack of differentiation of $B$ cells into plasma cells. Only diminished an-
tibody production occurs with this disorder. Although plasma cells are the most vigorous producers of antibodies, affected patients have normal lymph follicles and many B lymphocytes that produce some antibodies. This syndrome, called hypogammaglobulinemia, is a frequently occurring immunodeficiency. It is also called common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), a term that encompasses a variety of defects ranging from immunoglobulin A ( $\operatorname{Ig} \mathrm{A}$ ) deficiency, in which only the plasma cells that produce IgA are lacking, to the other extreme, in which there is severe panhypoglobulinemia (general lack of immunoglobulins in the blood).

CVID is the most common primary immunodeficiency seen in adults; it can occur in either gender. Although it can occur at any age, its onset is most often in the second decade of life. The vast majority of patients do not become symptomatic until 15 to 35 years of age. The major immunologic features of CVID include recurrent pyogenic infections, an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, and a decreased level of total immunoglobulins, with IgG below $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The B-cell numbers usually remain normal. The etiology of this disorder is unknown and believed to be multifactorial. The prevalence of CVID is about

1 case per 80,000 population in the United States (Tierney, McPhee \& Papdakis, 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Infants with sex-linked agammaglobulinemia usually become symptomatic after the natural loss of maternally transmitted immunoglobulins, which occurs at about 5 to 6 months of age. Symptoms of recurrent pyogenic infections usually occur by 5 to 6 months of age.

More than half of patients with CVID develop pernicious anemia. Lymphoid hyperplasia of the small intestine and spleen and gastric atrophy detected by biopsy of the stomach are common findings. Other autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis and hypothyroidism, frequently develop in patients with CVID. Those who develop late-onset disease also have an increased incidence of chronic lung disease, hepatitis, gastric cancer, and malabsorption that results in chronic diarrhea (Porth, 2002). CVID must be distinguished from secondary immunodeficiency diseases caused by protein-losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome, or burns.

Patients with CVID are susceptible to infections with encapsulated bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Frequent respiratory tract infections typically lead to chronic progressive bronchiectasis and pulmonary failure. Commonly, infection with Giardia lamblia occurs. Opportunistic infections with Pneumocystis carinii, however, are seen only in patients who have a concomitant deficiency in T-cell immunity.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Sex-linked agammaglobulinemia may be diagnosed by the marked deficiency or complete absence of all serum immunoglobulins. The diagnosis of CVID is based on the history of bacterial infections, quantification of B-cell activity, and reported signs and symptoms. The number of $B$ lymphocytes and the total and specific immunoglobulin levels are measured. Total serum globulin level alone is an inadequate measure because a compensatory overproduction of one globulin may mask the loss of a missing globulin or one present in very low amounts. Antibody titers to confirm successful childhood vaccination are determined by specific serologic tests. Previous successful childhood immunization indicates that B cells were functioning adequately earlier in life. If the patient exhibits signs and symptoms suggestive of pernicious anemia, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are also obtained.

\section*{Medical Management}

Patients with primary phagocytic disorders may be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Those who are receiving adequate treatment with IVIG usually do not require prophylactic antibiotics unless they also have chronic respiratory disease. Antimicrobial therapy is prescribed for respiratory infections to prevent complications such as pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media. Intestinal infestation with G. lamblia is treated with a 10 -day course of metronidazole (Flagyl) or a 7-day course of quinacrine hydrochloride (Atabrine) (Parslow et al., 2001). Patients with pernicious anemia receive parenteral
injections of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ at monthly intervals. Management may also include physical therapy with postural drainage for patients with chronic lung disease or bronchiectasis (Parslow et al., 2001).

\section*{T-CELL DEFICIENCIES}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Defects in T cells lead to opportunistic infections. Most primary T-cell immunodeficiencies are genetic in origin. An increased susceptibility to infection is common. Symptoms can vary considerably depending on the type of T-cell defect. Because the T cells play a regulatory role in immune system function, the loss of T-cell function is usually accompanied by some loss of B-cell activity.

DiGeorge syndrome, or thymic hypoplasia, is one example of a primary T-cell immunodeficiency. This rare congenital disease results from the absence of several genes on chromosome 22 (Porth, 2002). The variation in symptoms is a result of differences in the amount of genetic material affected. T-cell deficiency occurs when the thymus gland fails to develop normally during embryogenesis. DiGeorge syndrome is one of the few immunodeficiency disorders with symptoms that present almost immediately following birth (Parslow et al., 2001).

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis with or without endocrinopathy is another T-cell disorder associated with a selective defect in T-cell immunity; it is thought to be caused by an autosomal recessive inheritance, affecting both males and females. It is considered an autoimmune disorder in which the thymus and other endocrine glands are involved in the autoimmune process. The disease causes extensive morbidity resulting from endocrine dysfunction.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Infants born with DiGeorge syndrome have hypoparathyroidism with resultant hypocalcemia resistant to standard therapy, congenital heart disease, characteristic facial features, and possibly renal abnormalities. These infants, susceptible to yeast, fungal, protozoan, and viral infections, are particularly susceptible to childhood diseases (chickenpox, measles, and rubella), which are usually severe and may be fatal. Many of these infants are also born with congenital heart defects, which can result in congestive heart failure. The most frequent presenting sign in patients with DiGeorge syndrome is hypocalcemia that is resistant to standard therapy. It usually occurs within the first 24 hours of life (Parslow et al., 2001).

The initial presentation of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis may be either chronic candidal infection or idiopathic endocrinopathy. Patients may survive to the second or third decade of life. Problems may include hypocalcemia and tetany secondary to hypofunction of the parathyroid glands. Hypofunction of the adrenal cortex (Addison's disease) is the major cause of death in these patients; it may develop suddenly and without any history of previous symptoms.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The status of T cells can be evaluated by peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. Because T cells constitute $65 \%$ to $85 \%$ of peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphopenia may signify a T-cell
deficit. Dermal sensitization of the patient or stimulation of the patient's T cells in vitro may be conducted to determine if the T cells are capable of producing the expected responses. Immunoglobulin evaluation is not useful in infants because of the presence of maternally transmitted immunoglobulin (Parslow et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Patients with T-cell deficiency should receive $P$. carinii prophylaxis. General care includes management of hypocalcemia and correction of cardiac abnormalities. Hypocalcemia is controlled by oral calcium supplementation in conjunction with vitamin D or parathyroid hormone administration. Congenital heart disease frequently results in heart failure, and these patients may require immediate surgical intervention in a tertiary pediatric center. Transplantation of the fetal thymus, postnatal thymus, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow has been used for permanent reconstitution of T-cell immunity. IVIG therapy may be used if an antibody deficiency exists. This therapy may also be used to control recurrent infections. Prolonged survival has been reported following the successful transplantation of the thymus gland or spontaneous remission of immunodeficiency, which occurs in some patients (Parslow et al., 2001).

\section*{COMBINED B-CELL AND T-CELL DEFICIENCIES}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Combined B-cell and T-cell deficiencies are those disorders of the immune system that have elements of dysfunction of both the B cells and T cells. A variety of inherited (autosomal recessive and X-linked) conditions fit this description. These conditions have in common disruption of the normal communication system of B cells and T cells and impairment of the immune response (Porth, 2002). These conditions generally appear early in life. Examples of these deficiencies are discussed below.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting both T - and B -cell immunity. In $40 \%$ of patients with this disease, a selective IgA deficiency exists. IgA and IgG subclass deficiencies, along with IgE deficiencies, have been identified. Variable degrees of T-cell deficiencies are observed and become more severe with advancing age. The disease is associated with neurologic, vascular, endocrine, hepatic, and cutaneous abnormalities. It is accompanied by progressive cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, recurrent bacterial infection of the sinuses and lungs, and an increased incidence of cancer (Buckley, 2000).

Both B and T cells are missing in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). SCID is a phenotypic term that is used for a wide variety of congenital and hereditary immunologic defects that are characterized by early onset of infections, defects in both B- and T-cell systems, lymphoid aplasia, and thymic dysplasia. Inheritance of this disorder can be X-linked, autosomalrecessive, or sporadic. The exact incidence of SCID is unknown; it is recognized as a rare disease in most population groups, with an incidence of about 1 case in $1,000,000$. This illness occurs in all racial groups and both genders (Parslow et al., 2001). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a variation of SCID compounded by thrombocytopenia (loss of platelets). The prognosis is generally poor because most affected infants develop overwhelming fatal infections.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The onset of ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movement) telangiectasia (vascular lesions caused by dilated blood vessels) usually occurs in the first 4 years of life of those with ataxia-telangiectasia. Many patients, however, remain symptom-free for 10 years or longer. As patients approach the second decade of life, chronic lung disease, mental retardation, neurologic symptoms, and physical disability become severe. Long-term survivors develop progressive deterioration of immunologic and neurologic functions. Some affected patients have reached the fifth decade of life. The primary causes of death in these patients are overwhelming infection and lymphoreticular or epithelial cancer.

The onset of symptoms occurs within the first 3 months of life in the majority of patients with SCID with respiratory infections, pneumonia (often secondary to $P$. carinii), thrush, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Many of these infections are resistant to treatment. Shedding of viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus or cytomegalovirus from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts is persistent. Maculopapular and erythematous skin rashes may occur. Vomiting, fever, and a persistent diaper rash are also common manifestations (Parslow et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of ataxia-telangiectasia includes early management of infections with antimicrobial therapy, management of chronic lung disease with postural drainage and physical therapy, and management of other presenting symptoms. Other treatments include transplantation of fetal thymus tissue and IVIG administration (Chart 51-2).

Treatment options for SCID include stem cell and bone marrow transplantation. The ideal donor is an HLA-identical sibling (Parslow et al., 2001). Other treatment regimens include IVIG replacement, administration of thymus-derived factors, and thymus gland transplantation. Gene therapy has been used, but the results have thus far been disappointing. As treatment improves, an increased number of those who previously would have died in infancy may live to adulthood.

\section*{Nursing Management}

As many patients require immunosuppression to ensure engraftment of depleted bone marrow during certain transplantation procedures, nursing care must be exquisite, with attention to preventing the transmission of infection to patients. Use of standard precautions and meticulous hand hygiene is essential in caring for these patients. Reverse isolation procedures, where nurses protect the patient by donning gowns, gloves, caps, and so on, is essential. The patient's condition must be monitored at all times as a certain number of patients experience reactions to transplantation that can be fatal.

\section*{DEFICIENCIES OF THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM}

The complement system is an integral part of the immune system, and alterations in normal components of complement can result in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and to immunemediated disorders (Porth, 2002). Improved techniques to identify the individual components of the complement system have led to a steady increase in the number of deficiencies identified. Disorders of the complement system can be primary or secondary.

\section*{Chart 51-2 • PHARMACOLOGY}

Managing an IV Immunoglobulin Infusion

Previously available only for intramuscular injection, immunoglobulin can now be administered for replacement therapy as an IV infusion in greater, more effective doses without painful side effects. How Supplied
Immunoglobulin is supplied in a 5\% solution or a lyophilized powder with a reconstituting diluent prepared from Cohn fraction II obtained from pools of 1,000 to 10,000 donors. Currently, a number of different IV preparations are approved for use and have been shown to be effective and safe by the Food and Drug Administration. Dosage
The optimal dose is that determined by the patient's response. In most instances, an IV dose of 100 to $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight is administered monthly or more frequently to ensure adequate serum IgG levels.
Adverse Effects
- Complaints of flank pain, shaking chills, and tightness in the chest, terminating with a slight rise in body temperature
- Hypotension (possible with severe reactions)
- Anaphylactic reactions

Guidelines for Nursing Management
- Weigh the patient before treatment.
- Obtain vital signs before, during, and after treatment.
- Administer the prescribed pretreatment prophylactic aspirin or IV antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
- Be aware that corticosteroids may be used to prevent possible severe reactions.
- Administer the IV infusion at a slow rate, not to exceed $3 \mathrm{~mL} /$ minute.
- Assess the patient for adverse reactions, including the early signs of anaphylactic shock; prepare to slow the infusion rate if necessary.
- Be aware that patients with low gammaglobulin levels have more severe reactions than those with normal levels (eg, patients who receive gammaglobulin for thrombocytopenia or Kawasaki disease).
- Keep in mind that patients who have an immunoglobulin A ( $\operatorname{Ig} \mathrm{A}$ ) deficiency have $\operatorname{IgE}$ antibodies to $\operatorname{Ig} \mathrm{A}$, which requires administration of plasma or immunoglobulin replacement from IgA-deficient patients. Because all IV immunoglobulin preparations contain some IgA, they may cause an anaphylactic reaction in patients with $\operatorname{IgE}$ anti-IgA antibodies.
- Remember that the risk for transmission of hepatitis, HIV, or other known viruses is extremely low.

C2 and C3 component deficiencies result in diminished resistance to bacterial infections. Angioneurotic edema is caused by an inherited deficiency of the inhibitor of C1 esterase, which opposes the release of inflammatory mediators. A deficiency of this inhibitor results in frequent episodes of urticaria and edema in various parts of the body.

Patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) lack decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which is found on erythrocytes (red blood cells). DAF normally protects the erythrocytes from lysis (disintegration). In PNH, the complement component C3b accumulates on the CR1 molecule on the erythrocyte, acts as a binding site for the late-acting component, and allows lysis to occur.

\section*{Secondary Immunodeficiencies}

Secondary immunodeficiencies are more common than primary immunodeficiencies and frequently occur as a result of underlying disease processes or from the treatment of these diseases. Common causes of secondary immunodeficiencies include malnutrition, chronic stress, burns, uremia, diabetes mellitus, certain autoimmune disorders, certain viruses, exposure to immunotoxic medications and chemicals, and self-administration of recreational drugs and alcohol. AIDS, the most common secondary immunodeficiency disorder, is discussed in detail in Chapter 52. Patients with secondary immunodeficiencies have immunosuppression and are often referred to as immunocompromised hosts.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of secondary immunodeficiencies includes diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease process. Interventions include eliminating the contributing factors, treating the underlying condition, and using sound principles of infection control.

\section*{Nursing Management for Patients With Immunodeficiencies}

Nursing management includes assessment, patient teaching, and supportive care. Assessment of the patient for infection and for response to treatment is important if it is to be effective. Nursing care of patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies depends on the underlying cause of the immunodeficiency, the type of immunodeficiency, and its severity. Because immunodeficiencies result in a compromised immune system and high risk for infection, careful assessment of the patient's immune status is essential. The assessment focuses on history of past infections, particularly the type and frequency of infection; signs and symptoms of any current skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary infection; and measures that prevent infection. The nurse monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of infection: fever; chills; cough with or without sputum; shortness of breath; difficulty breathing; difficulty swallowing; white patches in the oral cavity; swollen lymph nodes; nausea; vomiting; persistent diarrhea; frequency, urgency, or pain on urination; redness, swelling, or drainage from skin wounds; lesions on the face, lips, or perianal area; persistent vaginal discharge with or without perianal itching; and persistent abdominal pain.

Because the inflammatory response may be blunted, the patient is monitored for subtle and unusual signs and changes in physical status. Vital signs and the development of pain, neurologic signs, cough, and skin lesions are monitored and reported. Pulse rate and respiratory rate should be counted for a full minute, as even subtle changes can signal deterioration in the patient's clinical status. Thorough auscultation and assessment of the breath sounds are also key in detecting changes in respiratory status. Any unusual response to treatment and any significant change in the patient's clinical condition are promptly reported to the physician.

Fehder, W. P., Sachs, J., Uvaydova, M., \& Douglas, S. D. (1997). Substance P as an immune modulator of anxiety. Neuroimmunomodulation, 4(1), 42-48.

\section*{Purpose}

Proinflammatory peptide substance P ( SP ), a protein that is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, has been implicated in modulation of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood concentrations of SP have increased in response to psychological anxiety in humans. The purposes of this study were to 1) examine changes in SP levels in peripheral blood in response to anxiety over time, and 2) correlate changes in percentages of CD8-expressing T lymphocytes with alterations in measures of anxiety and SP.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Two groups of patients were included in the sample in an effort to have two groups of patients receiving similar diagnostic procedures but with different levels of anxiety. Subjects ( $\mathrm{n}=11$ ) in one group underwent colonoscopy with sedation and subjects ( $\mathrm{n}=12$ ) in the second group underwent sigmoidoscopy without sedation. It was expected that the patients who received sedation would have lower levels of anxiety than the nonsedated group. Anxiety was assessed by the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist-Revised state forms (MAACL-R), which were administered to patients prior to the diagnostic procedure, after the diagnostic procedure, and at a home visit 3 days after the procedure. At the same times that the MAACL-R was administered, blood samples were collected. A competitive solid-phase, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay was used to measure blood levels of SP. Flow cytometry was used to express the percentage of mononuclear cells bearing the specific marker.

Data from the two groups were compared using repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc $t$ test and Pearson's cor-
relation coefficients. A $p$ value of $<0.05$ was used to determine statistical significance.

\section*{Findings}

Data analysis revealed no significant differences between the anxiety levels of the two groups of patients before, immediately after, and 3 days after the procedures. As patients in both groups experienced high levels of preprocedure anxiety, the researchers divided the subjects into anxiety groups on the basis of the initial anxiety scores using a median split technique. SP levels were then examined by high and low levels of anxiety by repeated-measures ANOVA. The highanxiety group had significantly higher SP levels than the low-anxiety group. Post-hoc t tests revealed SP levels were significantly elevated in the high-anxiety group compared with the low-anxiety group both before and after the procedures. Blood levels of SP, once elevated, remained elevated after the cause of the initial anxiety was removed. Levels of SP in the peripheral blood were found to be significantly correlated with the percent and absolute numbers of CD8 and T lymphocytes.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

This study demonstrated that peripheral blood levels of SP may be influenced by levels of anxiety. These findings suggest that patients' anxiety level may have an effect on their immune system; therefore, nurses need to monitor anxiety levels in patients preparing for diagnostic and other procedures and design and implement measures to alleviate such anxiety-provoking situations. Such interventions may prevent changes in the immune system secondary to anxiety.

The nurse also monitors laboratory values (ie, white blood cell count and differential cell count) for changes indicating infection. Culture and sensitivity reports from wound drainage, lesions, sputum, stool, urine, and blood are monitored to identify pathogenic organisms and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Changes in laboratory results and subtle changes in clinical status must be reported to the physician because the immunocompromised patient may not develop typical signs and symptoms of infection.

Assessment also focuses on nutritional status; stress level and coping skills; use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco; and general hygiene, all of which may affect immune function. Strategies the patient has used to reduce risk for infection are identified.

Other aspects of nursing care are directed toward reducing the patient's risk for infection, assisting with medical measures aimed at improving immune status and treating infection, improving the nutritional status, and maintaining bowel and bladder function. These include careful hand hygiene, encouraging the patient to cough and perform deep-breathing exercises at regular intervals, and protecting the integrity of the skin and mucous membranes. All health care personnel must use strict aseptic technique when performing invasive procedures, such as dressing changes, venipunctures, and bladder catheterizations.

Other aspects of nursing care include assisting the patient in managing stress and in adopting a lifestyle that enhances immune system function.

If the patient is a candidate for any of the newer or experimental therapies (gene therapy, bone marrow transplantation, immunomodulators such as interferon gamma), the patient or
parents (if the patient is a child) must be informed about the potential risks and benefits of the treatment regimen. A major role of the nurse is to assist the patient and family to understand the treatment options and to cope with the uncertainties of treatment outcomes.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient and the caregivers are instructed about the signs and symptoms that indicate infection. The nurse explains that the immunosuppressed patient may also have atypical symptoms secondary to underlying immunosuppression. Patients should be advised that they know themselves best; therefore, whenever they experience a symptom that is not typical for them, they should contact their health care provider. The health care provider will then determine and initiate indicated therapy. The patient and caregiver need instruction about any prophylactic medication regimen, including dosage, indications, times, actions, and side effects. The patient is instructed about the importance of avoiding others with infections and avoiding crowds. The patient and family also need to learn about other ways to prevent infection (Chart 51-3).

The patient who is to receive IVIG at home will need information about the expected benefits and outcomes of the treatment as well as expected adverse reactions and their management (Chart 51-4). Patients who can perform self-infusion at home are instructed in sterile technique, medication dosages, administration rate, and detection and management of adverse reactions.

The patient and family must be instructed to monitor for subtle changes in physical status and must be informed of the importance of seeking immediate health care if changes occur. Patients and their families are also instructed about the importance of continuing the treatment regimen and assisted in incorporating it into their lives.

Continuing Care. The importance of follow-up appointments is emphasized to the patient and family. They are urged to notify the primary health care provider about early signs and symptoms of infection, including any subtle changes. The importance of continuing disease-prevention strategies is stressed because these strategies need to be followed lifelong. The patient should be encouraged to have recommended health screening because of the increased susceptibility for cancer secondary to the immune suppression.

\section*{Management of Patients With HIV Infection and AIDS}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the modes of transmission of HIV infection.
2. Describe the pathophysiology of HIV infection.
3. Explain the physiology underlying the clinical manifestations of HIV infection.
4. Describe the management of patients with HIV infection.
5. Discuss the nursing interventions appropriate for patients with HIV infection and AIDS.
6. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with AIDS.

Although progress has been made in treating HIV infection and AIDS, the epidemic remains a critical public health issue in all communities across the country and around the world. Prevention, early detection, and ongoing treatment remain important aspects of care for people with HIV infection and AIDS. Nurses in all settings encounter people with this disease; thus, nurses need an understanding of the disorder, knowledge of the physical and psychological consequences associated with the diagnosis, and expert assessment and clinical management skills to provide optimal care for people with HIV infection and AIDS.

In 1987, just 6 years after the first cases of AIDS were reported, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first antiretroviral agent; in 1988 the first randomized controlled trial of primary prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia appeared in the literature; and in 1995 protease inhibitors joined the growing number of antiretroviral agents. Improved treatment of HIV and AIDS has resulted in increased survival times; in 1996, 1997, and 1998, age-adjusted death rates fell $29 \%, 48 \%$, and $21 \%$, respectively (Lee et al., 2001).

\section*{HIV Infection and AIDS}

Since acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first recognized more than 20 years ago, remarkable progress has been made in improving the quality and duration of life of persons
with HIV infection. During the first decade, this progress was associated with recognition of opportunistic disease processes, more effective therapy for complications, and introduction of prophylaxis against common opportunistic infections (OIs). The second decade has witnessed progress in developing highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) as well as continuing progress in treating OIs (Masur, Kaplan \& Holmes, 1999). Since the HIV serologic test (enzyme immunoassay [EIA], formerly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISHA]), became available in 1984, allowing early diagnosis of the infection before onset of symptoms, HIV infection has been best managed as a chronic disease and most appropriately managed in an outpatient care setting (Gallant, 2001).

\section*{Epidemiology}

In fall 1982, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a case definition of AIDS after the first 100 cases were reported. Since then, the CDC has revised the case definition a number of times (1985, 1987, and 1993). All 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. dependencies and possessions, and independent nations in free association with the United States report AIDS cases to the CDC using a uniform surveillance case definition and case report form (CDC, 2000). Starting in the late 1990s, more states started to implement HIV case reporting in response to the changing epidemic and the need for information on persons with HIV infection who have not developed AIDS.
alpha-interferon: protein substance that the body produces in response to infection
anergy: loss or weakening of the body's immunity to an irritating agent or antigen
B-cell lymphoma: common malignancy in patients with HIV/AIDS
candidiasis: yeast infection of skin or mucous membrane
CCR5: cell surface molecule that is needed along with the CD4 molecule to fuse with the membranes of the host's immune system cells
cytomegalovirus: a species-specific herpes virus that may cause retinitis in people with AIDS
EIA (enzyme immunoassay): a blood test that determines the presence of antibodies to HIV in the blood or saliva; also referred to as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive results must be validated, usually with Western blot test.
HIV-1: retrovirus isolated and recognized as the etiologic agent of AIDS
HIV-2: virus closely related to HIV-1 that has also been found to cause AIDS
HIV encephalopathy: degenerative neurologic condition characterized by a group of clinical presentations including loss of coordination, mood swings, loss of inhibitions, and widespread cognitive dysfunctions; formerly referred to as AIDS dementia complex (ADC)
human papillomavirus (HPV): virus that causes venereal warts
Kaposi's sarcoma: malignancy that involves the epithelial layer of blood and lymphatic vessels
macrophage: large immune cell that devours invading pathogens and other intruders. Can harbor large quantities of HIV without being killed, acting as a reservoir of the virus.
monocyte: large white blood cell that ingests microbes or other cells and foreign particles. When a monocyte enters tissues, it develops into a macrophage.
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC): opportunistic infection caused by mycobacterial organisms that commonly causes a respiratory illness but can also infect other body systems
opportunistic infection (OI): illness caused by various organisms, some of which usually do not cause disease in persons with normal immune systems

protease inhibitor: medication that inhibits the function of protease, an enzyme needed for HIV replication
provirus: viral genetic material in the form of DNA that has been integrated into the host genome. When it is dormant in human cells, HIV is in a proviral form.
retrovirus: a virus that carries genetic material in RNA instead of DNA and contains reverse transcriptase
reverse transcriptase: enzyme that transforms single-stranded RNA into a doublestranded DNA
viral load test: measures the quantity of HIV RNA in the blood
viral set point: amount of virus present in the blood after the initial burst of viremia and the immune response that follows
wasting syndrome: involuntary weight loss of $10 \%$ of baseline body weight with chronic diarrhea or chronic weakness and documented fever.
Western blot assay: a blood test that identifies antibodies to HIV and is used to confirm the results of an EIA (ELISA) test
window period: time from infection with
HIV until seroconversion detected on HIV antibody test

As of December 2001, there were 816,149 reported cases of HIV/AIDS and 506,154 adults, adolescents, and children in the United States (including U. S. dependencies, possessions, and associated nations) living with AIDS. Unprotected sex and sharing of injection drug use equipment are the major means of transmission of HIV. A total of 43,158 AIDS cases were diagnosed in 2001. For men diagnosed with AIDS during 2001, $59 \%$ were in the exposure category of men who have sex with men; $24 \%$ in injection drug use; and $7 \%$ in heterosexual contact. In women diagnosed with AIDS during that same period, $44 \%$ reported injection drug use and $52 \%$ reported heterosexual contact. Comparing race/ ethnicity among the three largest groups diagnosed in 2001, 20,752 were black, not Hispanic; 11,675 were Caucasian; and 8,221 were Hispanic (CDC, 2002).

The number of people living with AIDS is not evenly distributed throughout the United States. States with the largest number of reported AIDS cases during 2001 were New York (7,476), Florida $(5,138)$, California $(4,315)$, Texas $(2,892)$, and Maryland $(1,860)($ CDC, 2002).

AIDS has reached epidemic proportions in some other parts of the world. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, more than 18.8 million people worldwide have died of AIDS and 34.3 million people are infected with HIV, with 5.4 million people newly infected with HIV in 1999 alone (Letvin, Bloom \& Hoffman, 2001). UNAIDS (2001) reports that since the epidemic began, more than 60 million people have been infected with the virus, making it the most devastating disease ever.

The earliest confirmed case of HIV infection was found in blood drawn from an African man in 1959 (Stephenson, 1998). Although factors associated with the spread of HIV in Africa remain unknown, possibilities include the reuse of unsterilized needles in large-scale vaccination campaigns that began in Africa in the 1960s; however, social changes such as easier access to transportation, increasing population density, and more frequent sexual contacts may have been more important (Stephenson, 1998).

\section*{HIV Transmission}

HIV-1 is transmitted in body fluids containing HIV and/or infected CD4+ (or CD4) T lymphocytes. These fluids include blood, seminal fluid, vaginal secretions, amniotic fluid, and breast milk. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 may occur in utero, at the time of delivery, or through breastfeeding, but transmission frequency during each period has been difficult to determine (Nduati et al., 2000). Any behavior that results in breaks in the skin or mucosa results in the increased probability of exposure to HIV (Chart 52-1). Since HIV is harbored within lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, any exposure to infected blood results in a significant risk of infection. The amount of virus and infected cells in the body fluid is associated with the risk of new infections.

Blood and blood products can transmit HIV to recipients. However, the risk associated with transfusions has been virtually eliminated as a result of voluntary self-deferral, serologic testing, heat treatment of clotting factor concentrates, and more effective virus inactivation methods. Blood donor screening tests detect antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2, and p24 antigen testing has been added as an interim measure (American Red Cross, 2001). However, blood donated during the window period will be infectious but will test negative for HIV antibodies. The window period is the period of time between initial infection of HIV and development of a positive antibody test for HIV. Although antibodies will usually be detected within 3 to 6 months, the window period can last up to a year (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/pcrs/ pcrs-app.htm).

\section*{Risk Factors for HIV Infection and AIDS}

In the United States, most people with HIV/AIDS have engaged in high-risk behaviors, such as the following:
- Intravenous or injection drug use (the term "intravenous drug user" has been replaced by the term "injecting (or injection) drug user." This term includes people who inject drugs intravenously as well as those who inject drugs intradermally. This method is sometimes referred to as "skin popping."
- Sexual relations with infected individuals (both male and female)
Also at risk are people who received blood or blood products contaminated with HIV (especially before blood screening was instituted in 1985) and children born to mothers with HIV infection.

\section*{Prevention of HIV Infection}

Until an effective vaccine is developed, preventing HIV by eliminating or reducing risk behaviors is essential. Primary prevention efforts through effective educational programs are vital for control and prevention. HIV is not transmitted by casual contact.

\section*{PREVENTIVE EDUCATION}

Effective educational programs have been initiated to educate the public regarding safer sexual practices to decrease the risk of transmitting HIV-1 infection to sexual partners (Chart 52-2). Latex condoms should be used during vaginal or anal intercourse. Nonlatex condoms are available for people with latex allergy. A condom should be used for oral contact with the penis, and dental dams (a piece of latex used by dentists to isolate a tooth for treatment) should be used for oral contact with the vagina or rectum. As a result of a clinical trial that found that female sex workers who used a nonoxynol-9 (N-9) gel intravaginally in addition to condoms were $50 \%$ more likely to be infected with HIV than those who did not use N-9 gel, the CDC issued the recommendation that intravaginal application of $\mathrm{N}-9$ should no longer be recommended as an effective means of HIV prevention (AIDS Institute, 9/21/00).

Other topics important in preventive education include the importance of avoiding sexual practices that might cut or tear the lining of the rectum, penis, or vagina and avoiding sexual contact with multiple partners or people who are known to be HIV positive or injection drug users. In addition, people who are HIV positive or use injection drugs should be instructed not to donate blood or share drug equipment with others. Increasingly, needle exchange programs are available to enable injection drug users to obtain sterile drug equipment at no cost. Extensive research has demonstrated that needle exchange programs do not promote increased drug use; on the contrary, they have been found to decrease the incidence of blood-borne infections in persons who use injection drugs (Trzcianowska \& Mortensen, 2001). In the absence of needle exchange programs, injection drug users should be instructed on methods to clean their syringes and to avoid sharing cotton and other drug use equipment.

\section*{RELATED REPRODUCTIVE EDUCATION}

Because HIV infection in women usually occurs during the childbearing years, family planning issues need to be addressed. Attempts to achieve pregnancy by couples in which one partner has HIV and the other does not expose the unaffected partner to the

virus. Efforts at artificial insemination using processed semen from an HIV-infected partner are underway. Studies are needed because HIV has been found in the spermatozoa of patients with AIDS, with possible HIV replication in the male germ cell. Women considering pregnancy need to have adequate information about the risks of transmitting HIV infection to themselves, their partner, and their future children and about the benefits of antiretroviral agents in reducing perinatal HIV transmission. Other than abstinence, the condom has been the only method that has proved to decrease the risk of sexual transmission of HIV infection.

Certain contraceptive methods may pose additional health risks for women. Estrogen in oral contraceptives may increase a women's risk for HIV infection. In addition, women infected with HIV who use estrogen oral contraceptives have shown increased shedding of HIV in vaginal and cervical secretions. The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) may also increase the risk for HIV transmission because the device's string may serve as a means to transmit HIV infection. It also can cause penile abrasions. The female condom is as effective in preventing pregnancy as other barrier methods, such as the diaphragm and the male condom. Unlike the diaphragm, the female condom is also effective in preventing the transmission of HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The female condom has the distinction of being the first barrier method that can be controlled by women (see Chap. 46).

\section*{Transmission to Health Care Providers}

\section*{STANDARD PRECAUTIONS}

In 1996, efforts were made by the CDC and its Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) to stan-
dardize procedures and reduce the risk for exposure through development of Standard Precautions. Standard Precautions incorporate the major features of Universal Precautions (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of blood-borne pathogens) and Body Substance Isolation (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens from moist body substances); they are applied to all patients receiving care in hospitals regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infectious status (Chart 52-3). Standard Precautions apply to blood; all body fluids, secretions, and excretions, except sweat, regardless of whether they contain visible blood; nonintact skin; and mucous membranes (Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee [HICPAC], 1996).

The primary goal of Standard Precautions is to prevent the transmission of nosocomial infection. The first tier, referred to as Standard Precautions, was developed to reduce the risk for all recognized or unrecognized sources of infections in hospitals. A second tier for infection control precautions for specified conditions, called Transmission-Based Precautions, was designed for use in addition to Standard Precautions for patients with documented or suspected infections involving highly transmissible pathogens. The three types of Transmission-Based Precautions are referred to as Airborne Precautions, Droplet Precautions, and Contact Precautions. They can be used singularly or in combination, but they are always to be used in addition to Standard Precautions (HICPAC, 1997).

Large-scale studies of exposed health care workers continue to be conducted by the CDC and other groups. In November 2000, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act became law, mandating health care facilities to use devices to protect against sharps injuries (Worthington, 2001).

\section*{POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS}

Postexposure prophylaxis in response to exposure of health care personnel to blood or other body fluids has been proven to reduce the risk for HIV infection (Worthington, 2001). The CDC (1998) recommends that all health care providers who have sustained a significant exposure to HIV be counseled and offered anti-HIV postexposure prophylaxis, if appropriate. Some clinicians are considering using postexposure prophylaxis for patients exposed to HIV from high-risk sexual behavior or possible contact through injection drug use. This use of postexposure prophylaxis is controversial because of concern that it may be substituted for safer sex practices and safer injection drug use. Postexposure prophylaxis should not be considered an acceptable method of preventing HIV infection.

The medications recommended for postexposure prophylaxis are those used to treat established HIV infection. Ideally, prophylaxis needs to start immediately after exposure; therapy started more than 72 hours after exposure is thought to offer no benefit.

The recommended course of therapy involves taking the prescribed mediations for 4 weeks. Those who choose postexposure prophylaxis must be prepared for the side effects of the medications and must be willing to face the unknown long-term risks, because HIV often becomes resistant to the medications used to treat it. If the person becomes infected despite prophylaxis, viral drug resistance may reduce future treatment options. The cost is also of concern; the cost of a drug regimen ranges from $\$ 500$ to more than $\$ 1,000$, plus the costs of testing and counseling. Health insurance generally does not cover the costs of medications, laboratory tests, and counseling (Chart 52-4).

\section*{Standard Precautions}

The following guidelines were developed to prevent the transmission of infection during patient care for all patients, regardless of known or unknown infectious status.

\section*{Hand Washing/Hand Hygiene}
- Wash hands/perform hand hygiene after touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items, whether or not gloves are worn.
- Wash hands/perform hand hygiene immediately after gloves are removed, between patient contacts, and when otherwise indicated to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments.
- Wash hands/perform hand hygiene between tasks and procedures on the same patient to prevent cross-contamination of different body sites.
- Use a plain (nonantimicrobial) soap or alcohol-based hand rub for routine hand washing.
- Use an antimicrobial agent or waterless antiseptic agent for specific circumstances (control of outbreaks or hyperendemic infections). (See Contact Precautions.)

\section*{Gloves}
- Wear clean, nonsterile gloves when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items.
- Put on clean gloves just before touching mucous membranes and nonintact skin.
- Change gloves between tasks and procedures on the same patient after contact with materials that may contain a high concentration of microorganisms.
- Remove gloves promptly after use, before touching noncontaminated items and environmental surfaces, and before going to another patient.
- Wash hands/perform hand hygiene immediately after removing gloves.

\section*{Mask, Eye Protection, Face Shield}
- Wear a mask and eye protection or a face shield to protect mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions.

\section*{Gown}
- Wear a clean, nonsterile gown to protect skin and prevent soiling of clothing during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions.
- Select a gown that is appropriate for the activity and amount of fluid likely to be encountered.
- Remove a soiled gown as promptly as possible and wash hands/perform hand hygiene to prevent the transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments.

\section*{Patient Care Equipment}
- Handle used patient care equipment soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions in a manner that prevents skin
and mucous membrane exposures, contamination of clothing, and transfer of microorganisms to other patients and environments.
- Ensure that reusable equipment is not used for the care of another patient until it has been cleaned and reprocessed appropriately.
- Ensure that single-use items are discarded properly.

\section*{Environmental Control}
- Ensure that the hospital has adequate procedures for the routine care, cleaning, and disinfection of environmental surfaces, beds, bed rails, bedside equipment, and other frequently touched surfaces.
- Ensure that procedures are being followed.

\section*{Linen}
- Handle, transport, and process used linen soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions in a manner that prevents skin and mucous membrane exposures and contamination of clothing and that avoids transfer of microorganisms to other patients and environments.

\section*{Occupational Health and Bloodborne Pathogens}
- Take care to prevent injuries when using needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices:

When handling sharp instruments after procedures
When cleaning used instruments
When disposing of used needles
- Never recap used needles or otherwise manipulate them by using both hands or use any technique that involves directing the point of the needle toward any part of the body.
- Use either a one-handed scoop technique or a mechanical device designed for holding the needle sheath.
- Do not remove used needles from disposable syringes by hand and do not bend, break, otherwise manipulate used needles by hand.
- Place used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items in appropriate puncture-resistant containers as close as practical to the area in which the items were used.
- Place reusable syringes and needles in a puncture-resistant container for transport to the reprocessing area.
- Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices as an alternative to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation methods in areas where the need for resuscitation is predictable.

\section*{Patient Placement}
- Place a patient who contaminates the environment or who does not or cannot be expected to assist in maintaining appropriate hygiene or environmental control in a private room.
- If a private room is not available, consult with infection control professionals regarding patient placement or other alternatives.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Since HIV infection is an infectious disease, it is important to understand how HIV integrates itself into a person's immune system and how immunity plays a role in the course of infection. This knowledge is also essential for understanding drug therapy and vaccine development.

Viruses are intracellular parasites. HIV belongs to a group of viruses known as retroviruses. These viruses carry their genetic material in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA) rather than deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). As can be seen in Figure 52-1, HIV consists of a viral core containing the viral RNA that is surrounded by an envelope consisting of glycoproteins (gp) that protrude. For HIV to enter the targeted cell, the membrane of the

viral envelope must be fused with the plasma membrane of the cell, a process mediated by the envelope glycoproteins of HIV (Wyatt \& Sodroski, 1998).

The HIV life cycle is complex and consists of a number of steps (Fig. 52-2). First, the HIV GP120 and GP41 attach to the uninfected CD4 cell surface (receptor) and fuse with the cell

membrane. Second, the viral core contents are emptied into the host cell, a process known as uncoating. Third, HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase copies the viral genetic material from RNA into double-stranded DNA. Fourth, double-stranded DNA is spliced into the cellular DNA by the action of another HIV enzyme integrase. Fifth, using the integrated DNA or provirus as a blueprint, the cell makes new viral proteins and viral RNA. Sixth, HIV protease cleaves the new proteins (polyproteins). Seventh, the new proteins join the viral RNA into new viral particles. Finally, new viral particles bud from the cell and start the process all over (Porth, 2002).

Perhaps the least understood aspects of the HIV life cycle are the events that occur immediately after entry of the viral core into the host CD4 cell. The process of viral assembly is intimately linked to its subsequent reversal (disassembly). Interactions occur between viral proteins and cellular factors in the cells that produce virus and frequently influence events at the next round of infection (Emerman \& Malim, 1998). In resting (nondividing) cells, HIV can apparently survive in a latent state as an integrated provirus that produces few or no viral particles. These resting CD4 T cells can be prodded to churn out new particles if something reactivates
them (Mellors, 1998). When a T cell that harbors this integrated DNA (also known as provirus) becomes activated against HIV or other microbes, the cell replicates and also unwittingly begins to produce new copies of both RNA and viral proteins (Bartlett \& Moore, 1998). Activation of the infected cell may be achieved by antigens, mitogens, select cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1), or virus gene products of such viruses as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and hepatitis. Consequently, whenever the infected T4 cell is activated, HIV replication and budding occur, which often destroys the host cell. Newly formed HIV is then released into the blood plasma and infects other CD4+ cells (see Fig. 52-1).

HIV-1 mutates quickly, at a relatively constant rate, with about $1 \%$ of the virus's genetic material changing annually. Over the years, 10 distinct subtypes of HIV-1 have emerged, designated A through J. Subtype B is the dominant subtype in North America and Europe, while subtype D predominates in Africa (Stephenson, 1998).

All viruses target specific cells. Lymphocytes consist of three major populations: T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells (Huston, 1997). Mature T cells are phenotypically composed of two major subpopulations defined by cell surface reciprocal expression of CD4 or CD8 (Huston, 1997). Approximately two thirds of peripheral blood T cells are CD4 and approximately one third are CD8. Most people have about 700 to $1,000 \mathrm{CD} 4$ cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, but as low as $500 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ can be considered "normal." HIV targets cells with the CD4 glycoprotein, which is expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and brain microglia (Wyatt \& Sodroski, 1998). A major function of CD4 binding is to induce conformational changes in the GP120 glycoprotein of the HIV envelope that contribute to the formation or exposure of the binding site for the chemokine receptors (Wyatt \& Sodroski, 1998). Most primary clinical isolates of HIV use the chemokine receptor CCR5 for entry. HIV-1 isolates arising later in the course of infection often use other chemokine receptors such as CXCR4 in addition to CCR5 (Wyatt \& Sodroski, 1998). HIV must attach to both the CD4 and CCR5 binding sites in order to infect CD4+ cells. CD4 fits into a recessed pocket in the viral envelope GP120 that may simply be too deep to be easily accessed by antibodies (Balter, 1998). A mutation of CCR5 was identified that is common among Caucasians but not other ethnic groups. About 1\% of Caucasians lack functional CCR5 and are highly protected against HIV infection even if exposed (although protection is not absolute); about $18 \%$ are not markedly protected against infection but if infected demonstrate significantly slower rates of disease progression (Collman, 1997).

\section*{Stages of HIV Disease}

The stage of HIV disease is based on clinical history, physical examination, laboratory evidence of immune dysfunction, signs and symptoms, and infections and malignancies. The CDC standard case definition of AIDS categorizes HIV infection and AIDS in adults and adolescents on the basis of clinical conditions associated with HIV infection and CD4+ T-cell counts. The classification system (Table 52-1) groups clinical conditions into one of three categories denoted as $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, or C .

\section*{PRIMARY INFECTION (ALSO KNOWN AS ACUTE HIV INFECTION OR ACUTE HIV SYNDROME)}

The period from infection with HIV to the development of antibodies to HIV is known as primary infection. During this period, there is intense viral replication and widespread dissemination of HIV throughout the body. Symptoms associated with the
viremia range from none to severe flu-like symptoms. During the primary infection period, the window period occurs because a person is infected with HIV but tests negative on the HIV antibody blood test. Although antibodies to the HIV envelope glycoproteins typically can be detected in the sera of HIV-infected individuals by 2 to 3 weeks after infection, most of these antibodies lack the ability to inhibit virus infection. By the time neutralizing antibodies are detected, HIV-1 is firmly established in the host (Wyatt \& Sodroski, 1998). During this period, there are high levels of viral replication and the killing of CD4 T cells, resulting in high levels of HIV in the blood and a dramatic drop in CD4 T cell counts from the normal level of at least 800 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ of blood. About 3 weeks into this acute phase, individuals may display symptoms reminiscent of mononucleosis, such as fever, enlarged lymph nodes, rash, muscle aches, and headaches. These symptoms resolve within another 1 to 3 weeks as the immune system begins to gain some control over the virus. That is, the CD4 T-cell population responds in ways that spur other immune cells, such as CD8 lymphocytes, to increase their killing of infected, virus-producing cells. The body produces antibody molecules in an effort to contain the virus; they bind to free HIV particles (outside cells) and assist in their removal (Bartlett \& Moore, 1998). This balance between the amount of HIV in the body and the immune response is referred to as the viral set point and results in a steady state of infection. During this steady state, which can last for years, the amount of virus in circulation and the number of infected cells equal the rate of viral clearance (Ropka \& Williams, 1998).

Primary HIV infection, the time during which the viral burden set point is achieved, includes the acute symptomatic and early infection phases. During this initial stage, viral replication is associated with dissemination in lymphoid tissue and a distinct immunologic response. The final level of the viral set point is inversely correlated with disease prognosis; that is, the higher the viral set point, the poorer the prognosis (Cates, Chesney \& Cohen, 1997). The primary infection stage is part of CDC category A.

\section*{HIV ASYMPTOMATIC (CDC CATEGORY A: MORE THAN 500 CD4+ T LYMPHOCYTES/MM ${ }^{3}$ )}

On reaching a viral set point, a chronic, clinically asymptomatic state begins. Despite its best efforts, the immune system rarely if ever fully eliminates the virus. By about 6 months, the rate of viral replication reaches a lower but relatively steady state that is reflected in the maintenance of viral levels at a kind of "set point." This set point varies greatly from patient to patient and dictates the subsequent rate of disease progression; on average, 8 to 10 years pass before a major HIV-related complication develops. In this prolonged, chronic stage, patients feel well and show few if any symptoms (Bartlett \& Moore, 1998). Apparent good health continues because CD4 T-cell levels remain high enough to preserve defensive responses to other pathogens.

\section*{HIV SYMPTOMATIC (CDC CATEGORY B: 200 T0 499 CD4+ T LYMPHOCYTES/MM ${ }^{3}$ )}

Over time, the number of CD4 T cells gradually falls. Category B consists of symptomatic conditions in HIV-infected patients that are not included in the conditions listed in category C . These conditions must also meet one of the following criteria: (1) the condition is due to HIV infection or a defect in cellular immunity, or (2) the condition must be considered to have a clinical course or require management that is complicated by HIV infection. If an individual was once treated for a category B condition and has not developed a category C disease but is now symptomfree, that person's illness would be considered category $B$.

\section*{AIDS (CDC CATEGORY C: LESS THAN 200 CD4+ T LYMPHOCYTES/MM ${ }^{3}$ )}

When CD4 T-cell levels drop below 200 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ of blood, patients are said to have AIDS. As levels fall below 100, the immune system is significantly impaired (Bartlett \& Moore, 1998). Once a patient has had a category C condition, he or she remains in category C. This classification has implications for entitlements (ie, disability benefits, housing, and food stamps) since these programs are often linked to an AIDS diagnosis. Although the revised classification emphasizes CD4+ T-cell counts, it allows for $\mathrm{CD} 4+$ percentages (percentage of $\mathrm{CD} 4+\mathrm{T}$ cells of total lymphocytes). The CD4+ percentage is less subject to variation on repeated measurements than is the absolute CD4+ T-cell count. Less than $14 \%$ of the CD4+ T cells of the total lymphocytes is consistent with an AIDS diagnosis. The percentage, as compared to the absolute number of CD4+ T cells, becomes particularly important when the patient has a heightened immune response to infections in addition to HIV. One complication of advanced

HIV infection is anemia, which may be caused by HIV, opportunistic diseases, and medications (Collier et al., 2001).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

During the first stage of HIV infection, the patient may be asymptomatic or may exhibit various signs and symptoms. The patient history should alert the health care provider about the need for HIV screening based on the patient's sexual practices, injection drug use, and receipt of blood transfusions. Additionally, exposure to body fluids containing infected blood while providing care to others with HIV infection, such as through needlesticks, should alert health care providers to possible HIV infection. Patients who are in later stages of HIV infection may have a variety of symptoms related to their immunosuppressed state.

Several screening tests are used to diagnose HIV infection. Others are used to assess the stage and severity of the infection. Table 52-2 identifies common blood tests.

\section*{HIV ANTIBODY TESTS}

In 1985, the FDA licensed an HIV-1 antibody assay, which is used to screen all blood and plasma donations. When an individual is infected with HIV, the immune system responds by producing antibodies against the virus, usually within 3 to 12 weeks after infection. This delay in the production of antibody helps to explain why a person may be infected but not test antibodypositive during primary infection. The ability to document HIV antibodies in the blood has permitted screening of blood products and facilitated identification of individuals with HIV infection. Before an HIV antibody test is performed, the meaning of the test and possible test results are explained, and informed consent for the test is obtained from the patient. When results of the HIV antibody testing are received, they are carefully explained to the patient in private (Chart 52-5). All test results are kept confidential. Education and counseling about the test results and disease transmission are essential.

Blood samples are tested with two different blood tests to determine the presence of antibodies to HIV. The EIA (enzyme immunoassay), formerly referred to as the ELISA (enzymelinked immunosorbent assay) test, identifies antibodies directed specifically against HIV. The Western blot assay is used to con-

\section*{Chart 52-5 PATIENT EDUCATION \\ HIV Test Results: Implications for Patients}

\section*{Interpretation of Positive Test Results}
- Antibodies to HIV are present in the blood (the patient has been infected with the virus, and the body has produced antibodies).
- HIV is active in the body, and the patient can transmit the virus to others.
- Despite HIV infection, the patient does not necessarily have AIDS.
- The patient is not immune to AIDS (the antibodies do not indicate immunity).

\section*{Interpretation of Negative Test Results}
- Antibodies to HIV are not present in the blood at this time, which can mean that the patient has not been infected with HIV or, if infected, the body has not yet produced antibodies (which takes from 3 weeks to 6 months or longer).
- The patient should continue taking precautions. The test result does not mean that the patient is immune to the virus, nor does it mean the patient is not infected; it just means that the body may not have produced antibodies yet.
firm seropositivity when the EIA is positive. People whose blood contains antibodies for HIV are seropositive. Saliva can also be tested using the EIA antibody test.

The FDA approved a rapid HIV antibody screening test in November 2002. Using less than a drop of blood, this new test can quickly (approximately 20 minutes) and reliably ( $99.6 \%$ accuracy) detect antibodies to HIV-1. It is anticipated that the newly approved HIV test, the OraQuick Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test, will allow more rapid notification of individuals about their HIV status so that they can obtain care early in the course of HIV infection and take measures to help prevent the spread.

Patients' psychological responses to seropositive test results may include feelings of panic, depression, and hopelessness. The social and interpersonal consequences of a positive test result can be devastating. Patients may lose their sexual partners and their health insurance because of disclosure; they may experience discrimination in employment and housing as well as social ostracism. For these reasons and others, patients who test positive may need ongoing counseling as well as referrals for social, financial, medical, and psychological support services. Patients whose test results are seronegative may develop a false sense of security, possibly resulting in continued high-risk behaviors or feelings that they are immune to the virus. They may need ongoing counseling to help them modify high-risk behaviors and to return for repeated testing. Other patients may experience anxiety regarding the uncertainty of their status.

Home-based testing for HIV antibodies using a small amount of blood was first proposed in 1985 but not approved by the FDA until 1995. Although home testing kits are commercially available, they do raise concerns because of the lack of counseling and the possibility of inaccurate results, including both false-positive and false-negative results (Lewis, 2001).

\section*{VIRAL LOAD TESTS}

Target amplification methods quantify HIV RNA or DNA levels in the plasma and have replaced p24 antigen capture assays. Target amplification methods include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or nucleic acid sequencebased amplification (NASBA). A widely used viral load test measures plasma HIV RNA levels. Currently, these tests are used to track viral load and response to treatment for HIV infection. RT-PCR is also used to detect HIV in high-risk seronegative people before the development of antibodies, to confirm a positive EIA, and to screen neonates. HIV culture or quantitative plasma culture and plasma viremia are additional tests that measure viral burden, but they are used infrequently. Viral load is a better predictor of the risk of HIV disease progression than the CD4
count. The lower the viral load, the longer the time to AIDS diagnosis and the longer the survival time.

\section*{Treatment of HIV Infection}

Protocols of how to treat HIV disease change relatively often. Yearly a team of physicians from throughout the United States evaluates the latest evidence and makes recommendations that are widely disseminated, and monthly a subgroup evaluates available evidence (Panel on Clinical Practices for Treatment of HIV Infection [Panel], 2002). Treatment decisions for an individual patient are based on three factors: HIV RNA (viral load); CD4 T-cell count; and the clinical condition of the patient (Panel, $2000)$. Treatment should be offered to all patients with the primary infection (acute HIV syndrome, as previously described). In general, treatment should be offered to individuals with a T-cell count of less than 350 or plasma HIV RNA levels exceeding 55,000 copies $/ \mathrm{mL}$ (RT-PCR assay) (Panel, 2002).

The increasing number of antiretroviral agents (Table 52-3) and the rapid evolution of new information have introduced extraordinary complexity into the treatment of HIV-infected persons (Panel, 2000). Adherence rates among persons living with HIV and AIDS are no different from those of patients with other chronic diseases (Williams, 2001). Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have major side effects, pose difficulties with regard to adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance due to lack of adherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents (Panel, 2000). The goals of treatment are maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and/or preservation of immunologic function, improved quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. The Panel's guidelines recommend viral load testing at diagnosis and every 3 to 4 months thereafter in the untreated person; T-cell counts should be measured at diagnosis and generally every 3 to 6 months thereafter.

It is difficult to predict which patients will adhere to medication regimens (Holzemer, Corless, Nokes, et al., 1999). Perceived engagement with the health care provider has been associated with greater adherence to HIV medication regimens (Bakken et al., 2000). Individualized plans of care that take into consideration housing and social support issues in addition to health indicators are essential.

Results of therapy are evaluated with viral load tests (Panel, $2000)$. Viral load levels should be measured immediately prior to and again at 2 to 8 weeks after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, since in most patients adherence to a regimen of potent antiretroviral agents should result in a large decrease in the viral load by 2 to 8 weeks. The viral load should continue to decline over the following weeks and in most individuals will drop below detectable levels (currently defined as less than 50 RNA copies $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ) by 16 to 20 weeks. The rate of viral load decline toward undetectable levels is affected by the baseline T-cell count, the initial viral load, the potency of the medication, adherence of the patient to the medication regimen, prior exposure to antiretroviral agents, and the presence of any OIs (Panel, 2000). The confirmed absence of a viral load response should prompt the health care team to re-evaluate the regimen.

All approved anti-HIV drugs attempt to block viral replication within cells by inhibiting either reverse transcriptase or the HIV protease (Bartlett \& Moore, 1998). A treatment duration of 5 to 7 years of continuous therapy is difficult because of the complexity, toxicity, and cost of the current drug regimens, especially when the concept of maintenance therapy with a simplified reg-
imen does not seem viable (Ho, 1998). Medication side effects can make life difficult and are one of the main reasons people miss doses of the medications or stop taking them completely (Horn \& Pieribone, 1999).

All medications have toxic side effects. The nurse can obtain Web-based information to remain current about medications used to treat HIV/AIDS. The NIH (National Institutes of Health) maintains an AIDS drug line Website (see resources at the end of this chapter). Increasing numbers of patients with HIV infection receiving medications are presenting with metabolic complications such as increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels, hyperglycemia, and altered body habitus (NIAID, 2001). Toxicity to cell mitochondria may be involved in many of the side effects of HIV medications, including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy and cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis (fatty degeneration of liver), pancreatitis, osteopenia and osteoporosis, and bone marrow suppression. Fat redistribution (lipodystrophy syndrome, also known as pseudo-Cushing's syndrome [Panel, 2001]) is one of the most frequent systemic side effects. Many people who have lipodystrophy experience an increase in fat loss in the legs, arms, and face and/or a buildup of fat around the abdomen and at the base of the neck. Patients may also experience an increase in breast size. These changes in body image can be very disturbing to persons living with HIV/AIDS and have been reported to occur in $6 \%$ to $80 \%$ of patients receiving HAART (see following discussion). Hepatotoxicity associated with certain protease inhibitors may limit the use of these agents, especially in patients with underlying liver dysfunction (Panel, 2000).

Combination therapy is defined as a regimen containing any combination of two antiretroviral agents; HAART is defined as a regimen consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or two protease inhibitors and one other antiretroviral agent (Agins, 2000). As new medications are developed, the number of combinations continues to increase. Safety and efficacy data on many of the combination therapies are limited. Use of three- and four-drug combination regimens has become more widespread, starting earlier in the course of infection, with careful monitoring by viral load measures. In some patients receiving three-drug regimens, viral levels are so low that they are no longer detectable. Future therapy may be individualized based on the viral strain and resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Initially, HAART consisting of a triple-drug regimen (a protease inhibitor and two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) is recommended. Drawbacks of HAART are the inability of some patients to adhere to the regimen, the need to take multiple medications on different dosing schedules, and the risk for drug interactions. The duration of therapy needed to control acute HIV infection is unknown, but therapy may continue for several years or for life. Combination therapy with different types of fusion and entry inhibitors (such as T-20) may be synergistic against HIV. These agents fall into a new category of HIV medications called fusion inhibitors and target the GP120 during the initial stage of the HIV life cycle, which is cell fusion (Saag, 2001).

\section*{Drug Resistance}

Drug resistance can be broadly defined as the ability of pathogens to withstand the effects of medications intended to be toxic to them. Resistance develops as a result of spontaneous genetic mutation of the pathogens or in response to exposure to the

\section*{Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)}

Act by becoming part of HIV's DNA and derail its building process. As a result, the damaged viral DNA cannot take control of the host cell's DNA (Gracia Jones, 2001). Possible adverse reactions associated with medications that act through this mechanism include peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, bone marrow suppression, neutropenia, anemia, arthralgia, myopathy, kidney dysfunction, hepatomegaly, liver failure, vision changes, neuropathy, hypersensitivity reaction, abdominal pain, fever, chills, sore throat, oral ulcers, dry mouth, muscle and joint pain, irritability, anxiety, nervousness (Gracia Jones, 2001). Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis (fatty degeneration of the liver) is a rare but potentially life-threatening toxicity with this classification of medications (Panel on Clinical Practices, 2000, 2001).

\section*{Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)}

Act by attaching to the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which prevents it from converting HIV RNA into HIV DNA (Gracia Jones, 2001). Possible adverse reactions for this group of agents include abnormal liver function test results, hepatitis, stomatitis, numbness, muscle pain, drowsiness, changes in dreams, trouble concentrating, severe psychiatric symptoms in rare cases (severe depression, suicidal thoughts, angry behavior) (Gracia Jones, 2001). Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported with the use of this class of medications (Panel on Clinical Practices, 2000, 2001). Drug resistance develops very easily, which makes adherence essential.

\section*{Protease inhibitors}

Work at a later stage in the HIV replication process by preventing the protease enzyme from cutting HIV viral proteins into the viral particles that infect new CD4 T4 cells. As a result, new copies of HIV are defective and unable to infect new host cells (Gracia Jones, 2001). Possible adverse reactions include hemolytic anemia, paresthesia, kidney stones, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, dyspepsia, numbness (of lips, hands, or feet), altered taste, drowsiness, mood alterations (Gracia Jones, 2001); in patients with hemophilia, there are possible increased bleeding episodes (Panel on Clinical Practices, 2000, 2001).

medication (Esch \& Frank, 2001). Factors associated with the development of drug resistance include serial monotherapy (taking one medication at a time), inadequate suppression of virus replication with suboptimal treatment regimens, difficulty with adherence to complex and toxic regimens, and initiation of therapy late in the course of HIV infection (Boden et al., 1999). HIV-1 may find refuge in organ sanctuaries such as behind the blood-brain barrier, where diminished drug concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS) might induce the development of drug-resistant mutants (Cavert \& Haase, 1998). HIV-1 persists in lymphoid tissue even in individuals who appear to have responded well to antiviral therapy (Letvin, 1998). Deciding whether the medication regimen is effective or ineffective is a complex phenomenon. Some individuals experience an optimal response to treatment, as shown by effective viral suppression and ensuing immune recovery; others experience increasing CD4+ cell counts in the presence of ongoing viral replication or blunted immune recovery despite viral control, and finally complete treatment failure (Perrin \& Telenti, 1998).

Central to the complexity of HIV drug resistance are the phenomenon of HIV quasi-species (the simultaneous presence in a patient of multiple viral variants), the extent of cross-resistance among antiviral agents, the existence in each individual of archival HIV DNA copies representing all viruses that emerged under the
patient's previous treatment, and the preexistence of resistant variants even without prior exposure to the medication (Perrin \& Telenti, 1998). Measurement of HIV drug susceptibility for management of HIV infection is now practical using recombinant DNA technology (Hirsch et al., 2000). Although available data support a role for HIV drug resistance testing in selecting medications in many clinical situations, these test results should not be used as the principal criterion for decisions on initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy. Such decisions should be based primarily on the patient's plasma HIV viral load. Several factors in addition to resistance testing must be considered in choosing medications for a new regimen once the prior regimen has failed. These factors include the patient's past treatment history, viral load, medication tolerance, the likelihood of the patient adhering to the medication regimen, and concomitant medical conditions or medications (Hirsch et al., 2000). Blood specimens should be obtained for resistance testing before the failing drug regimen is stopped (Hirsch et al., 2000).

\section*{Structured Intermittent Therapy}

Because of drug toxicities, drug resistance, difficulties with adherence, and the high cost of medications, the complex medication regimen is often difficult for patients to follow. In an effort
to determine if alternative treatment approaches are possible, a study is underway to examine patients' responses to stopping HAART therapy by monitoring their immune status and viral load (Dybul et al., 2001). This would allow patients to move from a continuous regimen of anti-HIV therapy to a strategy in which they discontinue therapy for a specific period of time (ie, 7 days) and then resume therapy for 7 days. This approach is known as structured intermittent therapy. While preliminary results of the study are promising, larger studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these alternative medication regimens.

\section*{IMMUNOMODULATOR THERAPY}

Combating HIV infection requires not only agents that will inhibit viral growth but also those that will restore or augment the damaged immune system. New therapies are needed to restore immune function, and immunologic markers need to be identified to predict the success of therapy (NIAID, 2001). Current research is testing the effectiveness of interleukin-2, interleukin-12, and other cytokines and lymphokines (NIAID, 2001).

\section*{VACCINES}

HIV-1 is a uniquely difficult target for the development of vaccines (Letvin, 1998). Since HIV-1 was discovered, researchers have been working to develop a vaccine. A vaccine is a substance that triggers the production of antibodies to destroy the offending organism. Most vaccines activate the humoral arm of the immune system, which stimulates the production of protective antibodies. In addition to antibodies, B lymphocytes take the form of memory B cells. These cells do not produce antibodies immediately but respond vigorously to subsequent exposure. Vaccines that stimulate the cellular arm of the immune system are being developed. Since 1995, there have been a variety of vaccines under study using different strategies to prevent HIV infection in animals and humans. Some researchers are exploring whether different immunization schedules, different schedules of boosters, or a combination of several vaccines will result in stronger or more durable responses. Creation of an HIV vaccine is feasible, but a worldwide commitment is needed. Cooperation between all nations is necessary to develop and commit the resources to develop the vaccine and to create and support the infrastructure needed to facilitate testing of vaccine immunogens (Letvin, Bloom \& Hoffman, 2001).

Clinical trials began in November 2002 to test an HIV vaccine that incorporates three HIV subtypes that cause about $90 \%$ of all HIV-1 infections around the world. The first phase of this yearlong trial, which is being conducted at NIH, is examining the vaccine's safety. Subsequent trials will be conducted to determine the immune response to the vaccines (NIH News Release, 11/13/2002).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Treatment of specific manifestations of HIV infection and AIDS in the person with advanced disease targets specific symptoms. These are discussed later in this chapter.

Patients with HIV/AIDS experience a number of symptoms related to the disease as well as the effects of treatment. Nurses need to understand the causes, signs and symptoms, and interventions to enhance the quality of life of patients with HIV across the illness trajectory (Ropka \& Williams, 1998; Sherman, 1999). The clinical manifestations of HIV/AIDS are widespread and may affect virtually any organ system. Diseases associated with HIV infection and AIDS result from infections, malignancies, or
the direct effect of HIV on body tissues. Symptom assessment tools developed for research purposes could be useful in clinical practice to assess symptom intensity and severity (Holzemer, Henry, Nokes, et al., 1999; Nokes, Wheeler \& Kendrew, 1994; Nokes \& Bakken, 2002).

\section*{RESPIRATORY MANIFESTATIONS}

Shortness of breath, dyspnea (labored breathing), cough, chest pain, and fever are associated with various OIs, such as those caused by Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, CMV, and Legionella species. The most common infection in people with AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), one of the first OIs described in association with AIDS.

PCP. PCP is the most common OI resulting in an AIDS diagnosis. Without prophylactic therapy (discussed below), PCP will develop in $80 \%$ of all HIV-infected individuals. P. carinii was originally classified as a protozoan; however, studies and analysis of its ribosomal RNA structure suggest that it is a fungus. Its structure and antimicrobial sensitivity are very different from other diseasecausing fungi. P. carinii causes disease only in immunocompromised hosts, invading and proliferating within the pulmonary alveoli with resultant consolidation of the pulmonary parenchyma.

The clinical presentation of PCP in HIV infection is generally less acute than in people who are immunosuppressed as a result of other conditions. The time between the onset of symptoms and the actual documentation of disease may be weeks to months. Patients with AIDS initially develop nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as nonproductive cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and occasionally chest pain. PCP may be present despite the absence of crackles. Arterial oxygen concentrations in patients breathing room air may be mildly decreased, indicating minimal hypoxemia.

Untreated, PCP eventually progresses and causes significant pulmonary impairment and, ultimately, respiratory failure. A few patients have a dramatic onset and fulminant course involving severe hypoxemia, cyanosis, tachypnea, and altered mental status. Respiratory failure can develop within 2 to 3 days of initial symptoms.

PCP can be diagnosed definitively by identifying the organism in lung tissue or bronchial secretions. This is accomplished by such procedures as sputum induction, bronchial-alveolar lavage, and transbronchial biopsy (by fiberoptic bronchoscopy).

Mycobacterium avium Complex. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease is a leading OI in people with AIDS. Organisms belonging to MAC include M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. scrofulaceum. MAC, comprising a group of acid-fast bacilli, usually causes respiratory infection but is also commonly found in the GI tract, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Most patients with AIDS who have T-cell counts less than 100 have widespread disease at diagnosis and are usually debilitated. MAC infections are associated with rising mortality rates.

Tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis tends to occur in injection drug users and other groups with a preexisting high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) infection. Unlike other OIs, TB tends to occur early in the course of HIV infection, usually preceding the diagnosis of AIDS. This early occurrence is associated with the development of caseating granulomas (dry, cheeselike masses of granulation tissue), which should raise the suspicion of TB. At this stage, TB responds well to antituberculosis therapy.

TB that occurs late in HIV infection is characterized by absence of an immune response to a tuberculin skin test response.

This is known as anergy and results because the compromised immune system can no longer respond to the TB antigen. In the later stages of HIV infection, TB is associated with dissemination to extrapulmonary sites such as the CNS, bone, pericardium, stomach, peritoneum, and scrotum. Multiple drug-resistant strains of the bacillus have emerged and are often associated with noncompliance with antituberculosis therapy.

\section*{GI MANIFESTATIONS}

The GI manifestations of AIDS include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, oral and esophageal candidiasis, and chronic diarrhea. Diarrhea is a problem in $50 \%$ to $90 \%$ of all AIDS patients. GI symptoms may be related to the direct effect of HIV on the cells lining the intestines. Some of the enteric pathogens that occur most frequently, identified by stool cultures or intestinal biopsy, include Cryptosporidium muris, Salmonella species, Isopora belli, Giardia lamblia, CMV, Clostridium difficile, and M. aviumintracellulare. In patients with AIDS, the effects of diarrhea can be devastating in terms of profound weight loss (more than $10 \%$ of body weight), fluid and electrolyte imbalances, perianal skin excoriation, weakness, and inability to perform the usual activities of daily living.

Oral Candidiasis. Candidiasis, a fungal infection, occurs in nearly all patients with AIDS and AIDS-related conditions. Commonly preceding other life-threatening infections, it is characterized by creamy-white patches in the oral cavity. Untreated, oral candidiasis progresses to involve the esophagus and stomach. Associated signs and symptoms include difficult and painful swallowing and retrosternal pain. Some patients also develop ulcerating oral lesions and are particularly susceptible to dissemination of candidiasis to other body systems.

Wasting Syndrome. Wasting syndrome is part of the category C case definition for AIDS. Diagnostic criteria include profound involuntary weight loss exceeding $10 \%$ of baseline body weight and either chronic diarrhea for more than 30 days or chronic weakness and documented intermittent or constant fever in the absence of any concurrent illness that could explain these findings. This protein-energy malnutrition is multifactorial. In some AIDS-associated illnesses, patients experience a hypermetabolic state in which excessive calories are burned and lean body mass is lost. This state is similar to that seen in sepsis and trauma and can lead to organ failure. A distinction between cachexia (wasting) and malnutrition or between cachexia and simple weight loss is important because the metabolic derangement seen in wasting syndrome may not be modified by nutritional support alone.

Anorexia, diarrhea, GI malabsorption, and lack of nutrition in chronic disease all contribute to wasting syndrome. Progressive tissue wasting, however, may occur with only modest GI involvement and without diarrhea. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are cytokines that play important roles in AIDS-related wasting syndrome. Both act directly on the hypothalamus to cause anorexia. Cytokine-induced fever accelerates the body's metabolism by $14 \%$ for every $1^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ increase in temperature. TNF causes inefficient use of lipids by reducing enzymes that are needed for fat metabolism, whereas IL-1 triggers the release of amino acids from muscle tissue. People with AIDS generally experience increased protein metabolism in relation to fat metabolism, which results in significant decreases in lean body mass due to muscle and protein breakdown.

Hypertriglyceridemia, seen in people with AIDS and attributed to chronically elevated cytokine levels, can persist in people
with AIDS for months without tissue wasting and loss of lean body mass. It is believed that infections and sepsis lead to transient rises in TNF, IL-1, and other cell mediators above the chronically elevated levels generally seen. These transient rises in TNF and IL-1 trigger muscle wasting.

\section*{ONCOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS}

Patients with AIDS have a higher than usual incidence of cancer, possibly related to HIV stimulation of developing cancer cells or to the immune deficiency allowing cancer-causing substances, such as viruses, to transform susceptible cells into malignant cells. Kaposi's sarcoma, certain types of B-cell lymphomas, and invasive cervical carcinoma are included in the CDC classification of AIDS-related malignancies. Carcinomas of the skin, stomach, pancreas, rectum, and bladder also occur more frequently than expected in people with AIDS.

Kaposi's Sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common HIV-related malignancy, is a disease involving the endothelial layer of blood and lymphatic vessels. It is associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) transmission (USPHS/IDSA, 2002). When first noted in 1872 by Dr. Moritz Kaposi, KS characteristically presented as lower-extremity skin lesions in elderly men of Eastern European ancestry. This form, referred to as classic Kaposi's sarcoma, was slow to progress and easily treated. An endemic form of KS, found in children and young men in equatorial Africa, is more virulent than the classic form. Acquired KS occurs in patients who are treated with immunosuppressive agents and commonly occurs in patients who have undergone organ transplantation. In such patients, acquired KS usually resolves once the dose of the immunosuppressive medication is decreased or discontinued. In people with AIDS, epidemic KS is most often seen in male homosexuals and bisexuals.

Although the histopathology of all forms of KS is virtually identical, the clinical manifestations differ: AIDS-related KS exhibits a more variable and aggressive course, ranging from localized cutaneous lesions to disseminated disease involving multiple organ systems. Cutaneous signs may be the first manifestations of HIV, appearing in more than $90 \%$ of HIV-infected patients as immune function deteriorates. These skin signs correlate to low CD4 counts. Some disorders, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, facial molluscum contagiosum, dry skin, and oral candidiasis, indicate CD4 counts at or below 200 to 300.

Cutaneous lesions appearing anywhere on the body are usually brownish pink to deep purple. They may be flat or raised and surrounded by ecchymoses (hemorrhagic patches) and edema (Fig. 52-3). Rapid development of lesions involving large areas of skin is associated with extensive disfigurement. The location and size of some lesions can lead to venous stasis, lymphedema, and pain. Ulcerative lesions disrupt skin integrity and increase discomfort and susceptibility to infection. The most common sites of visceral involvement include the lymph nodes, GI tract, and lungs. Involvement of internal organs may eventually lead to organ failure, hemorrhage, infection, and death.

Diagnosis of KS is confirmed by biopsy of suspected lesions. Prognosis depends on the extent of the tumor, presence of constitutional symptoms, and CD4 count. Death may result from tumor progression. More often, however, it results from other complications of HIV infection.

B-Cell Lymphomas. B-cell lymphomas are the second most common malignancy occurring in people with AIDS. Lymphomas associated with AIDS usually differ from those occurring

EIGURE 52-3 Lesions of the AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Whereas some patients may have lesions that remain flat, others experience extensively disseminated, raised lesions with edema.

in the general population. Patients with AIDS are generally much younger than the usual population affected by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In addition, AIDS-related lymphomas tend to develop outside the lymph nodes, most commonly in the brain, bone marrow, and GI tract. These types of lymphomas are characteristically of a higher grade, indicating aggressive growth and resistance to treatment. The course of AIDS-related lymphomas includes multiple sites of organ involvement and complications related to OIs. Although aggressive combination chemotherapy is frequently successful in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not associated with HIV infection, it is less successful in people with AIDS because of the severe hematologic toxicity and complications of OIs that occur from treatment.

\section*{NEUROLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS}

An estimated $80 \%$ of all patients with AIDS experience some form of neurologic involvement during the course of HIV infection. Many neuropathologic disorders are underreported because patients may have neurologic involvement without overt signs or symptoms. Neurologic complications involve central, peripheral, and autonomic functions.

Neurologic dysfunction results from the direct effects of HIV on nervous system tissue, OIs, primary or metastatic neoplasms, cerebrovascular changes, metabolic encephalopathies, or complications secondary to therapy. Immune system response to HIV infection in the CNS includes inflammation, atrophy, demyelination, degeneration, and necrosis.

HIV Encephalopathy. HIV encephalopathy was formerly referred to as AIDS dementia complex. It is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive, behavioral, and motor functions. Substantial evidence exists that HIV encephalopathy is a direct result of HIV infection. HIV has been found in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with HIV encephalopathy. The brain cells infected by HIV are predominantly the CD4 cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage. HIV infection is thought to trigger the release of toxins or lymphokines that result in cellular dysfunction or interference with neurotransmitter function rather than cellular damage.

Signs and symptoms may be subtle and difficult to distinguish from fatigue, depression, or the adverse effects of treatment for
infections and malignancies. Early manifestations include memory deficits, headache, difficulty concentrating, progressive confusion, psychomotor slowing, apathy, and ataxia. Later stages include global cognitive impairments, delay in verbal responses, a vacant stare, spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia, psychosis, hallucinations, tremor, incontinence, seizures, mutism, and death.

Confirming the diagnosis of HIV encephalopathy may be difficult. Extensive neurologic evaluation includes a computed tomography (CT) scan, which may indicate diffuse cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Other tests that may detect abnormalities include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), analysis of CSF through lumbar puncture, and brain biopsy.

Cryptococcus neoformans. A fungal infection, Cryptococcus neoformans, is another common OI among patients with AIDS and causes neurologic disease. Cryptococcal meningitis is characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, malaise, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, and seizures. Diagnosis is confirmed by CSF analysis.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a demyelinating CNS disorder that affects the oligodendroglia. It occurs in about $3 \%$ of AIDS patients. Clinical manifestations often begin with mental confusion and rapidly progress to include blindness, aphasia, paresis (slight paralysis), and death. Treatments have greatly reduced the threat of mortality associated with this disorder.

Other Neurologic Disorders. Other common infections involving the nervous system include Toxoplasma gondii, CMV, and M. tuberculosis. Additional neurologic manifestations include both central and peripheral neuropathies. Vascular myelopathy is a degenerative disorder affecting the lateral and posterior columns of the spinal cord, resulting in progressive spastic paraparesis, ataxia, and incontinence. HIV-related peripheral neuropathy is thought to be a demyelinating disorder; it is associated with pain and numbness in the extremities, weakness, diminished deep tendon reflexes, orthostatic hypotension, and impotence.

\section*{DEPRESSIVE MANIFESTATIONS}

The prevalence of depression among people with HIV infection is unknown. The causes of depression are multifactorial and may include a history of preexisting mental illness, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and psychosocial factors. Depression also occurs in people with HIV infection in response to the physical symptoms, including pain and weight loss, and the lack of someone to talk with about their concerns. People with HIV/AIDS who are depressed may experience irrational guilt and shame, loss of selfesteem, feelings of helplessness and worthlessness, and suicidal ideation.

\section*{INTEGUMENTARY MANIFESTATIONS}

Cutaneous manifestations are associated with HIV infection and the accompanying OIs and malignancies. KS (described above) and OIs such as herpes zoster and herpes simplex are associated with painful vesicles that disrupt skin integrity. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection characterized by deforming plaque formation. Seborrheic dermatitis is associated with an indurated, diffuse, scaly rash involving the scalp and face. Patients with AIDS may also exhibit a generalized folliculitis associated with dry, flaking skin or atopic dermatitis, such as eczema or psoriasis. Up to $60 \%$ of patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) develop a drug-related rash that is pruritic with
pinkish-red macules and papules. Regardless of the origin of these rashes, patients experience discomfort and are at increased risk for additional infection from disrupted skin integrity.

\section*{ENDOCRINE MANIFESTATIONS}

The endocrine manifestations of HIV infection are not completely understood. At autopsy, endocrine glands show infiltration and destruction from OIs or neoplasms. Endocrine function may also be affected by therapeutic agents.

\section*{GYNECOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS}

Persistent, recurrent vaginal candidiasis may be the first sign of HIV infection in women. Past or present genital ulcer disease is a risk factor for the transmission of HIV infection. Women with HIV infection are more susceptible to and have increased rates and recurrence of genital ulcer disease and venereal warts. Ulcerative STDs such as chancroid, syphilis, and herpes are more severe in women with HIV infection. Human papillomavirus causes venereal warts and is a risk factor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, a cellular change that is frequently a precursor to cervical cancer. Women with HIV are 10 times more likely to develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia than are those not infected with HIV. There is a strong association between abnormal Pap smears and HIV seropositivity. HIV-seropositive women with cervical carcinoma present with a more advanced stage of disease and have more persistent and recurrent disease and a shorter interval to recurrence and death than women who do not have HIV infection.

A significant percentage of women who require hospitalization for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) have HIV infection. Women with HIV are at increased risk for PID, and the inflammation associated with PID may potentiate the transmission of HIV infection. Moreover, women with HIV appear to have a higher incidence of menstrual abnormalities, including amenorrhea or bleeding between periods, than women without HIV infection. The failure of health care providers to consider HIV infection in women may lead to a later diagnosis, thereby denying women appropriate treatment.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

More than $10 \%$ of all AIDS cases in the United States have occurred in people aged 50 years or older. HIV infection in middleaged and older populations may be underreported and underdiagnosed because health care professionals erroneously believe they are not at risk for HIV infection. Many older adults are sexually active but do not use condoms, viewing them only as a means of unneeded birth control and not considering themselves at risk for HIV infection. Many older gay men who grew up and lived in an era when disclosure of their sexual orientation was not acceptable have lost long-time partners and may turn to younger males for sexual gratification. Older adults may also be injection drug users or may have received HIV-infected blood through transfusions before 1985. As a result, they may be at risk for HIV infection.

Normal age-related changes include a reduction in immune system function similar to that of HIV infection. Older adults are normally at greater risk for infections, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. Many older adults also experience the loss of loved ones, resulting in depression and bereavement, factors that are also associated with depressed immune function. HIV-related dementia in the older adult may mimic Alzheimer's disease and may be misdiagnosed. There are at least three major differences be-

\section*{Purpose}

Although HIV/AIDS affects individuals across the age spectrum, it is often perceived as a disease that affects younger persons. As a result, there is little information about people living with HIV/AIDS who are older than 50 years of age. The purpose of this study was to explore health-related quality of life (QOL) for people with HIV and to explore differences in QOL in those 50 or older and in those younger than 50 .

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A descriptive survey design was used to identify differences in variables predicting health-related QOL. The conceptual model of QOL of Wilson and Cleary was used as the framework for the study. This model describes measures of health on a continuum of increasing biologic, social, and psychological complexity. The convenience sample consisted of 640 people with HIV disease younger than 50 years of age and 73 who were 50 or older. Data analyzed in this study were collected in a national study of persons living with HIV/AIDS who were recruited from a variety of clinical and community-based sites throughout the United States. Various instruments were used to assess HIV disease severity and comorbidities, symptom status, general health perceptions, and overall QOL. In addition, data on individual and environmental characteristics were collected. Individual characteristics included personality/ motivation and values/preferences; environmental characteristics examined included psychological support, social and economic support, professional support, and nonmedical factors.

\section*{Findings}

Older subjects reported significantly more medical conditions and more physical limitations than the younger subjects. They disclosed their HIV status to fewer people than subjects in the younger age group. No significant differences were found between the two groups on any other variables.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Although few differences were found in the two groups, the ones that were detected may be clinically relevant. Nurses need to be aware of and address the effect of other medical conditions and physical limitations on self-care in older patients with HIV/AIDS. The fact that older persons had disclosed their HIV status to fewer people than the younger age group may affect the availability of others to assist in their care. Nursing assessment of self-care and the availability of support from others is an important aspect of care of the older person with HIV/AIDS.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{TREATMENT OF INFECTIONS}

General Infections. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ; Bactrim, Septra) is an antibacterial agent for treating various organisms causing infection. Persons with HIV infection who have
a T-cell count of less than 200 should receive chemoprophylaxis against PCP with TMP-SMZ. PCP prophylaxis can be safely discontinued in patients responding to HAART with a sustained increase in T lymphocytes. Its use also confers cross-protection against toxoplasmosis and some common respiratory bacterial infections (USPHS/IDSA, 2002). Patients with AIDS who are treated with TMP-SMZ experience a high incidence of adverse effects, such as fever, rashes, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. Reintroduction of TMP-SMZ using a gradual increase in dose (desensitization) may be successful in up to $70 \%$ of patients.

PCP. In the past several years, there have been many advances in the treatment of PCP. TMP-SMZ, the drug of choice for PCP in patients with AIDS and in immunocompromised patients without HIV infection, is available in both intravenous (IV) and oral preparations. Pentamidine (Pentacarinat, Pentam 300, NebuPent), an antiprotozoal medication, is used as an alternative agent for combating PCP. If adverse effects develop or if patients do not improve clinically when treated with TMP-SMZ, the health care provider may recommend pentamidine. Intramuscular administration is avoided because of the potential for painful sterile abscess formation. Also, IV pentamidine may cause severe hypotension if administered too rapidly. Other adverse effects include impaired glucose metabolism (with diabetes mellitus), renal damage, hepatic dysfunction, and neutropenia. Initially, the success of aerosolized pentamidine led to its use as a treatment for mild to moderate PCP. However, it has proved to be less effective and more costly than TMP-SMZ, and early relapses are common. Because of these limitations, the inhalant form of pentamidine is usually reserved for patients with mild to moderate PCP who are intolerant of other treatments. The combination of TMP-SMZ and pentamidine has shown no additional benefit and is avoided because of the cumulative toxic effects that may result.

MAC. Chemoprophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease is indicated for HIV-infected persons with T-cell counts less than 50 (USOHS/IDSA, 2002). Treatment for MAC infections involves use of either clarithromycin (Biaxin) or azithromycin (Zithromax). The combination of azithromycin with rifabutin (Mycobutin) is more effective but the additional cost, increased occurrence of adverse effects, potential for drug interactions, and absence of differences in survival do not warrant the recommendation of both medications (USPHS/IDSA, 2002). Secondary prophylaxis for disseminated MAC may be discontinued in patients with sustained increases (eg, longer than 6 months) in CD4 counts greater than 100 in response to HAART, if they have completed 12 months of MAC therapy and have no signs or symptoms attributable to MAC. Primary prophylaxis for disseminated MAC may be discontinued in patients who have responded to HAART with CD4 counts of 100 or more for at least 3 months and reintroduced if counts decrease to 50 to 100 (USPHS/IDSA, 2002).

Meningitis. Current primary therapy for cryptococcal meningitis is IV amphotericin B with or without oral flucytosine (5-FC, Ancobon) or fluconazole (Diflucan). Serious potential adverse effects of amphotericin B include anaphylaxis, renal and hepatic impairment, electrolyte imbalances, anemia, fever, and severe chills. Intrathecal administration of amphotericin $B$ has been used in place of or in combination with IV administration in patients who have failed to respond to the latter. Until fluconazole,
an antifungal agent, was approved and used for lifelong suppressive therapy, frequent relapses and high mortality rates often necessitated prolonged therapy with amphotericin B. In some instances, the patient continues to receive IV amphotericin in the home setting. Oral fluconazole is used as suppressive therapy when the CSF tests negative for the organism. This medication is less toxic and better tolerated than amphotericin B.

Cytomegalovirus Retinitis. Retinitis caused by CMV is a leading cause of blindness in patients with AIDS. Prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir may be considered for HIV-infected persons with T-cell counts of less than 50. Two antiviral agents, ganciclovir (DHPG, Cytovene, Vitrasert) and foscarnet (Foscavir), offer effective treatment but not a cure for CMV retinitis. Because ganciclovir and foscarnet do not kill the virus but rather control its growth, they must be taken lifelong. Relapse rates of the two agents are similar. Discontinuation of the medication is associated with the relapse of retinitis within 1 month.

A common adverse reaction to ganciclovir is severe neutropenia, which limits the concomitant use of zidovudine (AZT, Compound $S$, Retrovir). For patients who cannot tolerate systemic ganciclovir because of severe neutropenia, infection at the venous access site, or the need to take zidovudine, intravitreal injections of ganciclovir have been effective. Zidovudine can be given with foscarnet (Foscavir). Common adverse reactions to foscarnet are nephrotoxicity, including acute renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which can be life-threatening. Other common adverse effects include seizures, GI disturbances, anemia, phlebitis at the infusion site, and low back pain. Possible bone marrow suppression (producing a decrease in white blood cell and platelet counts), oral candidiasis, and liver and renal impairments require close patient monitoring.

Other Infections. Oral acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir can be used to treat infections caused by herpes simplex or herpes zoster. Esophageal or oral candidiasis is treated topically with clotrimazole (Mycelex) oral troches or nystatin suspension. Chronic refractory infection with candidiasis (thrush) or esophageal involvement is treated with ketoconazole (Nizoral) or fluconazole (Diflucan).

\section*{ANTIDIARRHEAL THERAPY}

Although many forms of diarrhea respond to treatment, it is not unusual for this condition to recur and become a chronic problem for the patient. Therapy with octreotide acetate (Sandostatin), a synthetic analog of somatostatin, has been shown to be effective in managing chronic severe diarrhea. High concentrations of somatostatin receptors have been found in the GI tract and other tissues. Somatostatin inhibits many physiologic functions, including GI motility and intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes.

\section*{CHEMOTHERAPY}

Kaposi's Sarcoma. Management of KS is usually difficult because of the variability of symptoms and the organ systems involved. KS is rarely life-threatening except when there is pulmonary or GI involvement. The treatment goal is reduction of symptoms by decreasing the size of the skin lesions, reducing discomfort associated with edema and ulcerations, and controlling symptoms associated with mucosal or visceral involvement. No one treatment has been shown to increase survival. Localized treatment
includes surgical excision of the lesions or application of liquid nitrogen to local skin lesions and injections of intraoral lesions with dilute vinblastine. Injection of intraoral lesions has been associated with local pain and skin irritation. Radiation therapy is effective as a palliative measure to relieve localized pain due to tumor mass (especially in the legs) or for KS lesions that are in sites such as the oral mucosa, conjunctiva, face, and soles of the feet.

Interferon is known for its antiviral and antitumor effects. Patients with cutaneous KS treated with alpha-interferon have experienced tumor regression and improved immune system function. Positive responses have been observed in $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of patients, with the best responses seen in those with limited disease and no OIs. Alpha-interferon is administered by the IV, intramuscular, or subcutaneous route. Patients may self-administer interferon at home or receive it in an outpatient setting.

Lymphoma. Successful treatment of AIDS-related lymphomas has been limited because of the rapid progression of these malignancies. Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens may produce an initial response, but it is usually shortlived. Because standard regimens for non-AIDS lymphomas have been ineffective, many clinicians suggest that AIDS-related lymphomas be studied as a separate group in clinical trials.

\section*{ANTIDEPRESSANT THERAPY}

Treatment for depression in people with HIV infection involves psychotherapy integrated with pharmacology. If depressive symptoms are severe and of sufficient duration, treatment with antidepressants may be initiated. Antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil), desipramine (Norpramin), and fluoxetine (Prozac) may be used because these medications also alleviate the fatigue and lethargy that are associated with depression. A psychostimulant such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) may be used in low doses in patients with neuropsychiatric impairment. Electroconvulsive therapy may be an option for patients with severe depression that has not responded to pharmacologic interventions.

\section*{NUTRITION THERAPY}

Malnutrition increases the risk for infection and may also increase the incidence of OIs. Nutrition therapy should be integrated into the overall management plan and should be tailored to meet the nutritional needs of the patient, from oral diet to enteral tube feedings through parenteral nutritional support if needed. As with all patients, a healthy diet is essential for the patient with HIV infection. Calorie counts should be obtained for all patients with AIDS with unexplained weight loss to evaluate nutritional status and to initiate appropriate therapy. The goal is to maintain the ideal weight and, when necessary, to increase weight.

Appetite stimulants have been successfully used in patients with AIDS-related anorexia. Megestrol acetate (Megace), a synthetic oral progesterone preparation used to treat breast cancer, promotes significant weight gain and inhibits cytokine IL-1 synthesis. In patients with HIV infection, it increases body weight primarily by increasing body fat stores. Dronabinol (Marinol), synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana, has been used to relieve nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Preliminary results show that after beginning Marinol therapy, almost all patients with HIV infection experience a modest weight gain. The effects on body composition are unknown.

Oral supplements may be used to supplement diets deficient in calories and protein. Ideally, oral supplements should be lactose-
free (many people with HIV infection are intolerant to lactose), high in calories and easily digestible protein, low in fat with the fat easily digestible, palatable, inexpensive, and tolerated without causing diarrhea. Advera is a nutritional supplement that has been developed specifically for people with HIV infection and AIDS. Parenteral nutrition is the final option because of the costs and associated risks, including infections.

\section*{Complementary and Alternative Modalities}

Traditional Western medicine focuses on the treatment of disease. These treatments or interventions are taught in medical schools and are used by physicians in the care of patients. Complementary and alternative therapies are often viewed as unconventional and unorthodox treatments or interventions not traditionally taught in medical schools. Alternative therapy stresses the need to treat the whole person, recognizing the interaction of the body, mind, and spirit. What is considered to be an alternative therapy in one culture may actually be a traditional therapy in another. Persons with HIV infection report substantial use of complementary and alternative medical therapies for symptom management (Swanson et al., 2000). The use of alternative therapy in HIV infection and AIDS has resulted from disillusionment with standard medical treatment, which to date has provided no cure. Used with traditional therapies, alternative therapies may improve the patient's overall well-being.

Alternative therapies can be divided into four categories:
- Spiritual or psychological therapies may include humor, hypnosis, faith healing, guided imagery, and positive affirmations.
- Nutritional therapies may include vegetarian or macrobiotic diets, vitamin C or beta-carotene supplements, and turmeric, which contains curcumin, a food spice supplement. Chinese herbs, such as traditional herbal mixtures, as well as compound Q (a Chinese cucumber extract) and Monmordica charantia (bitter melon), which is given as an enema, are also used.
- Drug and biologic therapies include medicines not approved by the FDA. Examples of these include N-acetylcysteine, pentoxifylline (Trental), and 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene. Also included in this category are oxygen therapy, ozone therapy, and urine therapy.
- Treatment with physical forces and devices may include acupuncture, acupressure, massage therapy, reflexology, therapeutic touch, yoga, and crystals.

Although there is insufficient research on the effects of alternate therapies, there is a growing body of literature reporting benefits in the areas of nutrition, exercise, psychosocial treatment, and Chinese medicine. Clinical trials are in progress to examine the effect of Chinese herbal treatments of HIV-associated symptoms related to inadequate nutrition, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, painful or difficult swallowing, altered taste sensation, and diarrhea. At present there are no definitive study results that indicate that these treatments are effective, but some appear promising.

Many patients who use these alternative therapies do not report their use to their health care providers. To obtain a complete health history, the nurse should ask about the patient's use of alternative therapies. Patients may need to be encouraged to report their use to their primary health care provider. Problems may arise when patients are using alternative therapies while they are participating in clinical drug trials. They may have significant ad-
verse side effects, making it difficult to assess the effects of the medications in the clinical trial. The nurse needs to become familiar with the potential adverse side effects of alternative therapies. The nurse who suspects that the alternative therapy is causing a side effect needs to discuss this with the patient, the alternative therapy provider, and the primary health care provider. It is important for the nurse to view alternative therapies with an open mind and to try to understand the importance of this treatment to the patient. Doing so will improve communication with the patient and reduce conflict, so that all involved in care can meet the patient's needs.

\section*{Supportive Care}

Patients who are weak and debilitated as a result of chronic illness associated with HIV infection typically require many kinds of supportive care. Nutritional support may be as simple as providing assistance in obtaining or preparing meals. For patients with more advanced nutritional impairment that results from decreased intake, wasting syndrome, or GI malabsorption associated with diarrhea, parenteral feedings may be required. Imbalances that result from nausea, vomiting, and profuse diarrhea often necessitate IV fluid and electrolyte replacement.

Skin breakdown associated with KS, perianal skin excoriation, and immobility is managed with thorough and meticulous skin care involving regular turning, cleansing, and applying medicated ointments and dressings.

Pain associated with skin breakdown, abdominal cramping, peripheral neuropathy, or KS is managed by analgesics given at regular intervals around the clock. Relaxation and guided imagery may be helpful in reducing pain and anxiety.

Pulmonary symptoms, such as dyspnea and shortness of breath, may be related to infection, KS, or fatigue. For these patients, oxygen therapy, relaxation training, and energy conservation techniques may be helpful. Patients with severe respiratory dysfunction may require mechanical ventilation. Before placing a patient on mechanical ventilation, the procedure is explained to the patient and the caregiver. The patient may elect not to be placed on mechanical ventilation, and the patient's wishes should be followed. Ideally, the patient has prepared an advanced directive identifying preferences for treatments and end-of-life care, including hospice care. If the patient has not identified preferences in advance, treatment options are described so that the patient can make informed decisions and have those wishes respected.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH AIDS}

The nursing care of patients with AIDS is challenging because of the potential for any organ system to be the target of infections or cancer. In addition, this disease is complicated by many emotional, social, and ethical issues. The plan of care for the patient with AIDS is individualized to meet the needs of the patient (see Plan of Nursing Care). Care includes many of the interventions and concerns cited in the supportive care section.

\section*{Assessment}

Nursing assessment includes identification of potential risk factors, including a history of risky sexual practices and injection drug use. The patient's physical status and psychological status
are assessed. All factors affecting immune system functioning are thoroughly explored.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

Nutritional status is assessed by obtaining a dietary history and identifying factors that may interfere with oral intake, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, oral pain, or difficulty swallowing. In addition, the patient's ability to purchase and prepare food is assessed. Weight, anthropometric measurements, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum protein, albumin, and transferrin levels provide objective measurements of nutritional status.

\section*{SKIN INTEGRITY}

The skin and mucous membranes are inspected daily for evidence of breakdown, ulceration, or infection. The oral cavity is monitored for redness, ulcerations, and the presence of creamywhite patches indicative of candidiasis. Assessment of the perianal area for excoriation and infection in patients with profuse diarrhea is important. Wounds are cultured to identify infectious organisms.

\section*{RESPIRATORY STATUS}

Respiratory status is assessed by monitoring the patient for cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, orthopnea, tachypnea, and chest pain. The presence and quality of breath sounds are investigated. Other measures of pulmonary function include chest x-ray results, arterial blood gas values, pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function test results.

\section*{NEUROLOGIC STATUS}

Neurologic status is determined by assessing level of consciousness; orientation to person, place, and time; and memory lapses. Mental status is assessed as early as possible to provide a baseline (Chart 52-6). The patient is also assessed for sensory deficits (visual changes, headache, or numbness and tingling in the extremities) and motor involvement (altered gait, paresis, or paralysis) and seizure activity.

\section*{FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}

Fluid and electrolyte status is assessed by examining the skin and mucous membranes for turgor and dryness. Increased thirst, decreased urine output, low blood pressure or a decrease in systolic blood pressure between 10 and 15 mm Hg with a concurrent rise in pulse rate when the patient sits up or stands, weak and rapid pulse, and urine specific gravity of 1.025 or more may indicate dehydration. Electrolyte imbalances, such as decreased serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride, typically result from profuse diarrhea. The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of electrolyte deficits, including decreased mental status (see Chart 52-6), muscle twitching, muscle cramps, irregular pulse, nausea and vomiting, and shallow respirations.

\section*{KNOWLEDGE LEVEL}

The patient's level of knowledge about the disease and the modes of disease transmission is evaluated. In addition, the level of knowledge of family and friends is assessed. The patient's psychological reaction to the diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS is important to explore. Reactions vary among patients and may include denial, anger, fear, shame, withdrawal from social interactions, and depression. It is often helpful to gain an understanding of how the patient has dealt with illness and major life stress in the past. The patient's resources for support are also identified.

Nursing Diagnosis: Deficient knowledge related to means of preventing HIV transmission
Goal: Increased knowledge concerning means of preventing disease transmission
1. Instruct patient, family, and friends about routes of transmission of HIV.
2. Instruct patient, family, and friends
about means of preventing transmis of HIV:
a. Avoid sexual contact with multiple partners, and use precautions if sexual partner's HIV status is not certain.
b. Use condoms during sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, oral-genital); avoid mouth contact with the penis, vagina, or rectum; avoid sexual practices that can cause cuts or tears in the lining of the rectum, vagina, or penis.
c. Avoid sex with prostitutes and others at high risk.
d. Do not use injection drugs; if addicted and unable or unwilling to change behavior, use clean needles and syringes.
e. Women who may have been exposed to AIDS through sexual or drug practices should consult with a physician before becoming pregnant; consider
1. Knowledge about disease transmission can help prevent spread of disease; may also alleviate fears.
2. Reduces transmission risk
a. The risk of infection increases with the number of sexual partners, male or female, and sexual contact with those who engage in high-risk behaviors.
b. Risk of HIV transmission is reduced.
c. Many prostitutes are infected with HIV through sexual contact with multiple partners or IV/injection drug use.
d. Clean needles and syringes are the only way to prevent HIV transmission for those who continue to use drugs. Taking precautions is important for those who are antibody positive to prevent transmitting HIV.
e. AIDS can be transmitted from mother to child in utero; use of antiretroviral agents during pregnancy significantly reduces perinatal transmission of HIV. use of antiretroviral agents if pregnant.

Collaborative Problems: Opportunistic infections; impaired breathing; wasting syndrome and fluid and electrolyte imbalances; adverse reaction to medications
Goal: Absence of complications

\section*{Opportunistic Infections}
1. Monitor vital signs.
2. Obtain laboratory specimens and monitor test results.
3. Instruct the patient and caregiver about signs and symptoms of infection and the need to report them early.

\section*{Impaired Breathing}
1. Monitor respiratory rate and pattern.
2. Auscultate the chest for breath sounds and abnormal lung sounds.
3. Monitor pulse rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels.
1. Changes in vital signs such as increases in pulse rate, respirations, blood pressure, and temperature may indicate infection.
2. Smears and cultures can identify causative agents such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, and sensitivity studies can identify antibiotics or other medications effective against the causative agent.
3. Early recognition of symptoms facilitates prompt treatment and avoids extra complications.
1. Rapid shallow breathing, diminished breath sounds, and shortness of breath may indicate respiratory failure resulting in hypoxia.
2. Crackles and wheezes may indicate fluid in the lungs, which disrupts respiratory function and alters the blood's oxygencarrying capacity.
3. Changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels may indicate the development of respiratory or cardiac failure.

\section*{Reactions to Medications}
1. Monitor for medication interactions.
2. Monitor for and promptly report side effects from antiretroviral agents.
3. Instruct the patient and caregiver in the medication regimen.
1. Weight loss, malnutrition, and anemia are common in HIV infection and increase risk for superinfection.
2. Chronic diarrhea, inadequate oral intake, vomiting, and profuse sweating deplete electrolytes. Small intestine inflammation may impair the absorption of fluids and electrolytes.
3. Fluid loss results in decreased circulating volume leading to tachycardia, dry skin and mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, elevated urine specific gravity, and thirst. Early detection allows early treatment.

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Patient Outcomes}
- Maintains stable weight
- Eats a nutritious diet
- Attains and maintains hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin levels within normal limits
- Sustains fluid-electrolytes balance within normal limits
- Exhibits no signs and symptoms of dehydration

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

The list of potential nursing diagnoses is extensive because of the complex nature of this disease. Based on assessment data, however, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include the following:
- Impaired skin integrity related to cutaneous manifestations of HIV infection, excoriation, and diarrhea
- Diarrhea related to enteric pathogens or HIV infection
- Risk for infection related to immunodeficiency
- Activity intolerance related to weakness, fatigue, malnutrition, impaired fluid and electrolyte balance, and hypoxia associated with pulmonary infections
- Disturbed thought processes related to shortened attention span, impaired memory, confusion, and disorientation associated with HIV encephalopathy

- Pain related to impaired perianal skin integrity secondary to diarrhea, KS, and peripheral neuropathy
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to decreased oral intake
- Social isolation related to stigma of the disease, withdrawal of support systems, isolation procedures, and fear of infecting others
- Anticipatory grieving related to changes in lifestyle and roles and unfavorable prognosis
- Deficient knowledge related to HIV infection, means of preventing HIV transmission, and self-care

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, possible complications may include the following:
- Opportunistic infections
- Impaired breathing or respiratory failure
- Wasting syndrome and fluid and electrolyte imbalance
- Adverse reaction to medications

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Goals for the patient may include achievement and maintenance of skin integrity, resumption of usual bowel habits, absence of infection, improved activity tolerance, improved thought processes, improved airway clearance, increased comfort, improved nutritional status, increased socialization, expression of grief, increased knowledge regarding disease prevention and self-care, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING SKIN INTEGRITY}

The skin and oral mucosa are assessed routinely for changes in appearance, location and size of lesions, and evidence of infection and breakdown. The patient is encouraged to maintain a balance between rest and mobility whenever possible. Patients who are immobile are assisted to change position every 2 hours. Devices such as alternating-pressure mattresses and low-air-loss beds are used to prevent skin breakdown. Patients are encouraged to avoid
scratching, to use nonabrasive, nondrying soaps, and to apply nonperfumed skin moisturizers to dry skin surfaces. Regular oral care is also encouraged.

Medicated lotions, ointments, and dressings are applied to affected skin surfaces as prescribed. Adhesive tape is avoided. Skin surfaces are protected from friction and rubbing by keeping bed linens free of wrinkles and avoiding tight or restrictive clothing. Patients with foot lesions are advised to wear cotton socks and shoes that do not cause the feet to perspire. Antipruritic, antibiotic, and analgesic agents are administered as prescribed.

The perianal region is assessed frequently for impairment of skin integrity and infection. The patient is instructed to keep the area as clean as possible. The perianal area is cleaned after each bowel movement with nonabrasive soap and water to prevent further excoriation and breakdown of the skin and infection. If the area is very painful, soft cloths or cotton sponges may prove to be less irritating than washcloths. In addition, sitz baths or gentle irrigation may facilitate cleaning and promote comfort. The area is dried thoroughly after cleaning. Topical lotions or ointments may be prescribed to promote healing. Wounds are cultured if infection is suspected so that the appropriate antimicrobial treatment can be initiated. Debilitated patients may require assistance in maintaining hygienic practices.

\section*{PROMOTING USUAL BOWEL HABITS}

Bowel patterns are assessed for diarrhea. The nurse monitors the frequency and consistency of stools and reports of abdominal pain or cramping associated with bowel movements. Factors that exacerbate frequent diarrhea are also assessed. The quantity and volume of liquid stools are measured to document fluid volume losses. Stool cultures are obtained to identify pathogenic organisms.

The patient is counseled about ways to decrease diarrhea. The physician may recommend restriction of oral intake to rest the bowel during periods of acute inflammation associated with severe enteric infections. As the patient's dietary intake is increased, foods that act as bowel irritants, such as raw fruits and vegetables, popcorn, carbonated beverages, spicy foods, and foods of extreme temperatures, should be avoided. Small, frequent meals help to prevent abdominal distention. The physician may prescribe medications such as anticholinergic antispasmodics or opioids, which decrease diarrhea by decreasing intestinal spasms and motility. Administering antidiarrheal agents on a regular schedule may be more beneficial than administering them on an as-needed basis. Antibiotics and antifungal agents may also be prescribed to combat pathogens identified by stool cultures. The nurse should also assess the self-care strategies being used by the patient to control diarrhea (Henry et al., 1999).

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

The patient and caregivers are instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection: fever; chills; night sweats; cough with or without sputum production; shortness of breath; difficulty breathing; oral pain or difficulty swallowing; creamy-white patches in the oral cavity; unexplained weight loss; swollen lymph nodes; nausea; vomiting; persistent diarrhea; frequency, urgency, or pain on urination; headache; visual changes or memory lapses; redness, swelling, or drainage from skin wounds; and vesicular lesions on the face, lips, or perianal area. The nurse also monitors laboratory values that indicate infection, such as the white blood cell count and differential. The physician may decide to culture specimens of wound drainage, skin lesions, urine, stool, sputum, mouth, and blood to identify pathogenic organisms and the most appro-
priate antimicrobial therapy. The patient is instructed to avoid others with active infections such as upper respiratory infections.

\section*{IMPROVING ACTIVITY TOLERANCE}

Activity tolerance is assessed by monitoring the patient's ability to ambulate and perform activities of daily living. Patients may be unable to maintain their usual levels of activity because of weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and neurologic involvement. Assistance in planning daily routines that maintain a balance between activity and rest may be necessary. In addition, patients benefit from instructions about energy conservation techniques, such as sitting while washing or while preparing meals. Personal items that are frequently used should be kept within the patient's reach. Measures such as relaxation and guided imagery may be beneficial because they decrease anxiety, which contributes to weakness and fatigue.

Collaboration with other members of the health care team may uncover other factors associated with increasing fatigue and strategies to address them. For example, if fatigue is related to anemia, administering epoetin alfa (Epogen) as prescribed may relieve fatigue and increase activity tolerance.

\section*{MAINTAINING THOUGHT PROCESSES}

The patient is assessed for alterations in mental status that may be related to neurologic involvement, metabolic abnormalities, infection, side effects of treatment, and coping mechanisms. Manifestations of neurologic impairment may be difficult to distinguish from psychological reactions to HIV infection, such as anger and depression.

Family members are instructed to speak to the patient in simple, clear language and give the patient sufficient time to respond to questions. Family members are instructed to orient the patient to the daily routine by talking about what is taking place during daily activities. They are encouraged to provide the patient with a regular daily schedule for medication administration, grooming, meal times, bedtimes, and awakening times. Posting the schedule in a prominent area (eg, on the refrigerator), providing nightlights for the bedroom and bathroom, and planning safe leisure activities allow the patient to maintain a regular routine in a safe manner. Activities that the patient previously enjoyed are encouraged. These should be easy to accomplish and fairly short in duration. The nurse encourages the family to remain calm and not to argue with the patient while protecting the patient from injury. Around-the-clock supervision may be necessary, and strategies can be implemented to prevent the patient from engaging in potentially dangerous activities, such as driving, using the stove, or mowing the lawn. Strategies for improving or maintaining functional abilities and for providing a safe environment are used for patients with HIV encephalopathy (Chart 52-7).

\section*{IMPROVING AIRWAY CLEARANCE}

Respiratory status, including rate, rhythm, use of accessory muscles, and breath sounds; mental status; and skin color must be assessed at least daily. Any cough and the quantity and characteristics of sputum are documented. Sputum specimens are analyzed for infectious organisms. Pulmonary therapy (coughing, deep breathing, postural drainage, percussion, and vibration) is provided as often as every 2 hours to prevent stasis of secretions and to promote airway clearance. Because of weakness and fatigue, many patients require assistance in attaining a position (such as a high Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position) that facilitates breathing and airway clearance. Adequate rest is essential to maximize energy expenditure and prevent excessive fatigue. The fluid

Assessing Eatigue in Persons Living With HIV/AIDS

Bormann, J., Shively, M., Smith, T. L., \& Gifford, A. (2001). Measurement of fatigue in HIV-positive adults: Reliability and validity of the Global Fatigue Index. Journal of Association of Nurses in AIDS Care, 12(3), 75-83.

\section*{Purpose}

Fatigue is often cited by people living with HIV/AIDS as one of the most bothersome and frequently reported symptoms. Fatigue is a complex construct that consists of cognitive, emotional, and physical components, so its assessment can be challenging. The purpose of this study was to refine an assessment tool that could be used by nurses in clinical practice and research.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The Global Fatigue Index (GFI) was taken from the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue instrument, which was developed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The GFI consists of 15 items and assesses 5 dimensions of fatigue: degree; severity; distress; impact on activities of daily living; and timing, which addresses the frequency of fatigue and changes in degree of fatigue over the past week. A Likert scale is used for each item, and a single score of fatigue is calculated. Data were collected from 209 symptomatic HIV-positive persons living in San Diego, California, who were participating in an 8-week longitudinal descriptive study.

\section*{Findings}

The nonrandom sample included 183 men and 26 women. Their mean age was $40.8 \pm 8.3$; their ages ranged from 26 to 70 years. Fifty percent of the sample reported a diagnosis of AIDS; $71.8 \%$ of them reported taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Almost $88 \%$ of the sample reported fatigue. Internal consistency reliability of the GFI was assessed at 0.96 . Test-retest reliability of the assessment tool was demonstrated by lack of significant changes in scores over 8 weeks. Construct validity was analyzed through principal components factor analysis and demonstrated two factors. Construct validity was determined by examining the correlation of GFI scores and more established, widely used scales that assess health distress, depression, stress levels, and measures of physical and mental health. Significant correlations with these measures indicated construct validity of the GFI.

There were no significant bivariate correlations between GFI scores and patient characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment, and types of antiretroviral therapy). There was no significant relationship between fatigue as measured by the GFI and viral load as measured by HIV-RNA levels or CD4T4 cell.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The GFI is a practical, patient-centered instrument with evidence of reliability and validity. It takes only about 5 minutes to complete and can be used by nurses to assess baseline fatigue, to monitor the course of fatigue over time and in relation to changes in patients' HIV disease status and treatment plans, and to identify the need for more in-depth assessments of psychosocial, physical, and sleep status. The GFI can also be used by patients to monitor their fatigue scores to assess the effectiveness of different strategies.
volume status is evaluated so that adequate hydration can be maintained. Unless contraindicated by renal or cardiac disease, an intake of 3 L of fluid daily is encouraged. Humidified oxygen may be prescribed, and nasopharyngeal or tracheal suctioning, intubation, and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to maintain adequate ventilation.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

The patient is assessed for the quality and severity of pain associated with impaired perianal skin integrity, the lesions of KS, and peripheral neuropathy. In addition, the effects of pain on elimination, nutrition, sleep, affect, and communication are explored, along with exacerbating and relieving factors. Cleaning the perianal area as previously described can promote comfort. Topical anesthetics or ointments may be prescribed. Use of soft cushions or foam pads may increase comfort while sitting. The patient is instructed to avoid foods that act as bowel irritants. Antispasmodics and antidiarrheal medications may be prescribed to reduce the discomfort and frequency of bowel movements. If necessary, systemic analgesic agents may also be prescribed.

Pain from KS is frequently described as a sharp, throbbing pressure and heaviness if lymphedema is present. Pain management may include using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids plus nonpharmacologic approaches such as relaxation techniques. When NSAIDs are used in patients receiving zidovudine, hepatic and hematologic status must be monitored.

The patient with pain related to peripheral neuropathy frequently describes it as burning, numbness, and "pins and needles." Pain management measures may include opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and elastic compression stockings to equalize pressure. Tricyclic antidepressants have been found helpful in controlling the symptoms of neuropathic pain. They also potentiate the actions of opioids and can be used to relieve pain without increasing the dose of the opioid.

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

Nutritional status is assessed by monitoring weight; dietary intake; anthropometric measurements; and serum albumin, BUN, protein, and transferrin levels. The patient is also assessed for fac-
tors that interfere with oral intake, such as anorexia, oral and esophageal candidal infection, nausea, pain, weakness, fatigue, and lactose intolerance. Based on the results of assessment, the nurse can implement specific measures to facilitate oral intake. The dietitian is consulted to determine the patient's nutritional requirements.

Control of nausea and vomiting with antiemetic medications administered on a regular basis may increase the patient's dietary intake. Inadequate food intake resulting from pain caused by mouth sores or a sore throat may be managed by administering prescribed opioids and viscous lidocaine (the patient is instructed to rinse the mouth and swallow). Additionally, the patient is encouraged to eat foods that are easy to swallow and to avoid rough, spicy, or sticky food items and foods that are excessively hot or cold. Oral hygiene before and after meals is encouraged.

When fatigue and weakness interfere with intake, the nurse encourages the patient to rest before meals. If the patient is hospitalized, meals should be scheduled so that they do not occur immediately after painful or unpleasant procedures. The patient with diarrhea and abdominal cramping is encouraged to avoid foods that stimulate intestinal motility and abdominal distention (eg, fiber-rich food or lactose if the patient is intolerant to lactose). The patient is instructed about ways to enhance the nutritional value of meals. Adding eggs, butter, margarine, and fortified milk (powdered skim milk is added to milk to increase the caloric content) to gravies, soups, or milkshakes can provide additional calories and protein. Commercial supplements such as puddings, powders, milkshakes, and Advera (a nutritional product specifically designed for people with HIV infection or AIDS) may also be useful. Patients who cannot maintain their nutritional status through oral intake may require enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition.

\section*{DECREASING THE SENSE OF ISOLATION}

Individuals with AIDS are at risk for double stigmatization. They have what society refers to as a "dread disease," and they may have a lifestyle that differs from what is considered acceptable by many people. Many people with AIDS are young adults at a developmental stage usually associated with establishing intimate relationships and personal and career goals and having and raising children. Their focus changes as they are faced with a disease that threatens their life expectancy with no cure. In addition, they may be forced to reveal hidden lifestyles or behaviors to family, friends, coworkers, and health care providers. As a result, people with HIV infection may be overwhelmed with emotions such as anxiety, guilt, shame, and fear. They also may be faced with multiple losses, such as rejection by family and friends and loss of sexual partners, family, and friends; financial security; normal roles and functions; self-esteem; privacy; ability to control bodily functions; ability to interact meaningfully with the environment; and sexual functioning. Some patients may harbor feelings of guilt because of their lifestyle or because they may have infected others in current or previous relationships. Other patients may feel anger toward sexual partners who transmitted the virus. Infection control measures used in the hospital or at home may further contribute to the patient's emotional isolation. Any or all of these stressors may cause the patient with AIDS to withdraw both physically and emotionally from social contact.

Nurses are in a key position to provide an atmosphere of acceptance and understanding of people with AIDS and their families and partners. The patient's usual level of social interaction is assessed as early as possible to provide a baseline for monitoring changes in behavior indicative of social isolation (eg, decreased interaction with staff or family, hostility, noncompliance). Patients are encouraged to express feelings of isolation and loneliness, with the assurance that these feelings are not unique or abnormal.

Providing information about how to protect themselves and others may help patients avoid social isolation. Patients, family, and friends must be assured that AIDS is not spread through casual contact. Educating ancillary personnel, nurses, and physicians will help to reduce factors that might contribute to patients' feelings of isolation. Patient care conferences that address the psychosocial issues associated with AIDS may help sensitize the health care team to patients' needs.

\section*{COPING WITH GRIEF}

The nurse can help patients verbalize feelings and explore and identify resources for support and mechanisms for coping, especially when the patient is grieving about anticipated losses. Patients are encouraged to maintain contact with family, friends, and coworkers and to use local or national AIDS support groups and hotlines. If possible, losses are identified and addressed. The patient is encouraged to continue usual activities whenever possible. Consultations with mental health counselors are useful for many patients.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Opportunistic Infections}

Patients who are immunosuppressed are at risk for OIs. Therefore, anti-infective agents may be prescribed and laboratory tests obtained to monitor their effect. Signs and symptoms of OIs, including fever, malaise, difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, and any occurrences of swelling or discharge, should be reported.

\section*{Respiratory Failure}

Impaired breathing is a major complication that increases the patient's discomfort and anxiety and may lead to respiratory and cardiac failure. The respiratory rate and pattern are monitored and the lungs are auscultated for abnormal breath sounds. The patient is instructed to report shortness of breath and increasing difficulty in carrying out usual activities. Pulse rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are monitored. Suctioning and oxygen therapy may be prescribed to ensure an adequate airway and to prevent hypoxia. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary for a patient who cannot maintain adequate ventilation as a result of pulmonary infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, or respiratory muscle weakness. Arterial blood gas values are used to guide ventilator settings. If the patient is intubated, a method must be established to allow communication with the nurse and others. Attention must be given to assisting the patient on mechanical ventilation to cope with the stress associated with intubation and ventilator assistance. The possible need for mechanical ventilation in the future should be discussed early in the course of the disease, when the patient is able to make his or her desires about treatment known. The use of mechanical ventilation should be consistent with the patient's decisions about end-of-life treatment. (Further discussion of end-of-life care can be found in Chap. 17.)

\section*{Cachexia and Wasting}

Wasting syndrome and fluid and electrolyte disturbances, including dehydration, are common complications of HIV infection and AIDS. The patient's nutritional and electrolyte status is evaluated by monitoring weight gains or losses, skin turgor, ferritin levels, hemoglobin and hematocrit values, and electrolyte levels. Fluid and electrolyte status is monitored on an ongoing basis; fluid intake and output and urine specific gravity may be monitored daily if the patient is hospitalized with complications. The skin is assessed for dryness and adequate turgor. Vital signs are monitored for decreased systolic blood pressure or increased pulse rate upon sitting or standing. Signs and symptoms of electrolyte disturbances, such as muscle cramping, weakness, irregular pulse, decreased mental status, nausea, and vomiting, are documented and reported to the physician. Serum electrolyte values are monitored and abnormalities reported.

The nurse helps the patient select foods that will replenish electrolytes, such as oranges and bananas (potassium) and cheese and soups (sodium). A fluid intake of 3 L or more, unless contraindicated, is encouraged to replace fluid lost with diarrhea, and measures to control diarrhea are initiated. If fluid and electrolyte imbalances persist, the nurse may administer IV fluids and electrolytes as prescribed. Effects of parenteral therapy are monitored.

\section*{Side Effects of Medications}

Adverse reactions are of concern in patients who receive many medications to treat HIV infection or its complications. Many medications can cause severe toxic effects. Information about the purpose of the medications, correct administration, side effects, and strategies to manage or prevent side effects is provided. Patients and their caregivers need to know which signs and symptoms of side effects should be reported immediately to their primary health care provider (see Table 52-3).

In addition to medications used to treat HIV infection, other medications that may be required include opioids, tricyclics, and NSAIDs for pain relief; medications for treatment of OIs; antihistamines (diphenhydramine) for relief of pruritus (itching); acetaminophen or aspirin for management of fever; and antiemetic agents for control of nausea and vomiting. Concurrent use of
many of these medications may cause many drug interactions, including hepatic and hematologic abnormalities. Therefore, careful laboratory monitoring for these abnormalities is warranted.

During each contact with the patient, it is important for the nurse to ask not only about side effects but also how well the patient is managing the medication regimen. The nurse may be able to assist the patient in organizing and planning the medication schedule to promote adherence to the medication regimen.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients, families, and friends are instructed about the routes of transmission of HIV. The nurse discusses precautions to prevent transmitting HIV, including using condoms during vaginal or anal intercourse (Chart 52-8); using dental dams or avoiding oral contact with the penis, vagina, or rectum; avoiding sexual practices that might cut or tear the lining of the rectum, vagina, or penis; and avoiding sexual contact with multiple partners, individuals known to be HIV infected, people who use injection drugs, and sexual partners of people who inject drugs.

Patients and their families or caregivers must receive instructions about how to prevent disease transmission, including handwashing techniques, and in methods for safely handling items

4. Have sex.
soiled with body fluids. Caregivers in the home are taught how to administer medications, including IV preparations.

The medication regimens used for patients with HIV infection and AIDS are often complex and expensive. Patients receiving combination therapies for treatment of HIV infection and its complications require careful teaching about the importance of taking medications as prescribed and explanations and assistance in fitting the medication regimen into their lives (Chart 52-9).

Guidelines about infection and infection control, follow-up care, diet, rest, and activity are also necessary. Patient teaching also includes strategies to avoid infection. The importance of personal hygiene is emphasized. Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be cleaned regularly with disinfectants to prevent fungal and bacterial growth. Patients with pets are instructed to have another person clean areas soiled by animals, such as bird cages and litter boxes. If this is not possible, the patient should use gloves to clean up after pets. Patients are advised to avoid exposure to others who are sick or who have been recently vaccinated. Patients with AIDS and their sexual partners are strongly urged to avoid exposure to body fluids during sexual activities and to use condoms for any form of sexual intercourse. Injection drug use is strongly discouraged because of the risk to the patient of other infections and transmission of HIV infection to others. Patients infected with HIV are urged to avoid exposure to bodily fluids (through sexual contact or injection drug use) to prevent exposure to other HIV strains. The importance of avoiding smoking and maintaining a balance between diet, rest, and exercise is also emphasized.

If the patient requires enteral or parenteral nutrition, instruction is provided to patients and families about how to administer nutritional therapies at home. Home care nurses provide ongoing teaching and support for the patient and family.

Patients who are HIV positive or who inject drugs are instructed not to donate blood. Injection drug users who are unwilling to stop using drugs are advised to avoid sharing drug equipment with others.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Many people with AIDS remain in their community and continue their usual daily activities, whereas others can no longer work or maintain their independence. Families or caregivers may need assistance in providing supportive care. There are many community-based organizations that provide a variety of services for people living with HIV infection and AIDS; nurses can help identify these services.

Community health nurses, home care nurses, and hospice nurses are in an excellent position to provide the support and guidance so often needed in the home setting. As hospital costs continue to rise and insurance coverage continues to decline, the complexity of home care increases. Home care nurses are key in the administration of parenteral antibiotics, chemotherapy, and nutrition in the home.

During home visits, the nurse assesses the patient's physical and emotional status and home environment. The patient's adherence to the therapeutic regimen is assessed, and strategies are suggested to assist with adherence. The patient is assessed for progression of disease and for adverse side effects of medications. Previous teaching is reinforced, and the importance of keeping follow-up appointments is stressed.

Complex wound care or respiratory care may be required in the home. Patients and families are often unable to meet these skilled care needs without assistance. Nurses may refer patients to community programs that offer a range of services for patients, friends, and families, including help with housekeeping, hygiene, and meals; transportation and shopping; individual and group
5. Hold the condom so it cannot come off the penis.
6. Pull out.
7. Use a new condom if you want to have sex again or if you want to have sex in a different place (eg, in the anus and then in the vagina).
Keep condoms cool and dry. Never use skin lotions, baby oil, petroleum jelly, or cold cream with condoms. The oil in these products will cause the condom to break. You may use products made with water (like K-Y jelly or glycerin).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-080.jpg?height=821&width=1783&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=109)
therapy; support for caregivers; telephone networks for the homebound; and legal and financial assistance. These services are typically provided by both professional and nonprofessional volunteers. A social worker may be consulted to identify sources of financial support, if needed.

Home care and hospice nurses are increasingly called on to provide physical and emotional support to patients and families as patients with AIDS enter the terminal stages of disease. This support takes on special meaning when people with AIDS lose friends and when family members fear the disease or feel anger concerning the patient's lifestyle. The nurse encourages the patient and family to discuss end-of-life decisions and to ensure that care is consistent with those decisions, all comfort measures are employed, and the patient is treated with dignity at all times.

\section*{Evaluation}

8. Maintains adequate nutritional status
9. Experiences decreased sense of social isolation
10. Progresses through grieving process
11. Reports increased understanding of AIDS and participates in self-care activities as possible
12. Remains free of complications

\section*{Emotional and Ethical Concerns}

Nurses in all settings will be called on to provide care for patients with HIV infection. In doing so, they encounter not only the physical challenges of this epidemic but also emotional and ethi-
cal concerns. The concerns raised by health care professionals involve issues such as fear of infection, responsibility for giving care, values clarification, confidentiality, developmental stages of patients and caregivers, and poor prognostic outcomes.

Many patients with HIV infection have engaged in "stigmatized" behaviors. Because these behaviors challenge some traditional religious and moral values, nurses may feel reluctant to care for these patients. In addition, health care providers may still have fear and anxiety about disease transmission despite education concerning infection control and the low incidence of transmission to health care providers (Chart 52-10). Nurses are encouraged to examine their personal beliefs and use the process of values clarification to approach controversial issues. The American Nurses Association's Code for Nurses can also be used to help resolve ethical dilemmas that might affect the quality of care given to HIV-infected patients.

Nurses are responsible for protecting the patient's right to privacy by safeguarding confidential information. Inadvertent disclosure of confidential patient information may result in personal, financial, and emotional hardships for HIV-infected individuals. The controversy surrounding confidentiality concerns the circumstances in which information can be disclosed to others. Health care team members need accurate patient information to conduct assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation of patient care. Failure to disclose HIV status could compromise the quality of patient care. Sexual partners of HIV-infected patients should know about the potential for infection and the need to engage in safer sex practices, as well as the possible need for testing and medical care. Nurses are advised to discuss concerns about confidentiality with nurse administrators and professional nursing organizations such as the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care, and to consult legal experts in their state to identify the most appropriate course of action.

AIDS has had a high mortality rate, but advances in antiretroviral and multidrug therapy have demonstrated promise in slowing or controlling disease progression. It is not known whether current treatment regimens will remain effective, because viral drug resistance has developed with most previous medications.

\section*{Chart 52-10 $\cdot$ Ethics and Related Issues Revealing One's HIV Status}

Should all people who are infected with HIV be required to reveal this status to all their sexual and/or needlesharing contacts?

\section*{Situation}

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes HIV infection, which progresses to AIDS, a disease that is currently incurable and ultimately fatal. Many HIV-positive people are aware that they carry the virus but refuse to share this information with others, especially their sexual partners or injecting drug contacts. Because sexual contacts and needle-sharing partners are at risk for developing the disease, would a policy that requires notification of contacts infringe on the liberty and privacy of the known HIV-infected person? Dilemma
The person's right to privacy conflicts with notifying all people who are contacts either through sexual or needle-sharing behavior (autonomy versus justice). The person's right to privacy conflicts with society's need to contain the deadly virus and stem a deadly epidemic (autonomy versus justice).

\section*{Discussion}

What arguments would you offer in favor of notifying all the person's contacts?

What arguments would you offer against notifying all or some of the person's contacts?

Each state has various laws that pertain to whether contacts can be notified and who is responsible for notifying contacts. Is there a law for contact notification in the state in which you live? If there is such a law in your state, who is responsible for contact notification?

What would you do if the person responsible for contact notification refuses to do so based on his own beliefs for confidentiality of HIV infection status?

Most nurses in the United States have never faced an epidemic in which young and middle-aged adults experience serious illness and may die during the usual course of the disease process. Nurses may struggle with the value and meaning of their professional roles as they witness repeated instances of deterioration. Exposure to so many deaths in a population that is at the same developmental stage as many nurses can create feelings of stress. Contributing to this stress are personal fears of contagion or disapproval of the patient's lifestyle and behaviors. Unlike cancer or other diseases, AIDS is associated with controversies challenging our legal and political systems as well as religious and personal beliefs. Nurses who feel stressed and overburdened may experience physical and mental distress in the form of fatigue, headache, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, helplessness, irritability, apathy, negativity, and anger.

Many strategies have been used by nurses to cope with the stress associated with caring for AIDS patients. Education and provision of up-to-date information help to alleviate apprehension and prepare nurses to deliver safe, high-quality patient care. Interdisciplinary meetings allow participants to support one another and provide comprehensive patient care. Staff support groups give nurses an opportunity to solve problems and explore values and feelings about caring for AIDS patients and their families; they also provide a forum for grieving. Other sources of support include nursing administrators, peers, and spiritual advisors.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 27 -year-old man who was tested for HIV infection when he volunteered as a blood donor has been identified as HIV positive. He does not believe the results, says he cannot be HIV positive, and becomes angry when you attempt to explain the test results to him. How should you respond to the patient, and what further testing or treatment would you anticipate? How would you modify your approach if the patient seemed suicidal?
2. You are making a home visit to a patient with HIV encephalopathy. Describe the aspects of the home environment you would assess to ensure safety and adequate care. How would you modify your assessment if the patient lived alone in a third-floor apartment without an elevator? If the patient lived in a rural setting?
3. You are the nurse manager of a surgical department. A new graduate working in the operating room was inadvertently stuck with a needle used to administer medication to a patient who is HIV positive. She is frightened about contracting HIV infection. What actions should you take as nurse manager? What do you tell the new graduate about possible risks and consequences related to her needlestick? What testing, treatment, and counseling are warranted?
4. The partner of a patient hospitalized with AIDS asks you directly, "Does my partner have AIDS?" He demands a response, saying he has a legal right to know. How would you respond to him? What ethical and legal issues are involved here?
5. You are caring for a 26-year-old woman who is HIV positive and has two young children who are HIV negative. She tells you that she has recently remarried and that she and her new husband are considering having a child. She asks you what the likelihood is that her third child will also be HIV negative. What information and knowledge do you need to discuss pregnancy and childbearing with her? What counseling and teaching are warranted for the patient and her spouse?
6. One of your patients is hospitalized in the advanced stages of HIV disease with major complications and hepatitis C. The patient has brief episodes of disorientation. He has refused to prepare or even discuss an advance directive, although his family would like him to do so. What is the impact of lack of an advance directive on his care if he lapses into coma? If he cannot participate in making decisions about his health care?

\title{
Assessment and Management of Patients With Allergic Disorders
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Explain the physiologic events involved with allergic reactions.
2. Describe the types of hypersensitivity.
3. Describe the management of patients with allergic disorders.
4. Describe measures to prevent and manage anaphylaxis.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with allergic rhinitis.
6. Discuss the different allergic disorders according to type.

$T_{h}$he human body is menaced by a host of potential invadersallergens as well as microbial organisms-that constantly threaten its surface defenses. After penetrating those defenses, these allergens and organisms compete with the body for its nutrients and, if allowed to flourish unimpeded, disrupt its enzyme systems and destroy its vital tissues. To protect against these agents, the body is equipped with an elaborate defense system.

The epithelial cells coating the skin and making up the lining of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts provide the first line of defense. The structure and continuity of these surfaces and the resistance to penetration are initial deterrents to invaders.

One of the most effective defense mechanisms is the body's capacity to equip itself rapidly with weapons (antibodies) individually designed to meet each new invader, namely specific protein antigens. Antibodies react with antigens in a variety of ways: (1) by coating the antigens' surfaces if they are particular substances, (2) by neutralizing the antigens if they are toxic, and (3) by precipitating the antigens out of solution if they are dissolved.

The antibodies prepare the antigens so that the phagocytic cells of the blood and the tissues can dispose of them. In some cases, however, the body produces inappropriate or exaggerated responses to specific antigens, and the result is an allergic or hypersensitivity disorder.

\section*{Allergic Reaction: Physiologic Overview}

An allergic reaction is a manifestation of tissue injury resulting from interaction between an antigen and an antibody. Allergy is an inappropriate and often harmful response of the immune system to normally harmless substances. In this case, the substance is termed an allergen. Atopy refers to allergic reactions characterized by the action of IgE antibodies and a genetic predisposition to allergic reactions.

When the body is invaded by an antigen, usually a protein that the body's defenses recognize as foreign, a series of events occurs in an attempt to render the invader harmless, destroy it, and remove it from the body. When lymphocytes respond to the antigen, antibodies (protein substances that protect against antigens) are produced. Common allergic reactions occur when the immune system of a susceptible person responds aggressively to a
substance that is normally harmless (eg, dust, weeds, pollen, dander). Chemical mediators released in allergic reactions may produce symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.

The many cells and organs of the immune system secrete various substances important in the immune response. These parts of the immune system must work together to ensure adequate defense against invaders (ie, virus, bacteria, other foreign substances) without destroying the body's own tissues by an overly aggressive reaction.

\section*{FUNCTION AND PRODUCTION OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS}

Antibodies formed by lymphocytes and plasma cells in response to an immunogenic stimulus constitute a group of serum proteins called immunoglobulins. Grouped into five classes (IgE, IgD, IgG, IgM, and IgA), antibodies can be found in the lymph nodes, tonsils, appendix, and Peyer's patches of the intestinal tract or circulating in the blood and lymph. Each antibody molecule is composed of two identical heavy $(\mathrm{H})$ chains and two identical light (L) chains. Each chain contains one variable region and one or more constant regions. The constant regions determine the class (IgE, IgD, etc.) of each antibody and allow each class of antibody to interact with specific effector cells and molecules. The variable regions contain antigen-binding sites (Porth, 2002). Antibodies are capable of binding with a wide variety of antigens, which include macromolecules and small chemicals (Abbas \& Lichtman, 2001). Antibodies of the IgM, IgG, and IgA classes have definite and well-established protective functions. These include neutralization of toxins and viruses and precipitation, agglutination, and lysis of bacteria and other foreign cellular material. (See Chap. 50 for further discussion of these functions.)

Immunoglobulins of the IgE class are involved in allergic disorders and some parasitic infections, evidenced by elevation of IgE levels. IgE-producing cells are located in the respiratory and intestinal mucosa. Two or more IgE molecules bind together to an allergen and trigger mast cells or basophils to release chemical mediators, such as histamine, serotonin, kinins, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and the neutrophil factor, which produces allergic skin reactions, asthma, and hay fever.
allergen: substance that causes manifestations of allergy
allergy: inappropriate and often harmful immune system response to substances that are normally harmless
anaphylaxis: clinical response to an immediate immunologic reaction between a specific antigen and antibody
angioneurotic edema: condition characterized by urticaria and diffuse swelling of the deeper layers of the skin
antibody: protein substance developed by the body in response to and interacting with a specific antigen
antigen: substance that induces the production of antibodies
antihistamine: medication that opposes the action of histamine
atopic dermatitis: type I hypersensitivity involving inflammation of the skin evi-
denced by itching, redness, and a variety of skin lesions
atopy: term often used to describe IgEmediated diseases; genetically determined allergic disorders
B lymphocyte: cells that are important in producing circulating antibodies
bradykinin: polypeptide that stimulates nerve fibers and causes pain
eosinophil: granular leukocyte
epitope: an immunologically active site on an antigen; a single antigen can have several different epitopes that elicit responses from different antibodies
erythema: diffuse redness of the skin
hapten: incomplete antigen
histamine: substance in the body that causes increased gastric secretion, dilation of capillaries, and constriction of the bronchial smooth muscle
hypersensitivity: abnormal heightened reaction to a stimulus of any kind
immunoglobulins: a family of closely related proteins capable of acting as antibodies
leukotrienes: a group of chemical mediators that initiate the inflammatory response
lymphokines: substances released by sensitized lymphocytes when they contact specific antigens
mast cell: connective tissue cells that contain heparin and histamine in their granules prostaglandins: unsaturated fatty acids that have a wide assortment of biologic activity rhinitis: inflammation of the nasal mucosa serotonin: chemical mediator that acts as a potent vasoconstrictor and bronchoconstrictor
T lymphocyte: cells that can cause graft rejection, kill foreign cells, or suppress production of antibodies
urticaria: hives

Antibodies combine with antigens in a special way, likened to keys fitting into a lock. Antigens (the keys) only fit certain antibodies (the locks). Hence, the term "specificity" refers to the specific reaction of an antibody to an antigen. There are many variations and complexities in these patterns. The strength with which one antigen-binding surface of an antibody binds to one epitope, an immunologically active site on an antigen, is known as the affinity of the interaction (Abbas \& Lichtman, 2001).

Antibody molecules are bivalent; that is, they have two combining sites. Therefore, the antibody easily becomes a cross-link between two antigen groups, causing them to clump together (agglutination). By this action, foreign invaders are cleared from the bloodstream. Agglutination is the means for determining blood group in laboratory tests.

\section*{Role of B Cells}

The B cell, or B lymphocyte, is programmed to produce one specific antibody. On encountering a specific antigen, a $B$ cell stimulates production of plasma cells, the site of antibody production. The result is the outpouring of antibodies for the purpose of destroying and removing the antigen.

\section*{Role of T Cells}

The T cell, or T lymphocyte, assists the B cells in producing antibodies. T cells secrete substances known as lymphokines that encourage cell growth, promote cell activation, direct the flow of cell activity, destroy target cells, and stimulate the macrophages. Macrophages present the antigen to the T cells and initiate the immune response. They also digest antigens and assist in removing cells and other debris. The antigen-binding site of a T cell has a structure much like that of an immunoglobulin. It recognizes epitopes through complementary interactions. Unlike a specific antibody, a T cell does not bind free antigens (Parslow, Stites, Terr \& Imboden, 2001).

\section*{FUNCTION OF ANTIGENS}

Antigens are divided into two groups: complete protein antigens and low-molecular-weight substances. Complete protein antigens, such as animal dander, pollen, and horse serum, stimulate a complete humoral response. (See Chap. 50 for a discussion of humoral
immunity.) Low-molecular-weight substances, such as medications, function as haptens (incomplete antigens), binding to tissue or serum proteins to produce a carrier complex that initiates an antibody response. The term "hapten" is derived from the Greek word haptien (to fasten). The proteins or other immunogens that haptens are fastened to are known as carriers (Parslow et al., 2001).

In an allergic reaction, the production of antigen-specific IgE antibodies requires active communication between macrophages, T cells, and B cells. When the allergen is absorbed through the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or skin, allergen sensitization occurs. The macrophage processes the antigen and presents it to the appropriate T cell. B cells that are influenced by the T cell mature into an allergen-specific IgE immunoglobulinsecreting plasma cell that synthesizes and secretes antigen-specific IgE antibody.

\section*{FUNCTION OF CHEMICAL MEDIATORS}

Mast cells, which have a major role in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity, are located in the skin and mucous membranes. When mast cells are stimulated by antigens, powerful chemical mediators are released that cause a sequence of physiologic events resulting in symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity (Fig. 53-1). There are two types of chemical mediators: primary, which are preformed and found in mast cells or basophils, and secondary, which are inactive precursors formed or released in response to primary mediators. The most prevalent known primary and secondary mediators are described next. Table 53-1 summarizes the actions of primary and secondary chemical mediators.

\section*{Primary Mediators}

IgE-mediated inflammation occurs when an antigen binds to the IgE antibodies that occupy certain receptors on mast cells. Within minutes, this binding causes the mast cell to degranulate, releasing certain preformed mediators. A two-phase response results. There is an initial immediate effect on blood vessels, smooth muscle, and glandular secretion. This is followed a few hours later by cellular infiltration of the involved site. This type of inflammatory response is commonly known as an immediate hypersensitivity response (Parslow et al., 2001).

\section*{MEDIATORS}

\section*{ACTION}

\section*{Primary Mediators}
(Preformed and found in mast cells or basophils)
Histamine (preformed in mast cells)

Eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A)
lation
Smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretions
Attracts eosinophils (preformed in mast cells)

\section*{Secondary Mediators}
(Inactive precursors formed or released in response to primary mediators)
Bradykinin (derived from precursor kininogen)
Serotonin (preformed in platelets)
Heparin (preformed in mast cells)
Leukotrienes (derived from arachidonic acid and activated by

Smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability
Anticoagulant
Smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability mast cell degranulation) $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$, and E or slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A)

\section*{HISTAMINE}

Histamine plays an important role in the immune response. Histamine is released from mast cell granules where it is stored. Maximal intensity is reached within about 15 minutes after antigen contact (Parslow et al., 2001). The effects of histamine release include erythema; localized edema in the form of wheals; pruritus; contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in wheezing and bronchospasm; dilation of small venules and constriction of larger vessels; and increased secretion of gastric and mucosal cells, resulting in diarrhea. Histamine action results from stimulation of histamine-1 $\left(\mathrm{H}_{1}\right)$ and histamine-2 $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\right)$ receptors found on different types of lymphocytes, particularly T-lymphocyte suppressor cells and basophils. $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors are found predominantly on bronchiolar and vascular smooth muscle cells. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors are found on gastric parietal cells.

Certain medications are categorized by their action at these receptors. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is an example of an antihistamine, which is a medication displaying an affinity for $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors; cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac) are examples of other pharmacologic agents that target $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors to inhibit gastric secretions in peptic ulcer disease.

\section*{EOSINOPHIL CHEMOTACTIC FACTOR OF ANAPHYLAXIS}

Preformed in the mast cells, this chemotactic factor, which affects movement of eosinophils (granular leukocytes) to the site of allergens, is released upon degranulation to inhibit the action of leukotrienes and histamine.

\section*{PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR}

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is responsible for initiating platelet aggregation at sites of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. It also causes bronchoconstriction and increased vascular permeability. PAF also activates factor XII, or Hageman factor, which induces the formation of bradykinin.

\section*{PROSTAGLANDINS}

Prostaglandins, composed of unsaturated fatty acids, produce smooth muscle contraction as well as vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. The fever and pain that occur with inflammation are due in part to the prostaglandins.

\section*{Secondary Mediators}

\section*{LEUKOTRIENES}

Leukotrienes are chemical mediators that initiate the inflammatory response. They are metabolites released by mucosal mast cells. They collectively make up what was once termed "slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis" (SRS-A). Leukotrienes cause smooth muscle contraction, bronchial constriction, mucus secretion in the airways, and the typical wheal and flare reaction of the skin (Parslow et al., 2001). Compared with histamine, leukotrienes are 100 to 1,000 times more potent in causing bronchospasm. Many manifestations of inflammation can be attributed in part to leukotrienes. Medications categorized as leukotriene antagonists or modifiers (zileuton [Zyflo], zafirlukast [Accolate], montelukast [Singulair]) block the synthesis or action of leukotrienes and prevent the signs and symptoms associated with asthma.

\section*{BRADYKININ}

Bradykinin is a polypeptide with the ability to cause increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, hypotension, and contraction of many types of smooth muscle, such as the bronchi (Parslow et al., 2001). Increased permeability of the capillaries results in edema. Bradykinin stimulates nerve cell fibers and produces pain.

\section*{SEROTONIN}

Serotonin is released during platelet aggregation, acting as a potent vasoconstrictor and causing contraction of bronchial smooth muscle.

\section*{HYPERSENSITIVITY}

Although the immune system defends the host against infections and foreign antigens, immune responses can themselves cause tissue injury and disease. An immune response to an antigen may result in sensitivity to challenge with that antigen; hypersensitivity is a reflection of excessive or aberrant immune responses (Abbas \& Lichtman, 2001).

A hypersensitivity reaction is an abnormal, heightened reaction to any type of stimuli. It usually does not occur with the first exposure to an allergen. Rather, the reaction follows a re-exposure after sensitization in a predisposed individual. Sensitization initiates the humoral response or buildup of antibodies. To promote understanding of the immunopathogenesis of disease, hypersensitivity reactions have been classified into four specific types of re-
actions (Fig. 53-2). Most allergies are identified as either type I or type IV hypersensitivity reactions.

\section*{Anaphylactic (Type I) Hypersensitivity}

The most severe form of a hypersensitivity reaction is anaphylaxis. This systemic reaction is characterized by edema in many tissues, including the larynx, and is often accompanied by hypotension (Abbas \& Lichtman, 2001). Type I or anaphylactic hypersensitivity is an immediate reaction beginning within minutes of exposure to an antigen. This reaction is mediated by IgE antibodies rather than IgG or IgM antibodies. Type I hypersensitivity requires previous exposure to the specific antigen. In turn, the plasma cells produce IgE antibodies in the lymph nodes, where helper T cells aid in promoting this reaction. The IgE antibodies

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Type I. An anaphylactic reaction is characterized by vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and eosinophilia. Systemic reactions may involve laryngeal stridor, angioedema, hypotension, and bronchial, GI, or uterine spasm; local reactions are characterized by hives. Examples of type I reactions include extrinsic asthma, allergic rhinitis, systemic anaphylaxis, and reactions to insect stings.}
\end{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Type II. A cytotoxic reaction, which involves the binding of either the IgG or IgM antibody to a cellbound antigen, may lead to eventual cell and tissue damage. The reaction is the result of mistaken identity when the system identifies a normal constituent of the body as foreign and activates the complement cascade. Examples of type II reactions are myasthenia gravis, Goodpasture's syndrome, pernicious anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, transfusion reaction, and thrombocytopenia.}
\end{figure}

FIGURE 53-2 Four types of hypersensitivity reactions.
bind to membrane receptors on mast cells found in connective tissue and basophils. During re-exposure, the antigen binds to adjacent IgE antibodies, activating a cellular reaction that triggers degranulation and the release of chemical mediators (histamine, leukotrienes, and eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis [ECF-A]).

Primary chemical mediators are responsible for the symptoms of type I hypersensitivity because of their effects on the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. When chemical mediators continue to be released, a delayed reaction may occur lasting for up to 24 hours. Clinical symptoms are determined by the amount of the allergen, the amount of mediator released, the sensitivity of the target organ, and the route of allergen entry. Type I hypersensitivity reactions may include both local and systemic anaphylaxis.

\section*{Cytotoxic (Type II) Hypersensitivity}

Type II, or cytotoxic, hypersensitivity occurs when the system mistakenly identifies a normal constituent of the body as foreign. This reaction may be a result of a cross-reacting antibody, possibly leading to cell and tissue damage. Type II hypersensitivity involves the binding of either IgG or IgM antibody to the cellbound antigen. The result of antigen-antibody binding is activation of the complement cascade (see Chap. 50) and destruction of the cell to which the antigen is bound.

A type II hypersensitivity reaction is associated with several disorders. For example, in myasthenia gravis, the body mistakenly generates antibodies against normal nerve ending receptors. In Goodpasture syndrome, antibodies against lung and renal tissue are generated, producing lung damage and renal failure.

\caption{Type III. An immune complex reaction is marked by acute inflammation resulting from formation and deposition of immune complexes. The joints and kidneys are particularly susceptible to this kind of reaction, which is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, serum sickness, nephritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Some signs and symptoms include urticaria, joint pain, fever, rash, and adenopathy (swollen glands).}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Type IV. A delayed, or cellular, reaction occurs 1 to 3 days after exposure to an antigen. The reaction, which results in tissue damage, involves activity by lymphokines, macrophages, and lysozymes. Erythema and itching are common; a few examples include contact dermatitis, graft-versus-host disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and sarcoidosis.}
\end{figure}

A type II hypersensitivity reaction resulting in red blood cell destruction is associated with drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, Rh-hemolytic disease of the newborn, and incompatibility reactions in blood transfusions (see Chap. 33).

\section*{Immune Complex (Type III) Hypersensitivity}

Type III, or immune complex, hypersensitivity involves immune complexes formed when antigens bind to antibodies. These complexes are then cleared from the circulation by phagocytic action. When these type III complexes are deposited in tissues or vascular endothelium, two factors contribute to injury: the increased amount of circulating complexes and the presence of vasoactive amines. As a result, there is an increase in vascular permeability and tissue injury. The joints and kidneys are particularly susceptible to this type of injury. Type III hypersensitivity is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, certain types of nephritis, and some types of bacterial endocarditis. These are discussed elsewhere in this text.

\section*{Delayed-Type (Type IV) Hypersensitivity}

Type IV, or delayed-type hypersensitivity, also known as cellular hypersensitivity, occurs 24 to 72 hours after exposure to an allergen. It is mediated by sensitized T cells and macrophages. An example of this reaction is the effect of an intradermal injection of tuberculin antigen or purified protein derivative (PPD). Sensitized T cells react with the antigen at or near the injection site. Lymphokines are released and attract, activate, and retain macrophages at the site. These macrophages then release lysozymes, causing tissue damage. Edema and fibrin are responsible for the positive tuberculin reaction.

An example of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction is contact dermatitis resulting from exposure to allergens such as cosmetics, adhesive tape, topical medications, medication additives, and plant toxins. The primary exposure results in sensitization. Reexposure causes a hypersensitivity reaction composed of low-molecular-weight molecules (haptens) that bind with proteins or carriers and are then processed by Langerhans cells in the skin. The symptoms that occur include itching, erythema, and raised lesions.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

A comprehensive allergy history and a thorough physical examination provide useful data for the diagnosis and management of patients with allergic disorders. An assessment form is useful for obtaining and organizing this information (Chart 53-1).

The degree of difficulty and discomfort experienced by the patient because of allergic symptoms and the degree of improvement in those symptoms with and without treatment are assessed and documented. The relationship of symptoms to exposure to possible allergens is noted.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

Diagnostic evaluation of the patient with allergic disorders commonly includes blood tests, smears of body secretions, skin tests, and the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). Results of laboratory
blood studies provide supportive data for various diagnostic possibilities; however, they are not the major criteria for the diagnosis of allergic disease.

\section*{COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT WITH DIFFERENTIAL}

The white blood cell (WBC) count is usually normal except with infection. Eosinophils, granular leukocytes, normally make up $1 \%$ to 3\% of the total number of WBCs. A level between 5\% and $15 \%$ is nonspecific but does suggest allergic reaction. Higher levels are considered moderate and severe. In moderate eosinophilia, $15 \%$ to $40 \%$ of blood leukocytes as eosinophils are found in patients with allergic disorders as well as in patients with malignancy, immunodeficiencies, parasitic infections, and congenital heart disease, and those receiving peritoneal dialysis. In severe eosinophilia, 50\% to 90\% of blood leukocytes as eosinophils are found in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.

\section*{EOSINOPHIL COUNT}

An actual count of eosinophils may be obtained from blood samples or smears of secretions. A total eosinophil count can be obtained from a blood sample by using special diluting fluids that hemolyze erythrocytes and stain the eosinophils. During symptomatic episodes, smears obtained from nasal secretions, conjunctival secretions, and sputum of atopic patients usually reveal eosinophils, indicative of an active allergic response.

\section*{TOTAL SERUM IMMUNOGLOBULIN E LEVELS}

High total serum IgE levels support the diagnosis of atopic disease. A normal IgE level, however, does not exclude the diagnosis of an allergic disorder. IgE levels are not as sensitive as the paper radioimmunosorbent test (PRIST) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Indications for determining IgE levels include the following:
- Evaluation of immunodeficiency
- Evaluation of drug reactions
- Initial laboratory screening for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
- Evaluation of allergy among children with bronchiolitis
- Differentiation of atopic and nonatopic eczema
- Differentiation of atopic and nonatopic asthma and rhinitis

\section*{SKIN TESTS}

Skin testing entails the intradermal injection or superficial application (epicutaneous) of solutions at several sites. Depending on the suspected cause of allergic signs and symptoms, several different solutions may be applied at several separate sites. These solutions contain individual antigens representing an assortment of allergens, including pollen, most likely to be implicated in the patient's disease. Positive reactions (wheal and flare) are clinically significant when correlated with the history, physical findings, and results of other laboratory tests.

The results of skin tests complement the data obtained from the history. They indicate which of several antigens are most likely to provoke symptoms and provide some clue to the intensity of the patient's sensitization. The dosage of the antigen (allergen) injected is also important. Most patients are hypersensitive

to more than one pollen. Under testing conditions, they may not react (although they usually do) to the specific pollens that induce their attacks.

In cases of doubt about the validity of the skin tests, a RAST or a provocative challenge test may be performed. If a skin test is indicated, there is a reasonable suspicion that a specific allergen is producing symptoms in an allergic patient. Several precautionary steps, however, must be observed before skin testing with allergens:
- Testing is not performed during periods of bronchospasm.
- Epicutaneous tests (scratch or prick tests) are performed before other testing methods in an effort to minimize the risk of systemic reaction.
- Emergency equipment must be readily available to treat anaphylaxis.

\section*{Types of Skin Tests}

The methods of skin testing include prick skin tests, scratch tests, and intradermal skin testing (Fig. 53-3). After prick or scratch tests, intradermal skin testing is performed with allergens that did not elicit positive reactions. Because a larger antigen challenge is being used, local or systemic reactions could occur if the same antigens that produced positive skin or scratch reactions are used. The back is the most suitable area of the body for skin testing because it permits the performance of many tests. The multitest applicator is a commercially available device with multiple test heads that allows simultaneous administration of antigens by multiple punctures at different sites.

\section*{Interpretation of Skin Test Results}

Familiarity with and consistent use of a grading system are essential. The grading system used should be identified on a skin test sheet for later interpretation. A positive reaction, evidenced by the appearance of an urticarial wheal (round, reddened skin elevation) (Fig. 53-4), localized erythema (diffuse redness) in the area of inoculation or contact, or pseudopodia (irregular projec-
tion at the end of a wheal) with associated erythema is considered indicative of sensitivity to the corresponding antigen.

There may be false-negative results due to improper technique, outdated allergen solutions, and prior use of medications that suppress skin reactivity. Corticosteroids and antihistamines, including allergy medications, suppress skin test reactivity and are usually withheld 48 to 96 hours before testing, depending on the duration of their activity. False-positive skin tests may result from improper preparation or administration of allergen solutions.

Interpretation of positive or negative skin tests must be based on the history, physical examination, and other laboratory test

results. The following guidelines are used for the interpretation of skin test results:
- Skin tests are more reliable for diagnosing atopic sensitivity in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis than in patients with asthma.
- Positive skin tests correlate highly with food allergy.
- The use of skin tests to diagnose immediate hypersensitivity to medications is limited because metabolites of medications, not the medications themselves, are usually responsible for causing hypersensitivity.

\section*{PROVOCATIVE TESTING}

Provocative testing involves the direct administration of the suspected allergen to the sensitive tissue, such as the conjunctiva, nasal or bronchial mucosa, or gastrointestinal tract (by ingestion of the allergen) with observation of target organ response. This type of testing is helpful in identifying clinically significant allergens in patients with a large number of positive tests. Major disadvantages of this type of testing are the limitation of one antigen per session and the risk of producing severe symptoms, particularly bronchospasm, in patients with asthma.

\section*{RADIOALLERGOSORBENT TEST}

RAST is a radioimmunoassay that measures allergen-specific IgE. A sample of the patient's serum is exposed to a variety of suspected allergen particle complexes. If antibodies are present, they will combine with radiolabeled allergens. After the serum is centrifuged, radioimmunoassay detects the allergen-specific IgE antibody. Test results are then compared with control values. In addition to detecting an allergen, RAST indicates the quantity of allergen necessary to evoke an allergic reaction. Values are reported on a scale from 0 to 5 . Values of $2+$ or greater are considered significant. The major advantages of RAST over other tests include decreased risk of systemic reaction, stability of antigens, and lack of dependence on skin reactivity modified by medica-
tions. The major disadvantages include the limited allergen selection, reduced sensitivity compared with intradermal skin tests, lack of immediate results, and cost.

\section*{Allergic Disorders}

There are two types of IgE-mediated allergic reactions: atopic and nonatopic disorders. While the underlying immunologic reactions of the two types of disorders are the same, predisposing factors and manifestations are different. The atopic disorders are characterized by a hereditary predisposition and production of a local reaction to IgE antibodies produced in response to common environmental allergens (Kay, 2001a). The nonatopic disorders lack the genetic component and organ specificity of the atopic disorders (Porth, 2002). Examples of atopic disorders are allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and atopic dermatitis (Kay, 2001a).

A type I hypersensitivity response results in atopic (allergic) diseases, which affect $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the U.S. population. Genetic factors play a role in susceptibility to these diseases. Disorders characterized as atopic include anaphylaxis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria and angioedema, gastrointestinal allergy, and asthma. Latex allergy may be a type I or type IV hypersensitivity reaction, although true latex allergy is considered to be a type I hypersensitivity reaction (Brehler \& Kütting, 2001). Latex allergy is discussed later in this chapter. Contact dermatitis is considered a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

\section*{ANAPHYLAXIS}

Anaphylaxis is a clinical response to an immediate (type I hypersensitivity) immunologic reaction between a specific antigen and an antibody. The reaction results from IgE antibody. An anaphylactic reaction can be triggered by exposure to an antigen through inhalation, injection, ingestion, or skin contact. It is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. It is estimated that 3.3 to 43 million persons in the United States ( $1.24 \%$ to $16.8 \%$ of the
population) are at risk for anaphylaxis (Neugut, Ghatak \& Miller, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Anaphylaxis is caused by the interaction of a foreign antigen with specific IgE antibodies found on the surface membrane of mast cells and peripheral blood basophils. The subsequent release of histamine and other bioactive mediators causes activation of platelets, eosinophils, and neutrophils and the coagulation cascade. Smooth muscle spasm, bronchospasm, mucosal edema and inflammation, and increased capillary permeability result. These systemic changes characteristically produce clinical manifestations within seconds or minutes of antigen exposure (Neugut et al., 2001). Closely related to anaphylaxis is an anaphylactoid (anaphylaxis-like) reaction, which is described in Chart 53-2.

Substances that most commonly cause anaphylaxis include foods, medications, insect stings, and latex (Chart 53-3). Foods that are common causes of anaphylaxis include peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, soy, and wheat. Many medications have been implicated in anaphylaxis. Those that are most frequently reported include antibiotics (including penicillin), radiocontrast agents, intravenous anesthetics, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids. Antibiotics and radiocontrast agents cause the most serious anaphylactic reactions, producing reactions in about 1 of every 5,000 exposures. Penicillin is the most common cause of anaphylaxis and accounts for about 75\% of fatal anaphylactic reactions in the U.S. each year (Neugut et al., 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Anaphylactic reactions may be categorized as mild, moderate, and severe systemic reactions. The time from exposure to the antigen to onset of symptoms is a good indicator of the severity of the reaction: the faster the onset, the more severe the reaction (Neugut et al., 2001).

Mild systemic reactions consist of peripheral tingling and a sensation of warmth, possibly accompanied by fullness in the mouth and throat. Nasal congestion, periorbital swelling, pruritus, sneezing, and tearing of the eyes can also be expected. Onset of symptoms begins within the first 2 hours of exposure.

Moderate systemic reactions may include flushing, warmth, anxiety, and itching in addition to any of the above symptoms.

\section*{Anaphylactoid (Anaphylaxis-Like) Reaction}

Closely related to anaphylaxis is an anaphylactoid (anaphylaxis-like) reaction, caused by the release of mast cell and basophil mediators triggered by non-IgE-mediated events. An anaphylactoid reaction may occur with medications, food, exercise, and cytotoxic antibody transfusions. The reaction may be local or systemic. Local reactions usually involve urticaria and angioedema at the site of the antigen exposure. Although possibly severe, anaphylactoid reactions are rarely fatal. Systemic reactions occur within about 30 minutes of exposure involving cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and integumentary organ systems. For the most part, an anaphylactoid reaction and its treatment are identical to that of anaphylaxis (Neugut et al., 2001).

More serious reactions include bronchospasm and edema of the airways or larynx with dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. The onset of symptoms is the same as for a mild reaction.

Severe systemic reactions have an abrupt onset with the same signs and symptoms described above. These progress rapidly to bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, severe dyspnea, cyanosis, and hypotension. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), abdominal cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, and seizures can also occur. Cardiac arrest and coma may follow.

\section*{Prevention}

Strict avoidance of potential allergens is an important preventive measure for the patient at risk for anaphylaxis (Neugut et al., 2001). Patients at risk for anaphylaxis from insect stings should avoid areas populated by insects and should use appropriate clothing, insect repellent, and caution to avoid further stings.

If avoidance of exposure to allergens is impossible, administration of epinephrine is a critical measure to prevent an anaphylactic reaction. People sensitive to insect bites and stings, those who have experienced food or medication reactions, and those who have experienced idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylactic reactions should always carry an emergency kit that contains epinephrine. The EpiPen from Dey Pharmaceuticals is a commercially available first-aid device that delivers premeasured doses of 0.3 mg (Epipen) and 0.15 mg (Epipen Jr.) of epinephrine (Fig. 53-5). The autoinjection system requires no preparation, and the self-administration technique is uncomplicated. The patient must be given an opportunity to demonstrate the correct technique for use; an Epipen training device is available. Verbal and written information about the emergency kit, as well as strategies to avoid exposure to threatening allergens, must also be provided.

Screening for allergies before a medication is prescribed or first administered is an important preventive measure. A careful history of any sensitivity to suspected antigens must be obtained before administering any medication, particularly in parenteral form, because this route is associated with the most severe anaphylaxis. Nurses caring for patients in any setting (hospital, home, outpatient diagnostic testing sites, long-term care facilities) must assess patients' risk for anaphylactic reactions. The patient is asked about previous exposure to contrast agents used for diag-

nostic tests and any allergic reactions, as well as reactions to any medications, foods, insect stings, and latex. Persons predisposed to anaphylaxis should wear some form of identification, such as a medical alert bracelet, naming allergies to medications, food, and other substances.

People who are allergic to insect venom may require venom immunotherapy, which is used as a control measure and not a cure. Immunotherapy following an insect sting is very effective in reducing the risk of anaphylaxis from future stings (Neugut et al., 2001). Insulin-allergic diabetic patients and penicillin-sensitive patients may require desensitization. Desensitization is based on controlled anaphylaxis, with a gradual release of mediators. Patients who undergo desensitization are cautioned that there should be no lapses in therapy, because this may lead to the reappearance of an allergic reaction when the medication is reinstituted.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management depends on the severity of the reaction. Initially, respiratory and cardiovascular functions are evaluated. If the patient is in cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is instituted. Oxygen is provided in high concentrations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or when the patient is cyanotic, dyspneic, or wheezing. Epinephrine, in a $1: 1,000$ dilution, is administered subcutaneously in the upper extremity or thigh and may be followed by a continuous intravenous infusion. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may also be given to prevent recurrences of the reaction and to treat urticaria and angioedema. To maintain blood pressure and normal hemodynamic status, IV fluids (ie, normal saline solution), volume expanders, and vasopressor agents are given. In patients with episodes of bronchospasm or a history of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aminophylline and corticosteroids may also be administered to improve airway patency and function. If hypotension is unresponsive to vasopressors, intravenous glucagon may be given for its acute inotropic and chronotropic effects. Patients with severe reactions are observed closely for 12 to 14 hours. Because of the potential for recurrence, patients with even mild reactions must be educated concerning this risk.

\section*{Nursing Management}

If a patient is experiencing an allergic response, the nurse's initial action is to assess the patient for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. The nurse assesses the airway, breathing pattern, and other vital signs. The patient is observed for signs of increasing edema and respiratory distress. Prompt notification of the physician and preparation for initiation of emergency measures (intubation, administration of emergency medications, insertion of intravenous lines, fluid administration, oxygen administration) are important to reduce the severity of the reaction and to restore cardiovascular function. The nurse documents the interventions used and the patient's response to treatment, vital signs, and laboratory values.

The patient who has recovered from anaphylaxis needs an explanation of what occurred and instruction about avoiding future exposure to antigens and administering emergency medications to treat anaphylaxis. The patient must be instructed about antigens that should be avoided and about other strategies to prevent recurrence of anaphylaxis. All patients who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction should receive a prescription for preloaded syringes of epinephrine. The nurse instructs the patient and family in their use and has the patient and family demonstrate correct administration (Chart 53-4).

\section*{ALLERGIC RHINITIS}

Allergic rhinitis (inflammation of nasal mucosa; hay fever, chronic allergic rhinitis, pollinosis) is the most common form of respiratory allergy presumed to be mediated by an immediate (type I hypersensitivity) immunologic reaction. It affects about $8 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the U.S. population ( $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of adolescents). The symptoms are similar to viral rhinitis but are usually more persistent and demonstrate seasonal variation (Tierney, McPhee \& Papadakis, 2001). It often occurs with other conditions, such as allergic conjunctivitis, sinusitis, and asthma. Allergic rhinitis is associated with impaired work and school performance and decreased quality of life (Ratner, Ehrlich, Fineman et al., 2002). When untreated, many complications may result, such as allergic asthma, chronic nasal obstruction, chronic otitis media with hearing loss, anosmia (absence of the sense of smell), and, in children, orofacial dental deformities. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are essential to reduce complications and relieve symptoms.

Because allergic rhinitis is induced by airborne pollens or molds, it is characterized by the following seasonal occurrences:
- Early spring-tree pollen (oak, elm, poplar)
- Early summer-rose pollen (rose fever), grass pollen (Timothy, red-top)
- Early fall-weed pollen (ragweed)

Each year, attacks begin and end at about the same time. Airborne mold spores require warm, damp weather. Although there is no rigid seasonal pattern, these spores appear in early spring, are rampant during the summer, and taper off and disappear by the first frost.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Sensitization begins by ingestion or inhalation of an antigen. On re-exposure, the nasal mucosa reacts by the slowing of ciliary action, edema formation, and leukocyte (primarily eosinophil) infiltration. Histamine is the major mediator of allergic reactions in the nasal mucosa. Tissue edema results from vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.

\section*{Chart 53-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION}

Self-Administration of Epinephrine
The patient is taught how to inject epinephrine in the event of an anaphylactic reaction. The patient should be encouraged to practice this technique using a training device.
1. Carefully uncap the Epipen device, holding it so that the injecting end is upright.

3. Push the device into the thigh as far as possible. The Epipen device will autoinject a premeasured dose of epinephrine into the subcutaneous tissue.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Typical signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis include nasal congestion; clear, watery nasal discharge; intermittent sneezing; and nasal itching. Itching of the throat and soft palate is common. Drainage of nasal mucus into the pharynx initiates multiple attempts to clear the throat and results in a dry cough or hoarseness. Headache, pain over the paranasal sinuses, and epistaxis can accompany allergic rhinitis. The symptoms of this chronic condition depend on environmental exposure and intrinsic host responsiveness. Allergic rhinitis may affect quality of life by also producing fatigue, loss of sleep, and poor concentration (Ratner et al., 2002).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis of seasonal allergic rhinitis is based on history, physical examination, and diagnostic test results. Diagnostic tests include nasal smears, peripheral blood counts, total serum IgE, epicutaneous and intradermal testing, RAST, food elimination and challenge, and nasal provocation tests. Results indicative of allergy as the cause of rhinitis include increased IgE and eosinophil levels and positive reactions on allergen testing. Falsepositive and false-negative responses to these tests, particularly skin testing and provocation tests, may occur.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of therapy is to provide relief from symptoms. Therapy may include one or all of the following interventions: avoidance therapy, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy (Kay, 2001b). Verbal instructions must be reinforced by written information. Knowledge of general concepts regarding assessment and therapy in allergic diseases is important so that patients can learn to manage certain conditions as well as prevent severe reactions and illnesses.

\section*{AVOIDANCE THERAPY}

In avoidance therapy, every attempt is made to remove the allergens that act as precipitating factors. Simple measures and environmental controls are often effective in decreasing symptoms. Examples include use of air conditioners, air cleaners, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, and smoke-free environments. In many cases, it is impossible to avoid exposure to all environmental allergens, so pharmacologic therapy or immunotherapy is needed.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Antihistamines. Antihistamines, now classified as $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor antagonists (or $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-blockers), are used in managing mild allergic disorders. ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists are used to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers.) $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-blockers bind selectively to $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors, preventing the actions of histamines at these sites. They do not prevent the release of histamine from mast cells or basophils. The $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-antagonists have no effect on $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptors, but they do have the ability to bind to nonhistaminic receptors. The ability of certain antihistamines to bind to and block muscarinic receptors underlies several of the prominent anticholinergic side effects of these medications.

Oral antihistamines, which are readily absorbed, are most effective when given at the first occurrence of symptoms because they prevent the development of new symptoms by blocking the actions of histamine at the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptors. The effectiveness of these medications is limited to certain patients with hay fever, vasomotor rhinitis, urticaria (hives), and mild asthma. They are rarely effective in other conditions or in any severe conditions.

Antihistamines are the major class of medications prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis. The major side effect is sedation, although histamine $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are less sedating than earlier antihistamines (Kay, 2001b). Additional side effects include nervousness, tremors, dizziness, dry mouth, palpitations, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Antihistamines are contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy; for nursing mothers and newborns; in children and elderly people; and in patients whose conditions can be aggravated by muscarinic blockade (ie, asthma, urinary retention, open-angle glaucoma, hypertension, and prostatic hyperplasia).

Newer antihistamines are called second-generation or nonsedating $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor antagonists. Unlike first-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptor antagonists, they do not cross the blood-brain barrier and do not bind to cholinergic, serotonin, or alpha-adrenergic receptors. They bind to peripheral rather than central nervous system $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptors, causing less sedation. Examples of these medications are loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), and fexofenadine (Allegra). These are summarized in Table 53-2.

Adrenergic Agents. Adrenergic agents, vasoconstrictors of mucosal vessels, are used topically (nasal and ophthalmic) in addi-
tion to the oral route. The topical route (drops and sprays) causes fewer side effects than oral administration; however, the use of drops and sprays should be limited to a few days to avoid rebound congestion. Adrenergic nasal decongestants are used for the relief of nasal congestion when applied topically to the nasal mucosa. They activate the alpha-adrenergic receptor sites on the smooth muscle of the nasal mucosal blood vessels, reducing local blood flow, fluid exudation, and mucosal edema. Topical ophthalmic drops are used for symptomatic relief of eye irritations due to allergies. Potential side effects include hypertension, dysrhythmias, palpitations, central nervous system stimulation, irritability, tremor, and tachyphylaxis (acceleration of hemodynamic status). Examples of adrenergic decongestants and their routes of administration are found in Table 53-3.

Mast Cell Stabilizers. Intranasal cromolyn sodium (Nasalcrom) is a spray that acts by stabilizing the mast cell membrane, thus reducing the release of histamine and other mediators of the allergic response. In addition, it inhibits macrophages, eosinophils, monocytes, and platelets involved in the immune response (Ratner et al., 2002). Cromolyn interrupts the physiologic response to nasal antigens and is used prophylactically before exposure to

allergens to prevent the onset of symptoms and to treat symptoms once they occur. It is also used therapeutically in chronic allergic rhinitis. This spray is as effective as antihistamines but less effective than intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients must be informed that the beneficial effects of the medication may take a week or so to occur. The medication is of no benefit in the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis. Adverse effects (ie, sneezing, local stinging, and burning sensations) are usually mild.

Corticosteroids. Intranasal corticosteroids are indicated in more severe cases of allergic and perennial rhinitis that cannot be controlled by more conventional medications such as decongestants, antihistamines, and intranasal cromolyn. These medications include beclomethasone (Beconase, Vancenase), budesonide (Rhinocort), dexamethasone (Decadron Phosphate Turbinaire), flunisolide (Nasalide), fluticasone (Cutivate, Flonase), and triamcinolone (Nasacort).

Because of their anti-inflammatory actions, these medications are equally effective in preventing or suppressing the major symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Corticosteroids are administered by metered-spray devices. If the nasal passages are blocked, a topical decongestant can be used to clear the passages before the administration of the intranasal corticosteroid. Patients must be aware that full benefit may not be achieved for several days to 2 weeks. Adverse effects of intranasal corticosteroids are mild and include drying of the nasal mucosa and burning and itching sensations caused by the vehicle used to administer the medication. Systemic effects are more likely with dexamethasone. Recommended use of this medication is limited to 30 days. Beclomethasone, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone, and triamcinolone are deactivated rapidly after absorption, so they do not achieve significant blood levels. Corticosteroids suppress host defenses, so they must be used with caution in patients with tuberculosis or untreated bacterial infections of the lungs. Patients on corticosteroids are at risk for infection and for suppression of typical manifestations of inflammation because host defenses are compromised. Inhaled corticosteroids do not affect the immune system to the same degree as systemic corticosteroids (ie, oral corticosteroids). As corticosteroids are inhaled into the upper respiratory tract, tuberculosis or untreated bacterial infections of the lungs may become apparent and progress. Whenever possible, patients with tuberculosis and other bacterial infections of the lungs should avoid inhaled corticosteroids.

Oral and parenteral corticosteroids are used when conventional therapy has failed and symptoms are severe and of short duration. They can control symptoms of allergic reactions such as hay fever, medication-induced allergies, and allergic reactions to
insect stings. Because the response to corticosteroids is delayed, they have little or no value in acute therapy for severe reactions such as anaphylaxis. Patients who receive corticosteroids must be cautioned not to stop taking the medication suddenly or without specific instructions from the physician. The patient is also instructed about side effects, which include fluid retention, weight gain, hypertension, gastric irritation, glucose intolerance, and adrenal suppression. Further discussion of corticosteroids is provided in Chapter 42.

\section*{IMMUNOTHERAPY}

Allergen desensitization (allergen immunotherapy, hyposensitization) is primarily used to treat IgE-mediated diseases by injections of allergen extracts. This type of therapy provides an adjunct to symptomatic pharmacologic therapy and can be used when allergen avoidance is not possible (Parslow et al., 2001). Specific immunotherapy has been used in the treatment of allergic disorders for about 100 years. It consists of administering increasing concentrations of extracts of specific allergens over a long period (Kay, 2001b). Goals of immunotherapy include reducing the level of circulating IgE, increasing the level of blocking antibody IgG, and reducing mediator cell sensitivity. Immunotherapy has been most effective for ragweed pollen; however, treatment for grass, tree pollen, cat, and house dust mite allergens has also been effective.

Correlation of a positive skin test with a positive allergy history is an indication for immunotherapy if the allergen cannot be avoided. The value has been fairly well established in instances of allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma that are clearly due to sensitivity to one of the common pollens, molds, and household dust. Although helpful in most patients, immunotherapy does not cure the condition. Before immunotherapy is initiated, the patient must understand what to expect and the importance of continuing therapy for several years. When skin tests are performed, the results are correlated with clinical manifestations; treatment is based on the patient's needs rather than on skin tests.

The most common method of treatment is the serial injection of one or more antigens that are selected in each particular case on the basis of skin tests. This method provides a simple and efficient technique for identifying IgE antibodies to specific antigens. Specific treatment consists of injecting extracts of the pollens or mold spores that cause symptoms in a particular patient. Injections begin with very small amounts and are gradually increased, usually at weekly intervals, until a maximum tolerated dose is attained. Maintenance booster injections are given at 2- to 4-week intervals, frequently for a period of several years, before maximum benefit is achieved.

There are three methods of injection therapy: coseasonal, preseasonal, and perennial. When treatment is given on a coseasonal basis, therapy is initiated during the season in which the patient experiences symptoms. This method has been proved ineffective and is used infrequently. Also, there is an increased risk of systemic reactions. Preseasonal therapy injections are given 2 to 3 months before symptoms are expected, allowing time for hyposensitization to occur. This treatment is discontinued after the season begins. Perennial therapy is administered all year round, usually on a monthly basis, and is the preferred method because it has more effective, longer-lasting results.

Any patient who receives specific immunotherapy is at risk for general, and potentially fatal, anaphylaxis. This occurs most frequently at the induction or "up-dosing" phase. Attempts have been made to minimize the risk of systemic reactions by pretreating allergen extracts with agents such as formaldehyde. This approach decreases the binding of the allergen by IgE, but it also results in decreased immunogenicity (Kay, 2001b).

NURSING ALERT Because the injection of an allergen may induce systemic reactions, such injections are given only in a setting (ie, physician's office, clinic) where epinephrine is immediately available.

Because of the risk for anaphylaxis, injections should not be given by a lay person or by the patient. The patient remains in the office or clinic for at least 30 minutes after the injection and is observed for possible systemic symptoms. If a large, local swelling develops at the injection site, the next dose should not be increased, because this may be a warning sign of a possible systemic reaction.

Therapeutic failure is evident when a patient does not experience a decrease of symptoms within 12 to 24 months, fails to develop increased tolerance to known allergens, and cannot decrease the use of medications to reduce symptoms. Potential causes of treatment failure include misdiagnosis of allergies, inadequate doses of allergen, newly developed allergies, and inadequate environmental controls.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS:}

\section*{THE PATIENT WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS}

\section*{Assessment}

The examination and history of the patient reveal sneezing, often in paroxysms, thin and watery nasal discharge, itching eyes and nose, lacrimation, and occasionally headache. The health history includes a personal or family history of allergy. The allergy assessment identifies the nature of antigens, seasonal changes in symptoms, and medication history. The nurse also obtains subjective data about how the patient feels just before symptoms become obvious, such as the occurrence of pruritus, breathing problems, and tingling sensations. In addition to these symptoms, hoarseness, wheezing, hives, rash, erythema, and edema are noted. Any relationship between emotional problems or stress and the triggering of allergy symptoms is assessed.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective breathing pattern related to allergic reaction
- Deficient knowledge about allergy and the recommended modifications in lifestyle and self-care practices
- Ineffective individual coping with chronicity of condition and need for environmental modifications

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Anaphylaxis
- Impaired breathing
- Nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include restoration of normal breathing pattern, increased knowledge about the causes and control of allergic symptoms, improved coping with alterations and modifications, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING BREATHING PATTERN}

The patient is instructed and assisted to modify the environment to reduce the severity of allergic symptoms or to prevent their occurrence. The patient is instructed to reduce exposure to people with upper respiratory infections (URIs). If a URI occurs, the patient is encouraged to take deep breaths and cough frequently to ensure adequate gas exchange and prevent atelectasis. The patient is instructed to seek medical attention because allergy symptoms along with a URI may compromise adequate lung function. Compliance with medications and other treatment regimens is encouraged and reinforced.

\section*{PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING OF ALLERGY AND ALLERGY CONTROL}

Instruction includes strategies to minimize exposure to allergens, desensitization procedures, and correct use of medications. The nurse informs and reminds the patient of the importance of keeping appointments for desensitization procedures because usually dosages are adjusted on a weekly basis, and missed appointments may interfere with the dosage adjustment.

Patients also need to understand that medications for allergy control should be used only when the allergy is apparent. This is usually on a seasonal basis. Continued use of medications when not required may cause an increased tolerance to the medication, with the result that the medication is not effective when needed.

\section*{COPING WITH A CHRONIC DISORDER}

Although allergic reactions are infrequently life-threatening, they require constant vigilance to avoid allergens and modification of the lifestyle or environment to prevent recurrence of symptoms. Allergic symptoms are often present year-round and create discomfort and inconvenience for the patient. Although patients may not feel ill during allergy seasons, they often do not feel well either. The need to be alert for possible allergens in the environment may be tiresome, placing a burden on the patient's ability to lead a normal life. Stress related to these difficulties may in turn increase the frequency or severity of symptoms.

To assist the patient in adjusting to these modifications, the nurse must have an appreciation of the difficulties encountered
by the patient. The patient is encouraged to verbalize feelings and concerns in a supportive environment and to identify strategies to deal with them effectively.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Anaphylaxis and Impaired Breathing}

Respiratory and cardiovascular functioning can be significantly altered during allergic reactions by the reaction itself or by the medications used to treat reactions. The respiratory status is evaluated by monitoring the respiratory rate and pattern and by assessing for breathing difficulties or abnormal lung sounds. The pulse rate and rhythm and blood pressure are monitored to assess cardiovascular status regularly or any time the patient reports symptoms such as itching or difficulty breathing. In the event of signs and symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis, emergency medications and equipment must be available for immediate use.

\section*{Nonadherence to Therapeutic Regimen}

Knowing about the treatment regimen does not ensure adherence. Having the patient identify potential barriers and explore acceptable solutions for effective management of the condition (eg, installing tile floors rather than carpet, not gardening in the spring) can increase adherence to the treatment regimen.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient is instructed about strategies to minimize exposure to allergens, the actions and adverse effects of medications, and the correct use of medications. The patient should know the names, dose, frequency, actions, and side effects of all medications taken.

Instruction about strategies to control allergic symptoms is based on the needs of the patient as determined by the results of tests, the severity of symptoms, and the motivation of the patient and family to deal with the condition. Suggestions for patients sensitive to dust and mold in the home are given in Chart 53-5.

If the patient is to undergo immunotherapy, the nurse reinforces the physician's explanation regarding the purpose and procedure. Instructions are given regarding the series of injections, usually given initially every week and then at 2 - to 4 -week intervals. These instructions include remaining in the physician's office or the clinic at least 30 minutes after the injection so that emergency treatment may be given if the patient has a reaction; avoiding rubbing or scratching the injection site; and continuing with the series for the period of time required. In addition, the patient and family are instructed about emergency treatment of severe allergic symptoms.

Because antihistamines often produce drowsiness, the patient is cautioned about this and other side effects of the particular medication. Operating machinery, driving a car, and performing activities requiring intense concentration should be postponed. The patient is also informed about the dangers of drinking alcohol when taking these medications because they tend to exaggerate the effects of alcohol.

The patient must be aware of the effects caused by overuse of the sympathomimetic agents in nose drops or sprays. A condition referred to as rhinitis medicamentosa may result (Fig. 53-6). After topical application of the medication, a rebound period may occur in which the nasal mucous membranes become more edematous and congested than they were before the medication was used. Such a reaction encourages the use of more medication, and a cyclical pattern results. The topical agent must be discontinued immediately and completely to correct this problem.

Follow-up telephone calls to the patient are often reassuring to the patient and family and provide an opportunity for the nurse to answer any questions. The patient is reminded to keep followup appointments and is informed about the importance of continuing with treatment. The importance of participating in health promotion activities and health screening is emphasized to the patient.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

\section*{CONTACT DERMATITIS}

Contact dermatitis (dermatitis venenata), a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction, is an acute or chronic skin inflammation that results from direct skin contact with chemicals or allergens. There are four basic types: allergic, irritant, phototoxic, and photoallergic (Table 53-4). Eighty percent of cases are due to excessive exposure to or additive effects of irritants (eg, soaps, detergents, organic solvents) (Tierney et al., 2001). Skin sensitivity may develop after brief or prolonged periods of exposure, and the clinical picture may appear hours or weeks after the sensitized skin has been exposed.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms include itching, burning, erythema, skin lesions (vesicles), and edema, followed by weeping, crusting, and finally drying and peeling of the skin. In severe responses, hemorrhagic bullae may develop. Repeated reactions may be accompanied by thickening of the skin and pigmentary changes. Secondary invasion by bacteria may develop in skin abraded by rubbing or scratching. Usually, there are no systemic symptoms unless the eruption is widespread.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The location of the skin eruption and the history of exposure aid in determining the condition. In cases of obscure irritants or an unobservant patient, however, diagnosis may be extremely difficult, often involving many trial-and-error procedures before the cause is determined. Patch tests on the skin with suspected offending agents may clarify the diagnosis.

\section*{ATOPIC DERMATITIS}

Atopic dermatitis is a type I immediate hypersensitivity disorder. A family history is common. The incidence of atopic dermatitis is highest in infants and children. Atopic dermatitis (eczema) affects $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of children in Western populations (Kay, 2001b). Most patients have significant elevations of serum IgE and peripheral eosinophilia. Pruritus and hyperirritability of the skin are the most consistent features of atopic dermatitis and are related to large amounts of histamine in the skin. Excessive dryness of the skin with resultant itching is related to changes in lipid content, sebaceous gland activity, and sweating. In response to stroking of the skin, immediate redness appears on the skin and is followed in 15 to 30 seconds by pallor, which persists for

1 to 3 minutes. Lesions develop secondary to the trauma of scratching and appear in areas of increased sweating and hypervascularity. Atopic dermatitis is chronic, with remissions and exacerbations. This condition has a tendency to recur, with remission from adolescence to age 20 (Tierney et al., 2001). Treatment must be individualized.

\section*{Medical Management}

Guidelines for treatment include decreasing itching and scratching by wearing cotton fabrics, washing with a mild detergent, humidifying dry heat in winter, maintaining room temperature at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $22.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(68^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right.$ to $\left.72^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, using antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and avoiding animals, dust, sprays, and perfumes. Keeping the skin moisturized with daily baths to hydrate the skin and topical skin moisturizers is encouraged. Topical corticosteroids are used to prevent inflammation, and any infection is treated with antibiotics to eliminate Staphylococcus aureus when indicated. Use of low doses of cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), an immunosuppressive agent, may be effective (Kay, 2001b).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients who experience atopic dermatitis and their families require assistance and support from the nurse to cope with the disorder. The symptoms are often disturbing to the patient and
disruptive to the family. The appearance of the skin may affect the patient's self-esteem and may affect the patient's willingness to interact with others. Instructions and counseling about strategies to incorporate preventive measures and treatments into the lifestyle of the family may be helpful.

Patients and family members need to be aware of signs of secondary infection and of the need to seek treatment if infection occurs. The nurse also teaches the patient and family about the side effects of medications used in treatment.

\section*{DERMATITIS MEDICAMENTOSA (DRUG REACTIONS)}

Dermatitis medicamentosa, a type I hypersensitivity disorder, is the term applied to skin rashes induced by the internal administration of certain medications. Although individuals react differently to each medication, certain medications tend to induce eruptions of similar types. Rashes are among the most common adverse reactions to medications and occur in approximately $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ of hospitalized patients (Tierney et al., 2001).

In general, drug reactions appear suddenly, have a particularly vivid color, present with characteristics that are more intense than the somewhat similar eruptions of infectious origin, and, with the exception of bromide and the iodide rashes, disappear rapidly after the medication is withdrawn. Rashes may be accompanied by systemic or generalized symptoms. Upon discovery of a medication allergy, patients are warned that they have a hypersensi-
tivity to a particular medication and are advised not to take it again. Information identifying the hypersensitivity should be carried with them at all times.

Skin eruptions related to medication therapy suggest more serious hypersensitivities. Frequent assessment and prompt reporting of the appearance of any eruptions are important so that early treatment can be initiated. Some cutaneous drug reactions may be associated with a clinical complex that involves other organs. These are known as complex drug reactions (Tierney et al., 2001).

\section*{URTICARIA AND ANGIONEUROTIC EDEMA}

Urticaria (hives) is a type I hypersensitive allergic reaction of the skin characterized by the sudden appearance of pinkish, edematous elevations that vary in size and shape and itch and cause local discomfort. They may involve any part of the body, including the mucous membranes (especially those of the mouth), the larynx (occasionally with serious respiratory complications), and the gastrointestinal tract.

Each hive remains for a few minutes to several hours before disappearing. For hours or days, clusters of these lesions may come, go, and return episodically. If this sequence continues for longer than 6 weeks, the condition is called chronic urticaria (Tierney et al., 2001).

Angioneurotic edema involves the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in more diffuse swelling rather than the discrete lesions characteristic of hives. On occasion, this reaction covers the entire back. The skin over the reaction may appear normal but often has a reddish hue. The skin does not pit on pressure, as ordinary edema does. The regions most often involved are the lips, eyelids, cheeks, hands, feet, genitalia, and tongue; the mucous membranes of the larynx, the bronchi, and the gastrointestinal canal may also be affected, particularly in the hereditary type (see section that follows). Swellings may appear suddenly, in a few seconds or minutes, or slowly, in 1 or 2 hours. In the latter case, their appearance is often preceded by itching or burning sensations. Seldom does more than a single swelling appear at one time, although one may develop while another is disappearing. Infrequently, swelling recurs in the same region. Individual lesions usually last 24 to 36 hours. On rare occasions, swelling may recur with remarkable regularity at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks.

\section*{HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA}

Hereditary angioedema, although not an immunologic disorder in the usual sense, is included because of its resemblance to allergic angioedema and because of the seriousness of the condition. Symptoms are due to edema of the skin, the respiratory tract, or the digestive tract. Attacks may be precipitated by trauma or may seem to occur spontaneously.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

When skin is involved, the swelling is usually diffuse, does not itch, and is usually not accompanied by urticaria. Gastrointestinal edema may cause abdominal pain severe enough to suggest the need for surgery. Typically, attacks last 1 to 4 days and are gener-
ally harmless. Occasionally, attacks affect the subcutaneous and submucosal tissues in the region of the upper airway and can be associated with respiratory obstruction and asphyxiation. This disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Approximately $85 \%$ of patients with this disorder have one nonproductive gene; the other 15\% have a gene mutation (Parslow et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Attacks usually subside within 3 to 4 days, but during this time the patient should be observed carefully for signs of laryngeal obstruction, which may necessitate tracheostomy as a life-saving measure. Epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are usually used in treatment, but their success is limited.

\section*{FOOD ALLERGY}

IgE-mediated food allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction, occurs in $0.1 \%$ to $7.0 \%$ of the population. Almost any food can cause allergic symptoms. Any food can contain an allergen that results in anaphylaxis. The most common offenders are seafood (lobster, shrimp, crab, clams, fish), legumes (peanuts, tree nuts, peas, beans, licorice), seeds (sesame, cottonseed, caraway, mustard, flaxseed, and sunflower seeds), nuts, berries, egg white, buckwheat, milk, and chocolate (Parslow et al., 2001). Peanut and tree nut (ie, cashew, walnut) allergies are responsible for most severe food allergy reactions (Sicherer, Munoz-Furlong, Burks et al., 1999).

One of the dangers of food allergens is that they may be hidden in other foods and not apparent to those susceptible to the allergen. For example, peanuts and peanut butter are often used in salad dressings and Asian, African, and Mexican cooking and may result in severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Previous contamination of equipment with allergens (ie, peanuts) during preparation of another food product (ie, chocolate cake) is enough to produce anaphylaxis in those with severe allergy.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical symptoms are classic allergic symptoms (urticaria, atopic dermatitis, wheezing, cough, laryngeal edema, angioedema) and gastrointestinal symptoms (itching; swelling of lips, tongue, and palate; abdominal pain; nausea; cramps; vomiting; and diarrhea).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A careful diagnostic workup is required in any patient with a suspected food hypersensitivity. Included are a detailed allergy history, a physical examination, and pertinent diagnostic tests. When testing for allergy, skin testing is used to identify the source of symptoms and is useful in identifying specific foods as causative agents.

\section*{Medical Management}

Therapy for food hypersensitivity includes elimination of the food responsible for the hypersensitivity (Chart 53-6). Pharmacologic therapy is necessary in patients who cannot avoid exposure to offending foods or patients with multiple food sensitivities not responsive to elimination measures. Medication therapy involves the use of $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ - and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-blockers, antihistamines, adrenergic agents, corticosteroids, and cromolyn sodium.

Many food allergies disappear with time, particularly in children. About one third of proven allergies disappear in 1 to 2 years if the patient carefully avoids the offending food.

\section*{Nursing Management}

In addition to participating in management of the allergic reaction, the nurse focuses on preventing future exposure of the patient to the food allergen. If a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to food allergens has occurred, the nurse must instruct the patient and family about strategies to prevent its recurrence. The patient is instructed about the importance of carefully assessing food prepared by others for obvious as well as hidden sources of food allergens and of avoiding locations and facilities where those allergens are likely to be present. The patient and family must be knowledgeable about early signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and must be proficient in emergency administration of epinephrine if a reaction occurs. The nurse also advises the patient to wear a medical alert bracelet or to carry identification and emergency equipment at all times.

\section*{SERUM SICKNESS}

The illness known as serum sickness is an example of an immune complex type III hypersensitivity. It has traditionally resulted from the administration of therapeutic antisera of animal sources for the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases, such as tetanus, pneumonia, rabies, diphtheria, botulism, and venomous snake and black widow spider bites. With the advent of human antitetanus serum and antibiotics, classic serum sickness is much less common now. However, various medications (primarily penicillin) may cause a serum sickness-like reaction similar to that caused by foreign sera.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms are due to a reaction and immunologic attack on the serum or medication. Antibodies appear to be of the IgE and IgM classes. Early manifestations, beginning 6 to 10 days after the administration of the medication, include an inflammatory reaction at the site of injection of the medication, followed by regional and generalized lymphadenopathy. There is usually a skin rash, which may be urticarial or purpuric. Joints are frequently tender and swollen. Vasculitis may occur in any organ but is most commonly observed in the kidney, resulting in proteinuria and, occasionally, casts in the urine. There may be mild to severe cardiac involvement. Peripheral neuritis may cause temporary paralysis of the upper extremities or may be widespread, causing Guillain-Barré syndrome.

\section*{Medical Management}

The usual course lasts for several days to a few weeks if untreated, but the patient responds promptly and completely if treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Aggressive therapy, including ventilator support, may be necessary if peripheral neuritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome occur.

\section*{Nursing Management}

See Chapter 64 for nursing management of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

\section*{LATEX ALLERGY}

Latex allergy, the allergic reaction to natural rubber proteins, has been implicated in rhinitis, conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, urticaria, asthma, and anaphylaxis. Latex allergy and hypersensitivity were first reported in 1927 (Parslow et al., 2001). Although the prevalence of latex allergy is unknown, since 1989 the number of cases of latex allergy has steadily increased (Parslow et al., 2001). This increase may be due to the widespread use of latex gloves with implementation of universal and now standard precautions in response to the AIDS epidemic, changes in the manufacturing of gloves to speed the process to meet the increased demand for gloves, and greater awareness about latex allergy and its signs and symptoms.

Natural rubber latex is derived from the sap of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). The conversion of the liquid rubber latex into a finished product entails the addition of more than 200 chemicals. The proteins in the natural rubber latex (Hevea proteins) or the various chemicals that are used in the manufacturing process are thought to be the source of the allergic reactions. Not all objects composed of latex have the same ability to stimulate an allergic response. For example, the antigenicity of latex gloves can differ widely depending on their manufacturing method.

Populations at risk include health care workers, patients with atopic allergies or multiple surgeries, people working in factories manufacturing latex products, females, and patients with spina bifida. Because more food handlers, hairdressers, auto mechanics, and police are now wearing latex gloves, they may also be at risk for latex allergy. It is estimated that $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ of the general population has an allergy to latex and that $10 \%$ to $17 \%$ of health care workers are sensitized. Patients are at risk for anaphylactic reactions due to contact with latex during medical treatments, especially surgical procedures. About $19 \%$ of anaphylactic reactions associated with anesthesia are caused by allergy to latex (Brehler \& Kütting, 2001).

Food that has been handled by individuals wearing latex gloves may stimulate an allergic response. Cross-reactions have been reported in people who are allergic to certain food products, such as kiwis, bananas, pineapples, passion fruits, avocados, and chestnuts.

Routes of exposure to latex products can be cutaneous, percutaneous, mucosal, parenteral, and aerosol. The most frequent source of exposure is cutaneous, which usually involves the wearing of natural latex gloves. The powder used to facilitate putting on latex gloves can become a carrier of latex proteins from the gloves; when the gloves are put on or removed, the particles become airborne and can be inhaled or can settle on skin, mucous membranes, or clothing. Mucosal exposure can occur from the use of latex condoms, catheters, airways, and nipples. Parenteral exposure can occur from intravenous lines or hemodialysis equipment. In addition to latex-derived medical devices, many household items also contain latex. Examples of medical and household items containing latex and a list of alternative products are found in Table 53-5. It is estimated that over 40,000 medical devices and nonmedical products contain latex (Brehler \& Kütting, 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Several different types of reactions to latex are possible. Irritant contact dermatitis, a nonimmunologic response, may be due to mechanical skin irritation or an alkaline pH associated with latex gloves. Common symptoms of irritant dermatitis include erythema and pruritus. These symptoms can be eliminated by changing glove brands or using powder-free gloves. Use of hand lotion before donning latex gloves may worsen the symptoms because lotions may leach latex proteins from the gloves, increasing skin exposure and the risk of developing true allergic reactions (Burt, 1998).

Delayed hypersensitivity to latex, a type IV allergic reaction mediated by T cells in the immune system, is localized to the area of exposure and is characterized by symptoms of contact dermatitis, including vesicular skin lesions, papules, pruritus, edema, erythema, and crusting and thickening of the skin. These symptoms usually appear on the back of the hands. This reaction is thought to be due to chemicals that are used for manufacturing latex products. It is the most common allergic reaction to latex. Although not usually life-threatening, delayed hypersensitivity

\section*{Purpose}

In recent years, a variety of non-latex gloves have been used in health care in response to the increasing incidence of allergic reactions to latex, which has occurred with the increased use of gloves to protect health care personnel from exposure to body fluids. However, little research data about the barrier quality of these new synthetic gloves are available. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of glove stress, type of material, and manufacturer on the barrier effectiveness of medical examination gloves.

\section*{Study Design and Sample}

The sample consisted of 5,510 medical examination gloves: 1,464 nitrile, 1,052 latex, 1,006 copolymer, and 1,988 vinyl gloves. Eleven brands of gloves from five manufacturers were tested for barrier effectiveness. The gloves were divided into two groups: stressed and unstressed. Unstressed gloves were tested by the FDA 1989 water-leak test in which the gloves were filled with $1,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ of water, hung for 2 minutes, and observed for leaks. The gloves were rated as ineffective barriers if a water leak was detected. The remaining gloves were subjected to a laboratory and clinical stress protocol that mimics the stresses on gloves that occur during clinical use. Visible water leaks or leakage on the FDA water-leak test indicated barrier ineffectiveness. Chi-square analyses were used to test the differences between the fre-
quencies of failure across glove material, manufacturer, and the stressed vs. nonstressed conditions.

\section*{Findings}

Nitrile gloves had the lowest rate of failure, followed by latex gloves. Copolymer and vinyl gloves had the highest rates of failure. The failure rates were significantly different ( $p<0.001$ ). Subjecting gloves to the stress protocol increased the failure rate significantly ( $p<0.002$ ). Failure rates were also significantly different by glove manufacturer ( $p<0.001$ ). The data demonstrated that glove material, manufacturer, and stress are important factors that influence the barrier effectiveness of medical examination gloves.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The research findings suggest that nitrile medical examination gloves are an acceptable alternative to latex gloves and that vinyl and copolymer gloves provide less protection to the wearer. These findings suggest the need for health care providers and facilities to use care in selecting the type and manufacturer of gloves to protect the wearer during patient care. The researchers indicated that studies using larger samples are warranted and should address other variables that may affect the barrier effectiveness of gloves during use, including duration of use, presence of powder, glove size, hand dominance, complexity of tasks performed while wearing gloves, and the use of instruments.
reactions often require major changes in the patient's home and work environment to avoid further exposure.

Immediate hypersensitivity, a type I allergic reaction, is mediated by the IgE mast cell system. Symptoms can include rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis. The term "latex allergy" is usually used to describe the type I reaction. Clinical manifestations have a rapid onset and can include urticaria, wheezing, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angioedema, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.

Localized itching, erythema, or local urticaria within minutes after exposure to latex are often the initial symptoms. Symptoms of subsequent reactions can include generalized urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and anaphylactic shock minutes after dermal or mucosal exposure to latex. An increasing number of individuals allergic to latex experience severe reactions characterized by generalized urticaria, bronchospasm, and hypotension (Brehler \& Kütting, 2001).

\section*{Diagnostic Testing}

The diagnosis of latex allergy is based on the history and diagnostic test results (Parslow et al., 2001). Sensitization is detected by skin testing, RAST, or ELISA. Skin tests have been unreliable because of variability in the techniques used; however, a new standardized skin testing reagent is expected to be available in the near future. Skin tests should be done only by clinicians who have expertise in their administration and interpretation and who have the necessary equipment available to treat local or systemic allergic reactions to the reagent (Hamilton \& Adkinson, 1998). Nasal challenge and dipstick tests may be useful in the future as screening tests for latex allergy.

\section*{Medical Management}

The best treatment available for latex allergy is the avoidance of latex products, but this is often difficult because of the widespread use of latex-based products. Patients who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction to latex should be instructed to wear medical identification. Antihistamines and an emergency kit containing epinephrine should be provided to these patients, along with instructions about emergency management of latex allergy symptoms. Patients should be counseled to notify all health care workers as well as local paramedic and ambulance companies about their allergy. Warning labels can be attached to car windows to alert police and paramedics about the driver's or passenger's latex allergy in case of a motor vehicle crash. Individuals with latex allergy should be provided with a list of alternative products and referred to local support groups; they are also urged to carry their own supply of nonlatex gloves.

People with type I latex sensitivity may be unable to continue to work if a latex-free environment is not possible. This may occur with surgeons, dentists, operating room personnel, or intensive care nurses. Occupational implications for employees with type IV latex sensitivity are usually easier to manage by changing to nonlatex gloves and avoiding direct contact with latex-based medical equipment. Although latex-specific immunotherapy has been reported, this method of treatment remains experimental (Brehler \& Kütting, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse can assume a pivotal role in the management of both patients and staff with latex allergies. All patients should be asked about latex allergy, although special attention should be given to
those at particularly high risk (eg, patients with spina bifida, patients who have undergone multiple surgical procedures). Every time an invasive procedure must be performed, the nurse should consider the possibility of latex allergies. Nurses working in operating rooms, intensive care units, short procedure units, and emergency departments need to pay particular attention to latex allergy. See Chapter 19 for a latex allergy screening form.

Although the type I reaction is the most significant of the reactions to latex, care must be taken in the presence of irritant contact dermatitis and delayed hypersensitivity reaction to avoid further exposure of the individual to latex. Patients with latex allergy are advised to notify their health care providers and to wear a medical information bracelet. Patients must become knowledgeable about what products contain latex and what products are safe, nonlatex alternatives. They must also become knowledgeable about signs and symptoms of latex allergy and emergency treatment and self-injection of epinephrine in case of allergic reaction.

Nurses can be instrumental in establishing and participating in multidisciplinary committees to address latex allergy and to promote a latex-free environment. Latex allergy protocols and education of staff about latex allergy and precautions are important strategies to reduce this growing problem and to ensure assessment and prompt treatment of affected individuals.

\section*{New Approaches to Treatment of Allergic Diseases}

Although allergen-specific immunotherapy reduces symptoms for several years after it is discontinued, this approach to management is limited in terms of usefulness because of its potential adverse effects, particularly anaphylaxis, and the relatively crude allergen extracts involved. Newer approaches to the treatment of allergic diseases to overcome these limitations are being evaluated and include the use of substances such as naturally occurring isoforms of allergens from plants and trees. These isoforms are less likely to stimulate anaphylactic reactions. Use of recombinant allergens is expected to eliminate variation between batches of allergen. Other experimental approaches include the use of DNA vaccines and monoclonal antibodies and other strategies to block IgE or its synthesis (Kay, 2001b).

\section*{$?$ \\ Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 45 -year-old man arrives at the emergency department where you are employed. He states that he is severely allergic to bees and was stung by a wasp approximately 10 minutes ago. He tells you that he has been in anaphylactic shock in the past as a result of bee stings. He tells you that he received allergy injections for bee allergy approximately 10 years ago. Upon assessing the patient, you note that he has generalized hives and urticaria on his body, and he is complaining of his throat swelling. What would be your immediate course of action?
2. A patient with severe allergies is to receive instructions about self-administration of epinephrine if she experiences anaphylaxis. Develop a teaching plan for this patient and identify outcomes to measure the effectiveness of your
teaching. How would you modify your teaching if the patient reports a severe fear of injection? If the patient has a profound hearing loss? If the patient is visually impaired?
3. A 28-year-old man has a surgical procedure for a varicocele. A Penrose drain is inserted into his scrotum during the surgical procedure in the operating room. The patient develops erythema and significant edema of the scrotum inconsistent with the procedure that was performed. The circulating nurse had noted on the operative checklist that the patient was allergic to latex. What would be your immediate course of action? How could you ensure that a similar situation would not occur in the future? What course of action could you take to ensure a latexfree environment for patients who require such an environment?

\title{
Assessment and Management of Patients With Rheumatic Disorders
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Explain the processes of inflammation and degradation in the development of rheumatic diseases.
2. Describe the assessment and diagnostic findings that may be evidenced by patients with a suspected diagnosis of rheumatic disease.
3. Discuss appropriate nursing interventions based on nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems that commonly occur with rheumatic disorders.
4. Apply the nursing process as a framework for the care of the patient with a rheumatic disease, such as connective tissue disease or osteoarthritis.
5. Describe the systemic effects of a connective tissue disease.
6. Devise a teaching plan for the patient with newly diagnosed rheumatic disease.
7. Identify modifications in interventions to accommodate changes in patients' functional ability that may occur with disease progression.

Rheumatic diseases include common disorders such as osteoarthritis or rarer conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. These conditions can be life-threatening or minor illnesses. The problems caused by the rheumatic diseases include not only the obvious limitations in mobility and activities of daily living but also the subtler systemic effects that can lead to organ failure and death or result in problems such as pain, fatigue, altered self-image, and sleep disturbances. The rheumatic disease may be the patient's primary health problem or a secondary diagnosis. Thus, thorough understanding of rheumatic diseases and their effects on the patient's function and well-being is the key to developing an appropriate plan of care.

\section*{Rheumatic Diseases}

Commonly called arthritis (inflammation of a joint) and thought of as one condition, the rheumatic diseases are actually more than 100 different types of disorders that primarily affect skeletal muscles, bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and joints of males and females of all ages. Some disorders are more likely to occur at a particular time of life or to affect one gender more than the other. The onset of these conditions may be acute or insidious, with a course possibly marked by periods of remission (a period when disease symptoms are reduced or absent) and exacerbation (a period when symptoms occur or increase). Treatment can be simple, aimed at localized relief, or it can be complex, directed toward relieving systemic effects. Permanent changes may result from the disease.

There are several approaches to the classification of rheumatic diseases. One basic system is to classify disease as either monoarticular (affects a single joint) or polyarticular (affects multiple joints) and then to further classify it as either inflammatory or noninflammatory (Klippel, 2001). Conditions that may secondarily affect the musculoskeletal structure are also included, emphasizing the diversity of the rheumatic diseases.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Understanding the normal anatomy and physiology of the diarthrodial or synovial joints is key to understanding the pathophysiology of the rheumatic diseases. The function of the synovial joints is movement. Each synovial joint has a given range of motion, although range of motion of movable joints varies between individuals.

In a normal synovial joint, a smooth, nearly friction-free, resilient surface for movement is provided by articular cartilage,
which covers the bone end of the joint. Lining the inner surface of the fibrous capsule is the synovial membrane, which secretes fluid into the space between the bone ends. The synovial fluid functions as a shock absorber and a lubricant, allowing the joint to move freely.

The joint is the area most commonly affected by the inflammation and degeneration seen in rheumatic diseases. Despite the diversity of rheumatic diseases, from localized involvement of one joint to systemic, multisystem disorders, they all involve some degree of inflammation and degeneration, which may occur simultaneously. Inflammation is manifested in the joints as synovitis. In inflammatory rheumatic diseases, the primary process is inflammation as a result of the immune response. Degeneration occurs as a secondary process, resulting from the effect of pannus (proliferation of newly formed synovial tissue infiltrated with inflammatory cells). The inflammation is a result of altered immune function.

Conversely, in degenerative rheumatic diseases, inflammation occurs as a secondary process. This synovitis is usually milder, is more likely to be seen in advanced disease, and represents a reactive process. The synovitis is thought to result from mechanical irritation from cartilage matrix products.

\section*{INFLAMMATION}

Inflammation involves a series of related steps. With the triggering event, the antigen stimulus activates monocytes and T lymphocytes (also called T cells). Next, the immunoglobulin antibodies form immune complexes with antigens. Phagocytosis of the immune complexes is initiated, generating an inflammatory reaction (joint effusion, pain, and edema) (Fig. 54-1).

During the next step, the normal immune response deviates. Phagocytosis produces chemicals such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Leukotrienes contribute to the inflammatory process by attracting other white blood cells to the area. Prostaglandins act as modifiers to inflammation. In some cases, they increase inflammation; in other cases, they slow it down. Leukotrienes and prostaglandins produce enzymes such as collagenase that break down collagen, a vital part of a normal joint. The release of these enzymes in the joint causes edema, proliferation of synovial membrane and pannus formation, destruction of cartilage, and erosion of bone.

The immunologic inflammatory process begins when antigens are presented to T lymphocytes, leading to a proliferation of T and B cells. B cells are a source for antibody-forming cells, or plasma cells. In response to specific antigens, plasma cells produce and release antibodies. Antibodies combine with corresponding

antigens to form pairs, or immune complexes. The immune complexes build up and are deposited in synovial tissue or other organs in the body, triggering the inflammatory reaction that can ultimately damage the involved tissue.

The systemic nature of the rheumatic disease category known as the diffuse connective tissue diseases is reflected in the resultant widespread inflammatory process. Although focused in the joints, inflammation also involves other areas. The blood vessels (vasculitis and arteritis), lungs, heart, and kidneys may also be affected by the inflammation. In the joints, this inflammatory response is manifested as pannus extending throughout the joint space and, if persistent, eroding the articular cartilage, causing secondary degenerative changes to the joint.

\section*{DEGENERATION}

Although the cause for degeneration of the articular cartilage is poorly understood, the process is known to be metabolically active and therefore more accurately called "degradation." One theory of degradation is that genetic or hormonal influences, mechanical factors, or prior joint damage causes cartilage failure. Degradation of cartilage ensues and increased mechanical stress on bone ends causes stiffening of bone tissue. Another theory is that bone stiffening occurs and results in increased mechanical stress on cartilage, which in turn initiates the processes of degradation.

Articular cartilage plays two essential mechanical roles in joint physiology. First, the articular cartilage provides a remarkably smooth weight-bearing surface and, with synovial fluid, provides extremely low friction during movement. Second, the cartilage transmits load or pressure to the bone, dissipating the mechanical stress. Specific factors have been implicated in association with degenerative joint changes.

Mechanical Stress. Articular cartilage is highly resistant to wear under conditions of repeated movement. However, repetitive impact loading (velocity at which the force is applied) rapidly leads to joint failure at the cartilage level. When a person walks, three to four times the body weight is transmitted through the knee. A deep knee bend transmits up to nine times the body weight through the patellofemoral joint. As a joint undergoes repeated mechanical stress, the elasticity of the joint capsule, articular cartilage, and ligaments is reduced. The articular plate (subchondral bone) thins, and its ability to absorb shock decreases. The joint space narrows, accompanied by a loss of stability. When the articular plate disappears, bony spurs (osteophytes) form at the edges of the joint surfaces, and the capsule and synovial mem-
branes thicken. The joint cartilage degenerates and atrophies (shrinks), the bones harden and hypertrophy (thicken) at their articular surfaces, and the ligaments calcify. As a result, sterile joint effusions (fluid escaping from the blood vessels or lymphatics into the joint cavity) and secondary synovitis may be present (Fig. 54-2).

Altered Lubrication. In addition to the changes in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone, lubrication of the joint is also a factor in joint degeneration. With joint loading (forces carried through the joint), lubrication depends on a film of interstitial fluid squeezed out of the cartilage upon compression of the opposing surfaces of the joint. The mechanisms that normally operate under high weight loads to produce this lubricating film may be affected.

Immobility. Immobilization of a joint is another factor that can produce degenerative changes in articular cartilage. Although these changes are more marked and appear earlier in areas of contact, they also occur in areas not subject to mechanical compression. Cartilage degeneration due to joint immobility may result from loss of the pumping action of lubrication that occurs with joint movement. By 3 weeks after remobilization of the joint, the

\end{figure}
cartilage abnormalities are reversed. However, impact exercising (activities such as running) prevents reversal of the atrophy. Instead, slow, gradual range of motion is thought to be very important in preventing cartilage injury.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Pain is the symptom of a rheumatic disease that most commonly causes a person to seek medical attention. Other common symptoms include joint swelling, limited movement, stiffness, weakness, and fatigue.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment begins with a general health history, which includes the onset of symptoms and how they evolved, family history, past health history, and any other contributing factors. Because many of the rheumatic diseases are chronic conditions, the health history should also include information about the patient's perception of the problem, previous treatments and their effectiveness, the patient's support systems, and the patient's current knowledge base and the source of that information. A complete health history is followed by a complete physical assessment.

Assessment for rheumatic diseases combines the physical examination with a functional assessment. Inspection of the patient's general appearance occurs during initial contact. Gait, posture, and general musculoskeletal size and structure are observed. Gross deformities and abnormalities in movement are noted. The symmetry, size, and contour of other connective tissues, such as the skin and adipose tissue, are also noted and recorded. Chart 54-1 outlines the important areas for consideration during the physical assessment. The functional assessment is a combination of history (what the patient reports that he or she can and cannot do) and examination (observation of activities: the patient demonstrates what he or she can and cannot do, such as dressing and getting in and out of a chair). Observation also includes the adaptations and adjustments the patient may have made (sometimes without awareness); for example, with shoulder or elbow involvement, the individual may bend over to reach the fork to the mouth rather than raising the fork to the mouth.

The history and physical assessment data are supplemented by supportive or confirming diagnostic test findings. In some instances, tests are used to follow the course of the disease. For example, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) reflects inflammatory activity and indirectly the progression or remission of disease. The following tests are most commonly used for patients with rheumatic diseases.

\section*{ARTHROCENTESIS}

Arthrocentesis (needle aspiration of synovial fluid) may be performed not only to obtain a sample of synovial fluid for analysis but also to relieve pain caused by pressure of increased fluid volume, usually in the knee or shoulder. Synovial fluid is usually analyzed in cases such as suspected joint infection to determine the presence of inflammatory cells and to identify crystals in suspected gout or the presence of blood following trauma.

After the joint is anesthetized locally, a large-bore needle is inserted into the joint space to obtain a fluid specimen. Because this procedure has the potential for introducing bacteria into the joint, aseptic technique is essential. After the procedure, the patient is observed for signs of infection and hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint).

Normally, synovial fluid is clear, viscous, straw-colored, and scanty in volume, with few cells. In inflammatory joint disease, however, the fluid may become cloudy, milky, or dark yellow and may contain numerous inflammatory cells, such as leukocytes (white blood cells) and complement (a plasma protein associated with immunologic reactions). The viscosity is reduced in inflammatory disease, and copious amounts of fluid may be present. Arthrocentesis is diagnostically a valuable test, but arthrocentesis of small joints (ie, fingers or wrist) to obtain fluid may be difficult.

\section*{X-RAY STUDIES}

X-rays are often used in evaluating patients with rheumatic disease. The timing of the studies influences their usefulness: it is unlikely that a patient with a 2 -month history of joint inflammation will have demonstrable changes on an x-ray study, but someone with long-standing disease may show severe joint degeneration. X-rays can also be used to monitor disease activity and progression, demonstrating the loss of cartilage and narrowing of the joint space over time. In addition, x-rays can demonstrate cartilage abnormalities, joint erosions, abnormal bony growth, and osteopenia (decreased bone mineralization).

Arthrography. Arthrography is a diagnostic procedure used to detect connective tissue disorders. A radiopaque substance or air is injected into the joint cavity, especially the knee or shoulder, to outline the contour of the joint. The joint is then put through passive range of motion while several x-rays are obtained. The radiopaque substance is absorbed systemically, and joint swelling consequently subsides. After the procedure, the patient is observed for signs of infection and hemarthrosis.

\section*{BONE AND JOINT SCANS}

A bone scan reflects the degree to which the crystal lattice of bone takes up or absorbs a bone-seeking radioactive isotope. An area demonstrating increased uptake, such as a joint, is considered abnormal. A joint scan, the most sensitive study, allows determination of joint damage throughout the body. Because bone and joint scans are not the most cost-effective methods for detecting early disease, they are not done routinely at the time of diagnosis.

\section*{TISSUE BIOPSIES}

A muscle biopsy, carried out to examine skeletal muscle, is useful in diagnosing myositis. Following administration of local anesthesia under sterile conditions in an outpatient setting or in an operating room, a surgical incision is made to obtain the desired specimen, which is sent to the laboratory for microscopic analysis. A pressure dressing is applied, and the affected extremity is immobilized for 12 to 24 hours.

An arterial biopsy may be performed to examine a specimen of an arterial wall using a procedure similar to that for a muscle biopsy. Most frequently the temporal artery is selected, but other arteries may be used as indicated. Arterial biopsy most often confirms inflammation of the vessel wall, or arteritis, a type of vasculitis.

A skin biopsy may be performed to confirm inflammatory connective tissue diseases such as lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. A specimen may be lightly scraped from the skin without causing discomfort. Deeper skin biopsies may be needed when scraping is insufficient.

\section*{BLOOD TESTS}

In general, laboratory studies in rheumatology are based on the assumption that most rheumatic diseases are autoimmune disorders. Although many of the tests are highly complex and

technical, no single test used in isolation sufficiently supports a diagnosis of a rheumatic disease. Some of the most common blood studies are listed with their corresponding normal ranges and primary indications in Table 54-1. Because many of the tests require special laboratory techniques, they may not be used in every health care facility. The physician determines which tests are necessary based on the symptoms, stage of disease, and cost and likely benefit of the test.

\section*{IMPLICATIONS}

Diagnosis of a specific rheumatic disease may or may not be relatively simple and clear-cut. Commonly, observation of clinical signs and symptoms over time is needed to make the diagnosis. The combination of history, assessment, testing, and evolving manifestations of the disease may require explanation and interpretation to the patient with early disease. This is especially true for patients with multisystem rheumatic disease, such as one of the connective tissue diseases.

The presence of crystals or bacteria in the synovial fluid is specifically diagnostic for gout or infectious arthritis, respectively. Diagnosis, however, may be more presumptive in the case of the older person who is thought to have osteoarthrosis (OA) based on single joint involvement, supportive x-ray findings, and no evidence of other disease processes (Altman et al., 2000).

Many forms of rheumatic disease can be accurately diagnosed by the primary health care provider, but patients with more complicated signs and symptoms may need referral to a rheumatologist (a physician who specializes in diagnosing and treating rheumatic disease). Patients should know which type of rheumatic disease they have, not just that they have "arthritis" or "arthritis of the knee."

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Although people of all ages, from infancy through childhood, adolescence, and maturity, may be affected, rheumatic disease is commonly thought of by the patient, family, and society as a whole as an inevitable consequence of aging. Many older people expect and accept the immobility and self-care problems related to the rheumatic diseases and do not seek help, thinking that nothing can be done. Careful diagnosis and appropriate treatment can improve the quality of life for older people. However, the rheumatic diseases do have some special implications for the older adult.

In elderly patients, other medical conditions may take precedence over the rheumatic disease, which commonly becomes a secondary diagnosis and concern. Identifying the effects of the rheumatic disease on the patient's lifestyle, independence, and other chronic or acute conditions is important.

The frequency, pattern of onset, clinical features, severity, and effects on function of the rheumatic disease in elderly patients may be different in very elderly patients. Some of the rheumatic diseases, such as OA, are more prevalent with aging (Altman et al., $2000)$. One disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, is exclusive to the elderly (Gonzalez-Gay et al., 1999), whereas some disorders may be less severe for elderly people than for younger patients. However, OA, the most prevalent activity-limiting condition among elderly people, may account for more total disability among elderly patients than many diseases, such as stroke or cancer, that are considered more serious.

In some instances, the age of the patient and coexisting health problems may make diagnosis difficult. A missed diagnosis is not unusual because of the assumption that most older people with joint problems have OA . In addition, it may be difficult to differentiate problems associated with aging from those caused by a
rheumatic disease. For example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that begins in the later years has been shown to differ prognostically and therapeutically from RA that begins in childhood or early adulthood. In the elderly patient with initial RA, the onset is more likely to be abrupt, but the clinical course does not appear to differ from that of RA with an insidious onset. Moreover, patients with elderly-onset RA are less likely to have subcutaneous nodules or rheumatoid factor at disease onset (Ruddy et al., 2001).

For the elderly person who has had a diffuse connective tissue disease, the risk for osteoporosis is increased. Pain, loss of mobility, diminished self-image, and increasing morbidity can result from progressive osteoporosis. Thus, diagnosis and treatment for osteoporosis should not be overlooked in this population. Exercise, postural assistance, analgesic agents, modification of activities of daily living, and psychological support can be useful.

Other conditions (eg, soft tissue problems such as bursitis) usually are not problematic by themselves. When combined with other health problems and the normal physiologic processes of aging, however, these conditions may significantly reduce the patient's quality of life. In fact, the effects of most forms of rheumatic disease may lead to considerable changes in the individual's lifestyle, possibly threatening his or her independence. Decreased vision and altered balance, often present in elderly people, may be problematic if rheumatic disease in the lower extremities affects locomotion. Also, the combination of poor hearing, diminished vision, memory loss, and depression contributes to nonadherence to the treatment regimen in elderly patients. Special techniques for promoting patient safety, self-management, and strategies such as memory aids for medications may be necessary.

Partly because of the more frequent contact of the elderly with the health care system for a variety of health issues, overtreatment or inappropriate treatment is possible. Complaints of pain may be met with a prescription for an opioid analgesic rather than instructions for rest, use of an assistive device, and local comfort measures such as heat or cold. Acetaminophen may be appropriate and worth trying before using other medications that pose a greater chance of side effects. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections, with their usually rapid relief of symptoms, may be requested by the patient who is unaware of the consequences of too-frequent use. In addition to these factors, exercise programs may not be instituted or may be ineffective because the patient expects results to occur quickly or fails to appreciate the effectiveness of a program of exercise.

Pharmacologic treatment of rheumatic disease in older patients is more difficult than it is in younger patients. If the medications used have an effect on the senses (hearing, cognition), this effect is intensified in the elderly. The cumulative effect of medications is accentuated because of the physiologic changes of aging. For example, decreased renal function in the elderly alters the metabolism of certain medications, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Elderly patients are more prone to such side effects as gastroduodenal ulceration or bleeding, and they are more likely to use nonprescription remedies, to try many different medications (polypharmacy), and to be susceptible to unproven treatment methods (Michocki, 2001).

Elderly patients with rheumatic disease may accept or endure pain, loss of ambulation, and difficulty with activities of daily living unnecessarily. The need to view oneself as capable of managing life independently despite increasing age may take considerable energy. The body image and self-esteem of the elderly person with rheumatic disease, combined with underlying depression, may interfere with the use of assistive devices such as canes. Use of adaptive equipment such as long-handled reachers or tongs may be viewed as evidence of aging rather than as a means of increasing independence.

The elderly person usually has a lifelong pattern of dealing with the stresses of daily life. Depending on the success of that pattern, the elderly person can often maintain a positive attitude and self-esteem when faced with a rheumatic disease, especially when support is available. Previous stress management strategies are assessed. If these strategies have been effective, the patient is encouraged and supported in their use. If the strategies were ineffective, the nurse assists the patient in identifying alternative strategies, encourages use of new strategies, and assesses their effectiveness.

\section*{Medical Management}

A treatment program involving the interdisciplinary team, including the patient, is the basis for managing the rheumatic diseases. The chronic nature of most of these diseases mandates that the patient understand the disease, have the information necessary to make good self-management decisions, and be presented with a therapeutic program that is compatible with his or her lifestyle. Table 54-2 outlines the goals and strategies of basic rheumatic disease management.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Medications are used with the rheumatic diseases to manage symptoms, control inflammation, and in some instances to modify the disease. Useful medications include the salicylates, NSAIDs, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Table 54-3 reviews the medications often used.

Controlling the inflammation related to the disease process will help in managing pain, but this is often a delayed response. Nonopioid medications are often used for pain management, especially early in the treatment program, until other measures can be instituted (Burckhardt, 2001a). Short-term use of lowdose antidepressant medications, such as amitriptyline, may be prescribed to reestablish adequate sleep patterns and improve pain management (Wegner, 2001).

\section*{NONPHARMACOLOGIC PAIN MANAGEMENT}

Nonpharmacologic methods of pain management are important. Methods used include therapeutic heat or cold and devices such

\end{tabular}
as a cane or a wrist splint to protect and support the joint. A combination of methods may be required because different methods often work better at different times.

\section*{Exercise and Activity}

The ongoing nature of most rheumatic diseases makes it important to maintain and, when possible, improve joint mobility and overall functional status. The individualized exercise program is crucial to movement. Table 54-4 summarizes the exercises appropriate for patients with rheumatic diseases. Appropriate programs of exercise have been shown to decrease pain and improve function. A mild analgesic may be suggested prior to exercise for a patient starting a program of exercise. Acute or prolonged pain associated with exercise should be reported to a health care provider for evaluation (Minor \& Westby, 2001).

The major challenge for the patient and the health care provider is the need to adjust all aspects of treatment according to the activity of the disease. Especially for the patient with an active diffuse connective tissue disease, such as RA or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), activity levels may vary from day to day and even within the day itself.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A RHEUMATIC DISEASE}

\section*{Assessment}

The depth and focus of the nursing assessment depend on several factors: the health care setting (clinic or office, home, extended care facility, or hospital), the role of the nurse (home care nurse; nurse practitioner; hospital, clinic, or office nurse), and the needs of the patient. The nurse is often the first of the health care team members to come in contact with the patient. This enables the nurse to assess the patient's perceptions of the disorder and situation, actions taken to relieve symptoms, plans for treatment, and expectations. The nurse's assessment may lead to identifying issues and concerns that can be addressed by nursing interventions and, through collaboration with other team members, to achieving the expected patient outcomes.

The health history and physical assessment focus on current and past symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, pain, stiffness, fever, or anorexia, and the effects of these symptoms on the patient's lifestyle and self-image. Because the rheumatic diseases affect many body systems, the history and physical assessment include a review and examination of all systems, with particular attention given to those areas most commonly affected, including the musculoskeletal system (see Chart 54-1).

The patient's psychological and mental status and social support systems are also assessed, as is his or her ability to participate in daily activities, comply with the treatment regimen, and manage self-care. The information obtained can give insight into the patient's understanding of the medication regimen and may reveal misuse of medications, noncompliance, or use of potentially harmful unproven remedies. Additional areas assessed include the patient's understanding, motivation, knowledge, coping abilities, past experiences, preconceptions, and fears. The effects of the disease on the patient's self-concept and coping abilities are also assessed. The patient's perception of the condition and its impact influences the decisions, choices, and actions associated with treatment recommendations.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Although many nursing diagnoses are appropriate for the patient with a rheumatic disease, a few of the most common include the following:
- Acute and chronic pain related to inflammation and increased disease activity, tissue damage, fatigue, or lowered tolerance level

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Table 54-4 - Suggested Exercises to Promote Mobility} \\
\hline INFLAMMATORY PROCESS (PAIN) & RECOMMENDED EXERCISE & PATIENT PERFORMANCE LEVEL \\
\hline Acute exacerbation; severe pain & Passive range of motion (ROM) & Unable to perform exercises alone \\
\hline Subacute; moderate or minimal pain & Active assistive or active ROM within pain tolerance & Can perform with help from another person or an assistive mechanical device \\
\hline Inactive; remission; minimal pain or absence of pain & Active ROM: isometrics & Can perform alone \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- Fatigue related to increased disease activity, pain, inadequate sleep/rest, deconditioning, inadequate nutrition, emotional stress/depression
- Disturbed sleep pattern related to pain, depression, and medications
- Impaired physical mobility related to decreased range of motion, muscle weakness, pain on movement, limited endurance, lack of or improper use of ambulatory devices
- Self-care deficits related to contractures, fatigue, or loss of motion
- Disturbed body image related to physical and psychological changes and dependency imposed by chronic illness
- Ineffective coping related to actual or perceived lifestyle or role changes

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Adverse effects of medications

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of pain and discomfort, relief of fatigue, increased mobility, maintenance of self-care, improved body image, effective coping, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

An understanding of the underlying disease process (ie, degeneration or inflammation, including degeneration resulting from inflammation or vice versa) guides the nurse's critical thinking processes. In addition, knowledge about whether the condition is localized or more widely systemic influences the scope of the nursing activity.

Some rheumatic diseases (eg, OA) are more localized alterations in which control of symptoms such as pain or stiffness is possible. Others (eg, gout) have a known cause and specific treatment to control the symptoms. The diseases that usually present the greatest challenge are those with systemic manifestations, such as the diffuse connective tissue diseases. The Plan of Nursing Care details the nursing interventions to be considered for each nursing diagnosis.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Medications are used on a short-term basis to relieve acute pain. Because the pain may be persistent, nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen are often used. After administering medications, the nurse needs to reassess pain levels at intervals. With persistent pain, assessment findings should be compared with baseline measurements and evaluations. Additional measures include exploring coping skills and strategies that have worked in the past.

The patient needs to understand the importance of taking medications, such as NSAIDs and disease-modifying agents, exactly as prescribed to achieve maximum benefits. These benefits include relief of pain and anti-inflammatory action as the disease is brought under control. Because disease control and pain relief are delayed, the patient may mistakenly believe the medication is ineffective or may think of the medication as merely "pain pills," taking them only sporadically and failing to achieve control over the disease activity. Alternately, the patient may not understand the need to continue the medication for its anti-inflammatory actions once pain control has been achieved.

A weight reduction program may be recommended to relieve stress on painful joints. Heat applications are also helpful in relieving pain, stiffness, and muscle spasm. Superficial heat may be applied in the form of warm tub baths or showers and warm moist compresses. Paraffin baths (dips), which offer concentrated heat, are helpful to patients with wrist and small-joint involvement. Maximum benefit is achieved within 20 minutes of application. More frequent use for shorter lengths of time is most beneficial. Therapeutic exercises can be carried out more comfortably and effectively after heat has been applied.

In some patients, however, heat may actually increase pain, muscle spasm, and synovial fluid volume. If the inflammatory process is acute, cold applications in the form of moist packs or an ice bag may be tried. Both heat and cold are analgesic to nerve pain receptors and can relax muscle spasms. Safe use of heat and cold must be evaluated and taught, particularly to patients with impaired sensation.

The use of braces, splints, and assistive devices for ambulation, such as canes, crutches, and walkers, eases pain by limiting movement or stress from weight bearing on painful joints. Acutely inflamed joints can be rested by applying splints to limit motion. Splints also support the joint to relieve spasm. Canes and crutches can relieve stress from inflamed and painful weight-bearing joints while promoting safe ambulation. Cervical collars may be used to support the weight of the head and limit cervical motion. A metatarsal bar or special pads may be put into shoes if foot pain or deformity is present.

Other strategies for decreasing pain include muscle relaxation techniques, imagery, self-hypnosis, and distraction.

\section*{DECREASING FATIGUE}

Fatigue related to rheumatic disease can be both acute (brief and relieved by rest or sleep) and chronic. Chronic fatigue, related to the disease process, is persistent, cumulative, and not eliminated by rest but is influenced by biologic, psychological, social, and personal factors.

Disease-related factors that may influence the amount and severity of fatigue include persistent pain, sleep disturbance, impaired physical activity, and disease duration. Pain increases fatigue by requiring additional physical and emotional energy to deal with it. It may also cause the patient to expend more energy to do tasks in a way that causes less pain. Pain may also interfere with sleep, thereby increasing the fatigue level (Aaronson et al., 1999; Wolfe \& Skevington, 2000).

Efforts are aimed at modifying and reducing the fatigue. Energy may be regained by using rest periods. The patient's needs determine the type and amount of rest needed. Naps or nighttime sleep can provide systemic rest. Splints can provide articular rest by limiting motion and stress on the joints. Relaxation techniques can provide emotional rest. Inactivity may lead to deconditioning and fatigue, so measures to build endurance should be instituted. Conditioning exercise, such as walking, swimming, or biking, requires gradual progression of activity and monitoring of disease activity.

Psychosocial factors with an effect on fatigue include depression, learned helplessness, and perceived social support (Belza, 2001; Parker et al., 2001). These factors affect the patient's perception and evaluation of the fatigue. Improvement of functional status can improve mood. The patient is taught strategies to conserve energy, such as planning and grouping activities to minimize the number of times the patient needs to climb the stairs each day and sitting down to prepare meals.

\section*{PROMOTING RESTORATIVE SLEEP}

Restful sleep is important in helping the patient to cope with pain, minimize physical fatigue, and deal with the changes necessitated by a chronic disease. In patients with acute disease, sleep time is frequently reduced and fragmented by prolonged awakenings. Stiffness, depression, and medications may also compromise the quality of sleep and increase daytime fatigue. A sleep-inducing routine, medication, and comfort measures may help improve the quality of sleep.

\section*{INCREASING MOBILITY}

Proper body positioning is essential to minimize stress on inflamed joints and prevent deformities that limit mobility. All joints should be supported in a position of optimal function. When in bed, the patient should lie flat on a firm mattress, with feet positioned against a footboard and with only one pillow under the head because of the risk of dorsal kyphosis. A pillow should not be placed under the knees because this promotes flexion contracture. The patient should lie prone several times daily to prevent hip flexion contracture.

Active range-of-motion exercises are encouraged because they prevent joint stiffness. If the patient cannot actively exercise the joints, passive range of motion should be performed.

Measures to reinforce proper body posture and increase mobility include walking erect and using chairs with straight backs. When seated, the patient should rest the feet flat on the floor and the shoulders and hips against the back of the chair.

\section*{Expected Patient Outcomes}

Nursing Diagnosis: Impaired physical mobility related to decreased range of motion, muscle weakness, pain on movement, limited endurance, lack of or improper use of ambulatory devices
Goal: Attains and maintains optimal functional mobility
1. Encourage verbalization regarding limitations in mobility.
1. Mobility is not necessarily related to deformity. Pain, stiffness, and fatigue may temporarily limit mobility. The degree of mobility is not synonymous with the degree of independence. Decreased mobility may influence a person's selfconcept and lead to social isolation.
2. Therapeutic exercises, proper footwear,
2. Assess need for occupational or physical therapy consultation:
a. Emphasize range of motion of affected joints.
b. Promote use of assistive ambulatory devices.
c. Explain use of safe footwear.
d. Use individual appropriate positioning/posture.
3. Assist to identify environmental barriers.
4. Encourage independence in mobility and assist as needed.
a. Allow ample time for activity
b. Provide rest period after activity.
c. Reinforce principles of joint protection and work simplification.
5. Initiate referral to community health agency.
- Identifies factors that interfere with mobility
- Describes and uses measures to prevent loss of motion
- Identifies environmental (home, school, work, community) barriers to optimal mobility
- Uses appropriate techniques and/or assistive equipment to aid mobility
- Identifies community resources available to assist in managing decreased mobility and/or assistive equipment may improve mobility. Correct posture and positioning are necessary for maintaining optimal mobility.
5. The degree of mobility may be slow to improve or may not improve with intervention.

\section*{Furniture and architectural adaptations may enhance mobility. \\ 4. Changes in mobility may lead to a decrease in personal safety.}

Nursing Diagnosis: Self-care deficits related to contractures, fatigue, or loss of motion

\section*{Goal: Achieves self-care independently or with the use of resources}
1. Assist patient to identify self-care deficits and factors that interfere with ability to perform self-care activities.
2. Develop a plan based on the patient's perceptions and priorities on how to establish and achieve goals to meet selfcare needs, incorporating joint protection, energy conservation, and work simplification concepts.
a. Provide appropriate assistive devices.
b. Reinforce correct and safe use of assistive devices.
c. Allow patient to control timing of selfcare activities.
d. Explore with the patient different ways to perform difficult tasks or ways to enlist the help of someone else.
3. Consult with community health care agencies when individuals have attained a maximum level of self-care yet still have some deficits, especially regarding safety.
1. The ability to perform self-care activities is influenced by the disease activity and the accompanying pain, stiffness, fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of motion, and depression.
2. Assistive devices may enhance self-care abilities. Effective planning for changes must include the patient who must accept and adopt the plan.
- Identifies factors that interfere with the ability to perform self-care activities
- Identifies alternative methods for meeting self-care needs
- Uses alternative methods for meeting selfcare needs
- Identifies and uses other health care resources for meeting self-care needs

Care must be taken so that splinting for comfort does not restrict mobility later. The knee is splinted at full extension and the wrist at slight dorsiflexion. Because of the predominant strength of flexor muscles, the joints should not be permitted to "freeze" in positions of flexion. This can be prevented by regularly removing the splint and exercising the joint through a range of motion. Splint modification may be needed when changes occur in joint structure.

Additionally, assistive devices may be necessary for mobility. They should be properly fitted and the patient should be instructed in their correct and safe use. A cane, long enough to allow for only a slight bend of the elbow, should be held in the hand opposite the affected side. Forearm-trough style crutches (platform crutches) may be needed to protect the upper extremities if the disease also involves the hands and wrists. This is especially important for the patient undergoing rehabilitation after
lower extremity joint reconstructive surgery. Assistive devices can mean the difference between dependence and independence in mobility; however, they may also alter the patient's body image, which can become a barrier to compliance with treatment.

\section*{FACILITATING SELF-CARE}

Adaptive equipment may increase the patient's independence. When introducing adaptive equipment, however, the nurse should be sensitive to the patient's feelings by demonstrating acceptance and positive attitudes about using these devices. The nurse needs to keep in mind that a patient's deformity does not necessarily equate with the severity of limitations or disability. For example, swollen hands may be more limiting than deformed hands. The nurse in the hospital or in the extended care facility can help preserve the patient's independence in these settings by making available adaptive equipment for eating, toileting,
bathing, and dressing. In the home, the nurse can encourage use of these devices. Again, by relieving pain, stiffness, and fatigue, the nurse may increase the patient's ability to perform self-care (Luck, 2001).

\section*{IMPROVING BODY IMAGE AND COPING}

All aspects of the patient's life, including perception of self, work role, social life, sexual function, and financial status, may be altered because of the unpredictability and uncertainty of the course of a rheumatic disease. Body image changes may cause social isolation and depression. The nurse and the family need to empathize with the patient's emotional reactions to the disease. Communication should be encouraged so that the patient and family verbalize feelings, perceptions, and fears related to the disease. The nurse helps the patient and family identify areas in which they have some control over disease symptoms and treatment. The nurse also encourages commitment to the treatment program, which is a key to positive outcomes, as well as use of effective coping strategies.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Medications used for treating rheumatic diseases have the potential for serious and adverse effects. Thus, an important aspect of care is avoiding medication-induced complications. The physician bases the prescribed medication regimen on clinical findings and past medical history, then monitors for side effects with periodic clinical assessments and laboratory testing. The nurse has a major role in working with the physician and pharmacist to help the patient recognize and deal with side effects from medications. These side effects may include gastrointestinal bleeding or irritation, bone marrow suppression, kidney or liver toxicity, infection, mouth sores, rashes, and changes in vision. Other signs and symptoms include bruising, breathing problems, dizziness, jaundice, dark urine, black or bloody stools, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and headaches. Systemic and local infections, which can often be masked by high doses of corticosteroids, need close monitoring (see Table 54-3 for more information about administration considerations).

Patient instruction also includes teaching correct techniques of self-administration of medications, methods of reducing side effects, and measures to ensure regular monitoring. The nurse can be available for consultation between physician visits. If side
effects occur, the medication may need to be stopped or the dose reduced. The patient may experience an increase in symptoms while the complication is being resolved or a new medication is being initiated. In such cases, the nurse's counseling regarding symptom management may relieve potential anxiety and distress.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patient teaching is an essential aspect of nursing care of the patient with rheumatic disease to enable the patient to maintain as much independence as possible, to take medications accurately and safely, and to use adaptive devices correctly. Patient teaching focuses on the disorder itself, the possible changes related to the disorder, the therapeutic regimen prescribed to treat it, the side effects of medications, strategies to maintain independence and function, and patient safety in the home (Chart 54-2).

The patient and family are encouraged to verbalize their concerns and ask questions. Pain, fatigue, and depression can interfere with the patient's ability to learn and should be addressed before initiating teaching. Various educational strategies may then be used, depending on the patient's previous knowledge base, interest level, degree of comfort, social or cultural influences, and readiness to learn. The nurse instructs the patient about basic disease management and necessary adaptations in lifestyle. Because suppression of inflammation and autoimmune responses requires the use of anti-inflammatory, disease-modifying antirheumatic and immunosuppressive agents, the patient is taught about prescribed medications, including type, dosage, rationale, side effects, self-administration, and required monitoring procedures. If hospitalized, the patient is encouraged to practice new self-management skills with support from caregivers and significant others. The nurse then reinforces disease management skills during each patient contact. Barriers to compliance are assessed and measures are taken to promote adherence to medications and the treatment program.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Depending on the severity of the disorder and the patient's resources and supports, referral for home care may or may not be warranted. However, the patient who is elderly or frail, has a rheumatic disorder that limits function significantly, and lives alone may need a referral for home care.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-123.jpg?height=655&width=1783&top_left_y=1955&top_left_x=202)

The impact of rheumatic disease on everyday life is not always evident when the patient is seen in the hospital or an ambulatory care setting. The increased frequency with which nurses see patients in the home provides opportunities for recognizing problems and implementing interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of patients with rheumatic disorders. The patient encountered in the home setting often has a rheumatic disease that is secondary to the primary reason for the visit. In such cases, the problems caused by the rheumatic disease may interfere with the treatment of the primary condition. For example, the patient who is recovering from coronary artery surgery may have been instructed to exercise but is unable or only partially able to do so because of the rheumatic disease. Conversely, treatment of the primary condition may cause or increase problems related to the rheumatic disease. For example, the cardiac patient who has been instructed to walk long distances every day may find that doing so increases the symptoms of OA in the knees.

During home visits, the nurse has the opportunity to assess the home environment and its adequacy for patient safety and management of the disorder. Compliance with the treatment program can be more easily monitored in the home setting, where physical and social barriers to adherence are more readily identified. For example, the patient with diabetes who requires insulin may be unable to fill the syringe accurately or administer the insulin because of impaired joint mobility. Appropriate adaptive equipment needed for increased independence is often identified more readily when the nurse sees how the patient functions in the home. Any barriers to compliance can be identified and appropriate referrals made.

For patients at risk for impaired skin integrity, the home care nurse can closely monitor skin status and also instruct, provide, or supervise the patient and family in preventive skin care measures. The nurse also assesses the patient's need for assistance in the home and supervises home health aides, who may meet many of the needs of the patient with a rheumatic disease. Referrals to physical and occupational therapists may be made as problems are identified and limitations increase. A home care nurse can visit the home to make sure the patient can function as independently as possible despite mobility problems and can safely manage treatments and pharmacotherapy. The patient and family should be alerted to support services such as Meals on Wheels and local Arthritis Foundation chapters.

Because many of the medications to suppress inflammation are injectable, the nurse may administer the medication to the patient or teach self-injection procedure. These frequent contacts allow the nurse to reinforce other disease management techniques.

The nurse also assesses the patient's physical and psychological status, adequacy of symptom management, and adherence to the management plan. Previous teaching is reinforced with emphasis on side effects of medications and changes in physical status indicating disease progression and the need to contact the health care provider for reevaluation; otherwise, patients may wait until their next appointment. The importance of follow-up appointments is emphasized to the patient and family.

Patients with chronic disorders often neglect general health issues if they are focused on their chronic disorder; therefore, the patient and family should be reminded about the importance of participating in other health promotion activities and health screening (eg, immunizations, cholesterol screening, bone density testing, gynecologic examinations, mammography, colonoscopy).

\section*{Diffuse ConnectiveTissue Diseases}

Diffuse connective tissue disease refers to a group of disorders that are chronic in nature and characterized by diffuse inflammation and degeneration in the connective tissues. These disorders share similar clinical features and may affect some of the same organs. The characteristic clinical course is one of exacerbations and remissions. Although the diffuse connective tissue diseases have unknown causes, they are thought to be the result of immunologic abnormalities. They include RA, SLE, scleroderma, polymyositis, and polymyalgia rheumatica.

\section*{RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

RA is commonly used as the prototype for inflammatory arthritis. The incidence rate is approximately $3 \%$, with a two to three times greater incidence in women (Ruddy et al., 2001). In RA, the autoimmune reaction (Fig. 54-3) primarily occurs in the synovial tissue. Phagocytosis produces enzymes within the joint. The enzymes break down collagen, causing edema, proliferation of the synovial membrane, and ultimately pannus formation. Pannus destroys cartilage and erodes the bone. The consequence is loss of articular surfaces and joint motion. Muscle fibers undergo degenerative changes. Tendon and ligament elasticity and contractile power are lost.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations of RA vary, usually reflecting the stage and severity of the disease. Joint pain, swelling, warmth, erythema, and lack of function are classic. Palpation of the joints reveals spongy or boggy tissue. Often fluid can be aspirated from
the inflamed joint. Characteristically, the pattern of joint involvement begins with the small joints in the hands, wrists, and feet. As the disease progresses, the knees, shoulders, hips, elbows, ankles, cervical spine, and temporomandibular joints are involved. The onset of symptoms is usually acute. Symptoms are usually bilateral and symmetric. In addition to joint pain and swelling, another classic sign of RA is joint stiffness, especially in the morning, lasting for more than 30 minutes (Klippel, 2001).

In the early stages of disease, even before bony changes occur, limitation in function can occur when there is active inflammation in the joints. Joints that are hot, swollen, and painful are not easily moved. The patient tends to guard or protect these joints through immobilization. Immobilization for extended periods can lead to contractures, creating soft tissue deformity.

Deformities of the hands and feet are common in RA (Fig. 54-4). The deformity may be caused by misalignment resulting from swelling, progressive joint destruction, or the subluxation (partial dislocation) that occurs when a bone slips over another and eliminates the joint space.

RA is a systemic disease with multiple extra-articular features. Most common are fever, weight loss, fatigue, anemia, lymph node enlargement, and Raynaud's phenomenon (cold- and

stress-induced vasospasm causing episodes of digital blanching or cyanosis). Rheumatoid nodules may be noted in patients with more advanced RA and develop at some time in up to half of patients (Klippel, 2001). These nodules are usually nontender and movable in the subcutaneous tissue. They usually appear over bony prominences such as the elbow, are varied in size, and can disappear spontaneously. Nodules occur only in individuals who have rheumatoid factor. The nodules often are associated with rapidly progressive and destructive disease. Other extra-articular features include arteritis, neuropathy, scleritis, pericarditis, splenomegaly, and Sjögren's syndrome (dry eyes and dry mucous membranes).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Several factors can contribute to a diagnosis of RA: rheumatoid nodules, joint inflammation detected on palpation, and certain laboratory findings. The history and physical examination address manifestations such as bilateral and symmetric stiffness, tenderness, swelling, and temperature changes in the joints. The patient is also assessed for extra-articular changes; these often include weight loss, sensory changes, lymph node enlargement, and fatigue. Rheumatoid factor is present in more than $80 \%$ of patients with RA, but its presence alone is not diagnostic of RA. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is significantly elevated with RA. The red blood cell count and C4 complement component are decreased. C-reactive protein and antinuclear antibody test results may also be positive. Arthrocentesis shows synovial
fluid that is cloudy, milky, or dark yellow and contains numerous inflammatory components, such as leukocytes and complement.

X-ray studies, performed to help diagnose and monitor the progression of disease, show characteristic bony erosions and narrowed joint spaces occurring later in the disease.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{EARLY-STAGE RA}

In patients with early RA, treatment begins with education, a balance of rest and exercise, and referral to community agencies for support. Medical management begins with therapeutic doses of salicylates or NSAIDs. When used in full therapeutic dosages, these medications provide both anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Taking medications as prescribed to maintain a consistent blood level is necessary to optimize the effectiveness of the antiinflammatory medication.

Several COX-2 inhibitors, another class of NSAIDs, have been approved for treatment of RA. COX (cyclo-oxygenase) is an enzyme involved in the inflammatory process. COX-2 inhibitors block the enzyme involved in inflammation while leaving intact the enzyme involved in protecting the stomach lining. As a result, COX-2 inhibitors are less likely to cause gastric irritation and ulceration than other NSAIDs (Bombardier et al., 2000).

The trend in management is toward a more aggressive pharmacologic approach earlier in the disease. A window of opportunity for symptom control and improved disease management occurs within the first 2 years of disease onset. Therefore, the diseasemodifying antirheumatic agents (antimalarials, gold, penicillamine, or sulfasalazine) are initiated early in treatment. If symptoms appear to be aggressive (ie, early bony erosions as seen on x-rays), methotrexate may be considered. Methotrexate is currently the gold standard in the treatment of RA because of its success in improving disease parameters (ie, pain, tender and swollen joints, quality of life). The goals are to control symptoms and prevent destruction of the joints (Koopman, 2001).

An alternative treatment approach for RA has emerged in the area of biologic therapies. Biologic response modifiers are a group of agents that consist of molecules produced by cells of the immune system or by cells that participate in the inflammatory reactions (Koopman, 2001). Recent studies (Moreland et al., 1999; Weinblatt et al., 1999) using tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, both alone and in combination with other medications, have shown that patients demonstrate significant improvement based on American College of Rheumatology criteria (Felson et al., 1995). Two examples of biologic response modifiers that are currently available are enatercept (Enbrel) and infliximab (Remicade). These agents inhibit the function of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a key cytokine known to play a role in the disease process in RA (Miller, 2001). Research in this area is ongoing.

Additional analgesia may be prescribed for periods of extreme pain. Opioid analgesics are avoided because of the potential for continuing need for pain relief. Nonpharmacologic pain management techniques (eg, relaxation techniques, heat and cold applications) are taught.

\section*{MODERATE, EROSIVE RA}

For moderate, erosive RA, a formal program with occupational and physical therapy is prescribed to educate the patient about principles of joint protection, pacing activities, work simplification, range of motion, and muscle-strengthening exercises. The patient is encouraged to participate actively in the management program. The medication program is reevaluated periodically, and appropriate changes are made if indicated. Cyclosporine,
an immunomodulator, may be added to enhance the diseasemodifying effect of methotrexate.

\section*{PERSISTENT, EROSIVE RA}

For persistent, erosive RA, reconstructive surgery and corticosteroids are often used. Reconstructive surgery is indicated when pain cannot be relieved by conservative measures. Surgical procedures include synovectomy (excision of the synovial membrane), tenorrhaphy (suturing a tendon), arthrodesis (surgical fusion of the joint), and arthroplasty (surgical repair and replacement of the joint). Surgery is not performed during disease flares.

Systemic corticosteroids are used when the patient has unremitting inflammation and pain or needs a "bridging" medication while waiting for the slower disease-modifying antirheumatic agent (eg, methotrexate) to begin working. Low-dose corticosteroid therapy is prescribed for the shortest time necessary to minimize side effects. Joints that are severely inflamed and fail to respond promptly to the measures outlined previously may be treated by local injection of a corticosteroid (Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{ADVANCED, UNREMITTING RA}

For advanced, unremitting RA, immunosuppressive agents are prescribed because of their ability to affect the production of antibodies at the cellular level. These include high-dose methotrexate (Rheumatrex), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and azathioprine (Imuran). These medications, however, are highly toxic and can produce bone marrow suppression, anemia, gastrointestinal disturbances, and rashes.

Through all stages of RA, depression and sleep deprivation may require the short-term use of low-dose antidepressant medications, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft), to reestablish an adequate sleep pattern and to manage chronic pain better.

The FDA has approved a medical device for use in treating patients with more severe and longstanding cases of RA who have failed to respond to or are intolerant of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The device, a protein A Immunoadsorption column (Prosorba), is used in 12 weekly 2-hour apheresis treatments to bind IgG (ie, circulating immune complex). In this unique population of patients, a significant improvement using the American College of Rheumatology Criteria for Improvement has been demonstrated in several studies using the Prosorba column (Felson et al., 1999; Gendreau, 2001).

\section*{Nutrition Therapy}

Patients with RA frequently experience anorexia, weight loss, and anemia. A dietary history identifies usual eating habits and food preferences. Food selection should include the daily requirements from the basic food groups, with emphasis on foods high in vitamins, protein, and iron for tissue building and repair. For the extremely anorexic patient, small, frequent feedings with increased protein supplements may be prescribed. Some medications (ie, oral corticosteroids) used in RA treatment stimulate the appetite and, when combined with decreased activity, may lead to weight gain. Therefore, patients may need to be counseled about eating a healthy, calorie-restricted diet.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the patient with RA follows the basic plan of care presented earlier in the chapter. The most common issues for the patient with RA include pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue,
altered mood, and limited mobility. The patient with newly diagnosed RA needs information about the disease to make daily selfmanagement decisions and to cope with having a chronic disease.

Because of repeated contact with the patient, the nurse has the opportunity to assess and intervene in patient concerns and issues that occur with the diagnosis of a chronic illness such as RA. Because the disease commonly affects young women, major concerns may be related to the effects of the disease on childbearing potential, caring for family, or work responsibilities. The patient with a chronic illness may seek a "cure" or have questions about alternative therapies. Frequently, however, patients are hesitant to share their concerns with health care professionals (American College of Rheumatology, 1998).

\section*{SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS}

The overall prevalence of SLE is estimated to be 100 per 100,000 persons. It occurs 10 times more frequently in women than in men and approximately three times more frequently in the African-American population than in Caucasians (Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

SLE is a result of disturbed immune regulation that causes an exaggerated production of autoantibodies. This immunoregulatory disturbance is brought about by some combination of genetic, hormonal (as evidenced by the usual onset during the childbearing years), and environmental factors (sunlight, thermal burns). Certain medications, such as hydralazine (Apresoline), procainamide (Pronestyl), isoniazid (INH), chlorpromazine (Thorazine), and some antiseizure medications, have been implicated in chemical or drug-induced SLE.

In SLE, the increase in autoantibody production is thought to result from abnormal suppressor T-cell function, leading to immune complex deposition and tissue damage. Inflammation stimulates antigens, which in turn stimulate additional antibodies, and the cycle repeats.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The onset of SLE may be insidious or acute. For this reason, SLE may remain undiagnosed for many years. Clinical features of SLE involve multiple body systems.

\section*{SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS}

SLE is an autoimmune systemic disease that can affect any body system. Involvement of the musculoskeletal system, with arthralgias and arthritis (synovitis), is a common presenting feature of SLE. Joint swelling, tenderness, and pain on movement are also common. Frequently, these are accompanied by morning stiffness.

Several different types of skin manifestations may occur in patients with SLE, including subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which involves papulosquamous or annular polycyclic lesions, and discoid lupus erythematosus, which is a chronic rash that has erythematous papules or plaques and scaling and can cause scarring and pigmentation changes. The most familiar skin manifestation (but occurring in fewer than half of patients with SLE) is an acute cutaneous lesion consisting of a butterfly-shaped rash across the bridge of the nose and cheeks (Fig. 54-5). In some cases of discoid lupus erythematosus, only skin involvement may occur. In some SLE patients, the initial skin involvement may be

FIGURE 54-5 The characteristic butterfly rash of systemic lupus erythematosus.
the precursor to more systemic involvement. The lesions often worsen during exacerbations (flares) of the systemic disease and possibly are provoked by sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light. Oral ulcers, which may accompany skin lesions, may involve the buccal mucosa or the hard palate. The ulcers occur in crops and are often associated with exacerbations.

Pericarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation. Women who have SLE are also at risk for early atherosclerosis.

Serum creatinine levels and urinalysis are used in screening for renal involvement. Early detection allows for prompt treatment so that renal damage can be prevented. Renal involvement may lead to hypertension, which also requires careful monitoring and management.

Central nervous system involvement is widespread, encompassing the entire range of neurologic disease. The varied and frequent neuropsychiatric presentations of SLE are now widely recognized. These are generally demonstrated by subtle changes in behavior patterns or cognitive ability. Depression and psychosis are common (Klippel, 2001; Petri, 2000; Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis of SLE is based on a complete history, physical examination, and blood tests. In addition to the general assessment performed for any patient with a rheumatic disease, assessment for known or suspected SLE has special features. The skin is inspected for erythematous rashes. Cutaneous erythematous plaques with an adherent scale may be observed on the scalp, face, or neck. Areas of hyperpigmentation or depigmentation may be noted, depending on the phase and type of the disease. The patient should be questioned about skin changes (because these may be transitory) and specifically about sensitivity to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light. The scalp should be inspected for alopecia and the mouth and throat for ulcerations reflecting gastrointestinal involvement.

Cardiovascular assessment includes auscultation for pericardial friction rub, possibly associated with myocarditis and accompanying pleural effusions. The pleural effusions and infiltrations, which reflect respiratory insufficiency, are demonstrated by abnormal lung sounds. Papular, erythematous, and purpuric lesions developing on the fingertips, elbows, toes, and extensor surfaces of the forearms or lateral sides of the hand that may become necrotic suggest vascular involvement.

Joint swelling, tenderness, warmth, pain on movement, stiffness, and edema may be detected on physical examination. The joint involvement is often symmetric and similar to that found in RA.

Typically, assessment reveals classic symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and weight loss and possibly arthritis, pleurisy, and pericarditis. Interactions with the patient and family may provide further evidence of systemic involvement. The neurologic assessment is directed at identifying and describing any central nervous system changes. The patient and family members are asked about any behavioral changes, including manifestations of neuroses or psychosis. Signs of depression are noted, as are reports of seizures, chorea, or other central nervous system manifestations.

No single laboratory test confirms SLE; rather, blood testing reveals moderate to severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia and positive antinuclear antibodies. Other diagnostic immunologic tests support but do not confirm the diagnosis. Hematuria may be found on urinalysis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of SLE includes management of acute and chronic disease. Although SLE can be life-threatening, advances in its treatment have led to improved survival and reduced morbidity. Acute disease requires interventions directed at controlling increased disease activity or exacerbations that may involve any organ system. Disease activity is a composite of clinical and laboratory features that reflect active inflammation secondary to SLE. Management of the more chronic condition involves periodic monitoring and recognition of meaningful clinical changes requiring adjustments in therapy (Ruddy et al., 2001).

The goals of treatment include preventing progressive loss of organ function, reducing the likelihood of acute disease, minimizing disease-related disabilities, and preventing complications from therapy. Management of SLE involves regular monitoring to assess disease activity and therapeutic effectiveness.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Medication therapy for SLE is based on the concept that local tissue inflammation is mediated by exaggerated or heightened immune responses, which can vary widely in intensity and require different therapies at different times. The NSAIDs used for minor clinical manifestations are often used along with corticosteroids in an effort to minimize corticosteroid requirements.

Corticosteroids are the single most important medication available for treatment. They are used topically for cutaneous manifestations, in low oral doses for minor disease activity, and in high doses for major disease activity. Intravenous administration of corticosteroids is an alternative to traditional high-dose oral use. Antimalarial medications are effective for managing cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and mild systemic features of SLE. Immunosuppressive agents (alkylating agents and purine analogs) are used because of their effect on immune function. These medications are generally reserved for patients who have serious forms
of SLE and who have not responded to conservative therapies (Kimberly, 2001; National Institutes of Health, 1998; Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nursing care of the patient with SLE is based on the basic plan presented earlier in the chapter. The most common problems include fatigue, impaired skin integrity, body image disturbance, and lack of knowledge for self-management decisions. The disease or its treatment may produce dramatic changes in appearance and considerable distress for the patient. The changes and the unpredictable course of SLE necessitate expert assessment skills and nursing care and sensitivity to the psychological reactions of the patient. Patients may benefit from participation in support groups by receiving disease information, daily management tips, and social support. Because sun and ultraviolet light exposure can increase disease activity or cause an exacerbation, patients should be taught to avoid exposure or to protect themselves with sunscreen and clothing.

Because of the increased risk for involvement of multiple organ systems, patients should understand the need for routine periodic screenings as well as health promotion activities. A dietary consultation may be indicated to ensure that the patient is knowledgeable about dietary recommendations, given the increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. The nurse instructs the patient about the importance of continuing prescribed medications and addresses the changes and side effects that are likely with their use. The patient is reminded of the importance of monitoring because of the increased risk for systemic involvement, including renal and cardiovascular effects.

\section*{SCLERODERMA}

Scleroderma ("hard skin") is a relatively rare disease that is poorly understood; the cause is unknown. Its incidence is 18 to 20 persons per million per year (Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Like other diffuse connective tissue diseases, scleroderma (also known as systemic sclerosis) has a variable course with remissions and exacerbations. Its prognosis is not as optimistic as that of SLE. The disease commonly begins with skin involvement. Mononuclear cells cluster on the skin and stimulate lymphokines to stimulate procollagen. Insoluble collagen is formed and accumulates excessively in the tissues. Initially, the inflammatory response causes edema formation, with a resulting taut, smooth, and shiny skin appearance. The skin then undergoes fibrotic changes, leading to loss of elasticity and movement. Eventually, the tissue degenerates and becomes nonfunctional. This chain of events, from inflammation to degeneration, also occurs in blood vessels, major organs, and body systems (Klippel, 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Scleroderma starts insidiously with Raynaud's phenomenon and swelling in the hands. The skin and the subcutaneous tissues become increasingly hard and rigid and cannot be pinched up from the underlying structures. Wrinkles and lines are obliterated. The skin is dry because sweat secretion over the involved region is suppressed. The extremities stiffen and lose mobility. The condition
spreads slowly; for years, these changes may remain localized in the hands and the feet. The face appears masklike, immobile, and expressionless, and the mouth becomes rigid.

The changes within the body, although not visible directly, are vastly more important than the visible changes. The left ventricle of the heart is involved, resulting in heart failure. The esophagus hardens, interfering with swallowing. The lungs become scarred, impeding respiration. Digestive disturbances occur because of hardening (sclerosing) of the intestinal mucosa. Progressive renal failure may occur.

The patient may manifest a variety of symptoms referred to as the CREST syndrome. CREST stands for calcinosis (calcium deposits in the tissues), Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal hardening and dysfunctioning, sclerodactyly (scleroderma of the digits), and telangiectasis (capillary dilation that forms a vascular lesion).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Assessment focuses on the sclerotic changes in the skin, contractures in the fingers, and color changes or lesions in the fingertips. Assessment of systemic involvement requires a systems review with special attention to gastrointestinal, pulmonary, renal, and cardiac symptoms. Limitations in mobility and self-care activities should be assessed, along with the impact the disease has had (or will have) on body image.

There is no one conclusive test to diagnose scleroderma. A skin biopsy is performed to identify cellular changes specific to scleroderma. Pulmonary studies show ventilation-perfusion abnormalities. Echocardiography identifies pericardial effusion (often present with cardiac involvement). Esophageal studies demonstrate decreased motility in 75\% of patients with scleroderma. Blood tests may detect antinuclear antibodies, indicating a connective tissue disorder and possibly distinguishing the subgroup of scleroderma. A positive antinuclear antibody test result is common in patients with scleroderma.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of scleroderma depends on the clinical manifestations. All patients require counseling, during which realistic individual goals may be determined. Support measures include strategies to decrease pain and limit disability. A moderate exercise program is encouraged to prevent joint contractures. Patients are advised to avoid extreme temperatures and to use lotion to minimize skin dryness.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

No medication regimen has proved effective in modifying the disease process in scleroderma, but various medications are used to treat organ system involvement. Calcium channel blockers and other antihypertensive agents may provide improvement in symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon. Anti-inflammatory medications can be used to control arthralgia, stiffness, and general musculoskeletal discomfort (Klippel, 2001; Ramsey-Goldman, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nursing care of the patient with scleroderma is based on the basic plan of nursing care presented earlier in the chapter. The most common nursing diagnoses of the patient with scleroderma include impaired skin integrity; self-care deficits; imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements; and disturbed body image. The patient with advanced disease may also have problems with
impaired gas exchange, decreased cardiac output, impaired swallowing, and constipation.

Providing meticulous skin care and preventing the effects of Raynaud's phenomenon are major nursing challenges. Patient teaching must include the importance of avoiding cold and protecting the fingers with mittens in cold weather and when shopping in the frozen-food section of the grocery store. Warm socks and properly fitting shoes are helpful in preventing ulcers. Careful, frequent inspection for early ulcers is important. Smoking cessation is critical.

\section*{POLYMYOSITIS}

Polymyositis is one of a group of diseases termed idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. It is a rare condition with an incidence that is estimated to be from fewer than one to eight cases per million (Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Polymyositis is classified as autoimmune because autoantibodies are present. However, these antibodies do not cause damage to muscle cells, indicating only an indirect role in tissue damage. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, and a genetic predisposition is likely. Drug-induced disease is rare. Some evidence suggests a viral link.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The onset varies from sudden onset with rapid progression to a very slow, insidious onset. Proximal muscle weakness is typically a first symptom. Muscle weakness is usually symmetric and diffuse. Dermatomyositis, a related condition, is most commonly identified by an erythematous smooth or scaly lesion found over the joint surface.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A complete history and physical examination help to exclude other muscle-related disorders. As with other diffuse connective tissue disorders, no one test confirms polymyositis. An electromyogram is performed to rule out degenerative muscle disease. A muscle biopsy may reveal inflammatory infiltrate in the tissue. Serum studies indicate increased muscle enzyme activity.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management involves high-dose corticosteroid therapy initially, followed by a gradual dosage reduction over several months as muscle enzyme activity decreases. Patients who do not respond to corticosteroids require the addition of an immunosuppressive agent. For patients who are unresponsive to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications, plasmapheresis, lymphapheresis, and total-body irradiation have been used. Skin rashes may respond to the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Physical therapy is initiated slowly with range-of-motion exercises to maintain joint mobility, followed by gradual strengthening exercises (Klippel, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care is based on the basic plan of nursing care presented earlier in the chapter. The most frequent nursing diagnoses for the patient with polymyositis include impaired physical mobility,
fatigue, self-care deficit, and insufficient knowledge of selfmanagement techniques.

Patients with polymyositis may have symptoms similar to those of other inflammatory diseases. However, proximal muscle weakness is characteristic, making activities such as combing hair, reaching overhead, and using stairs difficult. Therefore, use of assistive devices may be recommended and referral to occupational or physical therapy may be warranted.

\section*{POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The underlying mechanism involved with polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown. This disease occurs predominately in Caucasians and often in first-degree relatives. An association with the genetic marker HLA-DR4 suggests a familial predisposition. Immunoglobulin deposits in the walls of inflamed temporal arteries also suggest an autoimmune process.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Polymyalgia rheumatica is characterized by severe proximal muscle discomfort with mild joint swelling. Severe aching in the neck, shoulder, and pelvic muscles is common. Stiffness is noticeable most often in the morning and after periods of inactivity. Systemic features include low-grade fever, weight loss, malaise, anorexia, and depression. Because polymyalgia rheumatica generally occurs in people 50 years of age and older, it may be confused with, or disregarded as, an inevitable consequence of aging.

Giant cell arteritis, sometimes associated with polymyalgia rheumatica, may cause headaches, changes in vision, and jaw claudication. These symptoms should be evaluated immediately because of the potential for a sudden and permanent loss of vision if untreated. Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis generally have a self-limited course, lasting several months to several years (Paget, 2001).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are found almost exclusively in people over 50 years of age. Giant cell arteritis has a reported incidence of 18 cases per 100,000, and polymyalgia rheumatica has an annual incidence rate of 52 cases per 100,000 over age 50 (Loeslie, 2000; Ruddy et al., 2001).

Assessment focuses on musculoskeletal tenderness, weakness, and decreased function. Careful attention should be directed toward assessing the head (for changes in vision, headaches, and jaw claudication).

Often diagnosis is difficult because of the lack of specificity of tests. A markedly high ESR is a screening test but is not definitive. Diagnosis is more likely to be made by eliminating other potential diagnoses, but this is highly dependent on the skills and experience of the diagnostician. The dramatic and immediate response to treatment with corticosteroids is considered by some to be diagnostic.

\section*{Medical Management}

Polymyalgia rheumatica (without giant cell arteritis) is treated with moderate doses of corticosteroids. NSAIDs are sometimes used for mild disease. For patients with giant cell arteritis, rapid initiation of and strict adherence to a regimen of corticosteroids are essential to avoid the complication of blindness.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nursing care of the patient with polymyalgia rheumatica is based on the basic plan of nursing care presented earlier in the chapter. The most common nursing diagnoses include pain and insufficient knowledge of the medication regimen.

A management concern is that the patient will take the prescribed medication, frequently corticosteroids, until symptoms improve and then discontinue the medication. The decision to discontinue the medication should be based on clinical and laboratory findings. Nursing implications are related to helping the patient prevent and monitor side effects from medications (eg, infections, diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal problems, and depression) and adjust to side effects that cannot be prevented (eg, increased appetite and altered body image).

NURSING ALERT The nurse must emphasize to the patient the need for continued adherence to the prescribed medication regimen to avoid complications of giant cell arteritis such as blindness.

The loss of bone mass with corticosteroid use increases the risk for osteoporosis in this already at-risk population. Interventions to promote bone health such as adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D , weight-bearing exercise, and smoking cessation, if indicated, should be emphasized (Buckley et al., 2001; Loeslie, 2000).

\section*{Degenerative Joint Disease (Osteoarthritis)}

OA, also known as degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis (even though inflammation may be present), is the most common and frequently disabling of the joint disorders. OA is both overdiagnosed and trivialized; it is frequently overtreated or undertreated. The functional impact of OA on quality of life, especially for elderly patients, is often ignored.

OA has been classified as primary (idiopathic), with no prior event or disease related to the OA, and secondary, resulting from previous joint injury or inflammatory disease. The distinction between primary and secondary OA is not always clear.

Increasing age directly relates to the degenerative process in the joint, as the ability of the articular cartilage to resist microfracture with repetitive low loads diminishes. OA often begins in the third decade of life and peaks between the fifth and sixth decades. By age 75 years, $85 \%$ of the population has either x-ray or clinical evidence of OA, but only $15 \%$ to $25 \%$ of these people experience significant symptoms (Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

OA may be thought of as the end result of many factors combining in a generalized predisposition to the disease. OA affects the articular cartilage, subchondral bone (the bony plate that supports the articular cartilage), and synovium. A combination of cartilage degradation, bone stiffening, and reactive inflammation of the synovium occurs. The basic degenerative process in the joint exemplified in OA is presented in Figure 54-6. Understanding of OA has been greatly expanded beyond what previously was thought of as simply "wear and tear" related to aging. Risk factors for OA are summarized in Chart 54-3.

Congenital and developmental disorders of the hip are well known for predisposing a person to OA of the hip. These include congenital subluxation-dislocation of the hip, acetabular dysplasia, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis.

\end{figure}

Obesity is now a well-recognized risk factor for the development of OA (USDHHS, 2001). Being overweight or obese also increases the pain and discomfort associated with the disease (Altman et al., 2000; Coggon et al., 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The primary clinical manifestations of OA are pain, stiffness, and functional impairment. The pain is due to an inflamed synovium, stretching of the joint capsule or ligaments, irritation of nerve endings in the periosteum over osteophytes, trabecular microfracture, intraosseous hypertension, bursitis, tendinitis, and muscle spasm. Stiffness, which is most commonly experienced in the morning or after awakening, usually lasts less than 30 minutes

\section*{Risk Factors for Osteoarthritis}
- Increased age
- Obesity
- Previous joint damage
- Repetitive use (occupational or recreational)
- Anatomic deformity
- Genetic susceptibility
and decreases with movement. Functional impairment is due to pain on movement and limited motion caused by structural changes in the joints.

Although OA occurs most often in weight-bearing joints (hips, knees, cervical and lumbar spine), the proximal and distal finger joints are also often involved. Characteristic bony nodes may be present; on inspection and palpation, these are usually painless, unless inflammation is present.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis of OA is complicated because only $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of patients with changes seen on x-rays report symptoms. Physical assessment of the musculoskeletal system reveals tender and enlarged joints. Inflammation, when present, is not the destructive type seen in the connective tissue diseases such as RA. OA is characterized by a progressive loss of the joint cartilage, which appears on x-ray as a narrowing of joint space. In addition, reactive changes occur at the joint margins and on the subchondral bone in the form of osteophytes (or spurs) as the cartilage attempts to regenerate. Neither the presence of osteophytes nor joint space narrowing alone is specific for OA ; however, when combined, these are sensitive and specific findings. In early or mild OA , there is only a weak correlation between joint pain and synovitis. Blood tests are not useful in the diagnosis of OA .

\section*{Medical Management}

Although no treatment halts the degenerative process, certain preventive measures can slow the progress if undertaken early enough. These include weight reduction, prevention of injuries, perinatal screening for congenital hip disease, and ergonomic modifications.

Conservative treatment measures include the use of heat, weight reduction, joint rest and avoidance of joint overuse, orthotic devices to support inflamed joints (splints, braces), isometric and postural exercises, and aerobic exercise. Occupational and physical therapy can help the patient adopt self-management strategies.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Pharmacologic management of OA is directed toward symptom management and pain control. Medications are used in conjunction with nonpharmacologic strategies, which are the mainstay of OA management (Altman et al., 2000). In most patients with OA, the initial analgesic therapy is acetaminophen. Some patients respond to the nonselective NSAIDs, and patients who are at increased risk for gastrointestinal complications, especially gastrointestinal bleeding, have been managed effectively with COX-2 inhibitors (Altman et al., 2000; Beehrle \& Evans, 1999; Bombardier et al., 2000; Pasero \& McCaffery, 2001; Ruddy et al., 2001). Selection of medication is based on the patient's needs, the stage of disease, and the risk for side effects. Other medications that may be considered are the opioids and intra-articular corticosteroids. Topical analgesics such as capsaicin and methylsalicylate are also recommended (Altman et al., 2000; Ruddy et al., 2001).

Newer therapeutic approaches include glucosamine and chondroitin, which are thought to improve tissue function and retard breakdown of cartilage (Altman et al., 2000; McAlindon et al., 2000). Viscosupplementation, the intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid, is thought to improve cartilage function and retard degradation; it may also have some anti-inflammatory effects (Huskisson \& Donnelly, 1999; Watterson \& Esdaile, 2000; Wright et al., 2000). Glucosamine and chondroitin and visco-
supplementation, although approved by the FDA, are still undergoing intensive investigation for safety and efficacy (Brandt et al., 2000).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In moderate to severe OA, when pain is severe or because of loss of function, surgical intervention may be used. Procedures most commonly used are osteotomy (to alter the force distribution in the joint) and arthroplasty. In arthroplasty, diseased joint components are replaced with artificial products (see Chap. 67).

Other procedures include viscosupplementation (the reconstitution of synovial fluid viscosity). Hyaluronic acid (Hyalgan, Synvisc), a glycosaminoglycan that acts as a lubricant and shockabsorbing fluid in the joint, may be used in this procedure. Hyaluronic acid stimulates the production of synoviocytes, possibly providing better and more prolonged pain control. A series of three to five weekly intra-articular injections are given. Pain relief may last for 6 months (Kellick et al., 1998).

Tidal irrigation (lavage) of the knee involves the introduction and then removal of a large volume of saline into the joint through cannulas. In some cases it provides pain relief for up to 6 months (Klippel, 2001; Lozada \& Altman, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nursing management of the patient with OA includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. The nonpharmacologic interventions are used first and continued with the addition of pharmacologic agents. Pain management and optimizing functional ability are major goals of nursing intervention. Patients' understanding of their disease process and symptom pattern is critical to a plan of care. Because patients with OA are older, they may have other health problems. Commonly they are overweight, and they may have a sedentary lifestyle. Weight loss and an increase in aerobic activity such as walking, with special attention to quadriceps strengthening, are important approaches to pain management (Altman et al., 2000; Bautch et al., 1997; Ettinger et al., 1997). A referral for physical therapy or to an exercise program for individuals with similar problems may be very helpful. Canes or other assistive devices for ambulation should be considered. Exercises such as walking should be begun in moderation and increased gradually. Patients should plan their daily exercise for a time when the pain is least severe or should plan to use an analgesic, if appropriate, before exercising. Adequate pain management is important for the success of an exercise program.

\section*{Spondyloarthropathies}

The spondyloarthropathies are another category of systemic inflammatory disorders of the skeleton. The spondyloarthropathies include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), and psoriatic arthritis. Spondyloarthritis is also associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as regional enteritis (Crohn's disease) and ulcerative colitis.

These rheumatic diseases share several clinical features. The inflammation tends to occur peripherally at the sites of attachmentat tendons, joint capsules, and ligaments. Periosteal inflammation may be present. Many patients have arthritis of the sacroiliac joints. Onset tends to occur during young adulthood, with the disease affecting men more often than women. There is a strong tendency for these conditions to occur in families. Frequently, the HLA-B27 genetic marker is found.

Baird, C. L. (2000). Living with hurting and difficulty doing: Older women with osteoarthritis. Clinical Excellence for Nurse Practitioners, 4(4), 231-237.

\section*{Purpose}

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common rheumatic disorder in older adults, presents a major challenge to individuals' independence. A greater understanding of patient experiences is necessary to develop appropriate needs-based interventions to help patients maintain independence. The purpose of this study was to develop an understanding of how OA affects individuals' lives and to provide data on which to base nursing interventions.

\section*{Study Sample And Design}

A qualitative research design was used. After informed written consent was obtained from eligible participants, semistructured interviews were conducted. The interviews were recorded for transcription and analysis. Data analyzed included the transcriptions of the interviews and the investigator's field notes of observations and impressions.

The sample comprised 18 women, 65 to 92 years of age, who reported having OA and who participated in an Area Council on Aging Center or were referred by other study participants. Data were continuously compared throughout data gathering and analysis. A process of deconstructing and reconstructing the data into several levels of categories was carried out.

\section*{Findings}

Subjects reported a continuous condition of "living with $\mathrm{OA}^{\text {" }}$ and "living with hurting." Hurting characterized the participants' experience because of its chronicity and the participants' persistent discomfort and pain. The hurting was reported as being prominent during activities such as walking, attending to personal care, and managing tasks for independent living. This finding resulted in a second category: "living with difficulty doing." The state of "living with difficulty doing" was characterized by being unable to carry out activities because of pain, stiffness, and instability. Personal care and completing household tasks became difficult and often impossible to accomplish.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings of this study demonstrate the need for health care providers to understand the problems associated with living with OA and to assess the impact of OA on activities of daily living. Further, the findings emphasize the need to help patients with OA to obtain pain relief and to develop alternative strategies to deal with pain and to accomplish tasks important to them. These strategies include helping patients to learn how to pace themselves and to use nonpharmacologic modalities along with pharmacologic therapies for pain relief.

\section*{ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS}

Ankylosing spondylitis affects the cartilaginous joints of the spine and surrounding tissues. Occasionally, the large synovial joints, such as hips, knees, or shoulders, may be involved. Ankylosing spondylitis is usually diagnosed in the second or third decade of life. The disease is not usually as severe in females as in males, in whom the disease is more prevalent and likely to include significant systemic involvement. Back pain is the characteristic feature. As the disease progresses, ankylosis of the entire spine may occur, leading to respiratory compromise and complications.

\section*{REACTIVE ARTHRITIS (REITER'S SYNDROME)}

This disease process is called reactive because the arthritis occurs following an infection. It affects young adult males and is characterized primarily by urethritis, arthritis, and conjunctivitis. Dermatitis and ulcerations of the mouth and penis may also be present. Low back pain is common.

\section*{PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS}

Psoriatic arthritis is characterized by synovitis, polyarthritis, and spondylitis. Both psoriasis and arthritis are common conditions, and one theory suggests that the overlap of the two conditions is a chance occurrence. However, epidemiologic data suggest that the prevalence of arthritis in patients with psoriasis is $7 \%$ to $42 \%$, exceeding the rate in the general population. Similarly, the prevalence of psoriasis in persons with arthritis is $2.6 \%$ to $7.0 \%$, compared with $0.1 \%$ to $2.8 \%$ in the general population, supporting the theory that these two processes occur together in a unique disease process (Ruddy et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management of Spondyloarthropathies}

Medical management of spondyloarthropathies focuses on treating pain and maintaining mobility by suppressing inflammation. For the patient with ankylosing spondylitis, good body positioning and posture are essential, so that if ankylosis (fixation) does occur, the patient is in the most functional position. Maintaining range of motion with a regular exercise and muscle-strengthening program is especially important.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Salicylates, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids often produce marked improvement in back, skin, and joint symptoms. Methotrexate is also used to control psoriasis as well as joint inflammation.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical management may include total hip replacement (see Chap. 67).

\section*{Nursing Management of Spondyloarthropathies}

Major nursing interventions in the spondyloarthropathies are related to symptom management and maintaining optimal functioning. This population is unique in rheumatology, because patients are primarily young men. Their major concerns are often related to prognosis and job modification, especially among those who perform physical work.

\section*{Metabolic and Endocrine Diseases Associated With Rheumatic Disorders}

Metabolic and endocrine diseases may be associated with rheumatic disorders. These include biochemical abnormalities (amyloidosis and scurvy), endocrine diseases (diabetes mellitus and acromegaly), immunodeficiency diseases (HIV infection, AIDS), and other hereditary disorders (hypermobility syndromes). The most common conditions, however, are the crystal-induced
arthropathies in which crystals, such as monosodium urate (gout) or calcium pyrophosphate (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate disease [CPPD] or pseudogout), are deposited within joints and other tissues.

\section*{GOUT}

Gout is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to a genetic defect of purine metabolism resulting in hyperuricemia. Oversecretion of uric acid or a renal defect resulting in decreased excretion of uric acid, or a combination of both, occurs. The prevalence of gout is reported to be 1.6 to 13.6 per thousand. The incidence increases with age and body mass index. It occurs more commonly in males than females (Ruddy et al., 2001).

In primary hyperuricemia, elevated serum urate levels or manifestations of urate deposition appear to be consequences of faulty uric acid metabolism. Primary hyperuricemia may be due to severe dieting or starvation, excessive intake of foods that are high in purines (shellfish, organ meats), or heredity. In secondary hyperuricemia, gout is a clinical feature secondary to any of a number of genetic or acquired processes, including conditions in which there is an increase in cell turnover (leukemia, multiple myeloma, some types of anemias, psoriasis) and an increase in cell breakdown. Altered renal tubular function, either as a major action or as an unintended side effect of certain pharmacologic agents (diuretics such as thiazides and furosemide), low-dose salicylates, and ethanol can contribute to uric acid underexcretion.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Hyperuricemia (serum concentration greater than $7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ [ $0.4 \mathrm{fmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ]) can but does not always cause monosodium urate crystal deposition. However, as uric acid levels rise, risk increases (Ruddy et al., 2001). Attacks of gout appear to be related to sudden increases or decreases of serum uric acid levels. When the urate crystals precipitate within a joint, an inflammatory response occurs and an attack of gout begins. With repeated attacks, accumulations of sodium urate crystals, called tophi, are deposited in peripheral areas of the body, such as the great toe, the hands, and the ear. Renal urate lithiasis (kidney stones) with chronic renal disease secondary to urate deposition may develop.

The finding of urate crystals in the synovial fluid of asymptomatic joints suggests that factors other than crystals may be related to the inflammatory reaction. Recovered monosodium urate crystals are coated with immunoglobulins that are mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgG enhances crystal phagocytosis, thereby demonstrating immunologic activity.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Manifestations of the gout syndrome include acute gouty arthritis (recurrent attacks of severe articular and periarticular inflammation), tophi (crystalline deposits accumulating in articular tissue, osseous tissue, soft tissue, and cartilage), gouty nephropathy (renal impairment), and uric acid urinary calculi. Four stages of gout can be identified: asymptomatic hyperuricemia, acute gouty arthritis, intercritical gout, and chronic tophaceous gout. The subsequent development of gout is directly related to the duration and magnitude of the hyperuricemia. Therefore, the commitment to lifelong pharmacologic treatment of hyperuricemia is deferred until there is an initial attack of gout.

For hyperuricemic people who are going to develop gout, acute arthritis is the most common early clinical manifestation. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe is the most commonly affected (75\% of patients). The tarsal area, ankle, or knee may also be affected. Less commonly, the wrists, fingers, and elbows may be affected. The acute attack may be triggered by trauma, alcohol ingestion, dieting, medications, surgical stress, or illness. The abrupt onset often occurs at night, awakening the patient with severe pain, redness, swelling, and warmth of the affected joint. Early attacks tend to subside spontaneously over 3 to 10 days even without treatment. The attack is followed by a symptom-free period (the intercritical stage) until the next attack, which may not come for months or years. With time, however, attacks tend to occur more frequently, involve more joints, and last longer.

Tophi are generally associated with more frequent and severe inflammatory episodes. Higher serum concentrations of uric acid are also associated with more extensive tophus formation. Tophi most commonly occur in the synovium, olecranon bursa, subchondral bone, infrapatellar and Achilles tendons, subcutaneous tissue on the extensor surface of the forearms, and overlying joints. They have also been found in the aortic walls, heart valves, nasal and ear cartilage, eyelids, cornea, and sclerae. Joint enlargement may cause a loss of joint motion. Uric acid deposits may cause renal stones and kidney damage.

\section*{Medical Management}

A definitive diagnosis of gouty arthritis is established by polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid of the involved joint. Uric acid crystals are seen within the polymorphonuclear leukocytes within the fluid. Colchicine (oral or parenteral) or an NSAID such as indomethacin is used to relieve an acute attack of gout. Management of hyperuricemia, tophi, joint destruction, and renal disorders is usually initiated after the acute inflammatory process has subsided. Uricosuric agents, such as probenecid, correct hyperuricemia and dissolve deposited urate. Allopurinol is also effective, but its use is limited because of the risk for toxicity. When reduction of the serum urate level is indicated, the uricosuric agents are the medications of choice. When the patient has, or is at risk for, renal insufficiency or renal calculi (kidney stones), allopurinol is the medication of choice. Corticosteroids may be used in resistant cases. If the individual experiences several acute episodes or there is evidence of tophi formation, prophylactic treatment is considered. Specific treatment is based on serum uric acid level, 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion, and renal function (Table 54-5).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Historically, gouty arthritis was thought to be a condition of the royalty and the very rich, with the disease attributed to "high living." This has not been shown to be entirely true. While severe dietary restriction is not necessary, patients should be encouraged to restrict consumption of foods high in purines, especially organ meats, and to limit alcohol intake. Maintenance of normal body weight should be encouraged. In an acute episode of gouty arthritis, pain management is essential. During the intercritical period, the patient feels well and may abandon preventive behaviors, which may result in an acute attack. Acute attacks are most effectively treated if therapy is begun early in the course.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Fibromyalgia}

Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome that involves chronic fatigue, generalized muscle aching, and stiffness. Two percent of the U.S. population, primarily women of childbearing age, are affected by this syndrome (American College of Rheumatology Fact Sheet, 2000). Although criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia have been established (Wolfe \& Skevington, 1990), controversy exists as to whether this diagnosis represents a unique syndrome. The cause is unknown and no pathologic characteristics have been identified that are specific for the condition. Treatment consists of attention to the specific symptoms reported by the patient. NSAIDs may be used to treat the diffuse muscle aching and stiffness. Tricyclic antidepressants are used to improve or restore normal sleep patterns, and individualized programs of exercise are used to decrease muscle weakness and discomfort and to improve the general deconditioning that occurs in these individuals (American College of Rheumatology Fact Sheet, 2000; Burckhardt, 2001b; Clark et al., 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Typically, patients with fibromyalgia have endured their symptoms for a long period of time. They may feel as if their symptoms have not been taken seriously. Nurses need to pay special attention to supporting these individuals and providing encouragement as they begin their program of therapy. Patient support groups may be helpful. Careful listening to patients' descriptions of their concerns and symptoms is essential to helping them make changes necessary to improve their quality of life (Anderson \& Burckhardt, 1999).

\section*{Arthritis Associated With Infectious Organisms}

Arthritis, tenosynovitis, and bursitis can be associated with infectious organisms. Some inflammation of joints, tendons, and bursae is directly related to infection caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic agents. Bacterial arthritis is the most rapidly destructive form of infectious arthritis. There are two major classes of bacterial arthritis: arthritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and nongonococcal bacterium. The most prevalent of the nongonococcal organisms include Staphylococcus aureus and the various
streptococcal variants. Less common pathogens are related to syphilis, tuberculosis, leprosy, fungi (particularly coccidioidomycosis), mycoplasmas, and viral agents, such as rubella, parvovirus, and hepatitis B.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The characteristic symptom is acute onset of a warm, swollen joint. Culture of the bacterium from the synovial fluid confirms the diagnosis. The patient often immobilizes the joint and elevates the affected extremity because of pain and swelling. Fever may be high or it may be absent. Signs of systemic infection may be lacking in elderly patients, those with diabetes, and those with suppressed immune systems. Diagnosis and treatment may be delayed by patients with pre-existing arthritic conditions if they attribute the symptoms to a flare-up of arthritis.

\section*{Management}

This condition is a medical emergency necessitating early diagnosis and appropriate treatment to eliminate the causative organism; otherwise, the joint may be destroyed relatively quickly. Treatment consists of parenteral antibiotics and drainage of the joint. The results of cultures are used to determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy. Immobilization of the joint and repeated joint aspirations may be necessary along with intravenous antibiotics. Nursing management focuses on providing pain relief, administering antibiotics, and assisting the patient with self-care activities. If the patient is sent home on intravenous antibiotics, the nurse arranges home care and instructs the patient and care providers in safe administration and changes to report to a health care provider.

\section*{Neoplasms and Neurovascular, Bone, and Extra-Articular Disorders}

Primary neoplasms of joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae are rare. Most neoplasms are benign, arising from the synovium. These benign tumors include lipoma, hemangioma, and fibroma and tumor-like lesions such as ganglion, bursitis, and synovial cyst. Malignant tumors include primary tumors, such as synovial and bone sarcomas, and secondary involvement as manifestations of
joint invasion by leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma or metastasis. Neoplasms may present as back or neck pain.

Neurovascular disorders include the compression syndromes, such as those with peripheral entrapment (carpal tunnel syndrome), radiculopathy, and spinal stenosis. Raynaud's phenomenon or disease and erythromelalgia (throbbing and burning pain often affecting the hands and feet) are also included in this category.

Bone and cartilage disorders include osteoporosis, osteomalacia, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, Paget's disease, osteonecrosis, avascular necrosis, costochondritis, osteolysis or chondrolysis, and biomechanical or anatomic abnormalities. Notably, these conditions involve resorption, destruction, infection, or remodeling of bone.

Extra-articular rheumatism is a descriptive term for a group of conditions affecting structures other than the joints. Included are general and regional pain syndromes, low back pain and intervertebral disk disorders, tendonitis and bursitis, and ganglion cysts.

\section*{Miscellaneous Disorders}

The last category in the classification of the rheumatic diseases is aptly labeled miscellaneous disorders because it contains a mix of disorders frequently associated with arthritis and other conditions. These disorders include the direct result of trauma (including internal derangement and loose bodies of joints), pancreatic disease (related to avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis), sarcoidosis (a multisystem disorder particularly of the lymph nodes and lungs), and palindromic rheumatism (an uncommon variety of recurring and acute arthritis and periarthritis that in some may progress to RA but is characterized by symptom-free periods of days to months). Other conditions include villonodular synovitis, chronic active hepatitis, and drug-related rheumatic syndromes. The nursing interventions related to these varied conditions are specific to the multisystemic problems experienced by the patient. However, the musculoskeletal components should not be neglected or overlooked. Further information about these rare disorders can be found in specialty references.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your 28-year-old, newly married patient has recently been informed that she has SLE. Although she is undergoing extensive testing to determine the systemic effects of SLE, she states that she feels fine and cannot understand the reasons for the testing. What explanations would you provide? Explain the relationship of SLE to possible systemic effects of the disorder.
2. A 68 -year-old woman is admitted for surgery to treat a bowel obstruction; it is anticipated that she will have a colostomy. She has advanced rheumatoid arthritis that has affected all four extremities and her cervical spine. How will the rheumatoid arthritis affect her immediate postoperative care?

3. A 57-year-old patient with a long history of osteoarthritis comes to the emergency department with severe pain and swelling of his right knee of 10 days' duration. His knee is
hot to the touch and he has a fever. He explains that he thought his symptoms were due to a flare-up of his osteoarthritis. It is suspected that he has infectious arthritis. Explain the possible consequences of this form of arthritis and the medical and nursing interventions you would anticipate. What are the possible consequences of the delay in seeking treatment?
4. NSAIDs and corticosteroids have been prescribed for your patient's rheumatic disorder. How do the actions of these medications differ, and what instructions and recommendations would you give to the patient to ensure their safe administration?

8. Discuss common skin tests and procedures used in diagnosing skin and related disorders.
$\int_{\text {kin disorders are encountered frequently in nursing practice. }}$ Skin-related disorders account for up to $10 \%$ of all ambulatory patient visits in this country. Because the skin mirrors the general condition of the patient, many systemic conditions may be accompanied by dermatologic manifestations (Fleischer et al., 2000).

The psychological stress of illness or various personal and family problems is commonly exhibited outwardly as dermatologic problems. Any hospitalized patient may suddenly develop itching and a rash from the treatment regimen. In certain systemic conditions, such as hepatitis and some cancers, dermatologic manifestations may be the first sign of the disorder.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The largest organ system of the body, the skin is indispensable for human life. Skin forms a barrier between the internal organs and the external environment and participates in many vital body functions. The skin is contiguous with the mucous membrane at the external openings of the digestive, respiratory, and urogenital systems. Because skin disorders are readily visible, dermatologic complaints are commonly the primary reason for a patient to seek health care.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE SKIN, HAIR, NAILS, AND GLANDS OF THE SKIN}

The skin is composed of three layers: epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 55-1). The epidermis is an outermost layer of stratified epithelial cells and composed predominantly of keratinocytes. It ranges in thickness from about 0.1 mm on the eyelids to about 1 mm on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Four distinct layers compose the epidermis, from innermost to outermost: stratum germinativum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum. Each layer becomes more differentiated (ie, mature and with more specific functions) as it rises from the basal stratum germinativum layer to the outermost stratum corneum layer.

\section*{Epidermis}

The epidermis, which is contiguous with the mucous membranes and the lining of the ear canals, consists of live, continuously dividing cells covered on the surface by dead cells that were origi-
nally deeper in the dermis but were pushed upward by the newly developing, more differentiated cells underneath. This external layer is almost completely replaced every 3 to 4 weeks. The dead cells contain large amounts of keratin, an insoluble, fibrous protein that forms the outer barrier of the skin and has the capacity to repel pathogens and prevent excessive fluid loss from the body. Keratin is the principal hardening ingredient of the hair and nails.

Melanocytes are the special cells of the epidermis that are primarily involved in producing the pigment melanin, which colors the skin and hair. The more melanin in the tissue, the darker is the color. Most of the skin of dark-skinned people and the darker areas of the skin on light-skinned people (eg, the nipple) contain larger amounts of this pigment. Normal skin color depends on race and varies from pale; almost ivory, to deep brown, almost pure black. Systemic disease affects skin color as well. For example, the skin appears bluish when there is insufficient oxygenation of the blood, yellow-green in people with jaundice, or red or flushed when there is inflammation or fever (Table 55-1).

Production of melanin is controlled by a hormone secreted from the hypothalamus of the brain called melanocyte-stimulating hormone. It is believed that melanin can absorb ultraviolet light in sunlight.

Two other cells are common to the epidermis: Merkel and Langerhans cells. Merkel cells are receptors that transmit stimuli to the axon through a chemical synapse. Langerhans cells are believed to play a significant role in cutaneous immune system reactions. These accessory cells of the afferent immune system process invading antigens and transport the antigens to the lymph system to activate the T lymphocytes.

The epidermis is modified in different areas of the body. It is thickest over the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and contains increased amounts of keratin. The thickness of the epidermis can increase with use and can result in calluses forming on the hands or corns forming on the feet.

The junction of the epidermis and dermis is an area of many undulations and furrows called rete ridges. This junction anchors the epidermis to the dermis and permits the free exchange of essential nutrients between the two layers. This interlocking between the dermis and epidermis produces ripples on the surface of the skin. On the fingertips, these ripples are called fingerprints. They are a person's most individual characteristic, and they rarely change.

\end{figure}

\section*{Dermis}

The dermis makes up the largest portion of the skin, providing strength and structure. It is composed of two layers: papillary and reticular. The papillary dermis lies directly beneath the epidermis and is composed primarily of fibroblast cells capable of producing one form of collagen, a component of connective tissue. The reticular layer lies beneath the papillary layer and also produces collagen and elastic bundles. The dermis is also made up of blood and lymph vessels, nerves, sweat and sebaceous glands, and hair roots. The dermis is often referred to as the "true skin."

\section*{Subcutaneous Tissue}

The subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, is the innermost layer of the skin. It is primarily adipose tissue, which provides a cushion between the skin layers, muscles, and bones. It promotes skin mobility, molds body contours, and insulates the body. Fat is deposited and distributed according to the person's gender and in part accounts for the difference in body shape between men and women. Overeating results in increased deposition of fat beneath the skin. The subcutaneous tissues and amount of fat deposited are important factors in body temperature regulation.

\section*{Hair}

An outgrowth of the skin, hair is present over the entire body except for the palms and soles. The hair consists of a root formed in the dermis and a hair shaft that projects beyond the skin. It grows in a cavity called a hair follicle. Proliferation of cells in the bulb of the hair causes the hair to form (see Fig. 55-1).

Hair follicles undergo cycles of growth and rest. The rate of growth varies; beard growth is the most rapid, followed by hair on the scalp, axillae, thighs, and eyebrows. The growth or anagen phase may last up to 6 years for scalp hair, whereas the telogen or resting phase lasts for approximately 4 months. During telogen, hair sheds from the body. The hair follicle recycles into the growing phase spontaneously, or it can be induced by plucking out hairs. Growing and resting hair can be found side by side on all parts of the body. About $90 \%$ of the 100,000 hair follicles on a
normal scalp are in the growing phase at any one time, and 50 to 100 scalp hairs are shed each day.

There is a small bulge on the side of the hair follicle that houses the stem cells that migrate down to the follicle root and begin the cycle of reproducing the hair shaft. It was discovered that these bulges also contain the stem cells that migrate upward to reproduce skin (Jaworski \& Gilliam, 1999). The location of these cells on the side of the hair shaft rather than at the base is a factor in hair loss. In conditions in which inflammation causes damage to the root of the hair, regrowth is possible. However, if inflammation causes damage to the bulge on the side, stem cells are destroyed and hair does not grow.

In certain locations on the body, hair growth is controlled by sex hormones. The most vivid example is the growth of hair on the face (ie, beard and mustache), chest, and back, which is controlled by the male hormones known as androgens. Some women with higher levels of testosterone have hair in the areas generally thought of as masculine, such as the face, chest, and lower abdomen. This is often a normal genetic variation; if it appears along with irregular menses and weight changes it may indicate a hormonal imbalance.

Hair in different parts of the body serves different functions. The hairs of the eyes (ie, eyebrows and lashes), nose, and ears filter out dust, bugs, and airborne debris. The hair of the skin provides thermal insulation in lower animals. This function is enhanced during cold or fright by piloerection (ie, hairs standing on end), caused by contraction of the tiny erector muscles attached to the hair follicle. The piloerector response that occurs in humans is probably vestigial (ie, rudimentary).

Hair color is supplied by various amounts of melanin within the hair shaft. Gray or white hair reflects the loss of pigment. Hair quantity and distribution can be affected by endocrine conditions. For example, Cushing's syndrome causes hirsutism (ie, excessive hair growth, especially in women), and hypothyroidism (ie, underactive thyroid) causes changes in hair texture. In many cases, chemotherapy and radiation therapy cause hair thinning or weakening of the hair shaft, resulting in partial or complete alopecia (ie, hair loss) from the scalp and other parts of the body.

\section*{Nails}

On the dorsal surface of the fingers and toes, a hard, transparent plate of keratin, called the nail, overlies the skin. The nail grows from its root, which lies under a thin fold of skin called the cuticle. The nail protects the fingers and toes by preserving their highly developed sensory functions, such as for picking up small objects.

Nail growth is continuous throughout life, with an average growth of 0.1 mm daily. Growth is faster in fingernails than toenails and tends to slow with aging. Complete renewal of a fingernail takes about 170 days, whereas toenail renewal takes 12 to 18 months.

\section*{Glands of the Skin}

There are two types of skin glands: sebaceous glands and sweat glands (see Fig. 55-1). The sebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles. The ducts of the sebaceous glands empty sebum (ie, oily secretion) onto the space between the hair follicle and the hair shaft. For each hair there is a sebaceous gland, the secretions of which lubricate the hair and render the skin soft and pliable.

Sweat glands are found in the skin over most of the body surface. They are heavily concentrated in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Only the glans penis, the margins of the lips, the external ear, and the nail bed are devoid of sweat glands. Sweat glands are subclassified into two categories: eccrine and apocrine.

The eccrine sweat glands are found in all areas of the skin. Their ducts open directly onto the skin surface. The thin, watery secretion called sweat is produced in the basal coiled portion of the eccrine gland and is released into its narrow duct. Sweat is composed of predominantly water and contains about one half of the salt content of the blood plasma. Sweat is released from eccrine glands in response to elevated ambient temperature and elevated body temperature. The rate of sweat secretion is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. Excessive sweating of the palms and soles, axillae, forehead, and other areas may occur in response to pain and stress.

The apocrine sweat glands are larger, and unlike eccrine glands, their secretion contains parts of the secretory cells. They are located in the axillae, anal region, scrotum, and labia majora. Their ducts generally open onto hair follicles. The apocrine glands become active at puberty. In women, they enlarge and recede with each menstrual cycle. Apocrine glands produce a milky sweat that is sometimes broken down by bacteria to produce the characteristic underarm odor. Specialized apocrine glands called ceruminous glands are found in the external ear, where they produce cerumen (ie, wax).

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF THE SKIN}

\section*{Protection}

The skin covering most of the body is no more than 1 mm thick, but it provides very effective protection against invasion by bacteria and other foreign matter. The thickened skin of the palms and soles protects against the effects of the constant trauma that occurs in these areas.

The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and is composed of several layers of keratinocytes that change character as they migrate to the surface. The stratum corneum, the outer layer
of the epidermis, provides the most effective barrier to epidermal water loss and penetration of environmental factors such as chemicals, microbes, and insect bites.

Various lipids are synthesized in the stratum corneum and are the basis for the barrier function of this layer. These are longchain lipids that are better suited than phospholipids for water resistance. The presence of these lipids in the stratum corneum creates a relatively impermeable barrier for water egress and for the entry of toxins, microbes, and other substances that come in contact with the surface of the skin.

Some substances do penetrate the skin but meet resistance in trying to move through the channels between the cell layers of the stratum corneum. Microbes and fungi, which are part of the body's normal flora, cannot penetrate unless there is a break in the skin barrier.

The dermis-epidermis junction is the basal layer, which is composed of collagen. The basal layer serves four functions. It acts as a scaffold for tissue organization and a template for regeneration; it provides selective permeability for filtration of serum; it is a physical barrier between different types of cells; and it adheres the epithelium to underlying cell layers.

\section*{Sensation}

The receptor endings of nerves in the skin allow the body to constantly monitor the conditions of the immediate environment. The primary functions of the receptors in the skin are to sense temperature, pain, light touch, and pressure (or heavy touch). Different nerve endings respond to each of the different stimuli. Although the nerve endings are distributed over the entire body, they are more concentrated in some areas than in others. For example, the fingertips are more densely innervated than the skin on the back.

\section*{Fluid Balance}

The stratum corneum (ie, outermost layer of the epidermis) has the capacity to absorb water, thereby preventing an excessive loss of water and electrolytes from the internal body and retaining moisture in the subcutaneous tissues. When skin is damaged, as occurs with a severe burn, large quantities of fluids and electrolytes may be lost rapidly, possibly leading to circulatory collapse, shock, and death.

The skin is not completely impermeable to water. Small amounts of water continuously evaporate from the skin surface. This evaporation, called insensible perspiration, amounts to approximately 600 mL daily in a normal adult. Insensible water loss varies with the body and ambient temperature. In a person with a fever, the loss can increase. During immersion in water, the skin can accumulate water up to three or four times its normal weight, such as swelling of the skin that occurs after prolonged bathing.

\section*{Temperature Regulation}

The body continuously produces heat as a result of the metabolism of food, which produces energy. This heat is dissipated primarily through the skin. Three major physical processes are involved in loss of heat from the body to the environment. The first process, radiation, is the transfer of heat to another object of
lower temperature situated at a distance. The second process, conduction, is the transfer of heat from the body to a cooler object in contact with it. Heat transferred by conduction to the air surrounding the body is removed by the third process, convection, which consists of movement of warm air molecules away from the body.

Evaporation from the skin aids heat loss by conduction. Heat is conducted through the skin into water molecules on its surface, causing the water to evaporate. The water on the skin surface may be from insensible perspiration, sweat, or the environment.

Normally, all of these mechanisms for heat loss are used. When the ambient temperature is very high, however, radiation and convection are ineffective, and evaporation becomes the only means for heat loss.

Under normal conditions, metabolic heat production is balanced by heat loss, and the internal temperature of the body is maintained constant at approximately $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. The rate of heat loss depends primarily on the surface temperature of the skin, which is a function of the skin blood flow. Under normal conditions, the total blood circulated through the skin is approximately 450 mL per minute, or 10 to 20 times the amount of blood required to provide necessary metabolites and oxygen. Blood flow through these skin vessels is controlled primarily by the sympathetic nervous system. Increased blood flow to the skin results in more heat delivered to the skin and a greater rate of heat loss from the body. In contrast, decreased skin blood flow decreases the skin temperature and helps conserve heat for the body. When the temperature of the body begins to fall, as occurs on a cold day, the blood vessels of the skin constrict, thereby reducing heat loss from the body.

Sweating is another process by which the body can regulate the rate of heat loss. Sweating does not occur until the core body temperature exceeds $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, regardless of skin temperature. In extremely hot environments, the rate of sweat production may be as high as 1 L per hour. Under some circumstances (eg, emotional stress), sweating may occur as a reflex and may be unrelated to the need to lose heat from the body.

\section*{Vitamin Production}

Skin exposed to ultraviolet light can convert substances necessary for synthesizing vitamin D (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D is essential for preventing rickets, a condition that causes bone deformities and results from a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus.

\section*{Immune Response Function}

Research findings (Demis, 1998) indicate that several dermal cells (ie, Langerhans cells, interleukin-1-producing keratinocytes, and subsets of T lymphocytes) and three varieties of human leukocyte antigen (ie, protein marker on white blood cells indicating the type of cell) are important components of the immune system. Ongoing research is expected to more clearly define the role of these dermal cells in immune function.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The skin undergoes many physiologic changes associated with normal aging. A lifetime of excessive sun exposure, systemic diseases, poor nutrition, and certain medications (eg, antihistamines, diuretics) can enhance the range of skin problems and the
rapidity with which they appear. The outcome is an increasing vulnerability to injury and to certain diseases. Skin problems are common among older people.

Before conducting a skin assessment, the nurse needs to be aware of significant changes that occur with aging. The major changes in the skin of older people include dryness, wrinkling, uneven pigmentation, and various proliferative lesions. Cellular changes associated with aging include a thinning at the junction of the dermis and epidermis. This results in fewer anchoring sites between the two skin layers, so that even minor injury or stress to the epidermis can cause it to shear away from the dermis. This phenomenon of aging may account for the increased vulnerability of aged skin to trauma. With increasing age, the epidermis and dermis thin and flatten, causing wrinkles, sags, and overlapping skin folds (Fig. 55-2).

Loss of the subcutaneous tissue substances of elastin, collagen, and subcutaneous fat diminishes the protection and cushioning of underlying tissues and organs, decreases muscle tone, and results in the loss of the insulating properties of fat.

Cellular replacement slows as a result of aging. As the dermal layers thin, the skin becomes fragile and transparent. The blood supply to the skin also changes with age. Vessels, especially the capillary loops, decrease in number and size. These vascular changes contribute to the delayed wound healing commonly seen in the elderly patient. Sweat and sebaceous glands decrease in number and functional capacity, leading to dry and scaly skin. Reduced hormonal levels of androgens are thought to contribute to declining sebaceous gland function.

Hair growth gradually diminishes, especially over the lower legs and dorsum of the feet. Thinning is common in the scalp, axilla, and pubic areas. Other functions affected with normal aging include the barrier function of skin, sensory perception, and thermoregulation.

Photoaging, or damage from excessive sun exposure, has detrimental effects on the normal aging of skin. A lifetime of outdoor work or outdoor activities (eg, construction work, lifeguarding, sunbathing) without prudent use of sunscreens can lead to profound wrinkling; increased loss of elasticity; mottled, pigmented areas; cutaneous atrophy; and benign or malignant lesions.

Many skin lesions are part of normal aging. Recognizing these lesions enables the examiner to assist the patient to feel less anx-

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

When caring for patients with dermatologic disorders, the nurse obtains important information through the health history and direct observations. The nurse's skill in physical assessment and an understanding of the anatomy and function of the skin can ensure that deviations from normal are recognized, reported, and documented.

During the health history interview, the nurse asks about any family and personal history of skin allergies, allergic reactions to

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Integumentary Conditions}

Examples of integumentary conditions influenced by genetic factors include the following:
- Albinism
- Eczema
- Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia
- Incontinentia pigmenti
- Neurofibromatosis type 1
- Pseudoxanthoma elasticum
- Psoriasis

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Assess for other closely related family members with integumentary impairment or abnormalities.
- Inquire about the nature and type of skin lesions and age at onset (eg, skin involvement with incontinentia pigmenti occurs in the first few weeks of life with blistering of the skin, whereas lesions of neurofibromatosis type 1 may appear in early childhood through adulthood).
- Note gender of affected individuals (eg, mostly females with incontinentia pigmenti, mostly males with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia).
- Inquire about the presence of other clinical features, such as unusual hair, teeth, or nails; thrombocytopenia; recurrent infections.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- Assess for related clinical features, such as sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, abnormally shaped teeth, alopecia, nail abnormalities (eg, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia).
- Assess for related alterations in vision, such as nystagmus, strabismus; albinism; retinal abnormalities (eg, pseudo-
xanthoma elasticum); Lisch nodules and/or optic glioma (neurofibromatosis type 1).

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether DNA mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on affected family members.
- If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of genetic testing, and gene-based interventions.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to families with newly diagnosed geneticrelated integumentary conditions.
- Participate in management and coordination of care for patients with genetic conditions and for individuals predisposed to develop or pass on a genetic condition.

food, medications, chemicals, previous skin problems, and skin cancer. The names of cosmetics, soaps, shampoos, and other personal hygiene products are obtained if there have been any recent skin problems noticed with the use of these products. The health history contains specific information about the onset, signs and symptoms, location, and duration of any pain, itching, rash, or other discomfort experienced by the patient. The accompanying assessment chart lists selected questions useful in obtaining appropriate information (Chart 55-2).

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

Assessment of the skin involves the entire skin area, including the mucous membranes, scalp, hair, and nails. The skin is a reflection of a person's overall health, and alterations commonly correspond to disease in other organ systems. Inspection and palpation are techniques commonly used in examining the skin. The room must be well lighted and warm. A penlight may be used to highlight lesions. The patient completely disrobes and is adequately draped. Gloves are worn during skin examination if rash or lesions are to be palpated. However, it is important to avoid making the patient feel as if he or she cannot be touched. Touching skin lesions indicates a level of acceptance of the patient.

\section*{Chart 55-2 • ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Patient History of Skin Disorders}

Patient history relevant to skin disorders may be obtained by asking the following questions:

When did you first notice this skin problem? (Also investigate duration and intensity.)
Has it occurred previously?
Are there any other symptoms?
What site was first affected?
What did the rash or lesion look like when it first appeared?
Where and how fast did it spread?
Do you have any itching, burning, tingling, or crawling sensations?
Is there any loss of sensation?
Is the problem worse at a particular time or season?
How do you think it started?
Do you have a history of hay fever, asthma, hives, eczema, or allergies?
Who in your family has skin problems or rashes?
Did the eruptions appear after certain foods were eaten? Which foods?
When the problem occurred, had you recently consumed alcohol?
What relation do you think there may be between a specific event and the outbreak of the rash or lesion?
What medications are you taking?
What topical medication (ointment, cream, salve) have you put on the lesion (including over-the-counter medications)?
What skin products or cosmetics do you use?
What is your occupation?
What in your immediate environment (plants, animals, chemicals, infections) might be precipitating this disorder? Is there anything new, or are there any changes in the environment?
Does anything touching your skin cause a rash?
How has this affected you (or your life)?
Is there anything else you wish to talk about in regard to this disorder?

\section*{Assessing General Appearance}

The general appearance of the skin is assessed by observing color, temperature, moisture or dryness, skin texture (rough or smooth), lesions, vascularity, mobility, and the condition of the hair and nails. Skin turgor, possible edema, and elasticity are assessed by palpation.

Skin color varies from person to person and ranges from ivory to deep brown to almost pure black. The skin of exposed portions of the body, especially in sunny, warm climates, tends to be more pigmented than the rest of the body. The vasodilation that occurs with fever, sunburn, and inflammation produces a pink or reddish hue to the skin. Pallor is an absence of or a decrease in normal skin color and vascularity and is best observed in the conjunctivae or around the mouth.

The bluish hue of cyanosis indicates cellular hypoxia and is easily observed in the extremities, nail beds, lips, and mucous membranes. Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin, is directly related to elevations in serum bilirubin and is often first observed in the sclerae and mucous membranes (Fig. 55-3).

\section*{Erythema}

Erythema is redness of the skin caused by the congestion of capillaries. In light-skinned people, it is easily observed at any location where it appears. To determine possible inflammation, the skin is palpated for increased warmth and for smoothness (ie, edema) or hardness (ie, intracellular infiltration). Because dark skin tends to assume a purple-gray cast when an inflammatory process is present, it may be difficult to detect erythema.

\section*{Rash}

In instances of pruritus (ie, itching), the patient should be asked to indicate which areas of the body are involved. The skin is then stretched gently to decrease the reddish tone and make the rash stand out. Pointing a penlight laterally across the skin may effectively highlight the rash. The differences in skin texture are then assessed by running the tips of the fingers lightly over the skin. The borders of the rash may be palpable. The patient's mouth and ears are included in the examination. (Sometimes rubeola, or measles, causes a red cast to appear on the tip of the ears.) The patient's temperature is assessed, and the lymph nodes are palpated.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 55-3 Examples of skin color changes: the bluish tint of cyanosis (left) and the yellow hue of jaundice (right).}
\end{figure}

\section*{Cyanosis}

Cyanosis is the bluish discoloration that results from a lack of oxygen in the blood. It appears with shock or with respiratory or circulatory compromise. In people with light skin, cyanosis manifests as a bluish hue to the lips, fingertips, and nail beds. Other indications of decreased tissue perfusion include cold, clammy skin; a rapid, thready pulse; and rapid, shallow respirations. The conjunctivae of the eyelids are examined for pallor and petechiae (ie, pinpoint red spots that appear on the skin as a result of blood leakage into the skin).

In a person with dark skin, the skin usually assumes a grayish cast. To detect cyanosis, the areas around the mouth and lips and over the cheekbones and earlobes should be observed.

\section*{Color Changes}

Almost every process that occurs on the skin causes some color change. For example, hypopigmentation (ie, decrease in the melanin of the skin, resulting in a loss of pigmentation) may be caused by a fungal infection, eczema, or vitiligo (ie, condition characterized by destruction of the melanocytes in circumscribed areas of the skin, resulting in white patches). Hyperpigmentation (ie, increase in the melanin of the skin, resulting in increased pigmentation) may occur after disease or injury to the skin (ie, postinflammatory), after sun injury, or as a result of aging.

Changes in skin color in people with dark skin are more noticeable and may cause more concern because the discoloration is more readily visible. Some variation in skin pigment levels is considered normal. Examples include the pigmented crease across the bridge of the nose, pigmented streaks in the nails, and pigmented spots on the sclera of the eye. Many variations of color are genetically determined.

\section*{ASSESSING PATIENTS WITH DARK SKIN}

The color gradations that occur in people with dark skin are largely determined by genetic transmission; they may be described as light, medium, or dark. In people with dark skin, melanin is produced at a faster rate and in larger quantities than in people with light skin. Healthy dark skin has a reddish base or undertone. The buccal mucosa, tongue, lips, and nails normally are pink. The degree of pigmentation of the patient's skin may affect the appearance of a lesion. Lesions may be black, purple, or gray instead of the tan or red seen in patients with light skin. Dark pigment responds with discoloration after injury or inflammation, and patients with dark skin more often experience postinflammatory hyperpigmentation than those with lighter skin. The hyperpigmentation eventually fades but may require months to a year to do so.

In general, people with dark skin suffer the same skin conditions as those with light skin. They are less likely to have skin cancer but more likely to have keloid or scar formation and disorders resulting from occlusion or blockage of hair follicles.

Table 55-2 provides an overview of color changes in lightskinned and dark-skinned people, and the following section provides specific guidelines for assessing dark and light skin.

\section*{ASSESSING SKIN LESIONS}

Skin lesions are the most prominent characteristics of dermatologic conditions. They vary in size, shape, and cause and are classified according to their appearance and origin. Skin lesions can
be described as primary or secondary. Primary lesions are the initial lesions and are characteristic of the disease itself. Secondary lesions result from external causes, such as scratching, trauma, infections, or changes caused by wound healing. Depending on the stage of development, skin lesions are further categorized according to type and appearance (Chart 55-3).

A preliminary assessment of the eruption or lesion should help to identify the type of dermatosis (ie, abnormal skin condition) and indicate whether the lesion is primary or secondary. At the same time, the anatomic distribution of the eruption should be observed, because certain diseases affect certain sites of the body and are distributed in characteristic patterns and shapes (Figs. 55-4 and 55-5). To determine the extent of the regional distribution, the left and right sides of the body should be compared while the color and shape of the lesions are assessed. After observation, the lesions are palpated to determine their texture, shape, and border and to see if they are soft and filled with fluid or hard and fixed to the surrounding tissue.

A metric ruler is used to measure the size of the lesions so that any further extension can be compared with this baseline measurement. The dermatosis is documented on the patient's health record; it should be described clearly and in detail, using precise terminology.

After the characteristic distribution of the lesions has been determined, the following information should be obtained and described clearly and in detail:
- Color of the lesion
- Any redness, heat, pain, or swelling
- Size and location of the involved area
- Pattern of eruption (eg, macular, papular, scaling, oozing, discrete, confluent)
- Distribution of the lesion (eg, bilateral, symmetric, linear, circular)

If acute open wounds or lesions are found on inspection of the skin, a comprehensive assessment should be made and documented in the patient's record. This assessment should address several issues:
- Wound bed: Inspect for necrotic and granulation tissue, epithelium, exudate, color, and odor.
- Wound edges and margins: Observe for undermining (ie, extension of the wound under the surface skin), and evaluate for condition.
- Wound size: Measure in millimeters or centimeters, as appropriate, to determine diameter and depth of the wound and surrounding erythema.
- Surrounding skin: Assess for color, suppleness and moisture, irritation, and scaling.

\section*{Assessing Vascularity and Hydration}

After the color of the skin has been evaluated and lesions have been inspected, an assessment of vascular changes in the skin is performed. A description of vascular changes includes location, distribution, color, size, and the presence of pulsations. Common vascular changes include petechiae, ecchymoses, telangiectases (ie, red marks on the skin caused by stretching of the superficial blood vessels), angiomas, and venous stars.

Skin moisture, temperature, and texture are assessed primarily by palpation. The elasticity (ie, turgor) of the skin, which decreases in normal aging, may be a factor in assessing the hydration status of a patient.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Assessing the Nails and Hair}

A brief inspection of the nails includes observation of configuration, color, and consistency. Many alterations in the nail or nail bed reflect local or systemic abnormalities in progress or resulting from past events (Fig. 55-6). Transverse depressions known as Beau's lines in the nails may reflect retarded growth of the nail matrix because of severe illness or, more commonly, local trauma. Ridging, hypertrophy, and other changes may also be visible with
local trauma. Paronychia, an inflammation of the skin around the nail, is usually accompanied by tenderness and erythema. The angle between the normal nail and its base is 160 degrees. When palpated, the nail base is usually firm. Clubbing is manifested by a straightening of the normal angle ( 180 degrees or greater) and softening of the nail base. The softened area feels spongelike when palpated.

Cherry angioma

The hair assessment is carried out by inspecting and palpating. Gloves are worn, and the examination room should be well lighted. Separating the hair so that the condition of the skin underneath can be easily seen, the nurse assesses color, texture, and distribution. Any abnormal lesions, evidence of itching, inflammation, scaling, or signs of infestation (ie, lice or mites) are documented.

\section*{COLOR AND TEXTURE}

Natural hair color ranges from white to black. Hair color begins to gray with age, initially appearing during the third decade of life, when the loss of melanin begins to become apparent. However, it is not unusual for the hair of younger people to turn gray as a result of hereditary traits. The person with albinism (ie, partial or complete absence of pigmentation) has a genetic predisposition to white hair from birth. The natural state of the hair can be altered by using hair dyes, bleaches, and curling or relaxing products. The types of products used are identified during the assessment.

The texture of scalp hair ranges from fine to coarse, silky to brittle, oily to dry, and shiny to dull, and hair can be straight, curly, or kinky. Dry, brittle hair may result from overuse of hair dyes, hair dryers, and curling irons or from endocrine disorders,
such as thyroid dysfunction. Oily hair is usually caused by increased secretion from the sebaceous glands close to the scalp. If the patient reports a recent change in hair texture, the underlying reason is pursued; the alteration may arise simply from the overuse of commercial hair products or from changing to a new shampoo.

\section*{DISTRIBUTION}

Body hair distribution varies with location. Hair over most of the body is fine, except in the axillae and pubic areas, where it is coarse. Pubic hair, which develops at puberty, forms a diamond shape extending up to the umbilicus in boys and men. Female pubic hair resembles an inverted triangle. If the pattern found is more characteristic of the opposite gender, it may indicate an endocrine problem and further investigation is in order. Racial differences in hair are expected, such as straight hair in Asians and curly, coarser hair in people of African descent.

Men tend to have more body and facial hair than women. Loss of hair, or alopecia, can occur over the entire body or be confined to a specific area. Scalp hair loss may be localized to patchy areas or may range from generalized thinning to total

baldness. When assessing scalp hair loss, it is important to investigate the underlying cause with the patient. Patchy hair loss may be from habitual hair pulling or twisting; from excessive traction on the hair (eg, braiding too tightly); excessive use of dyes, straighteners, and oils; chemotherapeutic agents (eg, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide); fungal infection; or moles or lesions on the scalp. Regrowth may be erratic, and distribution may never attain the previous thickness.

\section*{HAIR LOSS}

The most common cause of hair loss is male pattern baldness, which affects more than one half of the male population and is believed to be related to heredity, aging, and androgen (male hormone) levels. Androgen is necessary for male pattern baldness to develop. The pattern of hair loss begins with receding of the hairline in the frontal-temporal area and progresses to gradual thinning and complete loss of hair over the top of the scalp and crown. Figure 55-7 illustrates the typical male pattern hair loss.

\section*{OTHER CHANGES}

Male pattern hair distribution may be seen in some women at the time of menopause, when the hormone estrogen is no longer produced by the ovaries. In women with hirsutism, excessive hair may grow on the face, chest, shoulders, and pubic area. When menopause is ruled out as the underlying cause, hormonal abnormalities related to pituitary or adrenal dysfunction must be investigated.

Because patients with skin conditions may be viewed negatively by others, these patients may become distraught and avoid interaction with people. Skin conditions can lead to disfigurement, isolation, job loss, and economic hardship.

Some conditions may subject the patient to a protracted illness, leading to feelings of depression, frustration, self-consciousness, poor self-image, and rejection. Itching and skin irritation, features of many skin diseases, may be a constant annoyance. The results of these discomforts may be loss of sleep, anxiety, and depression, all of which reinforce the general distress and fatigue that frequently accompany skin disorders.

For patients suffering such physical and psychological discomforts, the nurse needs to provide understanding, explanations of the problem, appropriate instructions related to treatment, nursing support, patience, and encouragement. It takes time to help patients gain insight into their problems and resolve their difficulties. It is imperative to overcome any aversion that may be felt when caring for patients with unattractive skin disorders. The nurse should show no sign of hesitancy when approaching patients with skin disorders. Such hesitancy only reinforces the psychological trauma of the disorder.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

In addition to obtaining the patient's history, the examiner inspects the primary and secondary lesions and their configuration and distribution. Certain diagnostic procedures may also be used to help identify skin conditions.

\section*{SKIN BIOPSY}

Performed to obtain tissue for microscopic examination, a skin biopsy may be obtained by scalpel excision or by a skin punch instrument that removes a small core of tissue. Biopsies are per-
formed on skin nodules, plaques, blisters, and other lesions to rule out malignancy and to establish an exact diagnosis.

\section*{IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE}

Designed to identify the site of an immune reaction, immunofluorescence testing combines an antigen or antibody with a fluorochrome dye. Antibodies can be made fluorescent by attaching them to a dye. Direct immunofluorescence tests on skin are techniques to detect autoantibodies directed against portions of the skin. The indirect immunofluorescence test detects specific antibodies in the patient's serum.

\section*{PATCH TESTING}

Performed to identify substances to which the patient has developed an allergy, patch testing involves applying the suspected allergens to normal skin under occlusive patches. The development of redness, fine bumps, or itching is considered a weak positive reaction; fine blisters, papules, and severe itching indicate a moderately positive reaction; and blisters, pain, and ulceration indicate a strong positive reaction (see Chap. 53).

\section*{SKIN SCRAPINGS}

Tissue samples are scraped from suspected fungal lesions with a scalpel blade moistened with oil so that the scraped skin adheres to the blade. The scraped material is transferred to a glass slide, covered with a coverslip, and examined microscopically.

\section*{TZANCK SMEAR}

The Tzanck smear is a test used to examine cells from blistering skin conditions, such as herpes zoster, varicella, herpes simplex, and all forms of pemphigus. The secretions from a suspected lesion are applied to a glass slide, stained, and examined.

\section*{WOOD'S LIGHT EXAMINATION}

Wood's light is a special lamp that produces long-wave ultraviolet rays, which result in a characteristic dark purple fluorescence. The color of the fluorescent light is best seen in a darkened room, where it is possible to differentiate epidermal from dermal
lesions and hypopigmented and hyperpigmented lesions from normal skin. The patient is reassured that the light is not harmful to skin or eyes. Lesions that still contain melanin almost disappear under ultraviolet light, whereas lesions that are devoid of melanin increase in whiteness with ultraviolet light.

\section*{CLINICAL PHOTOGRAPHS}

Photographs are taken to document the nature and extent of the skin condition and are used to determine progress or improvement resulting from treatment.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. In thinking about the skin as the first line of defense for homeostasis, identify some of the threats to skin integrity that should be assessed when admitting a patient to the hospital. What impact does the type of skin care delivered have on skin integrity? How would skin assessment of an elderly patient differ from that of a young adult?
2. An elderly African American woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of diabetes. What concerns should be addressed relative to the skin and circulation in a patient with diabetes? How will your assessment of the skin of this patient differ from the assessment of the skin of a Caucasian patient?

2. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with psoriasis.
3. Describe the health education needs of the patient with infections of the skin and parasitic skin diseases.

9. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient undergoing facial reconstructive surgery.

Nuursing care for patients with dermatologic problems includes administering topical and systemic medications, managing wet dressings and other special dressings, and providing therapeutic baths. The four major objectives of therapy are to prevent additional damage, prevent secondary infection, reverse the inflammatory process, and relieve the symptoms.

\section*{Skin Care for Patients With Skin Conditions}

Some skin problems are markedly aggravated by soap and water, and bathing routines are modified according to the condition. Denuded skin, whether the area of desquamation is large or small, is excessively prone to damage by chemicals and trauma. The friction of a towel, if applied with vigor, is sufficient to produce a brisk inflammatory response that causes any existing lesion to flare up and extend.

\section*{Protecting the Skin}

The essence of skin care and protection in bathing a patient with skin problems is as follows: a mild, lipid-free soap or soap substitute is used; the area is rinsed completely and blotted dry with a soft cloth; and deodorant soaps are avoided.

Special care is necessary when changing dressings. Pledgets saturated with oil, sterile saline, or another prescribed solution help to loosen crusts, remove exudates, or free an adherent dry dressing.

\section*{Preventing Secondary Infection}

Potentially infectious skin lesions should be regarded strictly as such, and proper precautions should be observed until the diagnosis is established. Most lesions with pus contain infectious material. The nurse and physician must adhere to standard precautions and wear gloves when inspecting the skin or changing the dressing. Proper disposal of any contaminated dressing is carried out according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.

\section*{Reversing the Inflammatory Process}

The type of skin lesion (eg, oozing, infected, or dry) usually determines the type of local medication or treatment that is prescribed. As a rule, if the skin is acutely inflamed (ie, hot, red, and
swollen) and oozing, it is best to apply wet dressings and soothing lotions. For chronic conditions in which the skin surface is dry and scaly, water-soluble emulsions, creams, ointments, and pastes are used. The therapy is modified as the responses of the skin indicate. The patient and the nurse should note whether the medication or dressings seem to irritate the skin. The success or failure of therapy usually depends on adequate instruction and motivation of the patient and the interest of and support by the health care personnel.

\section*{Wound Care for Skin Conditions}

There are three major classifications of dressings for skin conditions: wet, moisture-retentive, and occlusive. During the 1980s and 1990s, new product development quadrupled the available choices for wound care, especially within the moisture-retentive dressing classification. Products classified as moisture-retentive dressings include hydrogels, foams, and alginates. Biologicals and biosynthetics containing collagen and growth factor are being researched and will soon be available. Chart 56-1 lists generic wound care products. Consultation with a wound care specialist can be very helpful in choosing the product most appropriate for the patient.

\section*{Dressings and Rules of Wound Care}

Even with the increased availability of dressings, an appropriate selection can be made if certain principles are maintained, referred to as the five rules of wound care (Krastner, et al, 2002).

Rule 1: Categorization. The nurse should learn about dressings by generic category and compare new products with those that already make up the category. As hundreds of choices become available, the nurse should become familiar with the generic categories and develop a systematic approach to product selection. The nurse should become familiar with indications, contraindications, and side effects. The best dressing may be created by combining products in different categories to achieve several goals at the same time. These categories are discussed in subsequent sections.

Rule 2: Selection. The nurse should select the safest and most effective, user-friendly, and cost-effective dressing possible. In
acantholysis: separation of epidermal cells from each other due to damage or abnormality of the intracellular substance
balneotherapy: a bath with therapeutic additives
carbuncle: localized skin infection involving several hair follicles
cheilitis: dry, cracking, inflamed skin at the corners of the mouth
comedones: the primary lesions of acne, caused by sebum blockage in the hair follicle
débridement: removal of necrotic or dead tissue by mechanical, surgical, or autolytic means
dermatitis: any inflammation of the skin dermatosis: any abnormal skin lesion epidermopoiesis: development of epidermal cells
furuncle: localized skin infection of a single hair follicle
hydrophilic: a material that absorbs moisture
hydrophobic: a material that repels moisture
hygroscopic: a material that absorbs moisture from the air
lichenification: thickening of the horny layer of the skin
liniments: lotions with added oil for increased softening of the skin
plasmapheresis: removal of whole blood from the body, separation of its cellular elements by centrifugation, and reinfusion of them suspended in saline or some other plasma substitute, thereby depleting the body's own plasma without depleting its cells
Propionibacterium acnes: bacteria that live on the skin; the primary causative agent of acne
pyodermas: bacterial skin infections
suspensions: liquid preparations in which powder is suspended, requiring shaking before use
tinea: a superficial fungal infection on the skin or scalp

\hline
\end{tabular}
many cases, nurses carry out the physician's prescriptions for dressings, but they should be prepared to give the physician feedback about the dressing's effect on the wound, ease of use for the patient, and other considerations when applicable.

Rule 3: Change. The nurse changes dressings based on patient, wound, and dressing assessments, not on standardized routines. Traditional nursing care plans recommended changing dressings on a routine schedule, often three or four times each day.

Rule 4: Evolution. As the wound progresses through the phases of wound healing, the dressing protocol is altered to optimize wound healing. It is rare, especially in cases of chronic wounds, that the same dressing material is appropriate throughout the healing process. The rule assumes that the nurse and the patient or family have access to a wide variety of products and knowledge about their use. The nurse teaches the patient or family caregiver about wound care and ensures that the family has access to appropriate dressing choices.

Rule 5: Practice. Practice with dressing material is required for the nurse to learn the performance parameters of the particular dressing. Refining the skills of applying appropriate dressings correctly and learning about new dressing products are essential nursing responsibilities. Dressing changes should not be delegated to assistive personnel; these techniques require the knowledge base and assessment skills of professional nurses.

\section*{Wet Dressings}

Wet dressings (ie, wet compresses applied to the skin) were traditionally used for acute, weeping, inflammatory lesions. They have become almost obsolete in light of the many newer products available for wound care. Wet dressings are sterile or nonsterile (clean), depending on the skin disorder. They are used to reduce inflammation by producing constriction of the blood vessels
(thereby decreasing vasodilation and local blood flow in inflammation); to clean the skin of exudates, crusts, and scales; to maintain drainage of infected areas; and to promote healing by facilitating the free movement of epidermal cells across the involved skin so that new granulation tissue forms. Wet dressings can be used for vesicular, bullous, pustular, and ulcerative disorders, as well as for inflammatory conditions.

Before applying these dressings, the nurse performs hand hygiene and puts on sterile or clean gloves. The open dressing requires frequent changes because evaporation is rapid. The closed dressing is changed less frequently, but there is always a danger that the closed dressing may cause not only softening and but actual maceration of the underlying skin. Wet-to-dry dressings are used to remove exudate from erosions or ulcers. The dressing remains in place until it dries. It is then removed without soaking so that crusts, exudate, or pus from the skin lesion adhere to the dressing and are removed with it.

\section*{Moisture-Retentive Dressings}

Newer, commercially produced moisture-retentive dressings can perform the same functions as wet compresses but are more efficient at removing exudate because of their higher moisture-vapor transmission rate; some have reservoirs that can hold excessive exudate. There is also evidence that moist wound healing results in wound resurfacing $40 \%$ faster than with air exposure. A number of moisture-retentive dressings are already impregnated with saline solution, petrolatum, zinc-saline solution, hydrogel, or antimicrobial agents, thereby eliminating the need to coat the skin to avoid maceration. The main advantages of moisture-retentive dressings over wet compresses are reduced pain, fewer infections, less scar tissue, gentle autolytic débridement, and decreased frequency of dressing changes. Depending on the product used and the type of dermatologic problem encountered, most moistureretentive dressings may remain in place from 12 to 24 hours; some can remain in place as long as a week. Table 56-1 is a guide to wound dressing functions and categories.

Hydrogels are polymers with a $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ water content. They are available in impregnated sheets or as gel in a tube. Their high moisture content makes them ideal for autolytic débridement of wounds. They are semitransparent, allowing for wound inspection without dressing removal. They are comfortable and soothing for the painful wound. They have no inherent adhesive and require a secondary dressing to keep them in place. Hydrogels are appropriate for superficial wounds with high serous output, such as abrasions, skin graft sites, and draining venous ulcers.

Hydrocolloids are composed of a water-impermeable, polyurethane outer covering separated from the wound by a hydrocolloid material. They are adherent and nonpermeable to water vapor and oxygen. As it evaporates over the wound, water is absorbed into the dressing, which softens and discolors with the increased water content. The dressing can be removed without damage to the wound. As the dressing absorbs water, it produces a foul-smelling, yellowish covering over the wound. This is a normal chemical interaction between the dressing and wound exudate and should not be confused with purulent drainage from the wound. Unfortunately, most of the hydrocolloid dressings are opaque, limiting inspection of the wound without removal of the dressing.

Available in sheets and in gels, hydrocolloids are a good choice for exudative wounds and for acute wounds. Easy to use and comfortable, hydrocolloid dressings promote débridement and formation of granulation tissue. They do not have to be removed for bathing. Most can be left in place for up to 7 days.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Foam dressings consist of microporous polyurethane with an absorptive hydrophilic (ie, water-absorbing) surface that covers the wound and a hydrophobic (ie, water-resistant) backing to block leakage of exudate. They are nonadherent and require a secondary dressing to keep them in place. Moisture is absorbed into the foam layer, decreasing maceration of surrounding tissue. A moist environment is maintained, and removal of the dressing does not damage the wound. The foams are opaque and must be removed for wound inspection. Foams are a good choice for exudative wounds. They are especially helpful over bony prominences because they provide contoured cushioning.

Calcium alginates are derived from seaweed and consist of tremendously absorbent calcium alginate fibers. They are hemostatic and bioabsorbable and can be used as sheets, mats, or ropes of absorbent material. As the exudate is absorbed, the fibers turn into a viscous hydrogel. They are quite useful in areas where the tissue is more irritated or macerated. The alginate dressing forms a moist pocket over the wound while the surrounding skin stays dry. They also react with wound fluid to form a foul-smelling coating. Alginates work well when packed into a deep cavity, wound, or sinus tract with heavy drainage (Krastner et al, 2002). They are nonadherent and require a secondary dressing.

\section*{Occlusive Dressings}

Occlusive dressings may be commercially produced or made inexpensively from sterile or nonsterile gauze squares or wrap. Occlusive dressings cover topical medication that is applied to a dermatosis (ie, abnormal skin lesion). The area is kept airtight by using plastic film (eg, plastic wrap). Plastic film is thin and readily adapts to all sizes, body shapes, and skin surfaces. Plastic surgical tape containing a corticosteroid in the adhesive layer can be cut to size and applied to individual lesions. Generally, plastic wrap should be used no more than 12 hours each day.

\section*{AUTOLYTIC DÉBRIDEMENT}

Autolytic débridement is a process that uses the body's own digestive enzymes to break down necrotic tissue. The wound is kept moist with occlusive dressings. Eschar and necrotic debris are softened, liquefied, and separated from the bed of the wound.

Several commercially available products contain the same enzymes that the body produces naturally. These are called enzymatic débriding agents; examples include Accu Zyme, collagenase (Santyl), Granulex, and Zymase. Application of these products speeds the rate at which necrotic tissue is removed. This method is still slower and no more effective than surgical débridement. When enzymatic débridment is being used under an occlusive
dressing, a foul odor is produced by the breakdown of cellular debris. This odor does not indicate that the wound is infected. The nurse should expect this reaction, and help the patient understand the reason for the odor.

\section*{Advances in Wound Treatment}

Increasing understanding of how skin heals has led to several advances in therapy. Growth factors are cytokines or proteins that have potent mitogenic activity (Valencia et al., 2001). Low levels of cytokines circulate in the blood continuously, but activated platelets release increased amounts of preformed growth factors into a wound. This increase in cytokines in the wound stimulates cellular growth and granulation of skin. Regranex gel contains becaplermin, a platelet-derived growth factor, which is applied to the wound to stimulate healing. Apligraf is a skin construct (ie, bioengineered skin substitute) imbedded in a dressing that also contains cytokines and fibroblasts. When applied to wounds, these agents stimulate platelet activity and potentially decrease wound healing time (Paquette \& Falanga, 2002).

Some oral medications are being investigated for their benefits in healing chronic venous ulcers of the lower legs. Pentoxifylline (Trental) increases peripheral blood flow by decreasing the viscosity of blood. It has some fibrinolytic action and decreases leukocyte adhesion to the wall of the blood vessels. Enteric-coated aspirin has also been shown to be of value, although its exact mechanism is still not clear (Valencia et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{THERAPEUTIC BATHS (BALNEOTHERAPY) AND MEDICATIONS}

Baths or soaks, known as balneotherapy, are useful when large areas of skin are affected. The baths remove crusts, scales, and old medications and relieve the inflammation and itching that accompany acute dermatoses. The water temperature should be comfortable, and the bath should not exceed 20 to 30 minutes because of the tendency of baths and soaks to produce skin maceration. Table 56-2 lists the different types of therapeutic baths and their uses.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Because skin is easily accessible and therefore easy to treat, topical medications are often used. High concentrations of some medications can be applied directly to the affected site with little systemic absorption and therefore with few systemic side effects. However, some medications are readily absorbed through the skin and can produce systemic effects. Because topical preparations may induce allergic contact dermatitis (ie, inflammation of the skin) in sensitive patients, any untoward response should be reported immediately and the medication discontinued.

Medicated lotions, creams, ointments, and powders are frequently used to treat skin lesions. In general, moisture-retentive dressings, with or without medication, are used in the acute stage; lotions and creams are reserved for the subacute stage; and ointments are used when inflammation has become chronic and the skin is dry with scaling or lichenification (ie, leathery thickening).

With all types of topical medication, the patient is taught to apply the medication gently but thoroughly and, when necessary, to cover the medication with a dressing to protect clothing. Table 56-3 lists some commonly used topical preparations.

Lotions. Lotions are of two types: suspensions and liniments. Suspensions consist of a powder in water, requiring shaking before application, and clear solutions, containing completely dissolved active ingredients. Lotions are usually applied directly to the skin, but a dressing soaked in the lotion can be placed on the affected area. A suspension such as calamine lotion provides a rapid cooling and drying effect as it evaporates, leaving a thin, medicinal layer of powder on the affected skin. Lotions are frequently used to replenish lost skin oils or to relieve pruritus. Lotions must be applied every 3 or 4 hours for sustained therapeutic effect. If left in place for a longer period, they may crust and cake on the skin. Liniments are lotions with oil added to prevent crusting. Because lotions are easy to use, therapeutic compliance is generally high.

Powders. Powders usually have a talc, zinc oxide, bentonite, or cornstarch base and are dusted on the skin with a shaker or with cotton sponges. Although their therapeutic action is brief, powders act as hygroscopic agents that absorb and retain moisture from the air and reduce friction between skin surfaces and clothing or bedding.

Creams. Creams may be suspensions of oil in water or emulsions of water in oil, with additional ingredients to prevent bacterial and fungal growth. Both may cause an allergic reaction such as contact dermatitis. Oil-in-water creams are easily applied and usually are the most cosmetically acceptable to the patient. Although they can be used on the face, they tend to have a drying effect. Water-inoil emulsions are greasier and are preferred for drying and flaking dermatoses. Creams usually are rubbed into the skin by hand. They are used for their moisturizing and emollient effects.

Gels. Gels are semisolid emulsions that become liquid when applied to the skin or scalp. They are cosmetically acceptable to the patient because they are not visible after application, and they are greaseless and nonstaining. The newer water-based gels appear to penetrate the skin more effectively and cause less stinging on application. They are especially useful for acute dermatitis in which there is weeping exudate (eg, poison ivy).

Pastes. Pastes are mixtures of powders and ointments and are used in inflammatory blistering conditions. They adhere to the skin and may be difficult to remove without using an oil (eg, olive oil, mineral oil). Pastes are applied with a wooden tongue depressor or gloved hand.

Ointments. Ointments retard water loss and lubricate and protect the skin. They are the preferred vehicle for delivering medication to chronic or localized dry skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. Ointments are applied with a wooden tongue depressor or by hand (gloved).

Sprays and Aerosols. Spray and aerosol preparations may be used on any widespread dermatologic condition. They evaporate on contact and are used infrequently.

Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are widely used in treating dermatologic conditions to provide anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects. The patient is taught to apply this medication according to strict guidelines, using it sparingly but rubbing it into the prescribed area thoroughly. Absorption of topical corticosteroid is enhanced when the skin is hydrated or the affected area is covered by an occlusive or moisture-retentive dressing. Inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids can result in local and systemic side effects, especially when the medication is absorbed through inflamed and excoriated skin, under occlusive dressings, or when used for long periods on sensitive areas. Local side effects may include skin atrophy and thinning, striae (ie, bandlike streaks), and telangiectasia. Thinning of the skin results from the ability of corticosteroids to inhibit skin collagen synthesis (Odom et al., 2000). The thinning process can be reversed by discontinuing the medication, but striae and telangiectasia are permanent. Systemic side effects may include hyperglycemia and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Caution is required when applying corticosteroids around the eyes because long-term use may cause glaucoma or cataracts, and the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids may mask existing viral or fungal infections.

Concentrated (fluorinated) corticosteroids are never applied on the face or intertriginous areas (ie, axilla and groin), because these areas have a thinner stratum corneum and absorb the medication much more quickly than areas such as the forearm or legs. Persistent use of concentrated topical corticosteroids in any location may produce acnelike dermatitis, known as steroid-induced acne, and hypertrichosis (ie, excessive hair growth). Because some topical corticosteroid preparations are available without prescription, patients should be cautioned about prolonged and inappropriate use. Table 56-4 lists topical corticosteroid preparations according to potency.

Intralesional Therapy. Intralesional therapy consists of injecting a sterile suspension of medication (usually a corticosteroid) into or just below a lesion. Although this treatment may have an antiinflammatory effect, local atrophy may result if the medication is injected into subcutaneous fat. Skin lesions treated with intralesional therapy include psoriasis, keloids, and cystic acne. Occasionally, immunotherapeutic and antifungal agents are administered as intralesional therapy.

Systemic Medications. Systemic medications are also prescribed for skin conditions. These include corticosteroids for short-term therapy for contact dermatitis or for long-term treatment of a chronic dermatosis, such as pemphigus vulgaris. Other frequently used systemic medications include antibiotics, antifungals, antihistamines, sedatives, tranquilizers, analgesics, and cytotoxic agents.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Management begins with a health history, direct observation, and a complete physical examination. Chapter 55 provides a description of integumentary assessment. Because of its visibility, a skin condition is usually difficult to ignore or conceal from others and may therefore cause the patient some emotional distress. The major goals for the patient may include maintenance of skin integrity, relief of discomfort, promotion of restful sleep, self-acceptance, knowledge about skin care, and avoidance of complications.

*cr, cream; lot, lotion; oint, ointment; OTC, over the counter

Nursing management for patients who must perform self-care for skin problems, such as applying medications and dressings, focuses mainly on teaching the patient how to wash the affected area and pat it dry, apply medication to the lesion while the skin is moist, cover the area with plastic (eg, Telfa pads, plastic wrap, vinyl gloves, plastic bag) if recommended, and cover it with an elastic bandage, dressing, or paper tape to seal the edges. Dressings that contain or cover a topical corticosteroid should be removed for 12 of every 24 hours to prevent skin thinning (ie, atrophy), striae, and telangiectasia (ie, small, red lesions caused by dilation of blood vessels).

Other forms of dressings, such as those used to cover topical medications, include soft cotton cloth and stretchable cotton dressings (eg, Surgitube, TubeGauz) that can be used for fingers, toes, hands, and feet. The hands can be covered with disposable polyethylene or vinyl gloves sealed at the wrists; the feet can be wrapped in plastic bags covered by cotton socks. Gloves and socks that are already impregnated with emollients, making application to the hands and feet more convenient, are also available. When large areas of the body must be covered, cotton cloth topped by an expandable stockinette can be used. Disposable diapers or cloths folded in diaper fashion are useful for dressing the groin and the
perineal areas. Axillary dressings can be made of cotton cloth, or a commercially prepared dressing may be used and taped in place or held by dress shields. A turban or plastic shower cap is useful for holding dressings on the scalp. A face mask, made from gauze with holes cut out for the eyes, nose, and mouth, may be held in place with gauze ties looped through holes cut in the four corners of the mask. See the Plan of Nursing Care 56-1 for more information.

\section*{Pruritus}

\section*{GENERAL ITCHING}

Pruritus (ie, itching) is one of the most common symptoms of patients with dermatologic disorders. Itch receptors are unmyelinated, penicillate (ie, brushlike) nerve endings that are found exclusively in the skin, mucous membranes, and cornea. Although pruritus is usually caused by primary skin disease with resultant rash or lesions, it may occur without a rash or lesion. This is referred to as essential pruritus, which generally has a rapid onset, may be severe, and interferes with normal daily activities.

Pruritus may be the first indication of a systemic internal disease such as diabetes mellitus, blood disorders, or cancer. It may also accompany renal, hepatic, and thyroid diseases (Chart 56-2). Some common oral medications such as aspirin, antibiotics, hormones (ie, estrogens, testosterone, or oral contraceptives), and opioids (ie, morphine or cocaine) may cause pruritus directly or by increasing sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Certain soaps and chemicals, radiation therapy, prickly heat (ie, miliaria), and contact with woolen garments are also associated with pruritus. Pruritus may also be caused by psychological factors, such as excessive stress in family or work situations.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Scratching the itchy area causes the inflamed cells and nerve endings to release histamine, which produces more pruritus, generating a vicious itch-scratch cycle. If the patient responds to an itch by scratching, the integrity of the skin may be altered, and excoriation, redness, raised areas (ie, wheals), infection, or changes in pigmentation may result. Pruritus usually is more severe at night and is less frequently reported during waking hours, probably because the person is distracted by daily activities. At night, when there are few distractions, the slightest pruritus cannot be easily ignored. Severe itching is debilitating.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Pruritus occurs frequently in elderly people as a result of dry skin. Elderly people are also more likely to have a systemic illness that triggers pruritus, are at higher risk for occult malignancy, and are more likely to be on multiple medications than is the younger population. All of these factors increase the incidence of pruritus.

\section*{Medical Management}

A thorough history and physical examination usually provide clues to the underlying cause of the pruritus, such as hay fever, allergy, recent administration of a new medication, or a change of cosmetics or soaps. After the cause has been identified, treatment of the condition should relieve the pruritus. Signs of infection and environmental clues, such as warm, dry air or irritating bed linens, should be identified. In general, washing with soap and hot water

Goal: Achievement of restful sleep
1. Prevent and treat dry skin.
a. Advise patient to keep bedroom well ventilated and humidified.
b. Keep skin moisturized.
c. Bathe/shower only as necessary if skin is excessively dry. Use no soap or only mild soap. Apply skin lotion/cream immediately after bathing while skin is damp.
2. Advise patient of the following measures that may be helpful in promoting sleep:
a. Keep a regular schedule for sleeping. Go to bed at the same time; get up at the same time.
b. Avoid caffeinated drinks in the evening.
c. Exercise regularly, particularly in late afternoon.
d. Use a bedtime routine or ritual.
e. Use an antihistamine at bedtime if prescribed.

e. Antihistamines decrease itching and promote sleep.
- Achieves restful sleep
- Reports relief of itching
- Maintains appropriate environmental conditions
- Avoids caffeine in late afternoon and evening
- Identifies measures to promote sleep
- Experiences satisfactory rest/sleep pattern

Nursing Diagnosis: Disturbed body image related to unsightly skin appearance
Goal: Development of increasing self-acceptance
1. Assess patient for disturbance of selfimage (avoidance of eye contact, selfnegating verbalizations, expression of disgust about skin condition).
2. Identify psychosocial stage of development.
3. Provide opportunity for expression. Listen (in an open, nonjudgmental way) to expressions of grief/anxiety about changes in body image.
1. Disturbance of body image may accompany any disease or condition that is apparent to the patient. An impression of one's own body has an effect on selfconcept.
2. There is a relationship between development stage, self-image, and the patient's reaction to and understanding of skin condition.
3. The patient needs the experience of being heard and understood.
- Develops increasing acceptance of own body
- Follows through and participates in selfcare measures
- Reports feeling in control of situation
- Gives self positive reinforcement
- Verbalizes a more healthful self-regard
- Appears less self-conscious; is not afraid to socialize and be seen by others
- Uses concealing and highlighting techniques to enhance appearance

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Patients With Dermatoses (Abnormal Skin Conditions) (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
4. Assess the patient's concerns and fears. Assist anxious patient to develop insight and identify and cope with problems.
5. Support patient's efforts to improve body image (participation in skin treatments; grooming), develop self-acceptance, socialize with others, and use cosmetics to conceal disfigurement.

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}
4. This gives health care personnel opportunity to neutralize undue anxiety and restore reality to the situation. Fear is destructive to adaptation.
5. A positive approach and suggestions about cosmetic techniques are often helpful in promoting self-acceptance and socialization.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Deficient knowledge about skin care and methods of treating skin ailment}

\section*{Goal: Understanding of skin care}
1. Determine what the patient knows (understands and misunderstands) about the condition.
2. Keep the patient informed; correct misconceptions/misinformation.
3. Demonstrate application of prescribed therapy (wet compresses; topical medication).
4. Advise the patient to keep skin moist and flexible with hydration and application of skin cream and lotion.
5. Encourage the patient to attain a healthy nutritional status.
1. Provides baseline data for developing the teaching plan.
2. Patients need to have a sense that there is something they can do. Most patients benefit from explanations and reassurance.
3. Allows patient the opportunity to observe the correct way to perform therapies.
4. The stratum corneum needs water to stay flexible. Application of skin cream or lotion to damp skin prevents dry, rough, cracked, and scaly skin.
5. The appearance of the skin reflects a person's general health. Changes may signal abnormal nutrition.
- Acquires understanding of skin care
- Follows treatment as prescribed and can verbalize rationale for measures taken
- Carries out prescribed baths, soaks, wet dressings
- Uses topical medication appropriately
- Understands importance of nutrition to skin health

\section*{Collaborative Problems: Infection}

\section*{Goal: Absence of complications}
1. Have a high index of suspicion for an infection in patients with compromised immune systems.
2. Instruct the patient clearly and in detail about the therapeutic regimen.
3. Apply intermittent wet dressings as prescribed to reduce intensity of inflammation.
4. Provide tub baths and soaks as prescribed.
5. Administer prescribed antimicrobial agents.
- Remains free of infection
- Describes skin care measures that promote
cleanliness and prevent skin breakdown
- Identifies signs and symptoms of infection to report
- Identifies adverse effects of medications that should be reported to health care personnel
- Participates in skin care measures (eg, dressing changes, soaks)

\section*{Plan of Nausing Cave \\ Patients With Dermatoses (Abnormal Skin Conditions) (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}
6. Use topical medications containing corticosteroids as prescribed and as indicated.
a. Observe lesion periodically for changes in response to therapy.
b. Instruct the patient about possible adverse effects of long-term use of fluorinated topical corticosteroids.
7. Advise patient to stop using any skin agent that makes the problem worse.
6. Corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory action, resulting in part from their ability to induce vasoconstriction of the small vessels in the upper dermis. Extensive prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can lead to antiproliferative effects on epidermal cells (loss of hair in area used; thinning of the skin).
7. A contact dermatitis or allergic reaction may develop from any ingredient in the medication.
is avoided. Bath oils (eg, Lubath, Alpha-Keri) containing a surfactant that makes the oil mix with bath water may be sufficient for cleaning. However, an elderly patient or a patient with unsteady balance should avoid adding oil because it increases the danger of slipping in the bathtub. A warm bath with a mild soap followed by application of a bland emollient to moist skin can control xerosis (ie, dry skin). Applying a cold compress, ice cube, or cool agents that contain menthol and camphor (which constrict blood vessels) may also help relieve pruritus.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Topical corticosteroids may be beneficial as anti-inflammatory agents to decrease itching. Oral antihistamines are even more effective because they can overcome the effects of histamine release from damaged mast cells. An antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax), prescribed in a sedative dose at bedtime is effective in producing a restful and comfortable sleep. Nonsedating antihistamine medications such

as fexofenadine (Allegra) should be used to relieve daytime pruritus. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as doxepin (Sinequan), may be prescribed for pruritus of neuropsychogenic origin. If pruritus continues, further investigation of a systemic problem is advised.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse reinforces the reasons for the prescribed therapeutic regimen and counsels the patient on specific points of care. If baths have been prescribed, the patient is reminded to use tepid (not hot) water and to shake off the excess water and blot between intertriginous areas (ie, body folds) with a towel. Rubbing vigorously with the towel is avoided because this overstimulates the skin and causes more itching. It also removes water from the stratum corneum. Immediately after bathing, the skin should be lubricated with an emollient to trap moisture.

The patient is instructed to avoid situations that cause vasodilation (ie, expansion of the blood vessels). Examples include exposure to an overly warm environment and ingestion of alcohol or hot foods and liquids. All can induce or intensify itching. Using a humidifier is helpful if environmental air is dry. Activities that result in perspiration should be limited because perspiration may irritate and promote pruritus. If the patient is troubled at night with itching that interferes with sleep, the nurse can advise wearing cotton clothing next to the skin rather than synthetic materials. The room should be kept cool and humidified. Vigorous scratching should be avoided, and nails kept trimmed to prevent skin damage and infection. When the underlying cause of pruritus is unknown and further testing is required, the nurse explains each test and the expected outcome.

\section*{PERINEAL AND PERIANAL ITCHING}

Pruritus of the genital and anal regions may be caused by small particles of fecal material lodged in the perianal crevices or attached to anal hairs or by perianal skin damage caused by scratching, moisture, and decreased skin resistance as a result of corticosteroid or antibiotic therapy. Other possible causes of perianal itching include local irritants such as scabies and lice, local lesions such as hemorrhoids, fungal or yeast infections, and pinworm infestation. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, anemia, hyperthyroidism, and pregnancy may also result in pruritus. Occasionally, no cause can be identified.

\section*{Management}

The patient is instructed to follow proper hygiene measures and to discontinue home and over-the-counter remedies. The perineal or anal area should be rinsed with lukewarm water and blotted dry with cotton balls. Premoistened tissues may be used after defecation. Cornstarch can be applied in the skinfold areas to absorb perspiration.

As part of health teaching, the nurse instructs the patient to avoid bathing in water that is too hot and to avoid using bubble baths, sodium bicarbonate, and detergent soaps, all of which aggravate dryness. To keep the perineal or perianal skin area as dry as possible, patients should avoid wearing underwear made of synthetic fabrics. Local anesthetic agents should not be used because of possible allergic effects. The patient should also avoid vasodilating agents or stimulants (eg, alcohol, caffeine) and mechanical irritants such as rough or woolen clothing. A diet that includes adequate fiber may help maintain soft stools and prevent minor trauma to the anal mucosa.

\section*{Secretory Disorders}

The main secretory function of the skin is performed by the sweat glands, which help to regulate body temperature. These glands excrete perspiration that evaporates, thereby cooling the body. The sweat glands are located in various parts of the body and respond to different stimuli. Those on the trunk generally respond to thermal stimulation; those on the palms and soles respond to nervous stimulation; and those in the axillae and on the forehead respond to both kinds of stimulation. Normal perspiration has no odor. Body odor is produced by the increase in bacteria on the skin and the interaction of bacterial waste products with the chemicals of perspiration.

As a rule, moist skin is warm, and dry skin is cool, but this is not always true. It is not unusual to observe warm, dry skin in a dehydrated patient and very hot, dry skin in some febrile states.

Normally, sweat can be controlled with the use of antiperspirants and deodorants. Most antiperspirants are aluminum salts that block the opening to the sweat duct. Pure deodorants inhibit bacterial growth and block the metabolism of sweat; they have no antiperspirant effect. Fragrance-free deodorants are available for those with sensitive skin (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{HYDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA}

A condition called hydradenitis suppurativa can occur in certain individuals. The cause is unknown.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Abnormal blockage of the sweat glands causes recurring inflammation, nodules, and draining sinus tracts. Eventually, hypertrophic bands of scar tissue form in the area of the sweat glands.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The condition occurs more frequently in the axilla but also appears in inguinal folds, on the mons pubis, and around the buttocks. The patients can be extremely uncomfortable with multiple suppurative lesions within a small area. This condition does not appear before puberty and does appear to have a genetic basis.

\section*{Management}

Management is difficult. Hot compresses and oral antibiotics are used frequently. Isotretinoin (Accutane) or etretinate can be tried; careful monitoring for side effects is important. Incision and drainage of large suppurating areas with gauze packs inserted to facilitate drainage is often necessary. Rarely, the entire area is excised, removing the scar tissue and any infection. This surgery is drastic and attempted only as a last resort (Hall, 2000).

\section*{SEBORRHEIC DERMATOSES}

Seborrhea is excessive production of sebum (ie, secretion of sebaceous glands) in areas where sebaceous glands are normally found in large numbers, such as the face, scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, sides of the nose and upper lip, malar regions (ie, cheeks), ears, axillae, under the breasts, groin, and gluteal crease of the buttocks. Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin with a predilection for areas that are well supplied with sebaceous glands or lie between skin folds, where the bacteria count is high.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Two forms of seborrheic dermatoses can occur, an oily form and a dry form. Either form may start in childhood and continue throughout life. The oily form appears moist or greasy. There may be patches of sallow, greasy skin, with or without scaling, and slight erythema (ie, redness), predominantly on the forehead, nasolabial fold, beard area, scalp, and between adjacent skin surfaces in the regions of the axillae, groin, and breasts. Small pustules or papulopustules resembling acne may appear on the trunk. The dry form, consisting of flaky desquamation of the scalp with a profuse amount of fine, powdery scales, is commonly called dandruff. The mild forms of the disease are asymptomatic. When scaling occurs, it is often accompanied by pruritus, which may lead to scratching and secondary infections and excoriation.

Seborrheic dermatitis has a genetic predisposition. Hormones, nutritional status, infection, and emotional stress influence its course. The remissions and exacerbations of this condition should be explained to the patient. If a person has not previously been diagnosed with this condition and suddenly appears with a severe outbreak, a complete history and physical examination should be considered.

\section*{Medical Management}

Because there is no known cure for seborrhea, the objective of therapy is to control the disorder and allow the skin to repair itself. Seborrheic dermatitis of the body and face may respond to a topically applied corticosteroid cream, which allays the secondary inflammatory response. However, this medication should be used with caution near the eyelids, because it can induce glaucoma and cataracts in predisposed patients. Patients with seborrheic dermatitis may develop a secondary candidal (yeast) infection in body creases or folds. To avoid this, patients should be advised to ensure maximum aeration of the skin and to clean carefully areas where there are creases or folds in the skin. Patients with persistent candidiasis should be evaluated for diabetes.

The mainstay of dandruff treatment is proper, frequent shampooing (daily or at least three times weekly) with medicated shampoos. Two or three different types of shampoo should be used in rotation to prevent the seborrhea from becoming resistant to a particular shampoo. The shampoo is left on at least 5 to 10 minutes. As the condition of the scalp improves, the treatment
can be less frequent. Antiseborrheic shampoos include those containing selenium sulfide suspension, zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid or sulfur compounds, and tar shampoo that contains sulfur or salicylic acid.

\section*{Nursing Management}

A person with seborrheic dermatitis is advised to avoid external irritants, excessive heat, and perspiration; rubbing and scratching prolong the disorder. To avoid secondary infection, the patient should air the skin and keep skin folds clean and dry.

Instructions for using medicated shampoos are reinforced for those with dandruff that requires treatment. Frequent shampooing is contrary to some cultural practices; the nurse should be sensitive to these differences when teaching the patient about home care.

The patient is cautioned that seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic problem that tends to reappear. The goal is to keep it under control. Patients need to be encouraged to adhere to the treatment program. Those who become discouraged and disheartened by the effect on body image should be treated with sensitivity and an awareness of their need to express their feelings.

\section*{ACNE VULGARIS}

Acne vulgaris is a common follicular disorder affecting susceptible hair follicles, most commonly found on the face, neck, and upper trunk. It is characterized by comedones (ie, primary acne lesions), both closed and open, and by papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts.

Acne is the most commonly encountered skin condition in adolescents and young adults between ages 12 and 35. Both genders are affected equally, although onset is slightly earlier for girls. This may be because girls reach puberty at a younger age than boys. Acne becomes more marked at puberty and during adolescence because the endocrine glands that influence the secretions of the sebaceous glands are functioning at peak activity. Acne appears to stem from an interplay of genetic, hormonal, and bacterial factors. In most cases, there is a family history of acne.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

During childhood, the sebaceous glands are small and virtually nonfunctioning. These glands are under endocrine control, especially by the androgens. During puberty, androgens stimulate the sebaceous glands, causing them to enlarge and secrete a natural oil, sebum, which rises to the top of the hair follicle and flows out onto the skin surface. In adolescents who develop acne, androgenic stimulation produces a heightened response in the sebaceous glands so that acne occurs when accumulated sebum plugs the pilosebaceous ducts. This accumulated material forms comedones.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The primary lesions of acne are comedones. Closed comedones (ie, whiteheads) are obstructive lesions formed from impacted lipids or oils and keratin that plug the dilated follicle. They are small, whitish papules with minute follicular openings that generally cannot be seen. These closed comedones may evolve into open comedones, in which the contents of the ducts are in open communication with the external environment. The color of open comedones (ie, blackheads) results not from dirt, but from an accumulation of lipid, bacterial, and epithelial debris.

Although the exact cause is unknown, some closed comedones may rupture, resulting in an inflammatory reaction caused by leakage of follicular contents (eg, sebum, keratin, bacteria) into the dermis. This inflammatory response may result from the action of certain skin bacteria, such as Propionibacterium acnes, that live in the hair follicles and break down the triglycerides of the sebum into free fatty acids and glycerin. The resultant inflammation is seen clinically as erythematous papules, inflammatory pustules, and inflammatory cysts. Mild papules and cysts drain and heal on their own without treatment. Deeper papules and cysts may result in scarring of the skin. Acne is usually graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number and type of lesions (eg, comedones, papules, pustules, cysts).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of acne is based on the history and physical examination, evidence of lesions characteristic of acne, and age. Acne does not occur until puberty. The presence of the typical comedones (ie, whiteheads and blackheads) along with excessively oily skin is characteristic. Oiliness is more prominent in the midfacial area; other parts of the face may appear dry. When there are numerous lesions, some of which are open, the person may exude a distinct sebaceous odor. Women may report a history of flare-ups a few days before menses. Biopsy of lesions is seldom necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of management are to reduce bacterial colonies, decrease sebaceous gland activity, prevent the follicles from becoming plugged, reduce inflammation, combat secondary infection, minimize scarring, and eliminate factors that predispose the person to acne. The therapeutic regimen depends on the type of lesion (eg, comedonal, papular, pustular, cystic).

There is no predictable cure for the disease, but combinations of therapies are available that can effectively control its activity. Topical treatment may be all that is needed to treat mild to moderate lesions and superficial inflammatory lesions (ie, papular or pustular).

\section*{NUTRITION AND HYGIENE THERAPY}

Although food restrictions have been recommended from time to time in treating acne, diet is not believed to play a major role in therapy. However, the elimination of a specific food or food product associated with a flare-up of acne, such as chocolate, cola, fried foods, or milk products, should be promoted. Maintenance of good nutrition equips the immune system for effective action against bacteria and infection.

For mild cases of acne, washing twice each day with a cleansing soap may be all that is required. These soaps can remove the excessive skin oil and the comedo in most cases. Providing positive reassurance, listening attentively, and being sensitive to the feelings of the patient with acne are essential contributors to the patient's psychological well-being and understanding of the disease and treatment plan. Over-the-counter acne medications contain salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, both of which are very effective at removing the sebaceous follicular plugs. However, the skin of some people is sensitive to these products, which can cause irritation or excessive dryness, especially when used with some prescribed topical medications. The patient should be instructed to discontinue their use if severe irritation occurs. Oil-free cosmetics and creams should be chosen. These products are usually designated as useful
for acne-prone skin. The duration of treatment depends on the extent and severity of the acne. In severe cases, treatment may extend over years.

\section*{TOPICAL PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Benzoyl Peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide preparations are widely used because they produce a rapid and sustained reduction of inflammatory lesions. They depress sebum production and promote breakdown of comedo plugs. They also produce an antibacterial effect by suppressing $P$. acnes. Initially, benzoyl peroxide causes redness and scaling, but the skin usually adjusts quickly to its use. Typically, the patient applies a gel of benzoyl peroxide once daily. In many instances, this is the only treatment needed. Benzoyl peroxide, benzoyl erythromycin, and benzoyl sulfur combinations are available over the counter and by prescription. Vitamin A acid (tretinoin) applied topically is used to clear the keratin plugs from the pilosebaceous ducts. Vitamin A acid speeds the cellular turnover, forces out the comedones, and prevents new comedones.

The patient should be informed that symptoms may worsen during early weeks of therapy because inflammation may occur during the process. Erythema and peeling also frequently result. Improvement may take 8 to 12 weeks. Some patients cannot tolerate this therapy. The patient is cautioned against sun exposure while using this topical medication because it may cause an exaggerated sunburn. Package insert directions should be followed carefully.

Topical Antibiotics. Topical antibiotic treatment for acne is common. Topical antibiotics suppress the growth of $P$. acnes; reduce superficial free fatty acid levels; decrease comedones, papules, and pustules; and produce no systemic side effects. Common topical preparations include tetracycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin.

\section*{SYSTEMIC PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Antibiotics. Oral antibiotics, such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline, administered in small doses over a long period are very effective in treating moderate and severe acne, especially when the acne is inflammatory and results in pustules, abscesses, and scarring. Therapy may continue for months to years. The tetracycline family of antibiotics is contraindicated in children younger than age 12 and in pregnant women. Although these medications are considered safe for long-term use in most cases, administration during pregnancy can affect the development of teeth, causing enamel hypoplasia and permanent discoloration of teeth in infants. Side effects of tetracyclines include photosensitivity, nausea, diarrhea, cutaneous infection in either gender, and vaginitis in women. In some women, broad-spectrum antibiotics may suppress normal vaginal bacteria and predispose the patient to candidiasis, a fungal infection.

Oral Retinoids. Synthetic vitamin A compounds (ie, retinoids) are used with dramatic results in patients with nodular cystic acne unresponsive to conventional therapy. One compound is isotretinoin (Accutane). Isotretinoin is also used for active inflammatory papular pustular acne that has a tendency to scar. Isotretinoin reduces sebaceous gland size and inhibits sebum production. It also causes the epidermis to shed (ie, epidermal desquamation), thereby unseating and expelling existing comedones.

The most common side effect, experienced by almost all patients, is cheilitis (ie, inflammation of the lips). Dry and chafed skin and mucous membranes are frequent side effects. These
changes are reversible with the withdrawal of the medication. Most important, isotretinoin, like other vitamin A metabolites, is teratogenic in humans, meaning that it can have an adverse effect on a fetus, causing central nervous system and cardiovascular defects and structural abnormalities of the face. Contraceptive measures for women of childbearing age are mandatory during treatment and for about 4 to 8 weeks thereafter. To avoid additive toxic effects, patients are cautioned not to take vitamin A supplements while taking isotretinoin (Odom et al., 2000).

Hormone Therapy. Estrogen therapy (including progesteroneestrogen preparations) suppresses sebum production and reduces skin oiliness. It is usually reserved for young women when the acne begins somewhat later than usual and tends to flare up at certain times in the menstrual cycle. Estrogen in the form of estrogen-dominant oral contraceptive compounds may be administered on a prescribed cyclic regimen. Estrogen is not administered to male patients because of undesirable side effects such as enlargement of the breasts and decrease in body hair.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical treatment of acne consists of comedo extraction, injections of corticosteroids into the inflamed lesions, and incision and drainage of large, fluctuant (ie, moving in palpable waves), nodular cystic lesions. Cryosurgery (ie, freezing with liquid nitrogen) may be used for nodular and cystic forms of acne. Patients with deep scars may be treated with deep abrasive therapy (ie, dermabrasion), in which the epidermis and some superficial dermis are removed down to the level of the scars.

Comedones may be removed with a comedo extractor. The site is first cleaned with alcohol. The opening of the extractor is then placed over the lesion, and direct pressure is applied to cause extrusion of the plug through the extractor. Removal of comedones leaves erythema, which may take several weeks to subside. Recurrence of comedones after extraction is common because of the continuing activity of the pilosebaceous glands.

Table 56-5 summarizes the treatment modalities for acne vulgaris.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of patients with acne consists largely of monitoring and managing potential complications of skin treatments. Major nursing activities include patient education, particularly in proper skin care techniques, and managing potential problems related to the skin disorder or therapy.

\section*{PREVENTING SCARRING}

Prevention of scarring is the ultimate goal of therapy. The chance of scarring increases as the grade of acne increases. Grades III and IV ( 25 to more than 50 comedones, papules, or pustules) usually require longer-term therapy with systemic antibiotics or isotretinoin. Patients should be warned that discontinuing these medications can exacerbate acne, lead to more flare-ups, and increase the chance of deep scarring. Moreover, manipulation of the comedones, papules, and pustules increases the potential for scarring.

When acne surgery is prescribed to extract deep-seated comedones or inflamed lesions or to incise and drain cystic lesions, the intervention itself may result in further scarring. Dermabrasion, which levels existing scar tissue, can also increase scar formation. Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation also may affect the tis-

Treatments listed are common but do not include all available forms of therapy.
sue involved. The patient should be informed of these potential outcomes before choosing surgical intervention for acne.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Female patients receiving long-term antibiotic therapy with tetracycline should be advised to watch for and report signs and symptoms of oral or vaginal candidiasis, a yeastlike fungal infection.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. In addition to receiving instructions for taking prescribed medications, patients are instructed to wash the face and other affected areas with mild soap and water twice each day to remove surface oils and prevent obstruction of the oil glands. They are cautioned to avoid scrubbing the face; acne is not caused by dirt and cannot be washed away.

Mild abrasive soaps and drying agents are prescribed to eliminate the oily feeling that troubles many patients. At the same time, patients are cautioned to avoid excessive abrasion because it makes acne worse. Excessive abrasion causes minute scratches on the skin surface and increases possible bacterial contamination. Soap itself can irritate the skin.

All forms of friction and trauma are avoided, including propping the hands against the face, rubbing the face, and wearing
tight collars and helmets. Patients are instructed to avoid manipulation of pimples or blackheads. Squeezing merely worsens the problem, because a portion of the blackhead is pushed down into the skin, which may cause the follicle to rupture. Because cosmetics, shaving creams, and lotions can aggravate acne, these substances are best avoided unless the patient is advised otherwise. There is no evidence that a particular food can cause or aggravate acne. In general, eating a nutritious diet helps the body maintain a strong immune system.

\section*{Bacterial Infections: Pyodermas}

Also called pyodermas, pus-forming bacterial infections of the skin may be primary or secondary. Primary skin infections originate in previously normal-appearing skin and are usually caused by a single organism. Secondary skin infections arise from a preexisting skin disorder or from disruption of the skin integrity from injury or surgery. In either case, several microorganisms may be implicated (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci). The most common primary bacterial skin infections are impetigo and folliculitis. Folliculitis may lead to furuncles or carbuncles.

\section*{IMPETIGO}

Impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin caused by staphylococci, streptococci, or multiple bacteria. Bullous impetigo, a more deep-seated infection of the skin caused by S. aureus, is characterized by the formation of bullae (ie, large, fluid-filled blisters) from original vesicles. The bullae rupture, leaving raw, red areas.

The exposed areas of the body, face, hands, neck, and extremities are most frequently involved. Impetigo is contagious and may spread to other parts of the patient's skin or to other members of the family who touch the patient or use towels or combs that are soiled with the exudate of the lesions.

Although impetigo is seen at all ages, it is particularly common among children living in poor hygienic conditions. It often follows pediculosis capitis (head lice), scabies (itch mites), herpes simplex, insect bites, poison ivy, or eczema. Chronic health problems, poor hygiene, and malnutrition may predispose an adult to impetigo. Some people have been identified as asymptomatic carriers of S. aureus, usually in the nasal passages.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The lesions begin as small, red macules, which quickly become discrete, thin-walled vesicles that soon rupture and become covered with a loosely adherent honey-yellow crust (Fig. 56-1). These crusts are easily removed to reveal smooth, red, moist surfaces on which new crusts soon develop. If the scalp is involved, the hair is matted, which distinguishes the condition from ringworm.

\section*{Medical Management}

Systemic antibiotic therapy is the usual treatment. It reduces contagious spread, treats deep infection, and prevents acute glomerulonephritis (ie, kidney infection), which may occur as an aftermath of streptococcal skin diseases. In nonbullous impetigo, benzathine penicillin or oral penicillin may be prescribed. Bullous impetigo is treated with a penicillinase-resistant penicillin (eg, cloxacillin,

EIGURE 56-1 Impetigo of the nostril.
dicloxacillin). In penicillin-allergic patients, erythromycin is an effective alternative.

Topical antibacterial therapy (eg, mupirocin) may be prescribed when the disease is limited to a small area. However, topical therapy requires that the medication be applied to the lesions several times daily for a week. The treatment regimen may be impossible for some patients or their caregivers to follow. Topical antibiotics generally are not as effective as systemic therapy in eradicating or preventing the spread of streptococci from the respiratory tract, thereby increasing the risk for developing glomerulonephritis.

When topical therapy is prescribed, lesions are soaked or washed with soap solution to remove the central site of bacterial growth, giving the topical antibiotic an opportunity to reach the infected site. After the crusts are removed, a topical medication (eg, Polysporin, bacitracin) may be applied. Gloves are worn when providing patient care. An antiseptic solution, such as povidone-iodine (Betadine) may be used to clean the skin, reduce bacterial content in the infected area, and prevent spread.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse instructs the patient and family members to bathe at least once daily with bactericidal soap. Cleanliness and good hygiene practices help prevent the spread of the lesions from one skin area to another and from one person to another. Each person should have a separate towel and washcloth. Because impetigo is a contagious disorder, infected people should avoid contact with other people until the lesions heal.

\section*{FOLLICULITIS, FURUNCLES, AND CARBUNCLES}

Folliculitis is an infection of bacterial or fungal origin that arises within the hair follicles. Lesions may be superficial or deep. Single or multiple papules or pustules appear close to the hair follicles. Folliculitis commonly affects the beard area of men who shave and women's legs. Other areas include the axillae, trunk, and buttocks.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (ie, shaving bumps) are an inflammatory reaction that occurs predominately on the faces of African American and other curly-haired men as a result of shaving. The sharp ingrowing hairs have a curved root that grows at a more acute angle and pierces the skin, provoking an irritative reaction. The only entirely effective treatment is to avoid shaving. Other treatments include using special lotions or antibiotics or using a hand brush to dislodge the hairs mechanically. If the patient must
remove facial hair, a depilatory cream or electric razor may be more appropriate than a straight razor.

A furuncle (ie, boil) is an acute inflammation arising deep in one or more hair follicles and spreading into the surrounding dermis. It is a deeper form of folliculitis. Furunculosis refers to multiple or recurrent lesions. Furuncles may occur anywhere on the body but are more prevalent in areas subjected to irritation, pressure, friction, and excessive perspiration, such as the back of the neck, the axillae, and the buttocks.

A furuncle may start as a small, red, raised, painful pimple. Frequently, the infection progresses and involves the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue, causing tenderness, pain, and surrounding cellulitis. The area of redness and induration represents an effort of the body to keep the infection localized. The bacteria (usually staphylococci) produce necrosis of the invaded tissue. The characteristic pointing of a boil follows in a few days. When this occurs, the center becomes yellow or black, and the boil is said to have "come to a head."

A carbuncle is an abscess of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that represents an extension of a furuncle that has invaded several follicles and is large and deep seated. It is usually caused by a staphylococcal infection. Carbuncles appear most commonly in areas where the skin is thick and inelastic. The back of the neck and the buttocks are common sites. In carbuncles, the extensive inflammation frequently prevents a complete walling off of the infection; absorption may occur, resulting in high fever, pain, leukocytosis, and even extension of the infection to the bloodstream.

Furuncles and carbuncles are more likely to occur in patients with underlying systemic diseases, such as diabetes or hematologic malignancies, and in those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for other diseases. Both are more prevalent in hot climates, especially on skin beneath occlusive clothing.

\section*{Medical Management}

In treating staphylococcal infections, it is important not to rupture or destroy the protective wall of induration that localizes the infection. The boil or pimple should never be squeezed.

Follicular disorders, including folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles, are usually caused by staphylococci; although if the immune system is impaired, the causative organisms may be gram-negative bacilli. Systemic antibiotic therapy, selected by sensitivity study, is generally indicated. Oral cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin are first-line medications. Cephalosporins and erythromycin are also effective. Bed rest is advised for patients who have boils on the perineum or in the anal region, and a course of systemic antibiotic therapy is indicated to prevent the spread of the infection.

When the pus has localized and is fluctuant, a small incision with a scalpel can speed resolution by relieving the tension and ensuring direct evacuation of the pus and slough. The patient is instructed to keep the draining lesion covered with a dressing.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Intravenous fluids, fever reduction, and other supportive treatments are indicated for patients who are very ill or suffering with toxicity. Warm, moist compresses increase vascularization and hasten resolution of the furuncle or carbuncle. The surrounding skin may be cleaned gently with antibacterial soap, and an antibacterial ointment may be applied. Soiled dressings are handled according to standard precautions. Nursing personnel should carefully follow isolation precautions to avoid becoming carriers
of staphylococci. Disposable gloves are worn when caring for these patients.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. To prevent and control staphylococcal skin infections such as boils and carbuncles, the staphylococcal pathogen must be eliminated from the skin and environment. Efforts must be made to increase the patient's resistance and provide a hygienic environment. If lesions are actively draining, the mattress and pillow should be covered with plastic material and wiped off with disinfectant daily; the bed linens, towels, and clothing should be laundered after each use; and the patient should use an antibacterial soap and shampoo for an indefinite period, often for several months.

Recurrent infection is prevented with the use of prescribed antibiotic therapy (eg, a daily dose of oral clindamycin to be taken continuously for about 3 months). The patient must take the full dose for the time prescribed. The purulent exudate (ie, pus) is a source of reinfection or transmission of infection to caregivers. When the patient has a history of recurrent infections, a carrier state may exist, which should be investigated and treated with an antibacterial cream such as mupirocin.

\section*{Viral Skin Infections}

\section*{HERPES ZOSTER}

Herpes zoster, also called shingles, is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of a group of DNA viruses. The viruses causing chickenpox and herpes zoster are indistinguishable, hence the name varicella-zoster virus. The disease is characterized by a painful vesicular eruption along the area of distribution of the sensory nerves from one or more posterior ganglia. It is assumed that herpes zoster represents a reactivation of latent varicella virus infection and reflects lowered immunity. After a case of chickenpox runs its course, it is thought that the varicellazoster viruses responsible for the outbreak lie dormant inside nerve cells near the brain and spinal cord. Later, when these latent viruses are reactivated, they travel by way of the peripheral nerves to the skin, where the viruses multiply and create a red rash of small, fluid-filled blisters. About $10 \%$ of adults get shingles during their lifetimes, usually after age 50 years. There is an increased frequency of herpes zoster infections among patients with weakened immune systems and cancers, especially leukemias and lymphomas (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The eruption is usually accompanied or preceded by pain, which may radiate over the entire region supplied by the affected nerves. The pain may be burning, lancinating (ie, tearing or sharply cutting), stabbing, or aching. Some patients have no pain, but itching and tenderness may occur over the area. Sometimes, malaise and gastrointestinal disturbances precede the eruption. The
patches of grouped vesicles appear on the red and swollen skin. The early vesicles, which contain serum, later may become purulent, rupture, and form crusts. The inflammation is usually unilateral, involving the thoracic, cervical, or cranial nerves in a bandlike configuration. The blisters are usually confined to a narrow region of the face or trunk (Fig. 56-2). The clinical course varies from 1 to 3 weeks. If an ophthalmic nerve is involved, the patient may have eye pain. Inflammation and a rash on the trunk may cause pain with the slightest touch. The healing time varies from 7 to 26 days.

Herpes zoster in healthy adults is usually localized and benign. However, in immunosuppressed patients, the disease may be severe and the clinical course acutely disabling.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of herpes zoster management are to relieve the pain and to reduce or avoid complications, which include infection, scarring, and postherpetic neuralgia and eye complications. Pain is controlled with analgesics, because adequate pain control during the acute phase helps prevent persistent pain patterns. Systemic corticosteroids may be prescribed for patients older than age 50 years to reduce the incidence and duration of postherpetic neuralgia (ie, persistent pain of the affected nerve after healing). Healing usually occurs sooner in those who have been treated with corticosteroids. Triamcinolone (Aristocort, Kenacort, Kenalog) injected subcutaneously under painful areas is effective as an antiinflammatory agent.

There is evidence that infection is arrested if oral antiviral agents such as acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), or famciclovir (Famvir) are administered within 24 hours of the initial eruption. Intravenous acyclovir, if started early, is effective in significantly reducing the pain and halting the progression of the disease. In older patients, the pain from herpes zoster may persist as postherpetic neuralgia for months after the skin lesions disappear (Hall, 2000).

Ophthalmic herpes zoster occurs when an eye is involved. This is considered an ophthalmic emergency, and the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist immediately to prevent the possible sequelae of keratitis, uveitis, ulceration, and blindness.

\end{figure}

People who have been exposed to varicella (ie, chicken pox) by primary infection or by vaccination are not at risk for infection after exposure to patients with herpes zoster.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse assesses the patient's discomfort and response to medication and collaborates with the physician to make necessary adjustments to the treatment regimen. The patient is taught how to apply wet dressings or medication to the lesions and to follow proper hand hygiene techniques to avoid spreading the virus.

Diversionary activities and relaxation techniques are encouraged to ensure restful sleep and to alleviate discomfort. A caregiver may be required to assist with dressings, particularly if the patient is elderly and unable to apply them. Relatives, neighbors, or a home care nurse may need to help with dressing changes and food preparation for patients who cannot care for themselves or prepare nourishing meals.

\section*{HERPES SIMPLEX}

Herpes simplex is a common skin infection. There are two types of the causative virus, which are identified by viral typing. Generally, herpes simplex type 1 occurs on the mouth and type 2 in the genital area, but both viral types can be found in both locations. About $85 \%$ of adults worldwide are seropositive for herpes type 1 . The prevalence of type 2 is lower; type 2 usually appears at the onset of sexual activity. Serologic testing shows that many more people are infected than have a history of clinical disease.

Herpes simplex is classified as a true primary infection, a nonprimary initial episode, or a recurrent episode. True primary infection is the initial exposure to the virus. A nonprimary initial episode is the initial episode of type 1 or type 2 in a person previously infected with the other type. Recurrent episodes are subsequent episodes of the same viral type.

\section*{OROLABIAL HERPES}

Orolabial herpes, also called fever blisters or cold sores, consists of erythematous-based clusters of grouped vesicles on the lips. A prodrome of tingling or burning with pain may precede the appearance of the vesicles by up to 24 hours. Certain triggers, such as sunlight exposure or increased stress, may cause recurrent episodes. Fewer than $1 \%$ of people with primary orolabial herpes infections develop herpetic gingivostomatitis. This complication occurs more in children and young adults. The onset is often accompanied by high fever, regional lymphadenopathy, and generalized malaise. Another complication of orolabial herpes is the development of erythema multiforme, an acute inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes with characteristic lesions that have the appearance of targets.

\section*{GENITAL HERPES}

Genital herpes, or type 2 herpes simplex, manifests with a broad spectrum of clinical signs. Minor infections may produce no symptoms at all; severe primary infections with type 1 can cause systemic flulike illness. Lesions appear as grouped vesicles on an erythematous base initially involving the vagina, rectum, or penis. New lesions can continue to appear for 7 to 14 days. Lesions are symmetric and usually cause regional lymphadenopathy. Fever and flulike symptoms are common. Typical recurrences begin
with a prodrome of burning, tingling, or itching about 24 hours before the vesicles appear. As the vesicles rupture, erosions and ulcerations begin to appear. Severe infections can cause extensive erosions of the vaginal or anal canal. For further information see Chapter 47.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Herpes simplex infections are confirmed in several ways. Generally, the appearance of the skin eruption is strongly suggestive. Viral cultures and rapid assays are available, and the type of test used depends on lesion morphology. Acute vesicular lesions are more likely to react positively to the rapid assay, whereas older, crusted patches are better diagnosed with viral culture. In all cases, it is imperative to obtain enough viral cells for testing, and careful collection methods are therefore important. All crusts should be gently removed or vesicles gently unroofed. A sterile cotton swab premoistened in viral culture preservative is used to swab the base of the vesicle to obtain a specimen for analysis.

\section*{Complications}

Eczema herpeticum is a condition in which patients with eczema contract herpes that spreads throughout the eczematous areas. The same type of spread of herpes can occur in severe seborrhea, scabies, and other chronic skin conditions.

Herpes Whitlow is an infection of the pulp of a fingertip with herpes type 1 or 2 . There is tenderness and erythema of the lateral fold of the cuticle. Deep-seated vesicles appear within 24 hours.

Most cases of neonatal infection with herpes occur during delivery by contact of the infant with the mother's active ulcerations. Rarely, in mothers who have primary infections during pregnancy, intrauterine neonatal infections occur. Fetal anomalies include skin lesions, microcephaly, encephalitis, and intracerebral calcifications.

\section*{Medical Management}

In many patients, recurrent orolabial herpes represents more of a nuisance than a disease. Because sun exposure is a common trigger, those with recurrent orolabial herpes should use a sunscreen liberally on the lips and face. Topical treatment with drying agents may accelerate healing. In more severe outbreaks or in patients who have identified a trigger, intermittent treatment with 200 mg of acyclovir administered five times each day for 5 days is often started as soon as the earliest symptoms occur.

Treatment of genital herpes depends on the severity, the frequency, and the psychological impact of recurrences and on the infectious status of the sexual partner. For people who have mild or rare outbreaks, no treatment may be required. For those who have more severe outbreaks, but for whom outbreaks are still infrequent, intermittent treatment as described for oral lesions can be used. Because intermittent treatment reduces the duration of the infection by only 24 to 36 hours, it should be initiated as early as possible.

Patients who have more than six recurrences per year may benefit from suppressive therapy. Use of acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir suppresses $85 \%$ of recurrences, and $20 \%$ of patients are free of recurrences during suppressive therapy. Suppressive therapy also reduces viral shedding by almost $95 \%$, making the person less contagious. Treatment with suppressive doses of oral antiviral medications prevents recurrent erythema multiforme.

Eczema herpeticum is managed with oral or intravenous acyclovir.

Management of genital herpes in pregnancy is controversial. Routine prenatal cultures do not predict shedding at the time of delivery. The use of scalp electrodes during delivery should be avoided because they increase the risk for infection in the newborn. Because the risk for neonatal herpes is greater in women with their initial episode during pregnancy, suppression therapy should be started in these women to reduce outbreaks during the third trimester. All women with active lesions at the time of delivery undergo cesarean section.

In immunocompromised patients, suppression therapy should be considered. In severe infections of the hospitalized patient, intravenous acyclovir is prescribed.

\section*{Fungal (Mycotic) Infections}

Fungi, tiny members of a subdivision of the plant kingdom that feed on organic matter, are responsible for various common skin infections. In some cases, they affect only the skin and its appendages (ie, hair and nails). In other cases, the internal organs are involved, and this disease may be life-threatening. Superficial infections, however, rarely cause even temporary disability and respond readily to treatment. Secondary infection with bacteria, Candida, or both organisms may occur.

The most common fungal skin infection is tinea, which is also called ringworm because of its characteristic appearance of ring or rounded tunnel under the skin. Tinea infections affect the head, body, groin, feet, and nails. Table 56-6 summarizes the tinea infections.

To obtain a specimen for diagnosis, the lesion is cleaned, and a scalpel or glass slide is used to remove scales from the margin of the lesion. The scales are dropped onto a slide to which potassium hydroxide has been added. The diagnosis is made by examination
of the infected scales microscopically for spores and hyphae or by isolating the organism in culture. Under Wood's light, a specimen of infected hair appears fluorescent; this may be helpful in diagnosing some cases of tinea capitis.

\section*{TINEA PEDIS: ATHLETE'S FOOT}

Tinea pedis (ie, athlete's foot) is the most common fungal infection. It is especially prevalent in those who use communal showers or swimming pools (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Tinea pedis may appear as an acute or chronic infection on the soles of the feet or between the toes. The toenail may also be involved. Lymphangitis and cellulitis occur occasionally when bacterial superinfection occurs. Sometimes, a mixed infection involving fungi, bacteria, and yeast occurs.

\section*{Medical Management}

During the acute, vesicular phase, soaks of Burow's solution or potassium permanganate solutions are used to remove the crusts, scales, and debris and to reduce the inflammation. Topical antifungal agents (eg, miconazole, clotrimazole) are applied to the infected areas. Topical therapy is continued for several weeks because of the high rate of recurrence.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Footwear provides a favorable environment for fungi, and the causative fungus may be in the shoes or socks. Because moisture encourages the growth of fungi, the patient is instructed to keep the feet as dry as possible, including the areas between the toes.

Small pieces of cotton can be placed between the toes at night to absorb moisture. Socks should be made of cotton, and hosiery should have cotton feet, because cotton is an effective absorber of perspiration.

For people whose feet perspire excessively, perforated shoes permit better aeration of the feet. Plastic- or rubber-soled footwear should be avoided. Talcum powder or antifungal powder applied twice daily helps to keep the feet dry. Several pairs of shoes should be alternated so that they can dry completely before being worn again.

\section*{TINEA CORPORIS: RINGWORM OF THE BODY}

In tinea corporis (ie, ringworm of the body), the typical ringed lesion appears on the face, neck, trunk, and extremities (Fig. 56-3). Animal (nonhuman) varieties are known to cause an intense inflammatory reaction in humans because they are not adapted to living on human hosts. Humans make contact with animal varieties through contact with pets or objects that have been in contact with an animal.

\section*{Medical Management}

Topical antifungal medication may be applied to small areas. Oral antifungal agents are used only in extensive cases. Side effects of oral antifungal agents include photosensitivity, skin rashes, headache, and nausea. Newer antifungal agents, including itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine, have been more effective with fewer systemic side effects than griseofulvin in patients with chronic fungal (dermatophyte) infections.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient is instructed to use a clean towel and washcloth daily. Because fungal infections thrive in heat and moisture, all skin areas and skin folds that retain moisture must be dried thoroughly. Clean cotton clothing should be worn next to the skin.

\section*{TINEA CAPITIS: RINGWORM OF THE SCALP}

Ringworm of the scalp is a contagious fungal infection of the hair shafts and a common cause of hair loss in children. Any child with scaling of the scalp should be considered to have tinea capitis until proven otherwise. Clinical examination reveals one or several round, red scaling patches. Small pustules or papules may

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-175.jpg?height=447&width=676&top_left_y=2110&top_left_x=299}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 56-3 Tinea corporis (ringworm) of the face.}
\end{figure}
be seen at the edges of such patches. As the hairs in the affected areas are invaded by the fungi, they become brittle and break off at or near the surface of the scalp, leaving bald patches or the classic sign of black dots, which are the broken ends of hairs. Because most cases of tinea capitis heal without scarring, the hair loss is only temporary.

\section*{Medical Management}

Griseofulvin, an antifungal agent, is prescribed for patients with tinea capitis. Topical agents do not provide an effective cure because the infection occurs within the hair shaft and below the surface of the scalp. However, topical agents can be used to inactivate organisms already on the hair. This minimizes contagion and eliminates the need to clip the hair. Infected hairs break off anyway, and noninfected ones may remain in place. The hair should be shampooed two or three times weekly, and a topical antifungal preparation should be applied to reduce dissemination of the organisms.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Because tinea capitis is contagious, the patient and family should be instructed to set up a hygiene regimen for home use. Each person should have a separate comb and brush and should avoid exchanging hats and other headgear. All infected members of the family must be examined because familial infections are relatively common. Household pets should also be examined.

\section*{TINEA CRURIS: RINGWORM OF THE GROIN}

Tinea cruris (ie, jock itch) is ringworm infection of the groin, which may extend to the inner thighs and buttock area. It occurs most frequently in young joggers, obese people, and those who wear tight underclothing. The incidence of tinea cruris is increased among people with diabetes.

\section*{Management}

Mild infections may be treated with topical medication such as clotrimazole, miconazole, or terbinafine for at least 3 to 4 weeks to ensure eradication of the infection. Oral antifungal agents may be required for more severe infections. Heat, friction, and maceration (from sweating) predispose the patient to the infection. The nurse instructs the patient to avoid excessive heat and humidity as much as possible and to avoid wearing nylon underwear, tight-fitting clothing, and a wet bathing suit. The groin area should be cleaned, dried thoroughly, and dusted with a topical antifungal agent such as tolnaftate (Tinactin) as a preventive measure, because the infection is likely to recur.

\section*{TINEA UNGUIUM: ONYCHOMYCOSIS}

Tinea unguium (ie, ringworm of the nails) is a chronic fungal infection of the toenails or, less commonly, the fingernails. It is usually caused by Trichophyton species (T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes) or Candida albicans. It is usually associated with long-standing fungal infection of the feet. The nails become thickened, friable (ie, easily crumbled), and lusterless. In time, debris accumulates under the free edge of the nail. Ultimately, the nail plate separates. Because of the chronicity of this infection, the entire nail may be destroyed.

\section*{Management}

An oral antifungal agent is prescribed for 6 weeks when the fingernails are involved and 12 weeks when the toenails are involved. Selection of the antifungal agent depends on the causative fungus. Candidal infections are treated with fluconazole (Diflucan) or itraconazole (Sporanox). Griseofulvin is no longer considered effective therapy because of its long treatment course and poor cure rate. Response to oral antifungal agents in treating infections of the toenails is poor at best. Frequently, when the treatment stops, the infection returns.

\section*{Parasitic Skin Infestation}

\section*{PEDICULOSIS: LICE INFESTATION}

Lice infestation affects people of all ages. Three varieties of lice infest humans: Pediculus humanus capitis (ie, head louse), Pediculus humanus corporis (ie, body louse), and Phthirus pubis (ie, pubic louse or crab louse). Lice are called ectoparasites because they live on the outside of the host's body. They depend on the host for their nourishment, feeding on human blood approximately five times each day. They inject their digestive juices and excrement into the skin, which causes severe itching.

\section*{PEDICULOSIS CAPITIS}

Pediculosis capitis is an infestation of the scalp by the head louse. The female louse lays her eggs (ie, nits) close to the scalp. The nits become firmly attached to the hair shafts with a tenacious substance. The young lice hatch in about 10 days and reach maturity in 2 weeks.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Head lice are found most commonly along the back of the head and behind the ears. The eggs are visible to the naked eye as silvery, glistening oval bodies that are difficult to remove from the hair. The bite of the insect causes intense itching, and the resultant scratching often leads to secondary bacterial infection, such as impetigo or furunculosis. The infestation is more common in children and people with long hair. Head lice may be transmitted directly by physical contact or indirectly by infested combs, brushes, wigs, hats, and bedding.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment involves washing the hair with a shampoo containing lindane (Kwell) or pyrethrin compounds with piperonyl butoxide (RID or R\&C Shampoo). The patient is instructed to shampoo the scalp and hair according to the product directions. After the hair is rinsed thoroughly, it is combed with a fine-toothed comb dipped in vinegar to remove any remaining nits or nit shells freed from the hair shafts. They are extremely difficult to remove and may have to be picked off one by one with the fingernails.

All articles, clothing, towels, and bedding that may have lice or nits should be washed in hot water-at least $54^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(130^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ or dry-cleaned to prevent re-infestation. Upholstered furniture, rugs, and floors should be vacuumed frequently. Combs and brushes are also disinfected with the shampoo. All family members and close contacts are treated. Complications such as severe pruritus, pyoderma, and dermatitis are treated with antipruritics, systemic antibiotics, and topical corticosteroids.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse informs the patient that head lice may infest anyone and are not a sign of uncleanliness. Because the condition spreads rapidly, treatment must be started immediately. School epidemics may be managed by having all of the students shampoo their hair on the same night. Students should be warned not to share combs, brushes, and hats. Each family member should be inspected for head lice daily for at least 2 weeks. The patient should be instructed that lindane may be toxic to the central nervous system when used improperly.

\section*{PEDICULOSIS CORPORIS AND PUBIS}

Pediculosis corporis is an infestation of the body by the body louse. This is a disease of unwashed people or those who live in close quarters and do not change their clothing. Pediculosis pubis is extremely common. The infestation is generally localized in the genital region and is transmitted chiefly by sexual contact.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Chiefly involved are those areas of the skin that come in closest contact with the underclothing (ie, neck, trunk, and thighs). The body louse lives primarily in the seams of underwear and clothing, to which it clings as it pierces the skin with its proboscis. Its bites cause characteristic minute hemorrhagic points. Widespread excoriation may appear as a result of intense itching and scratching, especially on the trunk and neck. Among the secondary lesions produced are parallel linear scratches and a slight degree of eczema. In long-standing cases, the skin may become thick, dry, and scaly, with dark pigmented areas.

Itching is the most common symptom of pediculosis pubis, particularly at night. Reddish brown dust (ie, excretions of the insects) may be found in the patient's underclothing. The pubic area should be examined with a magnifying glass for lice crawling down a hair shaft or nits cemented to the hair or at the junction with the skin. Infestation by pubic lice may coexist with sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, herpes, or syphilis. There may also be infestation of the hairs of the chest, armpit, beard, and eyelashes. Gray-blue macules may sometimes be seen on the trunk, thighs, and axillae as a result of either the reaction of the insects' saliva with bilirubin (converting it to biliverdin) or an excretion produced by the salivary glands of the louse.

\section*{Medical Management}

The patient is instructed to bathe with soap and water, after which lindane (Kwell) or 5\% permethrin (Elimite) is applied to affected areas of the skin and to hairy areas, according to the product directions. An alternative topical therapy is an over-thecounter strength of permethrin ( $1 \% \mathrm{Nix}$ ). If the eyelashes are involved, petrolatum may be thickly applied twice daily for 8 days, followed by mechanical removal of any remaining nits.

Complications, such as severe pruritus, pyoderma, and dermatitis, are treated with antipruritics, systemic antibiotics, and topical corticosteroids. Body lice can transmit epidemic rickettsial disease to humans such as epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever. The causative organism may be in the gastrointestinal tract of the insect and may be excreted on the skin surface of the infested person.

\section*{Nursing Management}

All family members and sexual contacts must be treated and educated in personal hygiene and methods to prevent or control infestation. The patient and partner must also be scheduled for a diagnostic workup for coexisting sexually transmitted disease. All clothing and bedding should be machine washed in hot water or dry-cleaned.

\section*{SCABIES}

Scabies is an infestation of the skin by the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The disease may be found in people living in substandard hygienic conditions, but it is also common in very clean individuals and among the sexually active, although infestations do not depend on sexual activity. The mites frequently involve the fingers, and hand contact may produce infection. In children, overnight stays with friends or the exchange of clothes may be a source of infection. Health care personnel who have prolonged hands-on physical contact with an infected patient may likewise become infected.

The adult female burrows into the superficial layer of the skin and remains there for the rest of her life. With her jaws and the sharp edges of the joints of her forelegs, the mite extends the burrow, laying two or three eggs daily for up to 2 months. She then dies. The larvae hatch from the eggs in 3 to 4 days and progress through larval and nymphal states to form adult mites in about 10 days.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

It takes approximately 4 weeks from the time of contact for the patient's symptoms to appear. The patient complains of severe itching caused by a delayed type of immunologic reaction to the mite or its fecal pellets. During examination, the patient is asked where the itch is most severe. A magnifying glass and a penlight are held at an oblique angle to the skin while a search is made for the small, raised burrows. The burrows may be multiple, straight or wavy, brown or black, threadlike lesions, most commonly observed between the fingers and on the wrists. Other sites are the extensor surfaces of the elbows, the knees, the edges of the feet, the points of the elbows, around the nipples, in the axillary folds, under pendulous breasts, and in or near the groin or gluteal fold, penis, or scrotum. Red, pruritic eruptions usually appear between adjacent skin areas. The burrow, however, is not always visible. Any patient with a rash may have scabies.

One classic sign of scabies is the increased itching that occurs at night, perhaps because the increased warmth of the skin has a stimulating effect on the parasite. Hypersensitivity to the organism and its products of excretion also may contribute to the itching. If the infection has spread, other members of the family and close friends also complain of itching about a month later.

Secondary lesions are quite common and include vesicles, papules, excoriations, and crusts. Bacterial superinfection may result from constant excoriation of the burrows and papules.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis is confirmed by recovering S. scabiei or the mites' byproducts from the skin. A sample of superficial epidermis is scraped off the top of the burrows or papules with a small scalpel blade. The scrapings are placed on a microscope slide and examined through a low-powered microscope to demonstrate the mite
at any stage (eg, egg, egg casing, larva, nymph, adult) and fecal pellets.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly patients living in long-term care facilities are more susceptible to outbreaks of scabies because of close living quarters, poor hygiene due to limited physical ability, and the potential for incidental spread of the organisms by nursing staff.

Although the older patient itches severely, the vivid inflammatory reaction seen in younger people seldom occurs. Scabies may not be recognized in the elderly person; the itching may erroneously be attributed to the dry skin of old age or to anxiety.

Health care personnel in extended-care facilities should wear gloves when providing hands-on care for a patient suspected of having scabies until the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment accomplished. It is advisable to treat all residents, staff, and families of patients at the same time to prevent reinfection. Because geriatric patients may be more sensitive to side effects of the scabicides, they should be closely observed for reactions.

\section*{Medical Management}

The patient is instructed to take a warm, soapy bath or shower to remove the scaling debris from the crusts and then to dry thoroughly and allow the skin to cool. A prescription scabicide, such as lindane (Kwell), crotamiton (Eurax), or 5\% permethrin (Elimite), is applied thinly to the entire skin from the neck down, sparing only the face and scalp (which are not affected in scabies). The medication is left on for 12 to 24 hours, after which the patient is instructed to wash thoroughly. One application may be curative, but it is advisable to repeat the treatment in 1 week.

> NURSING ALERT The patient must understand medication instructions, because application of a scabicide immediately after bathing and before the skin dries and cools increases percutaneous absorption of the scabicide and the potential for central nervous system abnormalities such as seizures.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient should wear clean clothing and sleep between freshly laundered bed linens. All bedding and clothing should be washed in hot water and dried on the hot dryer cycle, because the mites can survive up to 36 hours in linens. If bed linens or clothing cannot be washed in hot water, dry-cleaning is advised.

After treatment is completed, the patient should apply an ointment, such as a topical corticosteroid, to skin lesions because the scabicide may irritate the skin. The patient's hypersensitivity does not cease on destruction of the mites. Itching may continue for several weeks as a manifestation of hypersensitivity, particularly in atopic (allergic) people. This is not a sign that the treatment has failed. The patient is instructed not to apply more scabicide because it will cause more irritation and increased itching and advised not to take frequent hot showers because they can dry the skin and produce itching. Oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax) can help control the itching.

All family members and close contacts should be treated simultaneously to eliminate the mites. Some scabicides are approved for use in infants and pregnant women. If scabies is sexually
transmitted, the patient may require treatment for coexisting sexually transmitted disease. Scabies may also coexist with pediculosis.

\section*{Contact Dermatitis}

Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory reaction of the skin to physical, chemical, or biologic agents. The epidermis is damaged by repeated physical and chemical irritations. Contact dermatitis may be of the primary irritant type, in which a nonallergic reaction results from exposure to an irritating substance, or it may be allergic (ie, allergic contact dermatitis), resulting from exposure of sensitized people to contact allergens. Allergic dermatoses are discussed in Chapter 53. Common causes of irritant dermatitis are soaps, detergents, scouring compounds, and industrial chemicals. Predisposing factors include extremes of heat and cold, frequent contact with soap and water, and a preexisting skin disease (Chart 56-3).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The eruptions begin when the causative agent contacts the skin. The first reactions include itching, burning, and erythema, followed closely by edema, papules, vesicles, and oozing or weeping. In the subacute phase, these vesicular changes are less marked, and they alternate with crusting, drying, fissuring, and peeling. If repeated reactions occur or if the patient continually scratches the skin, lichenification and pigmentation occur. Secondary bacterial invasion may follow.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of management are to rest the involved skin and protect it from further damage. The distribution pattern of the reaction is determined to differentiate between allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. A detailed history is obtained. If indicated, the offending irritant is removed. Local irritation should be avoided, and soap is not generally used until healing occurs.

\section*{Chart 56-3 • PATIENT EDUCATION Strategies for Avoiding Contact Dermatitis}

The following precautions may help prevent repeated cases of contact dermatitis. Follow these instructions for at least 4 months after your skin appears to be completely healed.
- Study the pattern and location of your dermatitis and think about which things have touched your skin and which things may have caused the problem.
- Try to avoid contact with these materials.
- Avoid heat, soap, and rubbing, all of which are external irritants.
- Choose bath soaps, laundry detergents, and cosmetics that do not contain fragrance.
- Avoid using a fabric softener dryer sheet (Bounce, Cling). Fabric softeners that are added to the washer may be used.
- Avoid topical medications, lotions, or ointments, except those specifically prescribed for your condition.
- Wash your skin thoroughly immediately after exposure to possible irritants.
- When wearing gloves (for example, for washing dishes or general cleaning), be sure they are cotton-lined. Do not wear them more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time.

Many preparations are advocated for relieving dermatitis. In general, a bland, unmedicated lotion is used for small patches of erythema (ie, red, inflamed skin). Cool, wet dressings also are applied over small areas of vesicular dermatitis. Finely cracked ice added to the water often enhances its antipruritic effect.

Wet dressings usually help clear the oozing eczematous lesions. A thin layer of cream or ointment containing a corticosteroid then may be used. Medicated baths at room temperature are prescribed for larger areas of dermatitis. For severe, widespread conditions, a short course of systemic corticosteroids may be prescribed.

\section*{Noninfectious Inflammatory Dermatoses}

\section*{PSORIASIS}

Psoriasis is a chronic noninfectious inflammatory disease of the skin in which epidermal cells are produced at a rate that is about six to nine times faster than normal. The cells in the basal layer of the skin divide too quickly, and the newly formed cells move so rapidly to the skin surface that they become evident as profuse scales or plaques of epidermal tissue. The psoriatic epidermal cell may travel from the basal cell layer of the epidermis to the stratum corneum (ie, skin surface) and be cast off in 3 to 4 days, which is in sharp contrast to the normal 26 to 28 days. As a result of the increased number of basal cells and rapid cell passage, the normal events of cell maturation and growth cannot take place. This abnormal process does not allow the normal protective layers of the skin to form.

One of the most common skin diseases, psoriasis affects approximately $2 \%$ of the population, appearing more often in people who have a European ancestry. It is thought that the condition stems from a hereditary defect that causes overproduction of keratin. Although the primary cause is unknown, a combination of specific genetic makeup and environmental stimuli may trigger the onset of disease. There is some evidence that the cell proliferation is mediated by the immune system. Periods of emotional stress and anxiety aggravate the condition. Trauma, infections, and seasonal and hormonal changes also are trigger factors. The onset may occur at any age but is most common between the ages of 15 and 50 years. Psoriasis has a tendency to improve and then recur periodically throughout life (Champion et al., 1998).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Lesions appear as red, raised patches of skin covered with silvery scales. The scaly patches are formed by the buildup of living and dead skin resulting from the vast increase in the rate of skin-cell growth and turnover (Fig. 56-4). If the scales are scraped away, the dark red base of the lesion is exposed, producing multiple bleeding points. These patches are not moist and may be pruritic. One variation of this condition is called guttate psoriasis because the lesions remain about 1 cm wide and are scattered like raindrops over the body. This variation is believed to be associated with a recent streptococcal throat infection. Psoriasis may range in severity from a cosmetic source of annoyance to a physically disabling and disfiguring disorder.

Particular sites of the body tend to be affected most by this condition; they include the scalp, the extensor surface of the elbows and knees, the lower part of the back, and the genitalia. Bilateral symmetry is a feature of psoriasis. In approximately one fourth to one half of patients, the nails are involved, with pitting, discoloration, crumbling beneath the free edges, and separation of the nail plate. When psoriasis occurs on the palms and soles, it can cause pustular lesions called palmar pustular psoriasis.

\section*{Complications}

The disease may be associated with asymmetric rheumatoid factornegative arthritis of multiple joints. The arthritic development can occur before or after the skin lesions appear. The relation between arthritis and psoriasis is not understood. Another complication is an exfoliative psoriatic state in which the disease progresses to involve the total body surface, called erythrodermic psoriasis. In this case, the patient is more acutely ill, with fever, chills, and an electrolyte imbalance. Erythrodermic psoriasis often appears in people with chronic psoriasis after infections or after exposure to certain medications, including withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids (Champion et al., 1998).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The presence of the classic plaque-type lesions generally confirms the diagnosis of psoriasis. Because the lesions tend to change histologically as they progress from early to chronic plaques, biopsy
of the skin is of little diagnostic value. There are no specific blood tests helpful in diagnosing the condition. When in doubt, the health professional should assess for signs of nail and scalp involvement and for a positive family history.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of management are to slow the rapid turnover of epidermis, to promote resolution of the psoriatic lesions, and to control the natural cycles of the disease. There is no known cure.

The therapeutic approach should be one that the patient understands; it should be cosmetically acceptable and not too disruptive of lifestyle. Treatment involves the commitment of time and effort by the patient and possibly the family. First, any precipitating or aggravating factors are addressed. An assessment is made of lifestyle, because psoriasis is significantly affected by stress. The patient is informed that treatment of severe psoriasis can be time consuming, expensive, and aesthetically unappealing at times.

The most important principle of psoriasis treatment is gentle removal of scales. This can be accomplished with baths. Oils (eg, olive oil, mineral oil, Aveeno Oilated Oatmeal Bath) or coal tar preparations (eg, Balnetar) can be added to the bath water and a soft brush used to scrub the psoriatic plaques gently. After bathing, the application of emollient creams containing alphahydroxy acids (eg, Lac-Hydrin, Penederm) or salicylic acid will continue to soften thick scales. The patient and family should be encouraged to establish a regular skin care routine that can be maintained even when the psoriasis is not in an acute stage.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Three types of therapy are standard: topical, intralesional, and systemic (Table 56-7).

Topical Agents. Topically applied agents are used to slow the overactive epidermis without affecting other tissues. Medications include tar preparations, anthralin, salicylic acid, and corticosteroids. Two topical treatments introduced within the last few years are a vitamin D preparation, calcipotriene (Dovonex), and

a retinoid compound, tazarotene (Tazorac). Treatment with these agents tends to suppress epidermopoiesis (ie, development of epidermal cells) and cause sloughing of the rapidly growing epidermal cells.

Topical formulations include lotions, ointments, pastes, creams, and shampoos. Older treatments, including tar baths and application of tar preparations on involved skin, are rarely used. Tar and anthralin cause irritation of the skin at the sites of application, are malodorous and difficult to apply, and do not give reliable results. Newer preparations that cause less irritation and have more consistent results are becoming more widely used.

Topical corticosteroids may be applied for their antiinflammatory effect. Choosing the correct strength of corticosteroid for the involved site and choosing the most effective vehicle base are important aspects of topical treatment. In general, highpotency topical corticosteroids should not be used on the face and intertriginous areas, and their use on other areas should be limited to a 4-week course of twice-daily applications. A 2-week break should be taken before repeating treatment with the high-potency corticosteroids. For long-term therapy, moderate-potency corticosteroids are used. On the face and intertriginous areas, only low-potency corticosteroids are appropriate for long-term use (see Table 56-4).

Occlusive dressings may be applied to increase the effectiveness of the corticosteroid. For the hospitalized patient, large plastic bags may be used-one for the upper body with openings cut for the head and arms and one for the lower body with openings for the legs. This leaves only the extremities to wrap. In some dermatologic units, large rolls of tubular plastic are used, such as those used by dry-cleaners. For patients being treated at home, a vinyl jogging suit may be used. The medication is applied, and the suit is put on over it. The hands can be wrapped in gloves, the feet in plastic bags, and the head in a shower cap. Occlusive dressings should not remain in place longer than 8 hours. The nurse should very carefully inspect the skin for the appearance of atrophy and telangiectasias which are side effects of corticosteroids.

> NURSING ALERT When plastic substances are used, the nurse needs to check for flammability. Some thin plastic films burn slowly (if touched by a lighted cigarette), whereas others burst rapidly into flame. The patient should be cautioned not to smoke while wrapped in plastic dressing.

When psoriasis involves large areas of the body, topical corticosteroid treatment can become expensive and involve some systemic risk. Some potent corticosteroids, when applied to large areas of the body, have the potential to cause adrenal suppression through percutaneous absorption of the medication. In this event, other treatment modalities (eg, nonsteroidal topical medications, ultraviolet light) may be used instead or in combination to decrease the need for corticosteroids.

Newer nonsteroidal topical preparations are available and effective for many patients. Calcipotriene $0.05 \%$ (Dovonex) is a derivative of vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$. It works to decrease the mitotic turnover of the psoriatic plaques. Its most common side effect is local irritation, and the intertriginous areas and face should be avoided when using this medication. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of hypercalcemia. It is available as a cream for use on the body and a solution for the scalp. Calcipotriene is not recommended for use by elderly patients because of their more fragile skin or for pregnant or lactating women.

The second advance in topical treatment of psoriasis is tazarotene (Tazorac). Tazarotene, a retinoid, causes sloughing of the scales
covering psoriatic plaques. As with other retinoids, it causes increased sensitivity to sunlight, so patients should be cautioned to use an effective sunscreen and avoid other photosensitizers (eg, tetracycline, antihistamines). Tazarotene is listed as a Category X drug in pregnancy; reports indicate evidence of fetal risk, and the risk of use in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefits. A negative result on a pregnancy test should be obtained before initiating this medication, and an effective contraceptive should be continued during treatment. Side effects of tazarotene include burning, erythema, or irritation at the site of application and worsening of psoriasis.

Intralesional Agents. Intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide (Aristocort, Kenalog-10, Trymex) can be administered directly into highly visible or isolated patches of psoriasis that are resistant to other forms of therapy. Care must be taken to ensure that normal skin is not injected with the medication.

Systemic Agents. Although systemic corticosteroids may cause rapid improvement of psoriasis, their usual risks and the possibility of triggering a severe flare-up on withdrawal limit their use. Systemic cytotoxic preparations, such as methotrexate, have been used in treating extensive psoriasis that fails to respond to other forms of therapy. Other systemic medications in current use include hydroxyurea (Hydrea) and cyclosporine A (CyA).

Methotrexate appears to inhibit DNA synthesis in epidermal cells, thereby reducing the turnover time of the psoriatic epidermis. However, the medication can be toxic, especially to the liver, which can suffer irreversible damage. Laboratory studies must be monitored to ensure that the hepatic, hematopoietic, and renal systems are functioning adequately. Bone marrow suppression is another potential side effect. The patient should avoid drinking alcohol while taking methotrexate, because alcohol ingestion increases the possibility of liver damage. The medication is teratogenic (ie, producing physical defects in the fetus) and should not be administered to pregnant women.

Hydroxyurea also inhibits cell replication by affecting DNA synthesis. The patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of bone marrow depression.

Cyclosporine A, a cyclic peptide used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, has shown some success in treating severe, therapy-resistant cases of psoriasis. Its use, however, is limited by side effects such as hypertension and nephrotoxicity.

Oral retinoids (ie, synthetic derivatives of vitamin A and its metabolite, vitamin A acid) modulate the growth and differentiation of epithelial tissue. Etretinate is especially useful for severe pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. Etretinate is a teratogen with a very long half-life; it cannot be used in women with childbearing potential.

\section*{PHOTOCHEMOTHERAPY}

One treatment for severely debilitating psoriasis is a psoralen medication combined with ultraviolet-A (PUVA) light therapy. Ultraviolet light is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum containing wavelengths ranging from 180 to 400 nm . In this treatment, the patient takes a photosensitizing medication (usually 8-methoxypsoralen) in a standard dose and is subsequently exposed to long-wave ultraviolet light as the medication plasma levels peak. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it is thought that when psoralen-treated skin is exposed to ultraviolet-A light, the psoralen binds with DNA and decreases cellular proliferation. PUVA is not without its hazards;
it has been associated with long-term risks of skin cancer, cataracts, and premature aging of the skin.

The PUVA unit consists of a chamber that contains highoutput black-light lamps and an external reflectance system. The exposure time is calibrated according to the specific unit in use and the anticipated tolerance of the patient's skin. The patient is usually treated two or three times each week until the psoriasis clears. An interim period of 48 hours between treatments is necessary because it takes this long for any burns resulting from PUVA therapy to become evident.

After the psoriasis clears, the patient begins a maintenance program. Once little or no disease is active, less potent therapies are used to keep minor flare-ups under control.

Ultraviolet-B (UVB) light therapy is also used to treat generalized plaques. UVB light ranges from 270 to 350 nm , although research has shown that a narrow range, 310 to 312 nm , is the action spectrum. It is used alone or combined with topical coal tar. Side effects are similar to those of PUVA therapy. A new development in light therapy is the narrow-band UVB, which ranges from 311 to 312 nm , decreasing exposure to harmful ultraviolet energy while providing more intense, specific therapy (Shelk \& Morgan, 2000).

If access to a light treatment unit is not feasible, the patient can expose himself or herself to sunlight. The risks of all light treatments are similar and include acute sunburn reaction; exacerbation of photosensitive disorders such as lupus, rosacea, and polymorphic light eruption; and other skin changes such as increased wrinkles, thickening, and an increased risk for skin cancer.

Excimer lasers have come into use in treating psoriasis. These lasers function at 308 nm . Studies show that medium-sized psoriatic plaques clear in four to six treatments and remain clear for up to 9 months. A laser can be more effective on the scalp or on other hard-to-treat areas, because the laser can be aimed very specifically on the plaque (Lebwohl, 2000). Table 56-7 summarizes the treatment plans.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH PSORIASIS}

\section*{Assessment}

The nursing assessment focuses on how the patient is coping with the psoriatic skin condition, appearance of the normal skin, and appearance of the skin lesions, as described previously. The notable manifestations are red, scaling papules that coalesce to form oval, well-defined plaques. Silver-white scales may also be present. Adjacent skin areas show red, smooth plaques with a macerated surface. It is important to examine the areas especially prone to psoriasis: elbows, knees, scalp, gluteal cleft, fingers, and toenails (for small pits).

Psoriasis may cause despair and frustration for the patient; observers may stare, comment, ask embarrassing questions, or even avoid the person. The disease can eventually exhaust the patient's resources, interfere with his or her job, and make life miserable in general. Teenagers are especially vulnerable to the psychological effects of this disorder. The family, too, is affected, because timeconsuming treatments, messy salves, and constant shedding of scales may disrupt home life and cause resentment. The patient's frustrations may be expressed through hostility directed at health care personnel and others.

The nurse assesses the impact of the disease on the patient and the coping strategies used for conducting normal activities and interactions with family and friends. Many patients need reassurance that the condition is not infectious, not a reflection of poor personal hygiene, and not skin cancer.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the nursing assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge about the disease process and treatment
- Impaired skin integrity related to lesions and inflammatory response
- Disturbed body image related to embarrassment over appearance and self-perception of uncleanliness

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications include the following:
- Infection
- Psoriatic arthritis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Major goals for the patient may include increased understanding of psoriasis and the treatment regimen, achievement of smoother skin with control of lesions, development of self-acceptance, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING}

The nurse explains with sensitivity that, although there is no cure for psoriasis and lifetime management is necessary, the condition can usually be controlled. The pathophysiology of psoriasis is reviewed, as are the factors that provoke it-irritation or injury to the skin (eg, cut, abrasion, sunburn), current illness (eg, pharyngeal streptococcal infection), and emotional stress. It is emphasized that repeated trauma to the skin and an unfavorable environment (eg, cold) or a specific medication (eg, lithium, betablockers, indomethacin) may exacerbate psoriasis. The patient is cautioned about taking any nonprescription medications because some may aggravate mild psoriasis.

Reviewing and explaining the treatment regimen are essential to ensure compliance. For example, if the patient has a mild condition confined to localized areas, such as the elbows or knees, application of an emollient to maintain softness and minimize scaling may be all that is required. However, if the patient uses anthralin, the dosage schedule, possible side effects, and problems to report to the nurse or physician should be explained.

Most patients need a comprehensive plan of care that ranges from using topical medications and shampoos to more complex and lengthy treatment with systemic medications and photochemotherapy, such as PUVA therapy. Patient education materials that include a description of the therapy and specific guidelines are helpful but cannot replace face-to-face discussions of the treatment plan.

\section*{INCREASING SKIN INTEGRITY}

To avoid injuring the skin, the patient is advised not to pick at or scratch the affected areas. Measures to prevent dry skin are encouraged because dry skin worsens psoriasis. Too-frequent washing produces more soreness and scaling. Water should be warm, not hot, and the skin should be dried by patting with a towel rather than by rubbing. Emollients have a moisturizing effect,
providing an occlusive film on the skin surface so that normal water loss through the skin is halted and allowing the trapped water to hydrate the stratum corneum. A bath oil or emollient cleansing agent can comfort sore and scaling skin. Softening the skin can prevent fissures (see Plan of Nursing Care 56-1).

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-CONCEPT AND BODY IMAGE}

A therapeutic relationship between health care professionals and the patient with psoriasis is one that includes education and support. After the treatment regimen is established, the patient should begin to feel more confident and empowered in carrying it out and in using coping strategies that help deal with the altered selfconcept and body image brought about by the disease. Introducing the patient to successful coping strategies used by others with psoriasis and making suggestions for reducing or coping with stressful situations at home, school, and work can facilitate a more positive outlook and acceptance of the chronicity of the disease.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Psoriatic Arthritis}

The diagnosis of psoriasis, especially when it is accompanied by the complication of arthritis, is usually difficult to make. Psoriatic arthritis involving the sacroiliac and distal joints of the fingers may be overlooked, especially if the patient has the typical psoriatic lesions. However, patients who complain of mild joint discomfort and some pitting of the fingernails may not be diagnosed with psoriasis until the more obvious cutaneous lesions appear.

The complaint of joint discomfort in the patient with psoriasis should be noted and evaluated. The symptoms of psoriatic arthritis can mimic the symptoms of Reiter's disease and ankylosing spondylitis, and a definitive diagnosis must be made. Treatment of the condition usually involves joint rest, application of heat, and salicylates.

The patient requires education about the care and treatment of the involved joints and the need for compliance with therapy. The incidence of psoriatic arthropathy is unknown because the symptoms are so variable. It is believed, however, that when the psoriasis is extensive and a family history of inflammatory arthritis is elicited, the chance that the patient will develop psoriatic arthritis increases substantially. It is recommended that a rheumatologist be consulted to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of the arthropathy.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Printed patient education materials may be provided to reinforce face-to-face discussions about treatment guidelines and other con-
siderations. For example, the patient and the family caregiver may need to know that the topical agent anthralin leaves a brownish purple stain on the skin but that the discoloration subsides after anthralin treatment stops. The patient should also be instructed to cover lesions treated with anthralin with gauze, stockinette, or other soft coverings to avoid staining clothing, furniture, and bed linens.

Patients using topical corticosteroid preparations repeatedly on the face and around the eyes should be aware that cataract development is possible. Strict guidelines for applying these medications should be emphasized because overuse can result in skin atrophy, striae, and medication resistance.

Photochemotherapy (PUVA), which is reserved for moderate to severe psoriasis, produces photosensitization, which means that the skin is sensitive to the sun until methoxsalen has been excreted from the body in about 6 to 8 hours. Patients undergoing PUVA treatments should avoid exposure to the sun. If exposure is unavoidable, the skin must be protected with sunscreen and clothing. Gray- or green-tinted, wraparound sunglasses should be worn to protect the eyes during and after treatment, and ophthalmologic examinations should be performed on a regular basis. Nausea, which may be a problem in some patients, is lessened when methoxsalen is taken with food. Lubricants and bath oils may be used to help remove scales and prevent excessive dryness. No other creams or oils are to be used except on areas that have been shielded from ultraviolet light. Contraceptives should be used by sexually active women of reproductive age, because the teratogenic effect of PUVA has not been determined. The patient is kept under constant and careful supervision and is encouraged to recognize unusual changes in the skin.

If indicated, referral may be made to a mental health professional who can help to ease emotional strain and give support. Belonging to a support group may also help patients acknowledge that they are not alone in experiencing life adjustments in response to a visible, chronic disease. The National Psoriasis Foundation publishes periodic bulletins and reports about new and relevant developments in this condition.

\section*{EXFOLIATIVE DERMATITIS}

Exfoliative dermatitis is a serious condition characterized by progressive inflammation in which erythema and scaling occur in a more or less generalized distribution. It may be associated with chills, fever, prostration, severe toxicity, and an itchy scaling of the skin. There is a profound loss of stratum corneum (ie, outermost layer of the skin), which causes capillary leakage, hypoproteinemia, and negative nitrogen balance. Because of widespread dilation of cutaneous vessels, large amounts of body heat are lost, and exfoliative dermatitis has a marked effect on the entire body.

Exfoliative dermatitis has a variety of causes. It is considered to be a secondary or reactive process to an underlying skin or systemic disease. It may appear as a part of the lymphoma group of diseases and may precede the appearance of lymphoma. Preexisting skin disorders that have been implicated as a cause include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis. It also appears as a severe reaction to many medications, including penicillin and phenylbutazone. The cause is unknown in approximately $25 \%$ of cases (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

This condition starts acutely as a patchy or a generalized erythematous eruption accompanied by fever, malaise, and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms. The skin color changes from pink to dark red. After a week, the characteristic exfoliation (ie, scaling) begins, usually in the form of thin flakes that leave the underlying skin smooth and red, with new scales forming as the older ones come off. Hair loss may accompany this disorder. Relapses are common. The systemic effects include high-output heart failure, intestinal disturbances, breast enlargement, elevated levels of uric acid in the blood (ie, hyperuricemia), and temperature disturbances.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of management are to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and to prevent infection. The treatment is individualized and supportive and should be initiated as soon as the condition is diagnosed.

The patient may be hospitalized and placed on bed rest. All medications that may be implicated are discontinued. A comfortable room temperature should be maintained because the patient does not have normal thermoregulatory control as a result of temperature fluctuations caused by vasodilation and evaporative water loss. Fluid and electrolyte balance must be maintained because there is considerable water and protein loss from the skin surface. Plasma volume expanders may be indicated.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Continual nursing assessment is carried out to detect infection. The disrupted, erythematous, moist skin is susceptible to infection and becomes colonized with pathogenic organisms, which produce more inflammation. Antibiotics, prescribed if infection is present, are selected on the basis of culture and sensitivity.

NURSING ALERT The nurse observes the patient for signs and symptoms of heart failure because hyperemia and increased cutaneous blood flow can produce high-output cardiac failure.

Hypothermia may occur because increased blood flow in the skin, coupled with increased water loss through the skin, leads to heat loss by radiation, conduction, and evaporation. Changes in vital signs are closely monitored and reported.

As in any acute dermatitis, topical therapy is used to provide symptomatic relief. Soothing baths, compresses, and lubrication with emollients are used to treat the extensive dermatitis. The patient is likely to be extremely irritable because of the severe itching. Oral or parenteral corticosteroids may be prescribed when the disease is not controlled by more conservative therapy. When a specific cause is known, more specific therapy may be used. The patient is advised to avoid all irritants in the future, particularly medications.

\section*{Blistering Diseases}

Blisters of the skin have many origins, including bacterial, fungal, or viral infections; allergic contact reactions; burns; metabolic disorders; and immunologically mediated reactions. Some of these have been discussed previously (eg, herpes simplex and zoster infections, contact dermatitis). Immunologically mediated diseases are autoimmune reactions and represent a defect of IgM, IgE, IgG , and C 3 . Some of these conditions are life-threatening; others become chronic problems.

The diagnosis is always made by histologic examination of a biopsy specimen by a dermatopathologist. A specimen from the blister and surrounding skin demonstrates acantholysis (ie, separation of epidermal cells from each other because of damage to or an abnormality of the intracellular substance). Circulating antibodies may be detected by immunofluorescent studies of the patient's serum.

\section*{PEMPHIGUS}

Pemphigus is a group of serious diseases of the skin characterized by the appearance of bullae (ie, blisters) of various sizes on apparently normal skin (Fig. 56-5) and mucous membranes. Available evidence indicates that pemphigus is an autoimmune disease involving immunoglobulin G. It is thought that the pemphigus antibody is directed against a specific cell-surface antigen in epidermal cells. A blister forms from the antigen-antibody reaction. The level of serum antibody is predictive of disease severity. Genetic factors may also play a role in its development, with the highest incidence among those of Jewish or Mediterranean descent. This disorder usually occurs in men and women in middle and late adulthood. The condition may be associated with penicillins and captopril and with myasthenia gravis.

EIGURE 56-5 Vesicles on the chin (in pemphigus). Sauer, G. C. (1985). Manual of Skin Diseases. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Most patients present with oral lesions appearing as irregularly shaped erosions that are painful, bleed easily, and heal slowly. The skin bullae enlarge, rupture, and leave large, painful eroded areas that are accompanied by crusting and oozing. A characteristic offensive odor emanates from the bullae and the exuding serum. There is blistering or sloughing of uninvolved skin when minimal pressure is applied (ie, Nikolsky's sign). The eroded skin heals slowly, and huge areas of the body eventually are involved. Bacterial superinfection is common.

\section*{Complications}

The most common complications of pemphigus vulgaris arise when the disease process is widespread. Before the advent of corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, patients were very susceptible to secondary bacterial infection. Skin bacteria have relatively easy access to the bullae as they ooze, rupture, and leave denuded areas that are open to the environment. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance results from the loss of both fluid and protein as the bullae rupture. Hypoalbuminemia is common when the disease process includes extensive areas of the body skin surface and mucous membranes.

\section*{Management}

The goals of therapy are to bring the disease under control as rapidly as possible, to prevent loss of serum and the development of secondary infection, and to promote re-epithelization (ie, renewal of epithelial tissue).

Corticosteroids are administered in high doses to control the disease and keep the skin free of blisters. The high dosage level is maintained until remission is apparent. In some cases, corticosteroid therapy must be maintained for life.

Corticosteroids are administered with or immediately after a meal and may be accompanied by an antacid as prophylaxis against gastric complications. Essential to therapeutic management are daily evaluations of body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and fluid balance. High-dose corticosteroid therapy has its own serious toxic effects (see Chap. 42).

Immunosuppressive agents (eg, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, gold) may be prescribed to help control the disease and reduce the corticosteroid dose. Plasmapheresis (ie, plasma exchange) temporarily decreases the serum antibody level and has been used with variable success, although it is generally reserved for life-threatening cases.

\section*{BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID}

Bullous pemphigoid is an acquired disease of flaccid blisters appearing on normal or erythematous skin. It appears more often on the flexor surfaces of the arms, legs, axilla, and groin. Oral lesions, if present, are usually transient and minimal. When the blisters break, the skin has shallow erosions that heal fairly quickly. Pruritus can be intense, even before the appearance of the blisters. Bullous pemphigoid is common in the elderly, with a peak incidence at about 60 years of age. There is no gender or racial predilection, and the disease can be found throughout the world.

\section*{Management}

Medical treatment includes topical corticosteroids for localized eruptions and systemic corticosteroids for widespread involvement. Systemic prednisone may be continued for months, in alternateday doses. The patient needs to understand the implications of long-term corticosteroid therapy, including loss of bone mass, osteoporosis, cataracts, peptic ulcers, psychotic reactions, increased risk for infection, weight gain from fluid retention, and the potential for adrenal suppression.

\section*{DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS}

Dermatitis herpetiformis is an intensely pruritic, chronic disease that manifests with small, tense blisters that are distributed symmetrically over the elbows, knees, buttocks, and nape of the neck. It is most common between the ages of 20 and 40 years but can appear at any age. Most patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have a subclinical defect in gluten metabolism.

\section*{Management}

Most patients respond to dapsone (combination of tetracycline and nicotinamide) and to a gluten-free diet. All patients should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, because dapsone can induce severe hemolysis in those with this deficiency. Patients benefit from dietary counseling because the dietary restrictions are lifelong, and a gluten-free diet is often difficult to follow. They need emotional support as they deal with the process of learning new habits and accepting major changes in their life.

\section*{HERPES GESTATIONIS}

Herpes gestationis is a disease that occurs during or shortly after pregnancy. It shares several clinical features with bullous pemphigoid, and despite its name, it has no relation to the herpes virus. This disease is uncommon, with an incidence of approximately 1 case in every 50,000 pregnancies. It appears in the second or third trimester. It begins with urticarial papules on the abdomen and spreads to the trunk and extremities. It usually resolves within a few weeks of delivery but can recur in subsequent pregnancies, with menses, or with the use of oral contraceptives (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{Management}

Herpes gestationis is best managed with systemic corticosteroids. There is debate about whether there is any risk for fetal morbidity or mortality in babies born to mothers with herpes gestationis. As in other blistering diseases, special attention is required to prevent secondary infection.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH BLISTERING DISEASES}

\section*{Assessment}

Patients with blistering disorders may experience significant disability. There is constant itching and possible pain in the denuded areas of skin. There may be drainage from the denuded areas, which may be malodorous. Effective assessment and nursing management become a challenge.

Disease activity is monitored clinically by examining the skin for the appearance of new blisters. Areas where healing has occurred may show signs of hyperpigmentation. Particular attention is given to assessing for signs and symptoms of infection.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on nursing assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain of skin and oral cavity related to blistering and erosions
- Impaired skin integrity related to ruptured bullae and denuded areas of the skin
- Anxiety and ineffective coping related to the appearance of the skin and no hope of a cure
- Deficient knowledge about medications and side effects

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications include the following:
- Infection and sepsis related to loss of protective barrier of skin and mucous membranes
- Fluid volume deficit and electrolyte imbalance related to loss of tissue fluids

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of discomfort from lesions, skin healing, reduced anxiety and improved coping capacity, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING ORAL DISCOMFORT}

The patient's entire oral cavity may be affected with erosions and denuded surfaces. A necrotic slough may develop over these areas, adding to the patient's discomfort and interfering with food intake. Weight loss and hypoproteinemia may result. Meticulous oral hygiene is important to keep the oral mucosa clean and allow the epithelium to regenerate. Frequent rinsing of the mouth is prescribed to rid the mouth of debris and to soothe ulcerated areas. Commercial mouthwashes are avoided. The lips are kept moist with lanolin, petrolatum, or lip balm. Cool mist therapy helps to humidify environmental air.

\section*{ENHANCING SKIN INTEGRITY AND RELIEVING DISCOMFORT}

Cool, wet dressings or baths are protective and soothing. The patient with painful and extensive lesions should be premedicated with analgesics before skin care is initiated. Patients with large
areas of blistering have a characteristic odor that decreases when secondary infection is controlled. After the patient's skin is bathed, it is dried carefully and dusted liberally with nonirritating powder, which enables the patient to move freely in bed. Fairly large amounts are necessary to keep the patient's skin from sticking to the sheets. Tape should never be used on the skin because it may produce more blisters. Hypothermia is common, and measures to keep the patient warm and comfortable are priority nursing activities. The nursing management of patients with bullous skin conditions is similar to that for patients with extensive burns (see Chap. 57).

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Attention to the psychological needs of the patient requires listening to the patient, being available, giving expert nursing care, and educating the patient and the family. The patient is encouraged to express freely anxieties, discomfort, and feelings of hopelessness. Arranging for a family member or a close friend to spend more time with the patient can be supportive. When patients receive information about the disease and its treatment, uncertainty and anxiety are reduced, and the patient's capacity to act on his or her own behalf is enhanced. Referral for psychological counseling may assist the patient in dealing with fears, anxiety, and depression.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Infection and Sepsis}

The patient is susceptible to infection because the barrier function of the skin is compromised. Bullae are also susceptible to infection, and sepsis may follow. The skin is cleaned to remove debris and dead skin and to prevent infection.

Secondary infection may be accompanied by an offensive odor from skin or oral lesions. C. albicans of the mouth (ie, thrush) commonly affects patients receiving high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The oral cavity is inspected daily, and any changes are reported. Oral lesions are slow to heal.

Infection is the leading cause of death in patients with blistering diseases. Particular attention is given to assessment for signs and symptoms of local and systemic infection. Seemingly trivial complaints or minimal changes are investigated, because corticosteroids can mask or alter typical signs and symptoms of infection. The patient's vital signs are taken, and temperature fluctuations are monitored. The patient is observed for chills, and all secretions and excretions are monitored for changes suggesting infection. Results of culture and sensitivity tests are monitored. Antimicrobial agents are administered as prescribed, and response to treatment is assessed. Health care personnel must perform effective hand hygiene and wear gloves.

In the hospitalized patient, environmental contamination is reduced as much as possible. Protective isolation measures and standard precautions are warranted.

\section*{Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance}

Extensive denudation of the skin leads to fluid and electrolyte imbalance because of significant loss of fluids and sodium chloride from the skin. This sodium chloride loss is responsible for many of the systemic symptoms associated with the disease and is treated by intravenous administration of saline solution.

A large amount of protein and blood is lost from the denuded skin areas. Blood component therapy may be prescribed to maintain the blood volume, hemoglobin level, and plasma protein
concentration. Serum albumin, protein, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values are monitored.

The patient is encouraged to maintain adequate oral fluid intake. Cool, nonirritating fluids are encouraged to maintain hydration. Small, frequent meals or snacks of high-protein, highcalorie foods (eg, Ensure, Sustacal, eggnog, milkshakes) help maintain nutritional status. Parenteral nutrition is considered if the patient cannot eat an adequate diet.

\section*{TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS AND STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME}

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are potentially fatal skin disorders and the most severe form of erythema multiforme. The mortality rate from TEN approaches $30 \%$. Both conditions are triggered by a reaction to medications or result from a viral infection. Antibiotics, antiseizure agents, butazones, and sulfonamides are the most frequent medications implicated in TEN and SJS (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

TEN and SJS are characterized initially by conjunctival burning or itching, cutaneous tenderness, fever, cough, sore throat, headache, extreme malaise, and myalgias (ie, aches and pains). These signs are followed by a rapid onset of erythema involving much of the skin surface and mucous membranes, including the oral mucosa, conjunctiva, and genitalia. In severe cases of mucosal involvement, there may be danger of damage to the larynx, bronchi, and esophagus from ulcerations. Large, flaccid bullae develop in
some areas; in other areas, large sheets of epidermis are shed, exposing the underlying dermis. Fingernails, toenails, eyebrows, and eyelashes may be shed along with the surrounding epidermis. The skin is excruciatingly tender, and the loss of skin leaves a weeping surface similar to that of a total-body, partial-thickness burn; hence the condition is also referred to as scalded skin syndrome.

These conditions occur in all ages and both genders. The incidence is increased in older people because of their use of many medications. People with HIV, particularly those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and others who are immunocompromised are at higher risk for SJS and TEN. Although the incidence of TEN and SJS in the general population is about 3 cases per 1 million person-years, the risk associated with sulfonamides in HIV-positive individuals may approach 1 case per 1000 (Odom et al., 2000). Most patients with TEN have an abnormal metabolism of the culprit medication, and the mechanism leading to TEN seems to be a cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction (Wolkenstein, 2000).

\section*{Complications}

Sepsis and keratoconjunctivitis are complications of TEN and SJS. Unrecognized and untreated sepsis can be life-threatening. Keratoconjunctivitis can impair vision and result in conjunctival retraction, scarring, and corneal lesions.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Histologic studies of frozen skin cells from a fresh lesion and cytodiagnosis of collections of cellular material from a freshly denuded area are performed. A history of ingestion of medications known to precipitate TEN or SJS may confirm medication reaction as the underlying cause.

Immunofluorescent studies may be performed to detect atypical epidermal autoantibodies. A genetic predisposition to erythema multiforme has been suggested but is not confirmed for all cases.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of treatment include control of fluid and electrolyte balance, prevention of sepsis, and prevention of ophthalmic complications. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment.

All nonessential medications are discontinued immediately. If possible, the patient is treated in a regional burn center, because aggressive treatment similar to that for severe burns is required. Skin loss may approach $100 \%$ of the total body surface area. Surgical débridement or hydrotherapy in a Hubbard tank (ie, large, steel tub) may be performed to remove involved skin.

Tissue samples from the nasopharynx, eyes, ears, blood, urine, skin, and unruptured blisters are obtained for culture to identify pathogenic organisms. Intravenous fluids are prescribed to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, especially in the patient who has severe mucosal involvement and who cannot easily take oral nourishment. Because an indwelling intravenous catheter may be a site of infection, fluid replacement is carried out by nasogastric tube and then orally as soon as possible.

Initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids is controversial. Some experts argue for early high-dose corticosteroid treatment. However, in most cases, the risk for infection, the complication of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, the delay in the healing process, and the difficulty in initiating oral corticosteroids early in the course of the disease outweigh the perceived benefits. In patients
with TEN thought to result from a medication reaction, corticosteroids may be administered; however, the patients should be closely monitored for the previously stated adverse effects.

One report stated that intravenous administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG) to 10 patients led to improvement within 48 hours and skin healing within 1 week. This response is dramatically better than that obtained with immunosuppressives, and IVIG may soon become the treatment of choice (Rutter \& Luger, 2001).

Protecting the skin with topical agents is crucial. Various topical antibacterial and anesthetic agents are used to prevent wound sepsis and to assist with pain management. Systemic antibiotic therapy is used with extreme caution. Temporary biologic dressings (eg, pigskin, amniotic membrane) or plastic semipermeable dressings (eg, Vigilon) may be used to reduce pain, decrease evaporation, and prevent secondary infection until the epithelium regenerates. Meticulous oropharyngeal and eye care is essential when there is severe involvement of the mucous membranes and the eyes.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS}

\section*{Assessment}

A careful inspection of the skin is made, including its appearance and the extent of involvement. The normal skin is closely observed to determine if new areas of blisters are developing. Seepage from blisters is monitored for amount, color, and odor. Inspection of the oral cavity for blistering and erosive lesions is performed daily; the patient is assessed daily for itching, burning, and dryness of the eyes. The patient's ability to swallow and drink fluids, as well as speak normally, is determined.

The patient's vital signs are monitored, and special attention is given to the presence and character of fever and the respiratory rate, depth, rhythm, and cough. The characteristics and amount of respiratory secretions are reviewed. Assessment for high fever, tachycardia, and extreme weakness and fatigue is essential, because these factors indicate the process of epidermal necrosis, increased metabolic needs, and possible gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosal sloughing. Urine volume, specific gravity, and color are monitored. The insertion sites of intravenous lines are inspected for signs of local infection. Daily body weights are recorded.

The patient is asked to describe fatigue and pain levels. An attempt is made to evaluate the patient's level of anxiety. The patient's basic coping mechanisms are assessed, and effective coping strategies are identified.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Impaired tissue integrity (ie, oral, eye, and skin) related to epidermal shedding
- Deficient fluid volume and electrolyte losses related to loss of fluids from denuded skin
- Risk for imbalanced body temperature (ie, hypothermia) related to heat loss secondary to skin loss
- Acute pain related to denuded skin, oral lesions, and possible infection
- Anxiety related to the physical appearance of the skin and prognosis

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications include the following:
- Sepsis
- Conjunctival retraction, scars, and corneal lesions

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include skin and oral tissue healing, fluid balance, prevention of heat loss, relief of pain, reduced anxiety, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING SKIN AND MUCOUS MEMBRANE INTEGRITY}

The local care of the skin is an important area of nursing management. The skin denudes easily, even when the patient is lifted and turned; it may be necessary to place the patient on a circular turning frame. The nurse applies the prescribed topical agents that reduce the bacterial population of the wound surface. Warm compresses, if prescribed, should be applied gently to denuded areas. The topical antibacterial agent may be used in conjunction with hydrotherapy in a tank, bathtub, or shower. The nurse monitors the patient's condition during the treatment and encourages the patient to exercise the extremities during hydrotherapy.

The painful oral lesions make oral hygiene difficult. Careful oral hygiene is performed to keep the oral mucosa clean. Prescribed mouthwashes, anesthetics, or coating agents are used frequently to rid the mouth of debris, soothe ulcerative areas, and control foul mouth odor. The oral cavity is inspected several times each day, and any changes are documented and reported. Petrolatum or a prescribed ointment is applied to the lips.

\section*{ATTAINING FLUID BALANCE}

The vital signs, urine output, and sensorium are observed for indications of hypovolemia. Mental changes from fluid and electrolyte imbalance, sensory overload, or sensory deprivation may occur. Laboratory test results are evaluated, and abnormal results are reported. The patient is weighed daily (with a bed scale if necessary).

The nurse regulates intravenous fluids at prescribed infusion rates and assesses for systemic (ie, overinfusion or underinfusion) and local (eg, infection) complications. Oral lesions may result in dysphagia, making tube feeding or parenteral nutrition necessary. Prescribed enteral nourishment or enteral supplements can be administered by tube feeding until oral ingestion can be tolerated. A daily calorie count and accurate recording of all intake and output are essential.

\section*{PREVENTING HYPOTHERMIA}

The patient with TEN is prone to chilling. Dehydration may be made worse by exposing the denuded skin to a continuous current of warm air. The patient is usually sensitive to room temperature changes. Measures implemented for a burn patient, such as cotton blankets, ceiling-mounted heat lamps, and heat shields, are useful in maintaining body temperature. To minimize shivering and heat loss, the nurse should work rapidly and efficiently
when large wounds are exposed for wound care. The patient's temperature is monitored frequently.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The nurse assesses the patient's pain, its characteristics, any factors that influence the pain, and the patient's behavioral responses. Prescribed analgesics are administered, and the nurse documents pain relief and any side effects. Analgesics are administered before painful treatments are performed. Providing thorough explanations and speaking calmly to the patient during treatments can allay the anxiety that may intensify pain. Offering emotional support and reassurance and implementing measures that promote rest and sleep are basic in achieving pain control. As the pain diminishes and the patient has more physical and emotional energy, self-management techniques for pain relief, such as progressive muscle relaxation and imagery, may be taught.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Because the lifestyle of patients with TEN has been abruptly changed to one of complete dependence, an assessment of their emotional state may reveal anxiety, depression, and fear of dying. Patients can be reassured that these reactions are normal. They also need nursing support, honest communication, and hope that their situation can improve. They are encouraged to express their feelings to someone they trust. Listening to their concerns and being readily available with skillful and compassionate care are important anxiety-relieving interventions. Emotional support by a psychiatric nurse, chaplain, psychologist, or psychiatrist may be helpful to promote coping during the long recovery period.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Sepsis}

The major cause of death from TEN is infection, and the most common sites of infection are the skin and mucosal surfaces, lungs, and blood. The organisms most often involved are S. aureus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Serratia, and Candida. Monitoring vital signs closely and noticing changes in respiratory, renal, and gastrointestinal function may quickly detect the beginning of an infection. Strict asepsis is always maintained during routine skin care measures. Hand hygiene and wearing sterile gloves when carrying out procedures are necessary. When the condition involves a large portion of the body, the patient should be in a private room to prevent possible cross-infection from other patients. Visitors should wear protective garments and wash their hands before and after coming into contact with the patient. People with any infectious disease should not visit the patient until they are no longer a danger to the patient.

\section*{Conjunctival Retraction, Scars, and Corneal Lesions}

The eyes are inspected daily for signs of itching, burning, and dryness, which may indicate progression often to keratoconjunctivitis, the principal eye complication. Applying a cool, damp cloth over the eyes may relieve burning sensations. The eyes are kept clean and observed for signs of discharge or discomfort, and the progression of symptoms is documented and reported. Administering an eye lubricant, when prescribed, may alleviate dryness and prevent corneal abrasion. Using eye patches or reminding the patient to blink periodically may also counteract dryness. The patient is instructed to avoid rubbing the eyes or putting any medication into the eyes that has not been prescribed or approved by the physician.

b. Laboratory values within normal ranges
c. Has no abnormal discharges or signs of infection
d. Continues to see objects at baseline acuity level
e. Shows no signs of keratoconjunctivitis

\section*{Ulcerations}

Superficial loss of surface tissue as a result of death of the cells is called an ulceration. A simple ulcer, such as the kind found in a small, superficial, partial-thickness burn, tends to heal by granulation (ie, new tissue granules) if kept clean and protected from injury. If it is exposed to the air, the serum that escapes will dry and form a scab, under which the epithelial cells will grow and cover the surface completely. Certain diseases cause characteristic ulcers; tuberculous ulcers and syphilitic ulcers are examples.

Ulcers related to problems with arterial circulation are seen in patients with peripheral vascular disease, arteriosclerosis, Raynaud's disease, and frostbite. In these patients, treatment of the ulcers is concurrent with treatment of the arterial disease (see Chap. 31). Nursing management includes the use of the dressings discussed at the beginning of this chapter. If nursing interventions are instituted early in the progression of an ulcer, the condition can often be effectively improved. Surgical amputation of an affected limb is a last resort.

Pressure ulcers involve breakdown of the skin due to prolonged pressure and insufficient blood supply, usually at bony prominences. Information about these ulcers is presented in chapter 11.

\section*{BenignTumors of the Skin}

\section*{CYSTS}

Cysts of the skin are epithelium-lined cavities that contain fluid or solid material. Epidermal cysts (ie, epidermoid cysts) occur frequently and may be described as slow-growing, firm, elevated tumors found most frequently on the face, neck, upper chest, and back. Removal of the cysts provides a cure.

Pilar cysts (ie, trichilemmal cysts), formerly called sebaceous cysts, are most frequently found on the scalp. They originate from the middle portion of the hair follicle and from the cells of the outer hair root sheath. The treatment is surgical removal.

\section*{ACTINIC AND SEBORRHEIC KERATOSES}

Seborrheic keratoses are benign, wartlike lesions of various sizes and colors, ranging from light tan to black. They are usually located on the face, shoulders, chest, and back and are the most common skin tumors seen in middle-aged and elderly people. They may be cosmetically unacceptable to the patient. A black keratosis may be erroneously diagnosed as malignant melanoma. The treatment is removal of the tumor tissue by excision, electrodesiccation and curettage, or application of carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen. However, there is no harm in allowing these growths to remain, because there is no medical significance to their presence.

Actinic keratoses are premalignant skin lesions that develop in chronically sun-exposed areas of the body. They appear as rough, scaly patches with underlying erythema. A small percentage of these lesions gradually transform into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; they are usually removed by cryotherapy or shave excision.

\section*{VERRUCAE: WARTS}

Warts are common, benign skin tumors caused by infection with the human papillomavirus, which belongs to the DNA virus group. All age groups may be affected, but the condition occurs most frequently between ages 12 and 16 years. There are many types of warts.

As a rule, warts are asymptomatic, except when they occur on weight-bearing areas, such as the soles of the feet. They may be treated with locally applied laser therapy, liquid nitrogen, salicylic acid plasters, or electrodesiccation (ie, destruction of skin lesions by monopolar high-frequency electric current).

Warts occurring on the genitalia and perianal areas are known as condylomata acuminata. They may be transmitted sexually and are treated with liquid nitrogen, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, topically applied trichloracetic acid, and curettage. Condylomata (see Chapter 47) that affect the uterine cervix predispose the patient to cervical cancer.

\section*{ANGIOMAS}

Angiomas are benign vascular tumors that involve the skin and the subcutaneous tissues. They are present at birth and may occur as flat, violet-red patches (ie, port-wine angiomas) or as raised, bright-red, nodular lesions (ie, strawberry angiomas). The latter tend to involute spontaneously within the first few years of life, but port-wine angiomas usually persist indefinitely. Most patients use masking cosmetics (ie, Covermark or Dermablend) to camouflage the lesion. The argon laser is being used on various angiomas with some success. Treatment of strawberry angiomas is more successful if undertaken as soon after birth as possible (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{PIGMENTED NEVI: MOLES}

Moles are common skin tumors of various sizes and shades, ranging from yellowish brown to black. They may be flat, macular lesions or elevated papules or nodules that occasionally con-
tain hair. Most pigmented nevi are harmless lesions. However, in rare cases, malignant changes occur, and a melanoma develops at the site of the nevus. Some authorities believe that all congenital moles should be removed, because they may have a higher incidence of malignant change. However, depending on the quantity and location, this may be impractical. Nevi that show a change in color or size or become symptomatic (eg, itch) or develop irregular borders should be removed to determine if malignant changes have occurred. Moles that occur in unusual places should be examined carefully for any irregularity and for notching of the border and variation in color. Early melanomas may display some redness and irritation and areas of bluish pigmentation where the pigment-containing cells have spread deeper into the skin. Late melanomas have areas of paler color, where pigment cells have stopped producing melanin. Nevi larger than 1 cm should be examined carefully. Excised nevi should be examined histologically.

\section*{KELOIDS}

Keloids are benign overgrowths of fibrous tissue at the site of a scar or trauma. They appear to be more common among darkskinned people. Keloids are asymptomatic but may cause disfigurement and cosmetic concern. The treatment, which is not always satisfactory, consists of surgical excision, intralesional corticosteroid therapy, and radiation.

\section*{DERMATOFIBROMA}

A dermatofibroma is a common, benign tumor of connective tissue that occurs predominantly on the extremities. It is a firm, dome-shaped papule or nodule that may be skin colored or pinkish brown. Excisional biopsy is the recommended method of treatment.

\section*{NEUROFIBROMATOSIS: VON RECKLINGHAUSEN'S DISEASE}

Neurofibromatosis is a hereditary condition manifested by pigmented patches (ie, café-au-lait macules), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas that vary in size. Developmental changes may occur in the nervous system, muscles, and bone. Malignant degeneration of the neurofibromas occurs in some patients.

\section*{MalignantTumors of the Skin: Skin Cancer}

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. If the incidence continues at the present rate, an estimated one of eight fair-skinned Americans will develop skin cancer, especially basal cell carcinoma (Chart 56-5). Because the skin is easily inspected, skin cancer is readily seen and detected and is the most successfully treated type of cancer (Odom et al., 2000).

Exposure to the sun is the leading cause of skin cancer; incidence is related to the total amount of exposure to the sun. Sun damage is cumulative, and harmful effects may be severe by age 20 years. The increase in skin cancer probably reflects changing lifestyles and the emphasis on sunbathing and related activities in light of changes in the environment, such as holes in the Earth's ozone layer. Protective measures should be used throughout life, and nurses need to inform patients about risk factors associated with skin cancer.

\section*{Risk Factors for Skin Cancer}

Changes in the ozone layer from the effects of worldwide industrial air pollutants, such as chlorofluorocarbons, have prompted concern that the incidence of skin cancers, especially malignant melanoma, will increase. The ozone layer, a stratospheric blanket of bluish, explosive gas formed by the sun's ultraviolet radiation, varies in depth with the seasons and is thickest at the North and South Poles and thinnest at the equator. Scientists believe that it helps protect the earth from the effects of solar ultraviolet radiation. Proponents of this theory predict an increase in skin cancers as a consequence of changes in the ozone layer. Other skin cancer risk factors follow:

Fair-skinned, fair-haired, blue-eyed people, particularly those of Celtic origin, with insufficient skin pigmentation to protect underlying tissues
People who sustain sunburn and who do not tan
Long-time sun exposure (farmers, fishermen, construction workers)
Exposure to chemical pollutants (industrial workers in arsenic, nitrates, coal, tar and pitch, oils and paraffins)
Sun-damaged skin (elderly people)
History of x-ray therapy for acne or benign lesions
Scars from severe burns
Chronic skin irritations
Immunosuppression
Genetic factors

\section*{BASAL CELL AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA}

The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma (SCC). The third most common type, malignant melanoma, is discussed separately. Skin cancer is diagnosed by biopsy and histologic evaluation.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

BCC is the most common type of skin cancer. It generally appears on sun-exposed areas of the body and is more prevalent in regions where the population is subjected to intense and extensive exposure to the sun. The incidence is proportional to the age of the patient (average age of 60 years) and the total amount of sun exposure, and it is inversely proportional to the amount of melanin in the skin.

BCC usually begins as a small, waxy nodule with rolled, translucent, pearly borders; telangiectatic vessels may be present. As it grows, it undergoes central ulceration and sometimes crusting (Fig. 56-6). The tumors appear most frequently on the face. BCC is characterized by invasion and erosion of contiguous (adjoining) tissues. It rarely metastasizes, but recurrence is common. However, a neglected lesion can result in the loss of a nose, an ear, or a lip. Other variants of BCC may appear as shiny, flat, gray or yellowish plaques.

SCC is a malignant proliferation arising from the epidermis. Although it usually appears on sun-damaged skin, it may arise from normal skin or from preexisting skin lesions. It is of greater concern than BCC because it is a truly invasive carcinoma, metastasizing by the blood or lymphatic system.

Metastases account for $75 \%$ of deaths from SCC. The lesions may be primary, arising on the skin and mucous membranes, or

EIGURE 56-6 Basal cell carcinoma (left) and squamous cell carcinoma (right). Reprinted by permission from New England Journal of Medicine, 326, 169-170, 1992.
they may develop from a precancerous condition, such as actinic keratosis (ie, lesions occurring in sun-exposed areas), leukoplakia (ie, premalignant lesion of the mucous membrane), or scarred or ulcerated lesions. SCC appears as a rough, thickened, scaly tumor that may be asymptomatic or may involve bleeding (see Fig. 56-6). The border of an SCC lesion may be wider, more infiltrated, and more inflammatory than that of a BCC lesion. Secondary infection can occur. Exposed areas, especially of the upper extremities and of the face, lower lip, ears, nose, and forehead, are common sites (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{Prognosis}

The prognosis for BCC is usually good. Tumors remain localized, and although some require wide excision with resultant disfigurement, the risk for death from BCC is low. The prognosis for SCC depends on the incidence of metastases, which is related to the histologic type and the level or depth of invasion. Usually, tumors arising in sun-damaged areas are less invasive and rarely cause death, whereas SCC that arises without a history of sun or arsenic exposure or scar formation appears to have a greater chance for spread. Regional lymph nodes should be evaluated for metastases (Odom et al., 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of treatment is to eradicate the tumor. The treatment method depends on the tumor location; the cell type, location, and depth; the cosmetic desires of the patient; the history of previous treatment; whether the tumor is invasive, and whether metastatic nodes are present. The management of BCC and SCC includes surgical excision, Mohs' micrographic surgery, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, and radiation therapy.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The primary goal is to remove the tumor entirely. The best way to maintain cosmetic appearance is to place the incision properly along natural skin tension lines and natural anatomic body lines. In this way, scars are less noticeable. The size of the incision depends on the tumor size and location but usually involves a length-to-width ratio of $3: 1$.

The adequacy of the surgical excision is verified by microscopic evaluation of sections of the specimen. When the tumor is large, reconstructive surgery with use of a skin flap or skin grafting may be required. The incision is closed in layers to enhance cosmetic effect. A pressure dressing applied over the wound provides support. Infection after a simple excision is uncommon if proper surgical asepsis is maintained.

Mohs' Micrographic Surgery. Mohs' micrographic surgery is the technique that is most accurate and that best conserves normal tissue. When the surgical technique was introduced, the excision followed an application of zinc chloride paste to the tumor, but Mohs' surgery is now performed without the initial chemosurgery component. The procedure removes the tumor layer by layer. The first layer excised includes all evident tumor and a small margin of normal-appearing tissue. The specimen is frozen and analyzed by section to determine if all the tumor has been removed. If not, additional layers of tissue are shaved and examined until all tissue margins are tumor free. In this manner, only the tumor and a safe, normal-tissue margin are removed. Mohs' surgery is the recommended tissue-sparing procedure, with cure rates for BCC and SCC approaching $99 \%$. It is the treatment of choice and the most effective for tumors around the eyes, nose, upper lip, and auricular and periauricular areas (Odom et al., 2000).

Electrosurgery. Electrosurgery is the destruction or removal of tissue by electrical energy. The current is converted to heat, which then passes to the tissue from a cold electrode. Electrosurgery may be preceded by curettage (ie, excising the skin tumor by scraping its surface with a curette). Electrodesiccation is then implemented to achieve hemostasis and to destroy any viable malignant cells at the base of the wound or along its edges. Electrodesiccation is useful for lesions smaller than 1 to 2 cm ( 0.4 to 0.8 in ) in diameter.

This method takes advantage of the fact that the tumor in each instance is softer than surrounding skin and therefore can be outlined by a curette, which "feels" the extent of the tumor. The tumor is removed and the base cauterized. The process is repeated twice. Usually, healing occurs within a month.

Cryosurgery. Cryosurgery destroys the tumor by deep freezing the tissue. A thermocouple needle apparatus is inserted into the skin, and liquid nitrogen is directed to the center of the tumor until the tumor base is $-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $-60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Liquid nitrogen has the lowest boiling point of all cryogens tried, is inexpensive, and is easy to obtain. The tumor tissue is frozen, allowed to thaw, and then refrozen. The site thaws naturally and then becomes gelatinous and heals spontaneously. Swelling and edema follow the freezing. The appearance of the lesion varies. Normal healing, which may take 4 to 6 weeks, occurs faster in areas with a good blood supply.

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

Radiation therapy is frequently performed for cancer of the eyelid, the tip of the nose, and areas in or near vital structures (eg, facial nerve). It is reserved for older patients, because x-ray changes may be seen after 5 to 10 years, and malignant changes in scars may be induced by irradiation 15 to 30 years later.

The patient should be informed that the skin may become red and blistered. A bland skin ointment prescribed by the physician may be applied to relieve discomfort. The patient should also be cautioned to avoid exposure to the sun.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Because many skin cancers are removed by excision, patients are usually treated in outpatient surgical units. The role of the nurse is to teach the patient about prevention of skin cancer and about self-care after treatment (Chart 56-6).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The wound is usually covered with a dressing to protect the site from physical trauma, external irritants, and contaminants. The patient is advised when to report for a dressing change or is given written and verbal information on how to change dressings, including the type of dressing to purchase, how to remove dressings and apply fresh ones, and the importance of hand washing before and after the procedure.

The patient is advised to watch for excessive bleeding and tight dressings that compromise circulation. If the lesion is in the perioral area, the patient is instructed to drink liquids through a straw and limit talking and facial movement. Dental work should be avoided until the area is completely healed.

After the sutures are removed, an emollient cream may be used to help reduce dryness. Applying a sunscreen over the wound is advised to prevent postoperative hyperpigmentation if the patient spends time outdoors.

Health Promotion: Preventing Skin Cancer}
\end{figure}

Because skin cancer rates are rising, taking preventive measures such as the ones outlined below may help individuals avoid increasing their skin cancer risk.
- Do not try to tan if your skin burns easily, never tans, or tans poorly.
- Avoid unnecessary exposure to the sun, especially during the time of day when ultraviolet radiation (sunlight) is most intense ( 10 AM to 3 PM ).
- Avoid sunburn.
- Apply sunscreen when in the sun; sunscreens block harmful sun rays.
- Use a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher. Sunscreens are rated in strength from 4 (weakest) to 50 (strongest). The SPF indicates the solar protection factor, or how much longer you can stay in the sun before getting burned. Look for sunscreens that protect against both ultraviolet-A (UVA) and ultraviolet-B (UVB) light.
- Reapply water-resistant sunscreens after swimming, if heavily sweating, and every 2 to 3 hours during prolonged periods of sun exposure.
- Avoid oils. Applied before or during sun exposure, oils do not protect against sunlight or sun damage.
- Use a lip balm that contains a sunscreen with the highest SPF number.
- Wear protective clothing, such as a broad-brimmed hat and long sleeves.
- Remember that up to $50 \%$ of ultraviolet rays can penetrate loosely woven clothing.
- Remember that ultraviolet light can penetrate a cloud cover, and a sunburn can still occur.
- Do not use sun lamps for indoor tanning, and avoid commercial tanning booths. These rays are just as harmful.
- Teach children to avoid all but modest sun exposure and to use a sunscreen regularly for lifelong protection.

Follow-up examinations should be at regular intervals, usually every 3 months for a year, and should include palpation of the adjacent lymph nodes. The patient should also be instructed to seek treatment for any moles that are subject to repeated friction and irritation, and to watch for indications of potential malignancy in moles as described previously. The importance of lifelong fol-low-up evaluations should be emphasized.

Teaching About Prevention. Studies show that regular daily use of a sunscreen with a solar protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 can reduce the recurrence of skin cancer by as much as $40 \%$. The sunscreen should be applied to head, neck, arms, and hands every morning at least 30 minutes before leaving the house and reapplied every 4 hours if the skin perspires. Discretionary application (ie, applied only when sun exposure is anticipated) has not shown the same preventive response (Barton, 2001).

\section*{MALIGNANT MELANOMA}

A malignant melanoma is a cancerous neoplasm in which atypical melanocytes (ie, pigment cells) are present in the epidermis and the dermis (and sometimes the subcutaneous cells). It is the most lethal of all the skin cancers and is responsible for about $2 \%$ of all cancer deaths (Odom et al., 2000).

It can occur in one of several forms: superficial spreading melanoma, lentigo-maligna melanoma, nodular melanoma, and acral-lentiginous melanoma. These types have specific clinical and histologic features as well as different biologic behaviors. Most melanomas arise from cutaneous epidermal melanocytes, but some appear in preexisting nevi (ie, moles) in the skin or develop in the uveal tract of the eye. Melanomas occasionally appear simultaneously with cancer of other organs.

The worldwide incidence of melanoma doubles every 10 years, a rise that is probably related to increased recreational sun exposure and better methods of early detection. Peak incidence occurs between ages 20 and 45. The incidence of melanoma is increasing faster than that of almost any other cancer, and the mortality rate is increasing faster than that of any other cancer except lung cancer. The estimated number of new cases in 2002 is 53,600 and the number of deaths is 7400 (American Cancer Society, 2002).

\section*{Risk Factors}

The cause of malignant melanoma is unknown, but ultraviolet rays are strongly suspected, based on indirect evidence such as the increased incidence of melanoma in countries near the equator and in people younger than age 30 who have used a tanning bed more than 10 times per year. In general, 1 in 100 Caucasians will get melanoma every year. Up to $10 \%$ of melanoma patients are members of melanoma-prone families who have multiple changing moles (ie, dysplastic nevi) that are susceptible to malignant transformation. Patients with dysplastic nevus syndrome have been found to have unusual moles, larger and more numerous moles, lesions with irregular outlines, and pigmentation located all over the skin. Microscopic examination of dysplastic moles shows disordered, faulty growth. Chart 56-7 lists risk factors for malignant melanoma.

Research has identified a gene that resides on chromosome 9p, the absence of which increases the likelihood that potentially mutagenic DNA damage will escape repair before cell division.

\section*{Risk Factors for Malignant Melanoma}
- Fair-skinned or freckled, blue-eyed, light-haired people of Celtic or Scandinavian origin
- People who burn and do not tan or who have a significant history of severe sunburn
- Environmental exposure to intense sunlight (older Americans retiring to the southwestern United States appear to have a higher incidence)
- History of melanoma (personal or family)
- Skin with giant congenital nevi

The absence of this gene can be identified in melanoma-prone families (Piepkorn, 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Superficial spreading melanoma occurs anywhere on the body and is the most common form of melanoma. It usually affects middle-aged people and occurs most frequently on the trunk and lower extremities. The lesion tends to be circular, with irregular outer portions. The margins of the lesion may be flat or elevated and palpable (Fig. 56-7). This type of melanoma may appear in a combination of colors, with hues of tan, brown, and black mixed with gray, blue-black, or white. Sometimes a dull pink rose color can be seen in a small area within the lesion.

\section*{LENTIGO-MALIGNA MELANOMAS}

Lentigo-maligna melanomas are slowly evolving, pigmented lesions that occur on exposed skin areas, especially the dorsum of the hand, the head, and the neck in elderly people. Often, the lesions are present for many years before they are examined by a physician. They first appear as tan, flat lesions, but in time, they undergo changes in size and color.

\section*{NODULAR MELANOMA}

Nodular melanoma is a spherical, blueberry-like nodule with a relatively smooth surface and a relatively uniform, blue-black color (see Fig. 56-7). It may be dome shaped with a smooth surface. It may have other shadings of red, gray, or purple. Sometimes, nodular melanomas appear as irregularly shaped plaques.

FIGURE 56-7 Two forms of malignant melanoma: superficial spreading (left) and nodular (right). From Bickley, L. S., \& Szilagyi, P. (2003). Bates' guide to physical examination and history taking (8th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.

The patient may describe this as a blood blister that fails to resolve. A nodular melanoma invades directly into adjacent dermis (ie, vertical growth) and therefore has a poorer prognosis.

\section*{ACRAL-LENTIGINOUS MELANOMA}

Acral-lentiginous melanoma occurs in areas not excessively exposed to sunlight and where hair follicles are absent. It is found on the palms of the hands, on the soles, in the nail beds, and in the mucous membranes in dark-skinned people. These melanomas appear as irregular, pigmented macules that develop nodules. They may become invasive early.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Biopsy results confirm the diagnosis of melanoma. An excisional biopsy specimen provides histologic information on the type, level of invasion, and thickness of the lesion. An excisional biopsy specimen that includes a $1-\mathrm{cm}$ margin of normal tissue and a portion of underlying subcutaneous fatty tissue is sufficient for staging a melanoma in situ or an early, noninvasive melanoma. Incisional biopsy should be performed when the suspicious lesion is too large to be removed safely without extensive scarring. Biopsy specimens obtained by shaving, curettage, or needle aspiration are not considered reliable histologic proof of disease.

A thorough history and physical examination should include a meticulous skin examination and palpation of regional lymph nodes that drain the lesional area. Because melanoma occurs in families, a positive family history of melanoma is investigated so that first-degree relatives, who may be at high risk for melanoma, can be evaluated for atypical lesions. After the diagnosis of melanoma has been confirmed, a chest x-ray, complete blood cell count, liver function tests, and radionuclide or computed tomography scans are usually ordered to stage the extent of disease.

\section*{Prognosis}

The prognosis for long-term (5-year) survival is considered poor when the lesion is more than 1.5 mm thick or there is regional lymph node involvement. A person with a thin lesion and no lymph node involvement has a $3 \%$ chance of developing metastases and a $95 \%$ chance of surviving 5 years. If regional lymph nodes are involved, there is a $20 \%$ to $50 \%$ chance of surviving 5 years. Patients with melanoma on the hand, foot, or scalp have a better prognosis; those with lesions on the torso have an increased chance of metastases to the bone, liver, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system. Men and elderly patients also have poor prognoses (Demis, 1998).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment depends on the level of invasion and the depth of the lesion. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for small, superficial lesions. Deeper lesions require wide local excision, after which skin grafting may be needed. Regional lymph node dissection is commonly performed to rule out metastasis, although new surgical approaches call for only sentinel node biopsy. This technique is used to sample the nodes nearest the tumor and spares the patient the long-term sequelae of extensive removal of lymph nodes if the sample node is negative (Wagner, 2000).

Immunotherapy has had varied success. Immunotherapy modifies immune function and other biologic responses to cancer. Several forms of immunotherapy (eg, bacillus Calmette-Guérin
[BCG] vaccine, Corynebacterium parvum, levamisole) offer encouraging results. Some investigational therapies include biologic response modifiers (eg, interferon-alpha, interleukin-2), adaptive immunotherapy (ie, lymphokine-activated killer cells), and monoclonal antibodies directed at melanoma antigens. One of these, proleukin, shows promise in preventing recurrence of melanoma (Demis, 1998). Under investigation is the laboratory assay of tyrosinase, an enzyme believed to be produced only by melanoma cells (Demis, 1998). Several other studies are attempting to develop autologous immunization against specific tumor cells. These studies are still in the early experimental stage but show promise of producing a vaccine against melanoma (Piepkorn, 2000).

Current treatments for metastatic melanoma are largely unsuccessful, with cure generally impossible. Further surgical intervention may be performed to debulk the tumor or to remove part of the organ involved (eg, lung, liver, or colon). The rationale for more extensive surgery, however, is for relief of symptoms, not for cure. Chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma may be used; however, only a few agents (eg, dacarbazine, nitrosoureas, cisplatin) have been effective in controlling the disease.

When the melanoma is located in an extremity, regional perfusion may be used; the chemotherapeutic agent is perfused directly into the area that contains the melanoma. This approach delivers a high concentration of cytotoxic agents while avoiding systemic, toxic side effects. The limb is perfused for 1 hour with high concentrations of the medication at temperatures of $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(102.2^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right.$ to $\left.104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ with a perfusion pump. Inducing hyperthermia enhances the effect of the chemotherapy so that a smaller total dose can be used. It is hoped that regional perfusion can control the metastasis, especially if it is used in combination with surgical excision of the primary lesion and with regional lymph node dissection.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH MALIGNANT MELANOMA}

\section*{Assessment}

Assessment of the patient with malignant melanoma is based on the patient's history and symptoms. The patient is asked specifically about pruritus, tenderness, and pain, which are not features of a benign nevus. The patient is also questioned about changes in preexisting moles or the development of new, pigmented lesions. People at risk are assessed carefully.

A magnifying lens and good lighting are needed for inspecting the skin for irregularity and changes in the mole. Signs that suggest malignant changes are referred to as the ABCDs of moles (Chart 56-8)

Common sites of melanomas are the skin of the back, the legs (especially in women), between the toes, and on the feet, face, scalp, fingernails, and backs of hands. In dark-skinned people, melanomas are most likely to occur in less pigmented sites: palms, soles, subungual areas, and mucous membranes. Satellite lesions (ie, those situated near the mole) are inspected.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the nursing assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:

\section*{Chart 56-8 • ASSESSMENT}

\section*{The ABCDs of Moles}

\section*{A for Asymmetry}
- The lesion does not appear balanced on both sides. If an imaginary line were drawn down the middle, the two halves would not look alike.
- The lesion has an irregular surface with uneven elevations (irregular topography) either palpable or visible. A change in the surface may be noted from smooth to scaly.
- Some nodular melanomas have a smooth surface.

\section*{B for Irregular Border}
- Angular indentations or multiple notches appear in the border
- The border is fuzzy or indistinct, as if rubbed with an eraser.

\section*{C for Variegated Color}
- Normal moles are usually a uniform light to medium brown. Darker coloration indicates that the melanocytes have penetrated to a deeper layer of the dermis.
- Colors that may indicate malignancy if found together within a single lesion are shades of red, white, and blue; shades of blue are ominous.
- White areas within a pigmented lesion are suspicious.
- Some malignant melanomas, however, are not variegated but are uniformly colored (bluish-black, bluish-gray, bluish-red).

\section*{D for Diameter}
- A diameter exceeding 6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) is considered more suspicious, although this finding without other signs is not significant. Many benign skin growths are larger than 6 mm , whereas some early melanomas may be smaller.
- Acute pain related to surgical excision and grafting
- Anxiety and depression related to possible life-threatening consequences of melanoma and disfigurement
- Deficient knowledge about early signs of melanoma

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications include the following:
- Metastasis
- Infection of the surgical site

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of pain and discomfort, reduced anxiety and depression, knowledge of early signs of melanoma, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Surgical removal of melanoma in different locations (eg, head, neck, eye, trunk, abdomen, extremities, central nervous system) presents different challenges, taking into consideration the removal of the primary melanoma, the intervening lymphatic vessels, and the lymph nodes to which metastases may spread. Nursing management of the patient having surgery in these regions is discussed in the appropriate chapters.

Nursing intervention after surgery for a malignant melanoma centers on promoting comfort, because wide excision surgery may be necessary. A split-thickness or full-thickness skin graft may be necessary when large defects are created by surgical removal of
a melanoma. Anticipating the need for and administering appropriate analgesic medications are important.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION}

Psychological support is essential when disfiguring surgery is performed. Support includes allowing patients to express feelings about the seriousness of this cutaneous neoplasm, understanding their anger and depression, and conveying understanding of these feelings. During the diagnostic workup and staging of the depth, type, and extent of the tumor, the nurse answers questions, clarifies information, and helps clarify misconceptions. Learning that they have a melanoma can cause patients considerable fear and anguish. Pointing out patients' resources, past effective coping mechanisms, and social support systems helps them to cope with the problems associated with diagnosis, treatment, and continuing follow-up. The patient's family should be included in all discussions to clarify the information presented, ask questions that the patient might be reluctant to ask, and provide emotional support.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Metastasis}

The prognosis for malignant melanoma is related to metastasis: the deeper and thicker (more than 4 mm ) the melanoma, the greater is the likelihood of metastasis. If the melanoma is growing radially (ie, horizontally) and is characterized by peripheral growth with minimal or no dermal invasion, the prognosis is favorable. When the melanoma progresses to the vertical growth phase (ie, dermal invasion), the prognosis is poor. Lesions with ulceration have a poor prognosis. Melanomas of the trunk appear to have a poorer prognosis than those of other sites, perhaps because the network of lymphatics in the trunk permits metastasis to regional lymph nodes.

The role of the nurse in caring for the patient with metastatic disease is holistic. The nurse must be knowledgeable about the most effective current therapies and must deliver supportive care, provide and clarify information about the therapy and the rationale for its use, identify potential side effects of therapy and ways to manage them, and instruct the patient and family about the expected outcomes of treatment. The nurse monitors and documents symptoms that may indicate metastasis: lung (eg, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, increasing cough), bone (eg, pain, decreased mobility and function, pathologic fractures), and liver (eg, change in liver enzyme levels, pain, jaundice). Nursing care is based on the patient's symptoms.

Although the chance of a cure for malignant melanoma that has metastasized is poor, the nurse encourages the patient to have hope in the therapy employed while maintaining a realistic perspective about the disease and ultimate outcome. Moreover, the nurse provides time for the patient to express fears and concerns regarding future activities and relationships, offers information about support groups and contact people, and arranges palliative and hospice care if appropriate (see Chap. 17).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The best hope of controlling the disease lies in educating patients about the early signs of melanoma. Patients at risk are taught to examine their skin and scalp monthly in a systematic manner (Chart 56-9). The nurse also points out that a key factor in the development of malignant melanoma is exposure to sunlight. Because melanoma is thought to be genetically linked, the family and the patient should be taught sun-avoiding measures.

\section*{METASTATIC SKIN TUMORS}

The skin is an important, although not a common, site of metastatic cancer. All types of cancer may metastasize to the skin, but carcinoma of the breast is the primary source of cutaneous metastases in women. Other sources include cancer of the large intestine, ovaries, and lungs. In men, the most common primary sites are the lungs, large intestine, oral cavity, kidneys, or stomach. Skin metastases from melanomas are found in both genders. The clinical appearance of metastatic skin lesions is not distinctive, except perhaps in some cases of breast cancer in which diffuse, brawny hardening of the skin of the involved breast is seen. In most instances, metastatic lesions occur as multiple cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules of various sizes that may be skin colored or different shades of red.

\section*{Other Malignancies of the Skin}

\section*{KAPOSI'S SARCOMA}

First described by Moritz Kaposi in 1872, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has received renewed attention since its association with HIV infection and AIDS. Its occurrence with AIDS involves a more varied and aggressive form of KS than was seen previously. Before the AIDS epidemic, KS was considered a rare malignancy. It was subdivided into three categories: classic KS, African (endemic) KS, and KS associated with immunosuppressant therapy. Classic KS occurs predominantly in men of Mediterranean or Jewish ancestry between the ages of 40 and 70 years. Most patients have nodules or plaques on the lower extremities that rarely metastasize beyond the lower extremities. This KS is chronic, relatively benign, and rarely fatal.

African KS affects people predominantly in the eastern half of Africa near the equator. Men are affected more often than women, and children can be affected as well. The disease may resemble classic KS, or it may infiltrate and progress to lymphadenopathic forms.

KS associated with immunosuppressive therapy, as in transplant recipients, is characterized by local skin lesions and disseminated visceral and mucocutaneous diseases. The greater the degree of immunosuppression, the higher is the incidence of KS.

AIDS-related KS was identified in the early 1980s as distinctly different from previously described types of KS. Typically, it is an aggressive tumor that involves multiple body organs. Its presentation resembles that of KS associated with immunosuppressive therapy. Most patients are between the ages of 20 and 40 years (Odom et al., 2000). More information on this topic can be found in Chapter 52.

\section*{BASAL AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS IN THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED POPULATION}

The incidence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is increased in all immunocompromised individuals, including those infected with HIV. Clinically, the tumors have the same appearance as in non-HIV-infected people; however, in HIV patients, the tumors may grow more rapidly and recur more frequently. These tumors are managed the same as for the general population. Frequent follow-up (every 4 to 6 months) is recommended to monitor for recurrence.

\section*{Dermatologic and Plastic Reconstructive Surgery}

The word plastic comes from a Greek word meaning to form. Plastic or reconstructive surgery is performed to reconstruct or alter congenital or acquired defects to restore or improve the body's form and function. Often, the terms plastic and reconstructive are used interchangeably. This type of surgery includes closure of wounds, removal of skin tumors, repair of soft tissue injuries or burns, correction of deformities, and repair of cosmetic defects. Plastic surgery can be used to repair many parts of the body and numerous structures, such as bone, cartilage, fat, fascia, mucous membrane, muscle, nerve, and cutaneous structures. Bone inlays and transplants for deformities and nonunion can be performed, muscle can be transferred, nerves can be reconstructed and spliced, and cartilage can be replaced. As important as any of these measures is the reconstruction of the cutaneous tissues around the neck and the face; this is usually referred to as aesthetic or cosmetic surgery.

\section*{WOUND COVERAGE: GRAFTS AND FLAPS}

Various surgical techniques, including skin grafts and flaps, are used to cover skin wounds.

\section*{Skin Grafts}

Skin grafting is a technique in which a section of skin is detached from its own blood supply and transferred as free tissue to a distant (recipient) site. Skin grafting can be used to repair almost any type of wound and is the most common form of reconstructive surgery.

Skin grafts are commonly used to repair defects that result from excision of skin tumors, to cover areas denuded of skin (e.g., burns), and to cover wounds in which insufficient skin is available to permit wound closure. They are also used when primary closure of the wound increases the risk for complications or when primary wound closure would interfere with function.

Skin grafts may be classified as autografts, allografts, or xenografts. An autograft is tissue obtained from the patient's own skin. An allograft is tissue obtained from a donor of the same species. These grafts are also called allogeneic or homograft. A xenograft or heterograft is tissue from another species.

Grafts are also referred to by their thickness. A skin graft may be a split-thickness (ie, thin, intermediate, or thick) or fullthickness graft, depending on the amount of dermis included in the specimen. A split-thickness graft can be cut at various thicknesses and is commonly used to cover large wounds or defects for which a full-thickness graft or flap is impractical (Fig. 56-8). A full-thickness graft consists of epidermis and the entire dermis without the underlying fat. It is used to cover wounds that are too large to be closed directly.

\section*{DONOR SITE}

The donor site is selected with several criteria in mind:
- Achieving the closest possible color match
- Matching the texture and hair-bearing qualities
- Obtaining the thickest possible skin graft without jeopardizing the healing of the donor site (Fig. 56-9)
- Considering the cosmetic effects of the donor site after healing, so that it is in an inconspicuous location

\end{figure}

\section*{DONOR SITE CARE}

Detailed attention to the donor site is just as important as the care of the recipient area. The donor site heals by re-epithelization of the raw, exposed dermis. Usually, a single layer of nonadherent, finemesh gauze is placed directly over the donor site. Absorbent gauze dressings are then placed on top to absorb blood or serum from the wound. A membrane dressing (eg, Op-Site) may be used and provides certain advantages. It is transparent and allows the wound to be observed without disturbing the dressing, and it permits the patient to shower without fear of saturating the dressing with water.

After healing, the patient is instructed to keep the donor site soft and pliable with cream (eg, lanolin, olive oil). Extremes in temperature, external trauma, and sunlight are to be avoided for donor sites and grafted areas because these areas are sensitive, especially to thermal injuries.

\section*{GRAFT APPLICATION}

A graft is obtained by a variety of instruments: razor blades, skingrafting knives, electric- or air-powered dermatomes, or drum dermatomes. The skin graft is taken from the donor or host site and applied to the desired site, called the recipient site or graft bed.

For a graft to survive and be effective, certain conditions must be met:
- The recipient site must have an adequate blood supply so that normal physiologic function can resume.
- The graft must be in close contact with its bed to avoid accumulation of blood or fluid.
- The graft must be fixed firmly (immobilized) so that it remains in place on the recipient site.
- The area must be free of infection.

The graft, when applied to the recipient site, may be sutured in place. It may be slit and spread apart to cover a greater area. The process of revascularization (ie, establishing the blood supply) and reattachment of a skin graft to a recipient bed is referred to as a "take." After a skin graft is put in place, it may be left exposed (in areas that are impossible to immobilize) or covered with a light dressing or a pressure dressing, depending on the area.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The nurse instructs the patient to keep the affected part immobilized as much as possible. For a facial graft, strenuous activity must be avoided. A graft on the hand or arm may be immobilized with a splint. When a graft is placed on a lower extremity, the part is kept elevated because the new capillary connections are fragile and excess venous pressure may cause rupture. When ambulation is permitted, the patient wears an elastic stocking to counterbalance venous pressure.

The nurse instructs the patient, family member, or other caregiver to inspect the dressing daily. Unusual drainage or an inflammatory reaction around the wound margin suggests infection and should be reported to the physician. Any fluid, purulent drainage, blood, or serum that has collected is gently evacuated by the surgeon, because accumulation of this material would cause the graft to separate from its bed.

When the graft appears pink, it is vascularized. After 2 to 3 weeks, mineral oil or a lanolin cream is massaged into the wound to moisten the graft. Because there may be loss of feeling or sensation in the grafted area for a prolonged period, the application of heating pads and exposure to sun are avoided to prevent burns and further skin trauma.

\section*{Flaps}

Another form of wound coverage is provided by flaps. A flap is a segment of tissue that remains attached at one end (ie, a base or pedicle) while the other end is moved to a recipient area. Its survival depends on functioning arterial and venous blood supplies and lymphatic drainage in its pedicle or base. A flap differs from a graft in that a portion of the tissue is attached to its original site and retains its blood supply. An exception is the free flap, which is described later.

Flaps may consist of skin, mucosa, muscle, adipose tissue, omentum, and bone. They are used for wound coverage and provide bulk, especially when bone, tendon, blood vessels, or nerve tissue is exposed. Flaps are used to repair defects caused by congenital deformity, trauma, or tumor ablation (ie, removal, usually by excision) in an adjacent part of the body.

Flaps offer an aesthetic solution because a flap retains the color and texture of the donor area, is more likely to survive than a graft, and can be used to cover nerves, tendons, and blood vessels. However, several surgical procedures are usually required to advance a flap. The major complication is necrosis of the pedicle or base as a result of failure of the blood supply.

\section*{Free Flaps}

A striking advance in reconstructive surgery is the use of free flaps or free-tissue transfer achieved by microvascular techniques. A free flap is completely severed from the body and transferred to another site. A free flap receives early vascular supply from microvascular anastomosis (ie, attachment) with vessels at the recipient site. The procedure usually is completed in one step, eliminating
the need for a series of surgical procedures to move the flap. Microvascular surgery allows surgeons to use a variety of donor sites for tissue reconstruction.

\section*{CHEMICAL FACE PEELING}

Chemical face peeling, a technique that involves applying a chemical mixture to the face for superficial destruction of the epidermis and the upper layers of the dermis, treats fine wrinkles, keratoses, and pigment problems. It is especially useful for wrinkles at the upper and lower lip, forehead, and periorbital areas.

Pretreatment may consist of cleansing the face and hair for several days before the procedure with a hexachlorophene detergent. Pretreatment medication (ie, analgesic and tranquilizer for moderate sedation) may be prescribed to alleviate apprehension and control pain. This permits the patient to be sedated but conscious during the procedure, although some patients request general anesthesia.

The type of chemical used depends on the planned depth of the peel. A phenol-based chemical in an oil-water emulsion is commonly used because it produces a controlled, predictable chemical burn. The chemical is applied systematically to the face with cotton-tipped applicators. The conscious patient feels a burning sensation at this time. A mask of waterproof adhesive may then be applied directly to the skin and molded closely to the contours of the face, thereby acting as an occlusive dressing that increases the chemical penetration and action. Some surgeons believe that equally good results can be obtained with occlusive tape. After the tape mask is applied, the burning sensation continues, and the tape mask remains in place for 12 to 24 hours. Frequent small doses of analgesics and tranquilizers are prescribed to keep the patient comfortable.

\section*{Complications}

Complications may arise when control of the chemically induced burn cannot be sustained. Complications include pigment changes, infection, milia (ie, small inclusion cysts that disappear after several months), scarring, atrophy, sensitivity changes, and long-term (4 to 5 months) erythema or pruritus.

\section*{Management}

Because chemical face peeling is performed in the physician's office or in an outpatient surgical department, most care takes place in the home. After 6 to 8 hours, the face becomes edematous and the eyelids usually swell shut. The patient should be reassured that this reaction is expected and normal. The patient is cautioned to move the mouth as little as possible so that the tape continues to adhere to the skin. The head of the bed is elevated, and liquids are administered through a straw. Most of the burning sensation and discomfort subside after the first 12 to 24 hours.

By the second day, the patient may feel moisture under the dressings as serous exudate seeps from the chemically exfoliated skin. Dressings are usually removed 24 to 48 hours after treatment, exposing skin resembling a second-degree burn. The patient may be alarmed by the appearance of the skin and should be reassured. After the tape mask is removed, some surgeons dust the treated skin surface with thymol-iodine powder for its drying and bacteriostatic effects. Application of triple-antibiotic ointment may be substituted in some cases. The skin surface is left uncovered to dry. The patient may be permitted to wash the face with lukewarm water or advised to shower several times daily to help remove
any remaining facial crusting. An ointment is prescribed to cover the face and soften and loosen the crust between washings.

The nurse reinforces the physician's explanation that the redness of the skin will gradually subside over the next 4 to 12 weeks. Although a line between treated and untreated skin may be seen, makeup is usually permitted after the first few weeks. The patient is cautioned to avoid exposure to direct or reflected sunlight, because the treatment reduces the natural protection of the skin from sun. The skin will probably never tan evenly again. Blotchy pigmentation can occur with exposure to the sun.

\section*{DERMABRASION}

Dermabrasion is a form of skin abrasion used to correct acne scarring, aging, and sun-damaged skin. A special instrument (ie, motordriven wire brush, diamond-impregnated disk, or serrated wheel) is used in the procedure. The epidermis and some superficial dermis are removed, while enough of the dermis is preserved to allow re-epithelization of the treated areas. Results are best in the face because it is rich in intradermal epithelial elements.

\section*{Preparation and Procedure}

The primary reason for undergoing dermabrasion is to improve appearance. The surgeon explains to the patient what can be expected from dermabrasion. The patient should also be informed about the nature of the postoperative dressing, what discomfort may be experienced, and how long it will be before the tissues look normal.

Dermabrasion may be performed in the physician's office, the operating room, or an outpatient setting. It is performed under local or general anesthesia. During the procedure, some surgeons use refrigerant anesthetics to turn the skin into a numb, solid mass of rigid tissue and to provide a momentarily bloodless surgical field. During and after planning, the area is irrigated with copious amounts of saline solution to remove debris and allow the surgeon to see the area. A dressing impregnated with ointment is usually applied to the abraded surface.

\section*{Management}

The nurse instructs the patient about postoperative effects. Edema occurs during the first 48 hours and may cause the eyelids to close. The head of the bed is elevated to hasten fluid drainage. Erythema occurs and can last for weeks or months. After 24 hours, the dressing may be removed if the physician approves. When the serum oozing from the skin begins to gel, the patient applies the prescribed ointment to the face several times each day to prevent hard crusting and to keep the abraded areas soft and flexible. With the physician's approval, clear-water cleansing or soaking of the face is started to remove crusts from the healing skin.

The patient is advised to avoid extreme cold and heat and excessive straining or lifting, which may bruise delicate new capillaries. Direct or reflected sunlight should be avoided for 3 to 6 months and a sunscreen used.

\section*{FACIAL RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY}

Reconstructive procedures on the face are individualized to the patient's needs and desired outcomes. They are performed to repair deformities or restore normal function as much as possible. They may vary from closure of small defects to complicated procedures involving implantation of prosthetic devices to conceal a
large defect or reconstruct a lost part of the face (eg, nose, ear, jaw). Each surgical procedure is customized and involves a variety of incisions, flaps, and grafts.

In correcting a primary defect, the surgeon may have to create a secondary defect. Although the procedure may restore some function, such as eating or talking, the cosmetic or aesthetic results may be limited. The original appearance of a patient who has severe damage to soft tissue and bone structure can seldom be restored. Multiple surgical procedures may be required. The process of facial reconstruction is usually slow and tedious.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION}

\section*{Assessment}

The face is a part of the body that every person desires to keep at its best or improve, because most human interactions involve the face. When the face loses its appearance and function by injury or disease, significant emotional reactions often occur. Changes in appearance frequently cause anxiety and depression. Patients with facial changes frequently mourn for the lost part, suffer a loss of self-esteem because of reactions or rejection by others, and withdraw and isolate themselves. Health care personnel can acknowledge that anxiety and depression are appropriate for what the patient is experiencing.

The nurse assesses the patient's emotional responses and identifies strengths as well as usual coping mechanisms to determine how the patient will handle the surgical procedure. Any area in which the patient and family need extra support is identified.

The preoperative assessment determines the extent of disfigurement and improvement that can be anticipated, as well as the patient's understanding and acceptance of these limitations. The nurse is in a better position to reinforce facts and clarify misconceptions after the surgeon has fully informed the patient about the procedure, the functional defects that may result, the possible need for a tracheostomy or other prosthesis, and the probability of additional surgery. The nurse instructs the patient about various postoperative measures: intravenous therapy, the use of a nasogastric tube to allow gastric decompression and prevent vomiting, and the frequent and lengthy periods that may be required to care for wounds, flaps, and skin grafts and to change dressings. Extra time is needed when presenting this information to anxious patients because they may not hear, concentrate, or comprehend what is being said.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the nursing assessment data, the patient's major postoperative nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective airway clearance related to tracheobronchial secretions
- Acute pain related to facial edema and effects of the procedure
- Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to altered physiology of oral cavity, drooling, impaired chewing and swallowing, or excision affecting the tongue
- Impaired verbal communication related to trauma or surgery producing anatomic and physiologic abnormalities of speech
- Disturbed body image related to disfigurement
- Interrupted family processes related to grief reaction and disruption of family life

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include.
- Infection

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include a patent airway and adequate pulmonary function, increased comfort, adequate nutritional status, an effective communication method, positive selfconcept, effective family coping, and absence of infection.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING AIRWAY AND PULMONARY FUNCTION}

The immediate concern after facial reconstruction is maintenance of an adequate airway. If the patient has regained consciousness, mental confusion with combative, anxious behavior is a sign of hypoxia (ie, reduced oxygen supply to tissues). Sedatives or opioids are not prescribed in this situation because they may impair oxygenation. If the patient shows signs of restlessness, the airway is carefully inspected to detect laryngeal edema or accumulation of tracheobronchial mucus. Secretions are suctioned as necessary until the patient can manage the secretions without help. If the patient has a tracheostomy, suctioning is performed with sterile technique to prevent infection and cross-contamination. Chapter 25 provides information on care of the patient with a tracheostomy.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND ACHIEVING COMFORT}

Facial edema is an uncomfortable but natural consequence of facial reconstructive surgery. The patient's head and upper torso are kept slightly elevated (if the blood pressure is stable) to help reduce facial edema. Catheters attached to closed drainage may be in place to keep the tissue in close apposition and to remove serous discharge. If extensive reconstruction has been performed, the patient's head should be properly aligned and supported so that minimal stress is placed on the suture line.

Analgesics are prescribed to relieve pain. If bone grafts have been used for reconstruction, there is usually considerable pain in the donor area. If the patient has head and neck cancer and increasing levels of pain, comprehensive nursing management is required (see Chap. 13).

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Fluids may be offered to the patient after oral and pharyngeal edema diminish, the incisional areas and flaps heal, and the patient can swallow saliva. Gradually, soft foods are added as tolerated. If the patient cannot meet nutritional needs by the oral route, parenteral nutrition (ie, infusion of nutrients, water, and vitamins into the stomach or proximal small intestine through a tube) is initiated. The formula strength and feeding rate are gradually increased until the desired daily caloric level is attained. Chapter 36 provides information about nursing management of the patient requiring enteral feedings. Patients who have had radical surgery for large, encroaching neoplasms may have difficulty resuming eating. Positive nutrition is reflected in weight gain, and nutritional status is monitored by measuring body weight daily and assessing serum protein and electrolyte levels periodically.

\section*{ENHANCING COMMUNICATION}

Communication problems may range from minimal difficulty to the loss of oral speech. Some tumors and injuries require extensive surgery involving the larynx, tongue, and mandible. Paper, pen or pencil, and a firm writing surface should be provided. If the patient cannot write, a pictograph board may be used. Referral to a speech therapist may be necessary for the patient who has undergone structural changes. The family may become frustrated by the patient's inability to communicate. The patient soon senses this, and both parties may withdraw. Allowing the family to vent their feelings and fears (away from the patient) is important.

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-CONCEPT}

Success in rehabilitating the patient undergoing reconstructive surgery depends on the relationships among the patient and the nurse, the physician, and other health care personnel. Mutual trust, respect, and clear lines of communication are essential. Unhurried care provides emotional reassurance and support.

The kinds of dressings worn, the unusual positions to be maintained, and the temporary incapacity experienced can upset the most stable person. Reinforcement of the patient's successful coping strategies improves self-esteem. If prosthetic devices are used, the patient is taught how to use and care for them to gain a sense of greater independence. Once involved in self-care activities, the patient may feel some control over what was previously an overwhelming situation.

Patients with severe disfigurement are encouraged to socialize to experience the reactions of others in a more protected environment. Gradually, they can widen their sphere of contact. Every effort is made to cover or mask defects. Patients may require support by members of the mental health team to accept their changed appearance.

\section*{PROMOTING FAMILY COPING}

The family is informed about the patient's appearance after surgery, the supportive equipment, and the ways that the equipment aids recovery. It is helpful to join the family for a few minutes during their first postoperative visit to help them cope with the changes they will see.

A major role of the nurse is to support the family in their decision to participate (or not to participate) in the patient's treatment. Nursing interventions also include helping the family members communicate by suggesting ways to reduce anxiety and stress and to promote problem solving and decision making. These activities encourage family members and promote growth.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Infection}

Secondary infection is a primary concern after reconstructive surgery. The source of infection depends on the location and extent of the procedure, the suture line, and the pedicle flap.

The mouth is inspected to determine the location of sutures (when present) so that they are not accidentally disturbed during the cleaning process. The mouth is cleaned according to protocol several times daily. Loose blood clots may be removed with gentle swabbing. The patient is advised not to loosen clots with the tongue because this may cause fresh bleeding. The patient is instructed not to use fingers to clean or remove blood clots because this may introduce organisms that cause infection.

The suture line remains under stress for several days after surgery because of edema, increased drainage, and hematoma formation. The nurse assesses the suture line carefully for signs of
increased tension and infection (ie, elevated temperature, increasing edema, redness, bleeding, and increased pain) with each dressing change. Dressings may need to be changed many times each day until the drainage begins to decrease. Drainage and edema are expected after reconstructive surgery; however, both should decrease, and the process is hastened by using properly placed, functioning suction devices and elevating the head of the bed about 45 degrees. The nurse inspects the suction devices, empties them promptly, and documents the amount and consistency of drainage, as well as any unusual odor. When drainage is not removed or if saturated dressings are left unchanged for long periods, infection is likely to occur. Strict asepsis must be maintained in wound care.

A pedicle flap used in reconstruction may become a source of infection if its circulation becomes compromised. Poor circulation may result from a hematoma forming beneath the flap and causing increased pressure on the underlying vasculature. The nurse inspects the flap for changes in color and temperature indicative of poor circulation. Signs of necrosis, increased drainage, or an odor may be a warning of an infection and should be reported promptly. Reinforcing preoperative teaching about wound healing, the need for strict sterile technique, good personal hygiene, and the need to restrict movement and stress on the operative site is an important part of the nurse's role in postoperative care and in the prevention of secondary infection.

\section*{FACE LIFT}

Rhytidectomy (ie, face lift) is a surgical procedure that removes soft tissue folds and minimizes cutaneous wrinkles on the face. It is performed to create a more youthful appearance.

Psychological preparation requires that the patient recognize the limitations of surgery and the fact that miraculous rejuvenation will not occur. The patient is informed that the face may appear bruised and swollen after the dressings are removed and that several weeks may pass before the edema subsides.

The procedure is performed under local or general anesthesia, often in the outpatient setting. The incisions are concealed in natural skin folds and creases and areas hidden by hair. The loose skin, separated from underlying muscle, is pulled upward and backward. Excess skin that overlaps the incision line is removed. Liposuction-assisted rhytidectomy is being performed more frequently. In this procedure, fat is suctioned from the body through a cannula inserted through a small incision.

\section*{Management}

The nurse encourages the patient to rest quietly for the first 2 postoperative days until the dressings are removed. The head of the bed is elevated, and neck flexion is discouraged to avoid compromising the circulation and the suture line. The patient may feel some tightness of the face and neck from pressure created by the newly tightened muscles, fascia, and skin. Analgesics may be prescribed to relieve discomfort. A liquid diet may be given by means of straws, and a soft diet is permitted if chewing is not too uncomfortable.

When the dressings are removed, the skin is gently cleaned of crusting and oozing and coated with the prescribed topical ointment. Any hair matted with drainage may be combed with warm water and a wide-toothed comb.

The patient is advised not to lift or bend for 7 to 10 days because this activity may increase edema and provoke bleeding. Activities are gradually resumed. When all sutures are removed, the hair may be shampooed and blown dry with warm, not hot, air to avoid burning the ears, which may be numb for a while.

The patient needs to know that a face lift will not stop the aging process and that, with time, the tissues will resume the downward drift. Some patients have two or more face lifts.

Sudden pain indicates that blood is accumulating underneath the skin flaps; it should be reported to the surgeon immediately. Complications include sloughing of the skin, deformities of the face and neck, and partial facial paralysis. Cigarette smoking has been implicated as a cause of skin slough in some patients.

\section*{LaserTreatment of Cutaneous Lesions}

Lasers are devices that amplify or generate highly specialized light energy. They can mobilize immense heat and power when focused at close range and are valuable tools in surgical procedures. The argon laser, carbon dioxide ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) laser, and tunable pulsedye laser are used in dermatologic surgery. Each type of laser emits its own wavelength within the color spectrum.

\section*{ARGON LASER}

The argon laser produces a visible blue-green light that is absorbed by vascular tissue and is therefore useful in treating vascular lesions: port-wine stains, telangiectases, vascular tumors, and pigmented lesions. The argon beam can penetrate approximately 1 mm of skin and reach the pigmented layer, causing protein coagulation in this area. An immediate effect is that tiny blood vessels under the skin coagulate, causing the area to turn a much lighter color. A crust forms within a few days.

During the procedure, the patient may require local anesthesia (lidocaine) but only if the lesion, such as a port-wine stain, is wider than 0.5 cm . Laser beams, regardless of type, are reflected and scattered in all directions during the treatment. Laser radiation is hazardous to the eye, and the eyes of the patient and all personnel involved in the surgical procedure and those who are within the immediate surgical environment must be protected with orange, argon light-absorbing safety goggles.

\section*{Management}

Cold compresses are usually applied over the treatment area for approximately 6 hours to minimize edema, exudate, and loss of capillary permeability. The nurse advises the patient that swelling will subside in 1 to 2 days and will be followed by a crust that will last 7 to 10 days. The nurse instructs the patient to avoid picking at the crust, to apply an antibacterial ointment sparingly until the crust separates, to avoid applying makeup until the wound heals, and to avoid exposure to the sun. Sunscreen is to be used when exposure is unavoidable.

\section*{CARBON DIOXIDE LASER}

The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ laser emits invisible light in the infrared spectrum that is absorbed at the skin surface because of the high water content of the skin and the long wavelength of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ light. As the laser beam strikes tissue, it is absorbed by the intracellular and extracellular water, which vaporizes, destroying the tissue. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ laser is a precise surgical instrument that vaporizes and excises tissue with minimal damage. Because the beam can seal blood and lymphatic vessels, it creates a dry surgical field that makes many procedures easier and quicker. It is therefore safe to use on patients with bleeding disorders or those receiving anticoagulant therapy. It is useful for removing epidermal nevi, tattoos, certain warts, skin cancer, ingrown toenails, and keloids. Incisions made with the laser beam heal and scar much like those made by a scalpel.

In addition to wearing safety goggles, the patient and personnel wear laser-grade surgical masks to avoid inhaling the byproduct smoke, referred to as a plume.

\section*{Management}

Immediately after undergoing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ laser surgery, the treated area turns a charcoal color. The wound is covered with antibacterial ointment and a nonadhesive dressing. The patient is instructed to keep the wound dry except for gentle cleansing with mild soap several times each day. After the skin is cleaned, a prescribed ointment and light dressing are applied.

Because nerve endings and lymphatic vessels are sealed by the laser, less edema and pain follow the laser procedure than follow conventional surgery. A mild analgesic is sufficient to maintain
patient comfort. Wound healing occurs by secondary intention, with granulation tissue appearing within a week; complete healing occurs in several weeks. Sun exposure to the area should be avoided for approximately 6 months. Application of a sunscreen with an SPF value of at least 15 is recommended. People at high risk for skin cancer from sun exposure are advised to use a sunscreen with an SPF greater than 15 to block ultraviolet-B and ultraviolet-A light.

\section*{PULSE-DYE LASER}

The tunable pulse-dye laser with various wavelengths is the latest laser available for dermatologic surgery. It is especially useful in treating cutaneous vascular lesions such as port-wine stains and telangiectasia. Eye protection used for the argon and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ lasers is insufficient when the pulse-dye laser is in use. Special eyeglasses, such as those made of didymium glass, are required for the patient and all personnel. The procedure is generally painless. For procedures requiring anesthesia, lidocaine without epinephrine is sufficient because local vasoconstriction (which epinephrine induces) is unnecessary.

\section*{Management}

The patient should be informed that there may be stinging in the treated area for several hours. Applying ice to the area and a light antibacterial ointment followed by a nonstick dressing (eg, Telfa) usually eases discomfort.

> NURSING ALERT Telfa pads contain latex and should not be used on patients who are latex sensitive. Other dressings such as petrolatum-impregnated gauze should be used to prevent the dressing from adhering to the wound.

If crusting occurs, the patient is advised to wash the area gently with soap and water and reapply the antibacterial cream twice daily until the crust disappears. The nurse also advises the patient to avoid wearing makeup until all crust is removed. Sun exposure should be avoided as well; sunscreens with an SPF value of 15 or greater should be used for 3 to 4 months after the treatment. Complete removal of the lesion at one session, especially a portwine stain, is rare. The patient should be informed that several treatments may be necessary.

\title{
- Management of Patients With Burn Injury
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Discuss the classification system used for burn injuries.
2. Describe the local and systemic effects of a major burn injury.
3. Describe the three phases of burn care and the priorities of care for each phase.
4. Compare and contrast the potential fluid and electrolyte alterations of the emergent/resuscitative and acute phases of burn management.
5. Describe the goals of the following aspects of burn wound care and the nurse's role in each: wound cleaning, topical antibacterial therapy, wound dressing, dressing changes, wound débridement, and wound grafting
6. Describe the nurse's role in the following areas of management: pain management, restrictions of activity and joint motion, psychological support of the patient and family, nutritional support, pulmonary care, and patient and family education.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient during the three phases of burn care.

The nurse who cares for a patient with a burn injury requires a high level of knowledge about the physiologic changes that occur after a burn, as well as astute assessment skills to detect subtle changes in the patient's condition. In addition, the nurse must be able to provide sensitive, compassionate care to patients who are critically ill and must initiate rehabilitation early in the course of care. The nurse must also be able to communicate effectively with burn patients, distraught family members, and members of the entire interdisciplinary burn management team. This will ensure quality care, which increases the likelihood of the patient's survival and promotes optimal quality of life.

\section*{Incidence of Burn Injury}

The incidence of burn injuries has been declining during the past several decades. Approximately 2 million people require medical attention for burn injury in the United States each year (Kao \& Garner, 2000). Of this group, 51,000 require acute hospital admission. About 4,500 people die from burns and related inhalation injuries annually (American Burn Association, 2000). The risk of death increases significantly if the patient has sustained both a cutaneous burn injury and a smoke inhalation injury.

Young children and elderly people are at particularly high risk for burn injury. The skin in people in these two age groups is thin and fragile; therefore, even a limited period of contact with a source of heat can create a full-thickness burn. The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control lists "fire/burn" among the categories of the 1998 Unintentional Injuries and Adverse Effects. Chart 57-1 presents the ranking of "fire/burn" as cause of death by age group.

Most burn injuries occur in the home, usually in the kitchen while cooking and in the bathroom by means of scalds or improper use of electrical appliances around water sources (Gordon \& Goodwin, 1997). Careless cooking is one of the leading causes of household fires in the United States. The U.S. Fire Administration reports that nearly one third of all residential fires begin in the kitchen. The major factors contributing to cooking fires include unattended cooking, grease, and combustible materials on the stovetop.

Burns can also occur from work-related injuries. Education to prevent burn injuries in the workplace should include safe handling

of chemicals and chemical products and increasing awareness of the potential for injuries caused by hot objects and substances. The National Institute for Burn Medicine, which collects statistical data from burn centers throughout the United States, notes that most patients ( $75 \%$ ) are victims of their own actions. Contributing to the statistics are scalds in toddlers, school-age children playing with matches, electrical injury in teenage boys, and smoking in adults combined with the use of drugs and alcohol. One of the major culprits of burn injuries is the inappropriate use of gasoline. The U.S. Home Product Report, 1993-1997 (2000), indicated that there were over 140,000 gasoline-related fires and approximately 500 people died from gasoline-related injuries during this period.

Many burns can be prevented. Nurses can play an active role in preventing fires and burns by teaching prevention concepts and promoting legislation related to fire safety (Chart 57-2). Promoting the use of smoke alarms has had the greatest impact on decreasing fire deaths in the United States.

There are four major goals relating to burns:
1. Prevention
2. Institution of lifesaving measures for the severely burned person

Alloderm: processed dermis from human cadaver skin; can be used as dermal layer for skin grafts
autograft: a graft derived from one part of a patient's body and used on another part of that same patient's body
Biobrane: synthetic dressing composed of a nylon, Silastic membrane combined with a collagen derivative
carboxyhemoglobin: a compound of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin, formed in the blood with exposure to carbon monoxide
collagen: a protein present in skin, tendon, bone, cartilage, and connective tissue
contracture: shrinkage of burn scar through collagen maturation
cultured epithelial autografts (CEA): autologous epidermal cells that proliferate in
culture and then are regrafted onto the patient
dermis: the second layer of skin containing sweat glands, hair follicles, and nerves
débridement: removal of foreign material and devitalized tissue until surrounding healthy tissue is exposed
donor site: the area from which skin is taken to provide a skin graft for another part of the body
epidermis: the outermost layer of skin
eschar: devitalized tissue resulting from a burn
escharotomy: a linear excision made through eschar to release constriction of underlying tissue
excision: surgical removal of tissue
fasciotomy: an incision made through the fascia to release constriction of underlying muscle
heterograft: graft obtained from an animal of a species (ie, pigskin) other than that of the recipient; also called a xenograft
homograft: a graft transferred from one human (living or cadaveric) to another human; also called allograft
hydrotherapy: cleansing of wounds through use of bath, shower, shower cart table, or immersion
hypertrophic scar: excessive scar formation that rises above the level of the skin
Integra: synthetic dermal substitute
rule of nines: method for calculating body surface area burned by dividing the body into multiples of nine

\section*{Outlook for Survival and Recovery}

Great strides in research have helped to increase the survival rate of burn victims. Mortality has fallen to levels never thought possible. Hunt et al. (2000) reported that survival following large burns based on total body surface area (TBSA) appears to have leveled off. Persons older than 70 years are surviving burns of $30 \%$ TBSA; those 60 to 70 years of age, 50\% TBSA; those 20 to 30 years of age, $80 \%$ TBSA; and those 2 to 5 years of age, $75 \%$ TBSA. Research in areas such as fluid resuscitation, emergent burn treatment, inhalation injury treatment, and changes in wound care practice with early débridement and excision have contributed greatly to the decrease in burn deaths. Additionally, a better understanding of the importance of adequate nutritional support has contributed to increased survival rates. Very young and very old people have a high risk of death after burn injuries due to immature and stressed immunologic systems and pre-existing medical conditions, respectively. Chances of survival are greater in children older than age 5 and in adults younger than age 40 . Inhalation injuries in combination with cutaneous burns worsen the prognosis. Outcome depends on the depth and extent of the burn as well as on the pre-injury health status and age of the patient. Acute care of patients with burn injuries has improved to the point at which survival is expected for most patients, and the burn team has shifted its focus to long-term outcomes for these patients.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Reduced mobility, changes in vision, and decreased sensation in the feet and hands place elderly people at higher risk for burn injury; scalds and flames are the leading causes. These changes also place older people at risk for suffering a severe burn because they have difficulty in extinguishing the fire and removing themselves from the burn source.

Morbidity and mortality rates associated with burns are usually greater in elderly patients than in younger patients. Thinning
and loss of elasticity of the skin in the elderly predispose them to a deep injury from a thermal insult that might cause a less severe burn in a younger person. Moreover, chronic illnesses decrease the older person's ability to withstand the multisystem stresses imposed by burn injury.

An important goal of nurses in community and home settings is preventing burn injury, especially among the elderly. Nurses need to assess an elderly patient's ability to perform activities of daily living safely, assist elderly patients and families to modify the environment to ensure safety, and make referrals as needed.

\section*{Pathophysiology of Burns}

Burns are caused by a transfer of energy from a heat source to the body. Heat may be transferred through conduction or electromagnetic radiation. Burns are categorized as thermal (which includes electrical burns), radiation, or chemical. Tissue destruction results from coagulation, protein denaturation, or ionization of cellular contents. The skin and the mucosa of the upper airways are the sites of tissue destruction. Deep tissues, including the viscera, can be damaged by electrical burns or through prolonged contact with a heat source. Disruption of the skin can lead to increased fluid loss, infection, hypothermia, scarring, compromised immunity, and changes in function, appearance, and body image.

The depth of the injury depends on the temperature of the burning agent and the duration of contact with the agent. For example, in the case of scald burns in adults, 1 second of contact with hot tap water at $68.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(156^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ may result in a burn that destroys both the epidermis and the dermis, causing a fullthickness (third-degree) injury. Fifteen seconds of exposure to hot water at $56.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(133^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ results in a similar full-thickness injury. Temperatures less than $111^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ are tolerated for long periods without injury.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF BURNS}

Burn injuries are described according to the depth of the injury and the extent of body surface area injured.

\section*{Burn Depth}

Burns are classified according to the depth of tissue destruction as superficial partial-thickness injuries, deep partial-thickness injuries, or full-thickness injuries. Burn depth determines whether epithelialization will occur. Determining burn depth can be difficult even for the experienced burn care provider. See Chapter 56 for discussion and a diagram of the skin layers; see also Table 57-1. (The categories of superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, and full-thickness burns are similar to, but not the same as, first-, second-, and third-degree burns.)

In a superficial partial-thickness burn, the epidermis is destroyed or injured and a portion of the dermis may be injured. The damaged skin may be painful and appear red and dry, as in sunburn, or it may blister.

A deep partial-thickness burn involves destruction of the epidermis and upper layers of the dermis and injury to deeper portions of the dermis. The wound is painful, appears red, and exudes fluid. Capillary refill follows tissue blanching. Hair follicles remain intact. Deep partial-thickness burns take longer to heal and are more likely to result in hypertrophic scars.

A full-thickness burn involves total destruction of epidermis and dermis and, in some cases, underlying tissue as well. Wound color ranges widely from white to red, brown, or black. The burned area

\end{tabular}
is painless because nerve fibers are destroyed. The wound appears leathery; hair follicles and sweat glands are destroyed (Fig. 57-1).

The following factors are considered in determining the depth of the burn:
- How the injury occurred
- Causative agent, such as flame or scalding liquid
- Temperature of the burning agent
- Duration of contact with the agent
- Thickness of the skin

\section*{Extent of Body Surface Area Injured}

Various methods are used to estimate the TBSA affected by burns; among them are the rule of nines, the Lund and Browder method, and the palm method.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-208.jpg?height=575&width=813&top_left_y=1837&top_left_x=130}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 57-1 Zones of burn injury. Each burned area has three zones of injury. The inner zone (known as the area of coagulation, where cellular death occurs) sustains the most damage. The middle area, or zone of stasis, has a compromised blood supply, inflammation, and tissue injury. The outer zone-the zone of hyperemia-sustains the least damage.}
\end{figure}

\section*{RULE OF NINES}

An estimation of the TBSA involved in a burn is simplified by using the rule of nines (Fig. 57-2). The rule of nines is a quick way to calculate the extent of burns. The system assigns percentages in multiples of nine to major body surfaces.

\section*{LUND AND BROWDER METHOD}

A more precise method of estimating the extent of a burn is the Lund and Browder method, which recognizes that the percentage of TBSA of various anatomic parts, especially the head and legs, and changes with growth. By dividing the body into very small areas and providing an estimate of the proportion of TBSA accounted for by such body parts, one can obtain a reliable estimate of the TBSA burned. The initial evaluation is made on the patient's arrival at the hospital and is revised on the second and third post-burn days because the demarcation usually is not clear until then.

\section*{PALM METHOD}

In patients with scattered burns, a method to estimate the percentage of burn is the palm method. The size of the patient's palm is approximately $1 \%$ of TBSA.

\section*{LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC RESPONSES TO BURNS}

Burns that do not exceed $25 \%$ TBSA produce a primarily local response. Burns that exceed $25 \%$ TBSA may produce both a local and a systemic response and are considered major burn injuries. This systemic response is due to the release of cytokines and other mediators into the systemic circulation. The release of local mediators and changes in blood flow, tissue edema, and infection can cause progression of the burn injury.

Pathophysiologic changes resulting from major burns during the initial burn-shock period include tissue hypoperfusion and organ hypofunction secondary to decreased cardiac output, followed by a hyperdynamic and hypermetabolic phase. The incidence, magnitude, and duration of pathophysiologic changes in

\caption{EIGURE 57-2 The rule of nines: Estimated percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) in the adult is arrived at by sectioning the body surface into areas with a numerical value related to nine. (Note: The anterior and posterior head total $9 \%$ of TBSA.) In burn victims, the total estimated percentage of TBSA injured is used to calculate the patient's fluid replacement needs.}
\end{figure}
burns are proportional to the extent of burn injury, with a maximal response seen in burns covering $60 \%$ or more TBSA.

The initial systemic event after a major burn injury is hemodynamic instability, resulting from loss of capillary integrity and a subsequent shift of fluid, sodium, and protein from the intravascular space into the interstitial spaces. Figure 57-3 illustrates the pathophysiologic processes in acute major burns. Hemodynamic instability involves cardiovascular, fluid and electrolyte, blood volume, pulmonary, and other mechanisms.

\section*{Cardiovascular Response}

Hypovolemia is the immediate consequence of fluid loss resulting in decreased perfusion and oxygen delivery. Cardiac output decreases before any significant change in blood volume is evident. As fluid loss continues and vascular volume decreases, cardiac output continues to fall and blood pressure drops. This is the onset of burn shock. In response, the sympathetic nervous system releases catecholamines, resulting in an increase in peripheral resistance (vasoconstriction) and an increase in pulse rate. Peripheral vasoconstriction further decreases cardiac output. Myocardial contractility may be suppressed by the release of inflammatory cytokine necrosis factor (Wolf, Prough \& Herndon, 2002).

Prompt fluid resuscitation maintains the blood pressure in the low-normal range and improves cardiac output. Despite adequate fluid resuscitation, cardiac filling pressures (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pres-
sure) remain low during the burn-shock period. If inadequate fluid resuscitation occurs, distributive shock will occur (see Chap. 15).

Generally, the greatest volume of fluid leak occurs in the first 24 to 36 hours after the burn, peaking by 6 to 8 hours. As the capillaries begin to regain their integrity, burn shock resolves and fluid returns to the vascular compartment. As fluid is reabsorbed from the interstitial tissue into the vascular compartment, blood volume increases. If renal and cardiac function is adequate, urinary output increases. Diuresis continues for several days to 2 weeks.

\section*{Burn Edema}

Local swelling due to thermal injury is often extensive. Edema is defined as the presence of excessive fluid in the tissue spaces (Lund, 1999). As previously noted, in burns involving less than $25 \%$ TBSA, the loss of capillary integrity and shift of fluid are localized to the burn itself, resulting in blister formation and edema only in the area of injury. Patients with more severe burns develop massive systemic edema. Edema is usually maximal after 24 hours. It begins to resolve 1 to 2 days post-burn and usually is completely resolved in 7 to 10 days post-injury. Edema in burn wounds can be reduced by avoiding excessive fluid during the early post-burn period. Unnecessary over-resuscitation will increase edema formation in both burn tissue and non-burn tissue.

As edema increases in circumferential burns, pressure on small blood vessels and nerves in the distal extremities causes an obstruction of blood flow and consequent ischemia. This complication is known as compartment syndrome. The physician may need to perform an escharotomy, a surgical incision into the eschar (devitalized tissue resulting from a burn), to relieve the constricting effect of the burned tissue.

\section*{Effects on Fluids, Electrolytes, and Blood Volume}

Circulating blood volume decreases dramatically during burn shock. In addition, evaporative fluid loss through the burn wound may reach 3 to 5 L or more over a 24 -hour period until the burn surfaces are covered.

During burn shock, serum sodium levels vary in response to fluid resuscitation. Usually hyponatremia (sodium depletion) is present. Hyponatremia is also common during the first week of the acute phase, as water shifts from the interstitial to the vascular space.

Immediately after burn injury, hyperkalemia (excessive potassium) results from massive cell destruction. Hypokalemia (potassium depletion) may occur later with fluid shifts and inadequate potassium replacement.

At the time of burn injury, some red blood cells may be destroyed and others damaged, resulting in anemia. Despite this, the hematocrit may be elevated due to plasma loss. Blood loss during surgical procedures, wound care, and diagnostic studies and ongoing hemolysis further contribute to anemia. Blood transfusions are required periodically to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels for oxygen delivery. Abnormalities in coagulation, including a decrease in platelets (thrombocytopenia) and prolonged clotting and prothrombin times, also occur with burn injury.

\section*{Pulmonary Response}

Inhalation injury is the leading cause of death in fire victims. It is estimated that half of these deaths could have been prevented with use of a smoke detector. Often, burn victims make it out of

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

a burning home safely. However, once they are outside, they may realize that their loved ones, pets, or valuable items are still inside the burning home. They then re-enter the burning home and are overcome with toxic smoke and fumes and become disoriented or unconscious.

Inhalation injury has a significant impact on survivability of a burn patient. Deterioration in severely burned patients can occur without evidence of a smoke inhalation injury. Bronchoconstriction caused by release of histamine, serotonin, and thromboxane, a powerful vasoconstrictor, as well as chest constriction secondary to circumferential full-thickness chest burns causes this deterioration. One third of all burn patients have a pulmonary problem related to the burn injury (Flynn, 1999). Even without pulmonary injury, hypoxia (oxygen starvation) may be present. Early in the postburn period, catecholamine release in response to the stress of the burn injury alters peripheral blood flow, thereby reducing oxygen delivery to the periphery. Later, hypermetabolism and continued catecholamine release lead to increased tissue oxygen consumption, which can lead to hypoxia. To ensure that adequate oxygen is available to the tissues, supplemental oxygen may be needed.

Pulmonary injuries fall into several categories: upper airway injury; inhalation injury below the glottis, including carbon monoxide poisoning; and restrictive defects. Upper airway injury results from direct heat or edema. It is manifested by mechanical obstruction of the upper airway, including the pharynx and larynx. Because of the cooling effect of rapid vaporization in the pulmonary tract, direct heat injury does not normally occur below the level of the bronchus. Upper airway injury is treated by early nasotracheal or endotracheal intubation.

Inhalation injury below the glottis results from inhaling the products of incomplete combustion or noxious gases. These products include carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, cyanide, ammonia, chlorine, phosgene, benzene, and halogens. The injury results directly from chemical irritation of the pulmonary tissues at the alveolar level. Inhalation injuries below the glottis cause loss of ciliary action, hypersecretion, severe mucosal edema, and possibly bronchospasm. The pulmonary surfactant is reduced, resulting in atelectasis (collapse of alveoli). Expectoration of carbon particles in the sputum is the cardinal sign of this injury.

Carbon monoxide is probably the most common cause of inhalation injury because it is a byproduct of the combustion of organic materials and is therefore present in smoke. The pathophysiologic effects are due to tissue hypoxia, a result of carbon monoxide combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, which competes with oxygen for available hemoglobinbinding sites. The affinity of hemoglobin for carbon monoxide is 200 times greater than that for oxygen. Treatment usually consists of early intubation and mechanical ventilation with $100 \%$ oxygen. However, some patients may require only oxygen therapy, depending on the extent of pulmonary injury and edema. Administering 100\% oxygen is essential to accelerate the removal of carbon monoxide from the hemoglobin molecule.

Restrictive defects arise when edema develops under fullthickness burns encircling the neck and thorax. Chest excursion may be greatly restricted, resulting in decreased tidal volume. In such situations, escharotomy is necessary.

Pulmonary abnormalities are not always immediately apparent. More than half of all burn victims with pulmonary involvement do not initially demonstrate pulmonary signs and symptoms. Any patient with possible inhalation injury must be observed for at least 24 hours for respiratory complications. Airway obstruction may
occur very rapidly or develop in hours. Decreased lung compliance, decreased arterial oxygen levels, and respiratory acidosis may occur gradually over the first 5 days after a burn.

Indicators of possible pulmonary damage include the following:
- History indicating that the burn occurred in an enclosed area
- Burns of the face or neck
- Singed nasal hair
- Hoarseness, voice change, dry cough, stridor, sooty sputum
- Bloody sputum
- Labored breathing or tachypnea (rapid breathing) and other signs of reduced oxygen levels (hypoxemia)
- Erythema and blistering of the oral or pharyngeal mucosa

Diagnosis of inhalation injury is an important priority for many burn victims. Serum carboxyhemoglobin levels and arterial blood gas levels are frequently used to assess for inhalation injuries. Bronchoscopy and xenon-133 ( ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ ) ventilation-perfusion scans can also be used to aid diagnosis in the early postburn period. Pulmonary function studies may also be useful in diagnosing decreased lung compliance or obstructed airflow (Fitzpatrick \& Cioffi, 2002; Flynn, 1999).

Pulmonary complications secondary to inhalation injuries include acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory failure occurs when impairment of ventilation and gas exchange is life-threatening. The immediate intervention is intubation and mechanical ventilation. If ventilation is impaired by restricted chest excursion, immediate chest escharotomy is needed. ARDS may develop in the first few days after the burn injury secondary to systemic and pulmonary responses to the burn and inhalation injury. Respiratory failure and ARDS are discussed in Chapter 23.

\section*{Other Systemic Responses}

Renal function may be altered as a result of decreased blood volume. Destruction of red blood cells at the injury site results in free hemoglobin in the urine. If muscle damage occurs (eg, from electrical burns), myoglobin is released from the muscle cells and excreted by the kidney. Adequate fluid volume replacement restores renal blood flow, increasing the glomerular filtration rate and urine volume. If there is inadequate blood flow through the kidneys, the hemoglobin and myoglobin occlude the renal tubules, resulting in acute tubular necrosis and renal failure (see Chap. 45).

The immunologic defenses of the body are greatly altered by burn injury. Serious burn injury diminishes resistance to infection. As a result, sepsis remains the leading cause of death in thermally injured patients (Cioffi, 2001). The loss of skin integrity is compounded by the release of abnormal inflammatory factors, altered levels of immunoglobulins and serum complement, impaired neutrophil function, and a reduction in lymphocytes (lymphocytopenia). Research suggests that burn injury results in loss of T-helper cell lymphocytes (Munster, 2002). There is a significant impairment of the production and release of granulocytes and macrophages from bone marrow after burn injury. The resulting immunosuppression places the burn patient at high risk for sepsis.

Loss of skin also results in an inability to regulate body temperature. Burn patients may therefore exhibit low body temperatures in the early hours after injury. Then, as hypermetabolism resets core temperatures, burn patients become hyperthermic for much of the postburn period, even in the absence of infection.

Two potential gastrointestinal complications may occur: paralytic ileus (absence of intestinal peristalsis) and Curling's ulcer. Decreased peristalsis and bowel sounds are manifestations of paralytic ileus resulting from burn trauma. Gastric distention and nausea may lead to vomiting unless gastric decompression is initiated. Gastric bleeding secondary to massive physiologic stress may be signaled by occult blood in the stool, regurgitation of "coffee ground" material from the stomach, or bloody vomitus. These signs suggest gastric or duodenal erosion (Curling's ulcer).

\section*{Management of the Patient With a Burn Injury}

Burn care must be planned according to the burn depth and local response, the extent of the injury, and the presence of a systemic response. Burn care then proceeds through three phases: emergent/ resuscitative phase, acute/intermediate phase, and rehabilitation phase. Although priorities exist for each of the phases, the phases overlap, and assessment and management of specific problems and complications are not limited to these phases but take place throughout burn care. The three phases and the priorities for care are summarized in Table 57-2.

\section*{EMERGENT/RESUSCITATIVE PHASE OF BURN CARE}

\section*{On-the-Scene Care}

Anyone who encounters a burn victim for the first time may feel overwhelmed. The burned person's appearance can be frightening at first. It can be difficult not to get caught up with the appearance of the person and instead to concentrate on the burn wounds. However, the burn wound is not the first priority at the scene: the first priority of on-the-scene care for a burn victim is to prevent injury to the rescuer. If needed, fire and emergency medical services should be requested at the first opportunity. Additional emergency procedures are highlighted in Chart 57-3.

\section*{AIRWAY, BREATHING, CIRCULATION}

Although the local effects of a burn are the most evident, the systemic effects pose a greater threat to life. Therefore, it is important to remember the ABCs of all trauma care during the early postburn period:
- Airway
- Breathing
- Circulation; cervical spine immobilization for patients with high-voltage electrical injuries and if indicated for other injuries; cardiac monitoring for patients with all electrical injuries for at least 24 hours after cessation of dysrhythmia
Some practitioners include "DEF" in the trauma assessment: disability, exposure, and fluid resuscitation (Weibelhaus \& Hansen, 2001).

NURSING ALERT Breathing must be assessed and a patent airway established immediately during the initial minutes of emergency care. Immediate therapy is directed toward establishing an airway and administering humidified $100 \%$ oxygen. If such a high concentration of oxygen is not available under emergency conditions, oxygen by mask or nasal cannula is given initially. If qualified personnel and equipment are available and if the victim has severe respiratory distress or airway edema, the rescuers can insert an endotracheal tube and initiate manual ventilation.

The circulatory system must also be assessed quickly. Apical pulse and blood pressure are monitored frequently. Tachycardia (abnormally rapid heart rate) and slight hypotension are expected soon after the burn. The neurologic status is assessed quickly in the patient with extensive burns. Often the burn patient is awake and alert initially, and vital information can be obtained at that time. A secondary head-to-toe survey of the patient is carried out to identify other potentially life-threatening injuries. (The E and F parameters of trauma assessment are discussed in detail later.) Preventing shock in a burn patient is imperative.

> NURSING ALERT No food or fluid is given by mouth, and the patient is placed in a position that will prevent aspiration of vomitus because nausea and vomiting typically occur due to paralytic ileus resulting from the stress of injury.

Usually, rescue workers will cool the wound, establish an airway, supply oxygen, and insert at least one large-bore intravenous line.

\section*{Emergency Procedures at the Burn Scene}
- Extinguish the flames. When clothes catch fire, the flames can be extinguished if the victim falls to the floor or ground and rolls ("drop and roll"); anything available to smother the flames, such as a blanket, rug, or coat, may be used. Standing still forces the victim to breathe flames and smoke, and running fans the flames. If the burn source is electrical, the electrical source must be disconnected.
- Cool the burn. After the flames are extinguished, the burned area and adherent clothing are soaked with cool water, briefly, to cool the wound and halt the burning process. Once a burn has been sustained, the application of cool water is the best first-aid measure. Soaking the burn area intermittently in cool water or applying cool towels gives immediate and striking relief from pain and limits local tissue edema and damage. However, never apply ice directly to the burn, never wrap burn victims in ice, and never use cold soaks or dressings for longer than several minutes; such procedures may worsen the tissue damage and lead to hypothermia in patients with large burns.
- Remove restrictive objects. If possible, remove clothing immediately. Adherent clothing may be left in place once cooled. Other clothing and all jewelry should be removed to allow for assessment and to prevent constriction secondary to rapidly developing edema.
- Cover the wound. The burn should be covered as quickly as possible to minimize bacterial contamination and decrease pain by preventing air from coming into contact with the injured surface. Sterile dressings are best, but any clean, dry cloth can be used as an emergency dressing. Ointments and salves should not be used. Other than the dressing, no medication or material should be applied to the burn wound.
- Irrigate chemical burns. Chemical burns resulting from contact with a corrosive material are irrigated immediately. Most chemical laboratories have a high-pressure shower for such emergencies. If such an injury occurs at home, brush off the chemical agent, remove clothes immediately, and rinse all areas of the body that have come in contact with the chemical. Rinsing can occur in the shower or any other source of continuous running water. If a chemical gets in or near the eyes, the eyes should be flushed with cool, clean water immediately. Outcomes for the patient with chemical burns are significantly improved by rapid, sustained flushing of the injury at the scene.

\section*{Emergency Medical Management}

The patient is transported to the nearest emergency department. The hospital and physician are alerted that the patient is en route to the emergency department so that life-saving measures can be initiated immediately by a trained team.

Initial priorities in the emergency department remain airway, breathing, and circulation. For mild pulmonary injury, inspired air is humidified and the patient is encouraged to cough so that secretions can be removed by suctioning. For more severe situations, it is necessary to remove secretions by bronchial suctioning and to administer bronchodilators and mucolytic agents. If edema of the airway develops, endotracheal intubation may be necessary. Continuous positive airway pressure and mechanical ventilation may also be required to achieve adequate oxygenation.

After adequate respiratory status and circulatory status have been established, the patient is assessed for cervical spinal injuries or head injury if the patient was involved in an explosion, a fall, a jump, or an electrical injury. Once the patient's condition is stable, attention is directed to the burn wound itself. All clothing and jewelry are removed. For chemical burns, flushing of the exposed areas is continued. The patient is checked for contact lenses. These are removed immediately if chemicals have contacted the eyes or if facial burns have occurred.

It is important to validate an account of the burn scenario provided by the patient, witnesses at the scene, and paramedics. Information needs to include time of the burn injury, source of the burn, place where the burn occurred, how the burn was treated at the scene, and any history of falling with the injury. A history of preexisting diseases, allergies, and medications and the use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco is obtained at this point to plan care. A large-bore (16- or 18-gauge) intravenous catheter should be inserted in a non-burned area (if not inserted earlier). Most patients have a central venous catheter inserted so that large amounts of intravenous fluids can be given quickly and central venous pressures can be monitored. If the burn exceeds $25 \%$ TBSA or if the patient is nauseated, a nasogastric tube should be inserted and connected to suction to prevent vomiting due to paralytic ileus (absence of peristalsis).

The physician evaluates the patient's general condition, assesses the burn, determines the priorities of care, and directs the individualized plan of treatment, which is divided into systemic management and local care of the burned area. Nonsterile gloves, caps, and gowns are worn by personnel while assessing the exposed burned areas. Clean technique is maintained while assessing burn wounds.

Assessment of both the TBSA burned and the depth of the burn is completed after soot and debris have been gently cleansed from the burn wound. Careful attention is paid to keeping the burn patient warm during wound assessment and cleansing. Assessment is repeated frequently throughout burn wound care. Photographs may be taken of the burn areas initially and periodically throughout treatment; in this way, the initial injury and burn wound can be documented. Such documentation is invaluable for insurance and legal claims. Clean sheets are placed under and over the patient to protect the area from contamination, maintain body temperature, and reduce pain caused by air currents passing over exposed nerve endings.

An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to permit more accurate monitoring of urine output and renal function for patients with moderate to severe burns. Baseline height, weight, arterial blood gases, hematocrit, electrolyte values, blood alcohol level, drug panel, urinalysis, and chest x-rays are obtained. If the patient is elderly or has an electrical burn, a baseline electrocardiogram is obtained. Because burns are contaminated wounds, tetanus prophylaxis is administered if the patient's immunization status is not current or is unknown.

Although the major focus of care during the emergent phase is physical stabilization, the nurse must also attend to the patient's and family's psychological needs. Burn injury is a crisis, causing variable emotional responses. The patient's and family's coping abilities and available supports are assessed. Circumstances surrounding the burn injury should be considered when providing care. Individualized psychosocial support must be given to the patient and family. Because the emergent burn patient is usually anxious and in pain, those in attendance should provide reassurance and support, explanations of procedures, and adequate pain relief. Because poor tissue perfusion accompanies burn injuries,
only intravenous pain medication (usually morphine) is given, titrated for the patient. If the patient wishes to see a spiritual advisor, one is notified.

\section*{TRANSFER TO A BURN CENTER}

The depth and extent of the burn are considered in determining whether the patient should be transferred to a burn center. Patients with major burns, those who are at the extremes of the age continuum, those with coexisting health problems that may affect recovery, and those with circumstances that increase their risk for acute and long-term complications are transferred to a burn center. Chart 57-4 lists the American Burn Association's criteria for burn center referral after initial assessment and management.

If the patient is to be transported to a burn center, the following measures are instituted before transfer:
- A secure intravenous catheter is inserted with lactated Ringer's solution infusing at the rate required to maintain a urine output of at least 30 mL per hour.
- A patent airway is ensured.
- Adequate pain relief is attained.
- Adequate peripheral circulation is established in any burned extremity.
- Wounds are covered with a clean, dry sheet, and the patient is kept comfortably warm.

All assessments and treatments are documented, and this information is provided to the burn center personnel. The transferring facility must relay accurate intake and output totals to burn center personnel so that adequate fluid resuscitation measures continue.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF FLUID LOSS AND SHOCK}

Next to handling respiratory difficulties, the most urgent need is preventing irreversible shock by replacing lost fluids and electrolytes. As mentioned previously, survival of burn victims depends on adequate fluid resuscitation. Table 57-3 summarizes the fluid and electrolyte changes in the emergent phase of burn care. Intravenous lines and an indwelling catheter must be in place before implementing fluid resuscitation. Baseline weight and laboratory test results are obtained as well. These parameters must be monitored closely in the immediate post-burn (resuscitation) period. Controversy continues regarding the definition of adequate resuscitation and the optimal fluid type for resuscitation. Refinement of resuscitation techniques remains an active area of burn research.

Fluid Replacement Therapy. The total volume and rate of intravenous fluid replacement are gauged by the patient's response. The adequacy of fluid resuscitation is determined by following urine output totals, an index of renal perfusion. Output totals of 30 to $50 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour have been used as goals. Other indicators of adequate fluid replacement are a systolic blood pressure exceeding 100 mm Hg and/or a pulse rate less than $110 /$ minute.

> NURSING ALERT Clinical parameters are far more important in resuscitation than any formula. Indeed, the patient's individual response is the key to assessing the adequacy of fluid resuscitation.

Additional gauges of fluid requirements and response to fluid resuscitation include hematocrit and hemoglobin and serum sodium levels. If the hematocrit and the hemoglobin levels decrease or if the urinary output exceeds $50 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour , the rate of intravenous fluid administration may be decreased. The goal is to maintain serum sodium levels in the normal range during fluid replacement.

Appropriate resuscitation endpoints for burn patients remain controversial. Research in this area has led to the study of hemodynamic and oxygen transport resuscitation endpoints. When these endpoints were used, massive fluid resuscitation volumes were administered that could have deleterious effects. Successful resuscitation is associated with increased delivery of oxygen and consumption of oxygen with declining serum lactate levels (Holm et al., 2000). Attention has been directed recently toward other indicators of adequate resuscitation: base deficit and serum lactate levels. Measurement of serum lactate levels does not appear useful in the treatment of burn patients because of the large amounts of lactate released from burned tissue; however, metabolism of lactate is unaltered. Elevated levels occur despite adequate fluid resuscitation (Yowler \& Fratianne, 2000). Factors that are associated with the increased fluid requirements include delayed resuscitation, scald burn injuries, inhalation injuries, high-voltage electrical injuries, hyperglycemia, alcohol intoxication, and chronic diuretic therapy. Second 24 -hour post-burn fluid infusion rates incorporate both the maintenance amount of fluid and any additional fluid needs secondary to evaporative water loss through the burn wound.

Fluid Requirements. The projected fluid requirements for the first 24 hours are calculated by the clinician based on the extent of the burn injury. Some combination of fluid categories may be used: colloids (whole blood, plasma, and plasma expanders) and crystalloids/electrolytes (physiologic sodium chloride or lactated

Ringer's solution). Adequate fluid resuscitation results in slightly decreased blood volume levels during the first 24 post-burn hours and restores plasma levels to normal by the end of 48 hours. Oral resuscitation can be successful in adults with less than $20 \%$ TBSA and children with less than $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ TBSA.

Formulas have been developed for estimating fluid loss based on the estimated percentage of burned TBSA and the weight of the patient. Length of time since burn injury occurred is also very important in calculating estimated fluid needs. Formulas must be adjusted so that initiation of fluid replacement reflects the time of injury. Resuscitation formulas are approximations only and are individualized to meet the requirements of each patient. The various formulas are discussed below and summarized in Chart 57-5.

As early as 1978, the NIH Consensus Development Conference on Supportive Therapy in Burn Care established that salt and water are required in burn patients, but that colloid may or may not be useful during the first 24 to 48 post-burn hours. The consensus formula provides for the volume of balanced salt solution to be administered in the first 24 hours in a range of 2 to $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ per percent burn. In general, $2 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ per percent burn of lactated Ringer's solution may be used initially for adults. This is the most common fluid replacement formula in use today. As with the other formulas, half of the calculated total should be given over the first 8 post-burn hours, and the other half should be given over the next 16 hours. The rate and volume of the infusion must be regulated according to the patient's response by changing the

hourly infusion rates. Fluid boluses are recommended only in the presence of marked hypotension, not low urine output. Typical fluid rate changes should involve an increase or decrease in flow rate by no more than $25 \%$ to $33 \%$ (Yowler \& Fratianne, 2000).

Studies demonstrate that with large burns, there is a failure of the sodium-potassium pump (a physiologic mechanism involved in fluid-electrolyte balance) at the cellular level. Thus, patients with very large burns may need proportionately more milliliters of fluid per percent of burn than those with smaller burns. Also, patients with electrical injury, pulmonary injury, and delayed fluid resuscitation and those who were burned while intoxicated may need additional fluids.

The following example illustrates use of the formula in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ (168-lb) patient with a 50\% TBSA burn:
1. Consensus formula: 2 to $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \%$ TBSA
2. $2 \times 70 \times 50=7,000 \mathrm{~mL} / 24$ hours
3. Plan to administer: First 8 hours $=3,500 \mathrm{~mL}$, or $437 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour; next 16 hours $=3,500 \mathrm{~mL}$, or $219 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour

Most fluid replacement formulas use isotonic electrolyte solutions. Regardless of which standard replacement formula is used, the patient receives approximately the same fluid volume and sodium replacement during the first 48 hours.

Another fluid replacement method requires hypertonic electrolyte solutions. This method uses concentrated solutions of sodium chloride and lactate (a balanced salt solution) so that the resulting fluid has a concentration of 250 to 300 mEq of sodium. The rationale for this replacement method is that by increasing serum osmolality, fluid will be pulled back into the vascular space from the interstitial space. Reduced systemic and pulmonary edema has been reported after administering hypertonic solutions.

NURSING ALERT Formulas are only a guide. The patient's response, evidenced by heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, is the primary determinant of actual fluid therapy and must be assessed at least hourly. Patient outcomes are improved by optimal fluid resuscitation.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Decreased function of the cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary systems increases the need for close observation of elderly patients with even relatively minor burns during the emergent and acute phases. Acute renal failure is much more common in elderly patients than in those younger than age 40 . The margin of difference between hypovolemia and fluid overload is very small. Suppressed immunologic response, a high incidence of malnutrition, and an inability to withstand metabolic stressors (eg, a cold environment) further compromise the elderly person's ability to heal. As a result of these issues in elderly patients who sustain burn injury, close monitoring and prompt treatment of complications are mandatory.

\section*{Nursing Management:}

\section*{Emergent/Resuscitative Phase}

Assessment data obtained by prehospital providers (rescuers such as emergency medical technicians) are shared with the physician and nurse in the emergency department. Nursing assessment in the emergent phase of burn injury focuses on the major priorities for any trauma patient; the burn wound is a secondary consider-
ation. Aseptic management of the burn wounds and invasive lines continues.

The nurse monitors vital signs frequently. Respiratory status is monitored closely, and apical, carotid, and femoral pulses are evaluated. Cardiac monitoring is indicated if the patient has a history of cardiac disease, electrical injury, or respiratory problems, or if the pulse is dysrhythmic or the rate is abnormally slow or rapid.

If all extremities are burned, determining blood pressure may be difficult. A sterile dressing applied under the blood pressure cuff will protect the wound from contamination. Because increasing edema makes blood pressure difficult to auscultate, a Doppler (ultrasound) device or a noninvasive electronic blood pressure device may be helpful. In severe burns, an arterial catheter is used for blood pressure measurement and for collecting blood specimens. Peripheral pulses of burned extremities are checked hourly; the Doppler device is useful for this. Elevation of burned extremities is crucial to decrease edema. Elevation of the lower extremities on pillows and of the upper extremities on pillows or by suspension using intravenous poles may be helpful.

Large-bore intravenous catheters and an indwelling urinary catheter are inserted, and the nurse's assessment includes monitoring fluid intake and output. Urine output, an indicator of renal perfusion, is monitored carefully and measured hourly. The amount of urine first obtained when the urinary catheter was inserted is recorded. This may assist in determining the extent of preburn renal function and fluid status. Urine specific gravity, pH , and glucose, acetone, protein, and hemoglobin levels are assessed frequently.

Burgundy-colored urine suggests the presence of hemochromogen and myoglobin resulting from muscle damage. This is associated with deep burns caused by electrical injury or prolonged contact with flames. Glucosuria, a common finding in the early postburn hours, results from the release of stored glucose from the liver in response to stress.

Although not responsible for calculating the patient's fluid requirements, the nurse needs to know the maximum volume of fluid the patient should receive. Infusion pumps and rate controllers are used to deliver a complex regimen of prescribed intravenous fluids. Administering and monitoring intravenous therapy are major nursing responsibilities.

Body temperature, body weight, preburn weight, and history of allergies, tetanus immunization, past medical and surgical problems, current illnesses, and use of medications are assessed. A head-to-toe assessment is performed, focusing on signs and symptoms of concomitant illness, injury, or developing complications. Patients with facial burns should have their eyes examined for potential injury to the corneas. An ophthalmologist is consulted for complete assessment via fluorescent staining.

Assessing the extent of the burn wound continues and is facilitated with anatomic diagrams (described previously). In addition, the nurse works with the physician to assess the depth of the wound and areas of full- and partial-thickness injury. Assessment of the circumstances surrounding the injury is important. Obtaining a history of the burn injury can help to plan the care for the patient. Assessment should include the time of injury, mechanism of burn, whether the burn occurred in a closed space, the possibility of inhalation of noxious chemicals, and any related trauma.

The neurologic assessment focuses on the patient's level of consciousness, psychological status, pain and anxiety levels, and behavior. The patient's and family's understanding of the injury and treatment is assessed as well.

Nursing care of the patient during the emergent/resuscitative phase of burn injury is detailed in the Plan of Nursing Care.

5. Report labored respirations, decreased depth of respirations, or signs of hypoxia to physician immediately.
6. Prepare to assist with intubation and escharotomies.
7. Monitor mechanically ventilated patient closely.
2. These factors provide baseline data for further assessment and evidence of increasing respiratory compromise.
3. These signs indicate possible inhalation injury and risk of respiratory dysfunction.
4. Increasing $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and decreasing $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation may indicate need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Immediate intervention is indicated for respiratory difficulty.
6. Intubation allows mechanical ventilation. Escharotomy enables chest excursion in circumferential chest burns.
7. Monitoring allows early detection of decreasing respiratory status or complica-
- Absence of dyspnea
- Respiratory rate between 12 and 20 breaths $/ \mathrm{min}$
- Lungs clear on auscultation
- Arterial oxygen saturation $>96 \%$ by pulse oximetry
- Arterial blood gas levels within normal limits tions of mechanical ventilation.

Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective airway clearance related to edema and effects of smoke inhalation
Goal: Maintain patent airway and adequate airway clearance
1. Maintain patent airway through proper patient positioning, removal of secretions, and artificial airway if needed.
2. Provide humidified oxygen.
3. Encourage patient to turn, cough, and deep breathe. Encourage patient to use incentive spirometry. Suction as needed.
1. A patent airway is crucial to respiration.
2. Humidity liquefies secretions and facilitates expectoration.
3. These activities promote mobilization and removal of secretions.
- Patent airway
- Respiratory secretions are minimal, colorless, and thin
- Respiratory rate, pattern, and breath sounds normal

Nursing Diagnosis: Fluid volume deficit related to increased capillary permeability and evaporative losses from the burn wound
Goal: Restoration of optimal fluid and electrolyte balance and perfusion of vital organs
1. Observe vital signs (including central venous pressure or pulmonary artery pressure, if indicated) and urine output, and be alert for signs of hypovolemia or fluid overload.
2. Monitor urine output at least hourly and weigh patient daily.
1. Hypovolemia is a major risk immediately after the burn injury. Overresuscitation might cause fluid overload.
2. Output and weight provide information about renal perfusion, adequacy of fluid replacement, and fluid requirement and fluid status.
- Serum electrolytes within normal limits
- Urine output between 0.5 and $1.0 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$

Nursing Interventions
Rationale
Expected Outcomes
3. Maintain IV lines and regulate fluids at appropriate rates, as prescribed.
4. Observe for symptoms of deficiency or excess of serum sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate.
5. Elevate head of patient's bed and elevate burned extremities.
6. Notify physician immediately of decreased urine output, blood pressure, central venous, pulmonary artery, or pulmonary artery wedge pressures, or increased pulse rate.
3. Adequate fluids are necessary to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and perfusion of vital organs.
4. Rapid shifts in fluid and electrolyte status are possible in the postburn period.
5. Elevation promotes venous return.
6. Because of the rapid fluid shifts in burn shock, fluid deficit must be detected early so that distributive shock does not occur.

Nursing Diagnosis: Hypothermia related to loss of skin microcirculation and open wounds
Goal: Maintenance of adequate body temperature
1. Provide a warm environment through use of heat shield, space blanket, heat lights, or blankets.
2. Work quickly when wounds must be exposed.
3. Assess core body temperature frequently.
1. A stable environment minimizes evaporative heat loss.
2. Minimal exposure minimizes heat loss from wound.
3. Frequent temperature assessments help detect developing hypothermia.
- Body temperature remains $36.1^{\circ}$ to $38.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(97^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$
- Absence of chills or shivering

Nursing Diagnosis: Pain related to tissue and nerve injury and emotional impact of injury
Goal: Control of pain
1. Use pain intensity scale to assess pain level (ie, 1 to 10). Differentiate from hypoxia.
2. Administer intravenous opioid analgesics as prescribed. Observe for respiratory depression in the patient who is not mechanically ventilated. Assess response to analgesic.
3. Provide emotional support and reassurance.
1. Pain level provides baseline for evaluating effectiveness of pain relief measures. Hypoxia can cause similar signs and must be ruled out before analgesic medication is administered.
2. Intravenous administration is necessary because of altered tissue perfusion from burn injury.
3. Emotional support is essential to reduce fear and anxiety resulting from burn injury. Fear and anxiety increase the perception of pain.
- States pain level is decreased
- Absence of nonverbal cues of pain

Nursing Diagnosis: Anxiety related to fear and the emotional impact of burn injury
Goal: Minimization of patient's and family's anxiety
1. Assess patient's and family's understanding of burn injury, coping skills, and family dynamics.
2. Individualize responses to the patient's and family's coping level.
3. Explain all procedures to the patient and the family in clear, simple terms.
1. Previous successful coping strategies can be fostered for use in the present crisis. Assessment allows planning of individualized interventions.
2. Reactions to burn injury are extremely variable. Interventions must be appropriate to the patient's and family's present level of coping.
3. Increased understanding alleviates fear of the unknown. High levels of anxiety may interfere with understanding of complex explanations.
- Patient and family verbalize understanding of emergent burn care
- Able to answer simple questions

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
4. Maintain adequate pain relief.
5. Consider administering prescribed antianxiety medications if the patient remains extremely anxious despite nonpharmacologic interventions.

\section*{Rationale}
4. Pain increases anxiety.
5. Anxiety levels during the emergent phase may exceed the patient's coping abilities. Medication decreases physiologic and psychological anxiety responses.

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

4. Administer increased fluids as prescribed.

\section*{Compartment Syndrome}
1. Assess peripheral pulses hourly with Doppler ultrasound device.
2. Assess warmth, capillary refill, sensation, and movement of extremity hourly. Compare affected with unaffected extremity.
1. Such signs reflect deteriorating respiratory status.
2. Such signs reflect decreased oxygenation status.
3. X-ray may disclose pulmonary injury.
4. Such manifestations may indicate cerebral hypoxia.
5. Acute respiratory failure is life-threatening, and immediate intervention is required.
6. Intubation allows mechanical ventilation. Escharotomies allow improved chest excursion with respirations.
1. Such signs and symptoms may indicate distributive shock and inadequate intravascular volume.
2. As fluid shifts into the interstitial spaces in burn shock, edema occurs and may compromise tissue perfusion.
3. Optimal fluid resuscitation prevents distributive shock and improves patient outcomes.
1. These values reflect renal function.
2. These laboratory values indicate possible renal failure.
3. Hemoglobin or myoglobin in the urine points to an increased risk of renal failure.
4. Fluids help to flush out hemoglobin and myoglobin from renal tubules, decreasing the potential for renal failure.
1. Assessment with Doppler device substitutes for auscultation and indicates characteristics of arterial blood flow.
2. These assessments indicate characteristics of peripheral perfusion.
- Arterial blood gas values within acceptable limits: $\mathrm{PO}_{2}>80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, \mathrm{PCO}_{2}<50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$

\section*{Rationale}
3. Cuff may act as a tourniquet as extremities swell.
4. Elevation reduces edema formation.
5. These signs and symptoms may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion.
6. Escharotomies relieve the constriction caused by swelling under circumferential burns and improve tissue perfusion.
1. This measure relieves gastric and abdominal distention, also prevents vomiting.
2. As bowel sounds resume, feeding may be slowly initiated. Abdominal distention reflects inadequate decompression.
1. Acidic pH indicates need for antacids or histamine blockers. Blood indicates possible gastric bleeding.
2. Blood in stools may indicate gastric or duodenal ulcer.
3. Such medications reduce gastric acidity and risk of ulceration.

\section*{Expected Outcomes}
- Absence of abdominal distention
- Normal bowel sounds within 48 hours
- Absence of abdominal distention
- Normal bowel sounds within 48 hours
- Gastric aspirate and stools do not contain blood

\section*{ACUTE OR INTERMEDIATE PHASE OF BURN CARE}

The acute or intermediate phase of burn care follows the emergent/ resuscitative phase and begins 48 to 72 hours after the burn injury. During this phase, attention is directed toward continued assessment and maintenance of respiratory and circulatory status, fluid and electrolyte balance, and gastrointestinal function. Infection prevention, burn wound care (ie, wound cleaning, topical antibacterial therapy, wound dressing, dressing changes, wound débridement, and wound grafting), pain management, and nutritional support are priorities at this stage and will be discussed in detail.

Airway obstruction caused by upper airway edema can take as long as 48 hours to develop. Changes detected by x-ray and arterial blood gases may occur as the effects of resuscitative fluid and the chemical reaction of smoke ingredients with lung tissues become apparent. The arterial blood gas values and other parameters determine the need for intubation or mechanical ventilation.

As capillaries regain integrity, at 48 or more postburn hours, fluid moves from the interstitial to the intravascular compartment and diuresis begins (Table 57-4). If cardiac or renal function is inadequate, for instance in the elderly patient or in the patient with preexisting cardiac disease, fluid overload occurs and symptoms of congestive heart failure may result (see Chap. 30). Early detection allows for early intervention and carefully calculated fluid intake. Vasoactive medications, diuretics, and fluid restriction may be used to support circulatory function and prevent congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.

Cautious administration of fluids and electrolytes continues during this phase of burn care because of the shifts in fluid from
the interstitial to intravascular compartments, losses of fluid from large burn wounds, and the patient's physiologic responses to the burn injury. Blood components are administered as needed to treat blood loss and anemia.

\hline
\end{tabular}
results in a body temperature a few degrees higher than normal for several weeks after the burn. Bacteremia and septicemia also cause fever in many patients. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and hypothermia blankets may be required to maintain body temperature in a range of $37.2^{\circ}$ to $38.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(99^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ to reduce metabolic stress and tissue oxygen demand.

Central venous, peripheral arterial, or pulmonary artery thermodilution catheters may be required for monitoring venous and arterial pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, or cardiac output. Generally, however, invasive vascular lines are avoided unless essential because they provide an additional port for infection in an already greatly compromised patient.

Infection progressing to septic shock is the major cause of death in patients who have survived the first few days after a major burn. The immunosuppression that accompanies extensive burn injury places the patient at high risk for sepsis. The infection that begins within the burn site may spread to the bloodstream.

\section*{Infection Prevention}

Despite aseptic precautions and the use of topical antimicrobial agents, the burn wound is an excellent medium for bacterial growth and proliferation. Bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella find optimal conditions for growth within the burn wound. The burn eschar is a nonviable crust with no blood supply; therefore, neither polymorphonuclear leukocytes or antibodies nor systemic antibiotics can reach the area. Phenomenal numbers of bacteria-more than 1 billion per gram of tissue-may appear and subsequently spread to the bloodstream or release their toxins, which reach distant sites. Staphylococci and enterococci are the organisms responsible for more than 50\% of nosocomial bloodstream infections in patients with burn injuries. Fungi such as Candida albicans also grow easily in burn wounds.

When the burn wound is healing through spontaneous reepithelialization or is being prepared for skin grafting, it must be protected from sepsis. Burn wound sepsis has these characteristics:
- $10^{5}$ bacteria per gram of tissue
- Inflammation
- Sludging and thrombosis of dermal blood vessels

The primary source of bacterial infection appears to be the patient's intestinal tract, the source of most microbes. The intestinal mucosa normally serves as a barrier to keep the internal environment free from a variety of pathogens. After a severe burn injury, the intestinal mucosal barrier becomes markedly permeable. Because of this impaired intestinal mucosal barrier, the disturbed microbial flora and endotoxins found in the intestinal lumen pass freely into the systemic circulation, finally causing infection. If the intestinal mucosa receives some type of protection against permeability change, infection could be avoided. Early enteral feeding is one step to help avoid this increased intestinal permeability and prevent early endotoxin translocation (Cioffi, 2000; Peng, Yuan \& Ziao, 2001).

Infection impedes burn wound healing by promoting excessive inflammation and damaging tissue. A major secondary source of pathogenic microbes is the environment. Infection control is a major role of the burn team in providing appropriate burn wound care. Cap, gown, mask, and gloves are worn while caring for the patient with open burn wounds. Clean technique is used when caring directly for burn wounds.

Tissue specimens are obtained for culture regularly to monitor colonization of the wound by microbial organisms. These may be swab, surface, or tissue biopsy cultures. Swab or surface cultures are noninvasive, simple, and painless. However, data obtained from such cultures apply only to the area sampled; therefore, invasive wound biopsy cultures may be required. Antibiotics are seldom prescribed prophylactically because of the risk of promoting resistant strains of bacteria. Systemic antibiotics are administered when there is documentation of burn wound sepsis or other positive cultures such as urine, sputum, or blood. Sensitivity of the organisms to the prescribed antibiotics should be determined before administration. Several parenteral antimicrobial agents may be given together to treat the infection. Careful attention is paid to antibiotic use in the burn unit because inappropriate use of antibiotics significantly affects the microbial flora present in the unit.

\section*{Wound Cleaning}

Various measures are used to clean the burn wound. Hydrotherapy in the form of shower carts, individual showers, and bed baths can be used to clean the wounds. Total immersion hydrotherapy is performed in some settings. Because of the high risk of infection and sepsis, the use of plastic liners and thorough decontamination of hydrotherapy equipment and wound care areas are necessary to prevent cross-contamination. Tap water alone can be used for burn wound cleansing. The temperature of the water is maintained at $37.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, and the temperature of the room should be maintained between $26.6^{\circ}$ and $29.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(80^{\circ}\right.$ to $85^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ). Hydrotherapy, in whatever form, should be limited to a 20 - to 30 -minute period to prevent chilling of the patient and additional metabolic stress.

During the bath, the patient is encouraged to be as active as possible. Hydrotherapy provides an excellent opportunity for exercising the extremities and cleaning the entire body. When the patient is removed from the tub after the bath, any residue adhering to the body is washed away with a clear water spray or shower. Unburned areas, including the hair, must be washed regularly as well. At the time of wound cleaning, all skin is inspected for any hints of redness, breakdown, or local infection. Hair in and around the burn area, except the eyebrows, should be clipped short. Intact blisters may be left, but the fluid should be aspirated with a needle and syringe and discarded.

Conscientious management of the burn wound is essential. When nonviable loose skin is removed, aseptic conditions must be established. Wound cleaning is usually performed at least daily in wound areas that are not undergoing surgical intervention. When the eschar begins to separate from the viable tissue beneath (approximately 1.5 to 2 weeks after the burn), more frequent cleaning and débridement may be in order.

After the burn wounds are cleaned, they are gently patted with towels and the prescribed method of wound care is performed. Physician preferences, the availability of skilled nursing staff, and resources in terms of number of personnel, supplies, and time must be considered in choosing the best method for a given patient. Whatever the method, the goal is to protect the wound from overwhelming proliferation of pathogenic organisms and invasion of deeper tissues until either spontaneous healing or skin grafting can be achieved.

Patient comfort and ability to participate in the prescribed treatment are also important considerations. Wound care procedures, particularly tub baths, are metabolically stressful. Therefore, the patient is assessed for signs of chilling, fatigue, changes
in hemodynamic status, and pain unrelieved by analgesic medications or relaxation techniques.

\section*{Topical Antibacterial Therapy}

There is general agreement that some form of antimicrobial therapy applied to the burn wound is the best method of local care in extensive burn injury. Topical antibacterial therapy does not sterilize the burn wound; it simply reduces the number of bacteria so that the overall microbial population can be controlled by the body's host defense mechanisms. Topical therapy promotes conversion of the open, dirty wound to a closed, clean one.

Criteria for choosing a topical agent include the following:
- It is effective against gram-negative organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and even fungi.
- It is clinically effective.
- It penetrates the eschar but is not systemically toxic.
- It does not lose its effectiveness, allowing another infection to develop.
- It is cost-effective, available, and acceptable to the patient.
- It is easy to apply, minimizing nursing care time.

The three most commonly used topical agents are silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene), silver nitrate, and mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon). These agents are described in Table 57-5. Many other topical agents are available, including povidone-iodine ointment $10 \%$
(Betadine), gentamicin sulfate, nitrofurazone (Furacin), Dakin's solution, acetic acid, miconazole, and chlortrimazole. Bacitracin may be used for facial burns or on skin grafts initially.

A newer product used in burn wound care is Acticoat Antimicrobial Barrier dressing. Acticoat is a silver-coated dressing approved for treatment of burn wounds and donor sites. This dressing is kept moist with water for a controlled, sustained release of silver over the wound to provide an antimicrobial barrier. Acticoat has been shown to have a better antimicrobial performance than the traditional silver-based products commonly used in burn wound treatment. Acticoat is also cost-effective. The dressing can be left in place for up to 5 days, decreasing patient discomfort, the cost of dressing supplies, and nursing time for dressing changes. The dressing has been shown clinically to be very effective for prevention of burn wound infection (Yin, Langford \& Burrell, 1999).

No single topical medication is universally effective. Using different agents at different times in the postburn period may be necessary. Bacteriologic cultures are required to monitor the effect of topical medications. Prudent use and alternation of antimicrobial agents result in less resistant strains of bacteria, greater effectiveness of the agents, and a decreased risk of sepsis.

Before a topical agent is reapplied, the previously applied topical agent must be thoroughly removed. The number of times the dressings are changed and soaked is planned to promote optimal therapeutic use of the topical agent.

\section*{Wound Dressing}

When the wound is clean, the burned areas are patted dry and the prescribed topical agent is applied; the wound is then covered with several layers of dressings. A light dressing is used over joint areas to allow for motion (unless the particular area has a graft and motion is contraindicated). A light dressing is also applied over areas for which a splint has been designed to conform to the body contour for proper positioning. Circumferential dressings should be applied distally to proximally. If the hand or foot is burned, the fingers and toes should be wrapped individually to promote adequate healing.

Burns to the face may be left open to air once they have been cleaned and the topical agent has been applied. Careful attention must be given to burns left exposed to ensure that they do not dry out and convert to a deeper burn.

Close communication and cooperation among the patient, surgeon, nurse, and other health care team members are essential for optimal burn wound care. Different wound areas on a given patient may require a variety of wound care techniques. Diagrams posted at the bedside are useful to inform staff of the current prescription for wound care, splints to be applied over dressings, and the exercise regimen to be followed before dressings are reapplied.

\section*{OCCLUSIVE METHOD}

There is a role for occlusive dressings in treating specific wounds. An occlusive dressing is a thin gauze that is impregnated with a topical antimicrobial agent or that is applied after topical antimicrobial application. Occlusive dressings are most often used over areas with new skin grafts. Their purpose is to protect the graft, promoting an optimal condition for its adherence to the recipient site. Ideally, these dressings remain in place for 3 to 5 days, at which time they are removed for examination of the graft.

When these dressings are applied, precautions are taken to prevent two body surfaces from touching, such as fingers or toes, ear and scalp, the areas under the breasts, any point of flexion, or between the genital folds. Functional body alignment positions are maintained by using splints or by careful positioning of the patient.

\section*{Dressing Changes}

Dressings are changed in the patient's unit, hydrotherapy room, or treatment area approximately 20 minutes after an analgesic agent is administered. They may also be changed in the operating room after the patient is anesthetized. A mask, goggles, hair cover, disposable plastic apron or cover gown, and gloves are worn by health care personnel when removing the dressings. The outer dressings are slit with blunt scissors, and the soiled dressings are removed and disposed of in accordance with established procedures for contaminated materials.

Dressings that adhere to the wound can be removed more comfortably if they are moistened with tap water or if the patient is allowed to soak for a few moments in the tub. The remaining dressings are carefully and gently removed. The patient may participate in removing the dressings, providing some degree of control over this painful procedure. The wounds are then cleaned and débrided to remove debris, any remaining topical agent, exudate, and dead skin. Sterile scissors and forceps may be used to trim loose eschar and encourage separation of devitalized skin. During this procedure, the wound and surrounding skin are carefully inspected. The color, odor, size, exudate, signs of re-epithelialization, and
other characteristics of the wound and the eschar and any changes from the previous dressing change are noted.

\section*{Wound Débridement}

As debris accumulates on the wound surface, it can retard keratinocyte migration, thus delaying the epithelialization process. Débridement, another facet of burn wound care, has two goals:
- To remove tissue contaminated by bacteria and foreign bodies, thereby protecting the patient from invasion of bacteria
- To remove devitalized tissue or burn eschar in preparation for grafting and wound healing

There are three types of débridement-natural, mechanical, and surgical.

\section*{NATURAL DÉBRIDEMENT}

With natural débridement, the dead tissue separates from the underlying viable tissue spontaneously. After partial- and full-thickness burns, bacteria that are present at the interface of the burned tissue and the viable tissue underneath gradually liquefy the fibrils of collagen that hold the eschar in place for the first or second postburn week. Proteolytic and other natural enzymes cause this phenomenon. Using antibacterial topical agents, however, tends to slow this natural process of eschar separation. It is advantageous to the patient to speed this process through other means, such as mechanical or surgical débridement, thereby reducing the time during which bacterial invasion and other iatrogenic problems may arise.

\section*{MECHANICAL DÉBRIDEMENT}

Mechanical débridement involves using surgical scissors and forceps to separate and remove the eschar. This technique can be performed by skilled physicians, nurses, or physical therapists and is usually done with daily dressing changes and wound cleaning procedures. Débridement by these means is carried out to the point of pain and bleeding. Hemostatic agents or pressure can be used to stop bleeding from small vessels.

Dressings are also useful débriding agents. Coarse-mesh dressings applied dry or wet-to-dry (applied wet and allowed to dry) will slowly débride the wound of exudate and eschar when they are removed. Topical enzymatic débridement agents are available to promote débridement of the burn wounds. Because such agents do not have antimicrobial properties, they should be used with topical antibacterial therapy to protect the patient from bacterial invasion.

\section*{SURGICAL DÉBRIDEMENT}

Early surgical excision to remove devitalized tissue along with early burn wound closure is now being recognized as one of the most important factors contributing to survival in a patient with a major burn injury. Aggressive surgical wound closure has reduced the incidence of burn wound sepsis, thus improving survival rates (Gibran \& Heimbach, 2000). Early excision is carried out before the natural separation of eschar is allowed to occur.

Surgical débridement is an operative procedure involving either primary excision (surgical removal of tissue) of the full thickness of the skin down to the fascia (tangential excision) or shaving the burned skin layers gradually down to freely bleeding, viable tissue. Surgical excision is initiated early in burn wound management. This may be performed a few days after the burn or as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable and edema has decreased.

Ideally, the wound is then covered immediately with a skin graft, if needed, and an occlusive dressing. If the wound bed is not ready for a skin graft at the time of excision, a temporary biologic dressing may be used until a skin graft can be applied during subsequent surgery.

The use of surgical excision carries with it risks and complications, especially with large burns. The procedure creates a high risk of extensive blood loss (as much as 100 to 125 mL of blood per percent body surface excised) and lengthy operating and anesthesia time. However, when conducted in a timely and efficient manner, surgical excision results in shorter hospital stays and possibly a decreased risk of complications from invasive burn wound sepsis.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Eschar separation in full-thickness burns is typically delayed in elderly patients, and older patients are frequently poor risks for surgical excision. Therefore, prolonged hospitalization, immobilization, and associated problems may be common. If the elderly patient can tolerate surgery, early excision with skin grafting is the treatment of choice because it decreases the mortality rate in this population. Prevention of complications of prolonged hospitalization, immobility, and surgery is essential in the care of the elderly burn patient.

\section*{Grafting the Burn Wound}

If wounds are deep (full-thickness) or extensive, spontaneous reepithelialization is not possible. Therefore, coverage of the burn wound is necessary until coverage with a graft of the patient's own skin (autograft) is possible. The purposes of wound coverage are to decrease the risk for infection; prevent further loss of protein, fluid, and electrolytes through the wound; and minimize heat loss through evaporation. Several methods of wound coverage are available; some are temporary until grafting with permanent coverage is possible. Wound coverage may consist of biologic, biosynthetic, synthetic, and autologous methods or a combination of these approaches.

The main areas for skin grafting include the face (for cosmetic and psychological reasons); functional areas, such as the hands and feet; and areas that involve joints. Grafting permits earlier functional ability and reduces contractures (shrinkage of burn scar through collagen maturation). When burns are very extensive, the chest and abdomen may be grafted first to reduce the burn surface.

Granulation tissue fills the space created by the wound, creates a barrier to bacteria, and serves as a bed for epithelial cell growth. Richly vascular granulation tissue is pink, firm, shiny, and free of exudate and debris. It should have a bacterial count of less than 100,000 per gram of tissue to optimize graft take. If the wound is not ready for skin grafting, the burn wound is excised and allowed to granulate. Once the wound is excised, a wound covering is applied to keep the wound bed moist and promote the granulation process.

\section*{BIOLOGIC DRESSINGS (HOMOGRAFTS AND HETEROGRAFTS)}

Biologic dressings have several uses. In extensive burns, they save lives by providing temporary wound closure and protecting the granulation tissue until autografting is possible. Biologic dressings are commonly used in patients with large areas of burn and little remaining normal skin donor sites. Biologic dressings may
also be used to débride wounds after eschar separation. With each biologic dressing change, débridement occurs. Once the biologic dressing appears to be "taking," or adhering to the granulating surface with minimal underlying exudation, the patient is ready for an autograft.

Biologic dressings also provide temporary immediate coverage for clean, superficial burns and decrease the wound's evaporative water and protein loss. They decrease pain by protecting nerve endings and are an effective barrier against water loss and entry of bacteria. When applied to superficial partial-thickness wounds, they seem to speed healing. Biologic materials can be left open or covered. They stay in place for varying lengths of time but are removed in instances of infection or rejection.

Biologic dressings consist of homografts (or allografts) and heterografts (or xenografts). Homografts are skin obtained from living or recently deceased humans. The amniotic membrane (amnion) from the human placenta may also be used as a biologic dressing. Heterografts consist of skin taken from animals (usually pigs). Most biologic dressings are used as temporary coverings of burn wounds and are eventually rejected because of the body's immune reaction to them as foreign.

Homografts tend to be the most expensive biologic dressings. They are available from skin banks in fresh and cryopreserved (frozen) forms. Homografts are thought to provide the best infection control of all the biologic or biosynthetic dressings available. Revascularization occurs within 48 hours, and the graft may be left in place for several weeks. Cost, availability, and the possibility of transmission of disease limit the use of homografts.

Amnion is less expensive and is available in hospitals with burn centers and specialized tissue banks, which obtain and process it in cooperation with obstetric services. However, amnion grafts do not become vascularized by the patient's vessels and can be left in place only for short periods.

Pigskin is available from commercial suppliers. It is available fresh, frozen, or lyophilized (freeze-dried) for longer shelf life. Pigskin impregnated with a topical antibacterial agent such as silver nitrate is also available. Pigskin is widely used for temporary covering of clean wounds such as superficial partial-thickness wounds and donor sites. Although pigskin does not vascularize, it will adhere to clean superficial wounds and provides excellent pain control while the underlying wound epithelializes.

\section*{BIOSYNTHETIC AND SYNTHETIC DRESSINGS}

Problems with availability, sterility, and cost have prompted the search for biosynthetic and synthetic skin substitutes, which may eventually replace biologic dressings as temporary wound coverings. Currently the most widely used synthetic dressing is Biobrane, which is composed of a nylon, Silastic membrane combined with a collagen derivative. The material is semitransparent and sterile. It has an indefinite shelf life and is less costly than homograft or pigskin. Like biologic dressings, Biobrane protects the wound from fluid loss and bacterial invasion.

Biobrane adheres to the wound fibrin, which binds to the nylon-collagen material. Within 5 days, cells migrate into the nylon mesh. Generally, adherence to the wound surface correlates directly with low bacterial counts. When the Biobrane dressing adheres to the wound, the wound remains stable and the Biobrane can remain in place for 3 to 4 weeks. Biobrane dressings (Fig. 57-4) readily adhere to donor sites and meticulously clean débrided partial-thickness wounds; they will remain until spontaneous epithelialization and wound healing occur. Biobrane can be laid on top of a wide-meshed autograft to protect the wound until the autograft epithelium grows out to close the interstices.

As the Biobrane gradually separates, it is trimmed, leaving a healed wound.

Biobrane is also useful for intermediate or long-term closure of a surgically excised wound until an autograft becomes available. Like biologic dressings, Biobrane should not be used over grossly contaminated or necrotic wounds. Removal of Biobrane after several weeks is similar to but easier than removal of a vascularized allograft and leaves a bleeding granulation bed that readily accepts an autograft.

Another fairly new temporary wound covering is BCG Matrix. This dressing combines beta-glucan, a complex carbohydrate, with collagen in a meshed reinforced wound dressing. Beta-glucan is known to stimulate macrophages, which are vital in the inflammatory process of healing. BCG Matrix is a temporary wound covering intended for use with partial-thickness burns and donor sites. It is applied immediately after cleaning and débridement. If the burn wound surface remains free of infection, BCG Matrix can be left in place until healing is complete.

Several other synthetic dressings are available for burn wound care. Op-Site, a thin, transparent, polyurethane elastic film, can be used to cover clean partial-thickness wounds and donor sites. This dressing is occlusive and waterproof but permeable to water vapor and air; this permeability not only provides protection from microbial contamination but also allows for the exchange of gases, which occurs much more quickly in a moist environment. Other synthetic dressings used for burn wounds include Tegaderm, N-Terface, and DuoDerm.

Burns that are between superficial and deep partial thickness in depth can be treated with a promising new temporary biologic covering, TransCyte, a material composed of human newborn fibroblasts, which are cultured on the nylon mesh of Biobrane. The thin silicone membrane bonded to the mesh provides a moisture vapor barrier for the wound. TransCyte is used to treat burns in which the depth is indeterminate. TransCyte delivers a variety of biologically active proteins, which may benefit the wound healing process. Research has shown that wounds treated with TransCyte healed more quickly and with less hypertrophic scarring than burns treated with the traditional silver sulfadiazine protocols (Noordenbos, Dore \& Hansbrough, 1999).

\section*{DERMAL SUBSTITUTES}

In an attempt to develop the ideal burn wound covering product, dermal substitutes have been created. Two such products are Integra Artificial Skin and Alloderm.

Artificial skin (Integra) is the newest type of dermal substitute. A dermal analog, Integra is composed of two main layers. The epidermal layer, consisting of Silastic, acts as a bacterial barrier and prevents water loss from the dermis. The dermal layer is composed of animal collagen. It interfaces with the open wound surface and allows migration of fibroblasts and capillaries into the material. This "neodermis" becomes a permanent structure. The artificial dermis is biodegraded and reabsorbed. The outer silicone membrane is removed 2 to 3 weeks after application and is replaced with the patient's own skin in the form of a thin epidermal skin graft. Long-term effects of Integra include minimal contracture formation. The graft site is very pliable, almost eliminating the need for repeated cosmetic surgery. Most importantly, Integra has resulted in less hypertrophic scarring (Fig. 57-5), thus eliminating the need for compression devices once the burn wound has healed. The use of Integra is increasing the survivability of burns and improving the functional and cosmetic qualities of the healed burn (Winfrey, Cochran \& Hegarty, 1999).

Another promising dermal substitute is Alloderm. It is processed dermis from human cadaver skin, which can be used as the dermal layer for skin grafts. When a donor site (the area from which skin is taken to provide a skin graft for another part of the body) is harvested for an autologous skin graft, both the epidermal and dermal layers of skin are removed from the donor site. Alloderm provides a permanent dermal layer replacement. Its use allows the burn surgeon to harvest a thinner skin graft consisting of the epidermal layer only. The patient's epidermal layer is placed directly over the dermal base (Alloderm). The new graft is then treated according to the burn unit's protocol. Use of Alloderm has also resulted in less scarring and contractures with healed grafts; donor sites heal much more quickly than conventional donor sites because only the epidermal layer has been harvested. This is important when donor sites are limited because of extensive burns (Luterman, 2000).

\section*{AUTOGRAFTS}

Autografts remain the preferred material for definitive burn wound closure following excision. Autografts are the ideal means of covering burn wounds because the grafts are the patient's own skin and thus are not rejected by the patient's immune system. They can be split-thickness, full-thickness, pedicle flaps, or epithelial grafts. Full-thickness and pedicle flaps are commonly used for reconstructive surgery, months or years after the initial injury.

Split-thickness autografts can be applied in sheets or in postage stamp-like pieces, or they can be expanded by meshing so that they can cover 1.5 to 9 times more than a given donor site

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
area. Skin meshers enable the surgeon to cut tiny slits into a sheet of donor skin, making it possible to cover large areas with smaller amounts of donor skin. These expanded grafts adhere to the recipient site more easily than sheet grafts and prevent the accumulation of blood, serum, air, or purulent material under the graft. However, any kind of graft other than a sheet graft will contribute to scar formation as it heals. Using expanded grafts may be necessary in large wounds but should be viewed as a compromise in terms of cosmesis.

If blood, serum, air, fat, or necrotic tissue lies between the recipient site and the graft, there may be partial or total loss of the graft. Infection and mishandling of the graft, as well as trauma during dressing changes, account for most other instances of graft loss. Using split-thickness grafts allows the remaining donor site to retain sweat glands and hair follicles and minimizes donor site healing time.

Use of cultured epithelial autograft (CEA) is common at several burn centers. This involves a biopsy of the patient's skin in an unburned area. Keratinocytes are then isolated and epithelial cells are cultured in a laboratory. The original epithelial cell sample can multiply to 10,000 times its original size over 30 days. These cells are then attached to the burn wound. Varying degrees of success have been reported, and results are encouraging. However, the disadvantages of the CEA are that the grafts are thin and fragile and can shear easily. Research has shown that the outcomes of use of CEA are not as positive as once thought. The quality of burn scars is better, but patients have longer hospital stays and higher hospital costs and require more surgical procedures than those treated by traditional methods. In addition, patients require more reconstructive pro-
cedures in the first 1 to 2 years postinjury. Therefore, CEA use is very limited and reserved for burn patients whose donor sites are limited (Noordenbos et al., 1999).

Care of the Patient with an Autograft. Occlusive dressings are commonly used initially after grafting to immobilize the graft. Occupational therapists may be helpful in constructing splints to immobilize newly grafted areas to prevent dislodging the graft. Homografts, heterografts, or synthetic dressings may also be used to protect grafts. The graft may be left open with skin staples to immobilize it, which allows close observation of progress.

The first dressing change is usually performed 3 to 5 days after surgery, or earlier in the case of purulent drainage or a foul odor. If the graft is dislodged, sterile saline compresses will help prevent drying of the graft until the physician reapplies it.

The patient is positioned and turned carefully to avoid disturbing the graft or putting pressure on the graft site. If an extremity has been grafted, it is elevated to minimize edema. The patient begins exercising the grafted area 5 to 7 days after grafting.

Care of Donor Site. A moist gauze dressing is applied at the time of surgery to maintain pressure and to stop any oozing. A thrombostatic agent such as thrombin or epinephrine may be applied directly to the site as well. The donor site may be treated in several ways, from single-layer gauze impregnated with petrolatum, scarlet red, or bismuth to new biosynthetic dressings such as Biobrane or BCG Matrix. Some burn centers are using the Acticoat dressing on donor sites. Despite the type of donor site covering, donor sites must remain clean, dry, and free from pressure. Because a donor site is usually a partial-thickness wound, it will heal
spontaneously within 7 to 14 days with proper care. Donor sites are painful, and additional pain management must be a part of the patient's care.

\section*{Pain Management}

Pain is inevitable during recovery from any burn injury. Pain in the burn patient has been described as a tormenting consequence of burn injury and wound healing (Jonsson, Holmsten, Dahlstrom \& Jonsson, 1998). Burn pain is thought to have both nociceptive and neuropathic pain components. Management of the often-severe pain is one of the most difficult challenges facing the burn team. Many factors contribute to the burn patient's pain experience. These factors include but are not limited to the severity of the pain, the adequacy of the health care provider's assessment of the pain, the appropriateness and adequacy of pharmacologic treatment of pain, the multiple procedures involved in burn care (ie, wound care, rehabilitative exercises), and appropriate evaluation of the effectiveness of pain relief measures. The outstanding features of burn pain are its intensity and long duration. Further, necessary wound care carries with it the anticipation of pain and anxiety.

In partial-thickness burns, the nerve endings are exposed, resulting in excruciating pain with exposure to air currents. Although nerve endings are destroyed in full-thickness burns, the margins of the burn wound are hypersensitive to pain, and there is pain in adjacent structures. Healing of full-thickness burns creates significant discomfort as regenerating nerve endings become entrapped in scar formation. Most severe burns are a combination of partialthickness and full-thickness burns.

Burn patients have been described as having three types of pain: background or resting pain, procedural pain, and breakthrough pain. Background pain is pain that exists on a 24 -hour basis. Procedural pain is pain caused by procedures such as burn wound care or range of motion exercises. Breakthrough pain occurs when blood levels of analgesic agents fall below the level required to control background pain. The patient's pain level must be assessed throughout the day because each type of pain is different and various pain management strategies may be needed to address different types of pain (McCaffrey \& Pasaro, 1999).

The primary pain from the burn itself is intense in the initial acute postburn phase. In the next few weeks thereafter, until the skin heals or skin grafts are applied and heal, the pain intensity remains high because of treatment-induced pain. Wound cleaning, dressing changes, débridement, and physical therapy can all cause intense pain. Donor sites may be intensely painful for several days. Discomfort related to tissue healing, such as itching, tingling, and tightness of contracting skin and joints, adds to the duration, if not the intensity, of pain over weeks or months. Because pain cannot be eliminated short of complete anesthesia, the goal is to minimize the pain with analgesic agents to an acceptable goal set by the patient.

Opioid administration via the intravenous (IV) route, particularly in the emergent and acute phases of burn management, remains the mainstay for pharmacologic management of burn pain. Use of opioids is complicated by the fluctuation in the bioavailability of drugs, protein binding of the drug, and the drug clearance related to the hemodynamic and fluid volume shifts that occur with a burn injury. Absorption of the opioid also may be affected. Titrating analgesic agents to obtain pain relief while minimizing side effects is crucial. The burn patient's requirements for analgesia are often high, but fear of addiction on the part of the patient and health care provider hamper adequate opioid administration.

Morphine sulfate remains the analgesic of choice for treatment of acute burn pain. It is titrated to obtain pain relief based on the patient's self-report of pain using a standardized pain rating scale.

Fentanyl is another useful opioid for burn pain, particularly procedural burn pain. It has been shown to be effective for management of intense pain of short duration. Fentanyl has a rapid onset, high potency, and short duration, all of which make it effective for use with burn wound procedures. Appropriate cardiac and respiratory monitoring must be carried out during its administration.

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), in which a pump is used to administer a continuous infusion of an opioid, maintains a steady level of opioid for pain relief. Use of continuous infusion requires close monitoring of the patient's responses.

Sustained-release opioids, such as MS Contin or oxycodone (OxyContin), have also been used successfully in the treatment of burn pain. These medications can effectively treat the resting pain that is often associated with burn injury. Additional medications must be prescribed with these medications to cover breakthrough pain.

Some burn units use self-administered nitrous oxide during burn wound procedures. Proper ventilation and monitoring equipment and availability of qualified personnel to administer nitrous oxide limit its use.

Anxiety and pain go hand in hand for burn patients. The entire burn experience can produce severe anxiety, which can, in turn, exacerbate pain. Therefore, the ideal pain management regimen must incorporate the treatment of pain and anxiety and must be individualized for each patient. Sedation with anxiolytic medications such as lorazepam (Ativan) and midazolam (Versed) may be indicated in addition to the administration of opioids.

The use of nonpharmacologic measures has also proven effective in the management of burn pain. These measures include relaxation techniques, deep breathing exercises, distraction, guided imagery, hypnosis, therapeutic touch, humor, information giving, and music therapy (McCaffrey \& Pasaro, 1999).

Music therapy has gained interest recently in the treatment of pain. Researchers have found that music affects both the physiologic and psychological aspects of the pain experience. Music diverts the patient's attention from the painful stimulus; provides reality orientation, distraction, and sensory stimulation; and allows for patient self-expression (Fratianne et al., 2001; Prensner et al., 2001).

\section*{Nutritional Support}

Burn injuries produce profound metabolic abnormalities fueled by the exaggerated stress response to the injury. The body's response has been classified as hyperdynamic, hypermetabolic, and hypercatabolic. Hypermetabolism can affect morbidity and mortality by increasing the risk of infection and slowing the healing rate. Patients' metabolic demands vary with the extent of the burn injury. Hypermetabolism is evident immediately after a burn injury. The degree of the response depends on the size of the burn and the patient's age, body composition, size, and genetic response to insult. Persistent hypermetabolism may last up to 1 year after burn injury (Hart et al., 2000).

Major metabolic abnormalities seen after a burn injury include increased catabolic hormones (cortisol and catechols); decreased anabolic hormones (human growth factor and testosterone); a marked increase in the metabolic rate; a sustained increase in body temperature; a marked increase in glucose demands; rapid skeletal
muscle breakdown with amino acids serving as the energy source; lack of ketosis, indicating that fat is not a major source of calories; and catabolism that does not respond to nutrient intake (Demling \& Seigne, 2000). Therefore, it is essential to control the stress response by increasing the anabolic process through adequate nutrition and increased muscle activity, decreasing heat loss from wounds, and maintaining a warm environment. Controlling secondary stress, such as pain and anxiety, also helps to control the stress response.

The most important of these interventions is to provide adequate nutrition and calories to decrease catabolism. Nutritional support with optimized protein intake can decrease protein losses by approximately 50\% (Cioffi, 2000). Healing of the burn wound consumes large quantities of energy. Effective nutrition management depends on how well the energy expenditure due to the burn injury can be estimated and matched with appropriate amounts of micronutrients, carbohydrates, lipids, and protein. The goal of nutritional support is to promote a state of positive nitrogen balance by optimizing nutrition to match nutrient utilization. The nutritional support required is based on the patient's preburn status and the TBSA burned.

Several formulas exist for estimating the daily metabolic expenditure and caloric requirements of patients with burn injuries. The most commonly used formulas include the Curreiri formula, which uses body weight and percent burn, and a variation of the Harris-Bennedict equation, which determines basal energy requirements based on stress and burn size (Demling \& Seigne, 2000). Protein requirements may range from 1.5 to 4.0 g of protein per kilogram of body weight every 24 hours. Lipids are included in the nutritional support of every burn patient because of their importance for wound healing, cellular integrity, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Carbohydrates are included to meet caloric requirements as high as 5,000 calories per day and to spare protein, which is essential for wound healing. The patient also needs adequate vitamins and minerals. Existing formulas may underestimate the daily metabolic expenditures associated with burns. The formulas fail to account for added stressors such as pain, anxiety, daily dressing changes, and decreased activity levels. These must be considered when estimating appropriate nutritional support. Research findings have brought about changes in specific guidelines for estimating energy expenditure during the various phases of postburn recovery. The proportions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate must be carefully planned for maximal use (Demling \& Seigne, 2000).

The enteral route of feeding is far superior to the parenteral route. Enteral feedings preserve the intestinal barrier function and absorption of peptides and amino acids, which leads to higher nitrogen retention. Feedings are started as soon as possible. If a feeding tube is used, placement into the duodenum is ideal to prevent aspiration and to allow for continuous, uninterrupted feedings during surgical procedures. If the oral route is used, high-protein, high-calorie meals and supplements are given. Dietary consultations are useful in helping patients meet their nutritional needs. Daily calorie counts aid in assessing the adequacy of nutritional intake. Overfeeding must be avoided because it increases metabolism, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production.

Patients lose a great deal of weight during recovery from severe burns. Reserve fat deposits are catabolized, fluids are lost, and caloric intake may be limited. Because a burn injury lowers the patient's resistance to infection and disease, the nutritional status must be improved and maintained although the patient has a poor appetite and is weak.

Indications for parenteral nutrition include weight loss greater than $10 \%$ of normal body weight, inadequate intake of enteral nutrition due to clinical status, prolonged wound exposure, and malnutrition or debilitated condition before injury. The risk of infection at the site of the central venous catheter required for parenteral nutrition must be considered. Moreover, the risk of Curling's ulcer continues in the acute phase.

\section*{DISORDERS OF WOUND HEALING}

Disorders of wound healing in the burn patient result from excessive abnormal healing or inadequate new tissue formation. Hypertrophic scarring and keloid formation result from excessive abnormal healing.

\section*{Scars}

One of the most devastating sequelae of a burn injury is the formation of hypertrophic scars. Clinicians cannot reliably predict or prevent the formation of hypertrophic scars. Hypertrophic scars are more common in children, in people with dark skin, and in areas of stretch or motion. The pathophysiology behind these scars is not completely understood, but they are characterized by an overabundant matrix formation, especially collagen.

Hypertrophic scars and wound contractures are more likely to occur if the initial burn injury extends below the level of the deep dermis. Healing of such deep wounds results in the replacement of normal integument with highly metabolically active tissues that lack the normal architecture of the skin. In the collagen layer beneath the epithelium, many fibroblasts proliferate gradually. Myofibroblasts, cells that have the ability to contract, are also present in immature wounds. As the myofibroblasts contract, the collagen fibers, which normally lie in flat bundles, tend to form a wavy pattern. Eventually the collagen bundles take on a supercoiled appearance and collagen nodules develop. The scar becomes red (because of its hypervascular nature), raised, and hard.

Burn personnel must be proactive in the prevention and management of scar formation. Compression measures are instituted early in burn wound treatment. Ace wraps are used initially to help promote adequate circulation, but they can also be used as the first form of compression. Scar management occurs mainly in the rehabilitative phase, after the wounds are closed. Hypertrophic scarring may cause severe contracture across involved joints. Therefore, prevention and management of this type of scarring is essential (see "Prevention of Hypertrophic Scarring" in the rehabilitation phase discussion). However, these scars are limited to the area of injury and gradually regress over time.

\section*{Keloids}

A large, heaped-up mass of scar tissue, a keloid, may develop and extend beyond the wound surface. Keloids tend to be found in people with darkly pigmented skin, tend to grow outside of wound margins, and are likely to recur after surgical excision.

\section*{Failure to Heal}

Failure of the wound to heal may result from many factors, including infection and inadequate nutrition. A serum albumin level of less than $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ is usually a factor in impaired healing in the burn patient.

\section*{Contractures}

Contractures are another concern as wounds heal. The burn wound tissue shortens because of the force exerted by the fibroblasts and the flexion of muscles in natural wound healing. An opposing force provided by splints, traction, and purposeful movement and positioning must be used to counteract deformity in burns affecting joints.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT DURING THE ACUTE PHASE}

\section*{Assessment}

Continued assessment of the burn patient during the early weeks after the burn injury focuses on hemodynamic alterations, wound healing, pain and psychosocial responses, and early detection of complications. Assessment of respiratory and fluid status remains the highest priority for detection of potential complications.

The nurse assesses vital signs frequently. Continued assessment of peripheral pulses is essential for the first few postburn days while edema continues to increase, potentially damaging peripheral nerves and restricting blood flow. Observation of the electrocardiogram may give clues to cardiac dysrhythmias resulting from potassium imbalance, preexisting cardiac disease, or the effects of electrical injury or burn shock.

Assessment of residual gastric volumes and pH in the patient with a nasogastric tube is also important. Blood in the gastric fluid or the stools must also be noted and reported.

Assessment of the burn wound requires an experienced eye, hand, and sense of smell. Important wound assessment features include size, color, odor, eschar, exudate, abscess formation under the eschar, epithelial buds (small pearl-like clusters of cells on the wound surface), bleeding, granulation tissue appearance, status of grafts and donor sites, and quality of surrounding skin. Any significant changes in the wound are reported to the physician, because they usually indicate burn wound or systemic sepsis and require immediate intervention.

Other significant and ongoing assessments focus on pain and psychosocial responses, daily body weights, caloric intake, general hydration, and serum electrolyte, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels. Assessment for excessive bleeding from blood vessels adjacent to areas of surgical exploration and débridement is necessary as well. The Plan of Nursing Care provides an outline of nursing activities in the acute phase of burn care.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, priority nursing diagnoses in the acute phase of burn care may include the following:
- Excessive fluid volume related to resumption of capillary integrity and fluid shift from the interstitial to intravascular compartment
- Risk for infection related to loss of skin barrier and impaired immune response
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to hypermetabolism and wound healing needs
- Impaired skin integrity related to open burn wounds
- Acute pain related to exposed nerves, wound healing, and treatments
- Impaired physical mobility related to burn wound edema, pain, and joint contractures
- Ineffective coping related to fear and anxiety, grieving, and forced dependence on health care providers
- Interrupted family processes related to burn injury
- Deficient knowledge about the course of burn treatment

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop in the acute phase of burn care may include:
- Heart failure and pulmonary edema
- Sepsis
- Acute respiratory failure
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Visceral damage (electrical burns)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include restoration of normal fluid balance, absence of infection, attainment of anabolic state and normal weight, improved skin integrity, reduction of pain and discomfort, optimal physical mobility, adequate patient and family coping, adequate patient and family knowledge of burn treatment, and absence of complications. Achieving these goals requires a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to patient management.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RESTORING NORMAL FLUID BALANCE}

To reduce the risk of fluid overload and consequent congestive heart failure, the nurse closely monitors IV and oral fluid intake, using IV infusion pumps to minimize the risk of rapid fluid infusion. To monitor changes in fluid status, careful intake and output and daily weights are obtained. Changes in pulmonary artery, wedge, and central venous pressures, as well as in blood pressure and pulse rate, are reported to the physician. Low-dose dopamine to increase renal perfusion and diuretics may be prescribed to promote increased urine output. The nurse's role is to administer these medications as prescribed and to monitor the patient's response.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

A major part of the nurse's role during the acute phase of burn care is detecting and preventing infection. The nurse is responsible for providing a clean and safe environment and for closely scrutinizing the burn wound to detect early signs of infection. Culture results and white blood cell counts are monitored.

Clean technique is used for wound care procedures. Aseptic technique is used for any invasive procedures, such as insertion of IV lines and urinary catheters or tracheal suctioning. Meticulous hand hygiene before and after each patient contact is also an essential component of preventing infection, even though gloves are worn to provide care.

The nurse protects the patient from sources of contamination, including other patients, staff members, visitors, and equipment. Invasive lines and tubing must be routinely changed according to recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tube feeding reservoirs, ventilator circuits, and drainage containers are replaced regularly. Fresh flowers, plants, or fresh

Collaborative Problems: Congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, ARDS, visceral damage (electrical burns)
Goal: Absence of complications

\section*{Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Pulmonary Edema}
1. Assess for decreased urine output, JVD, or an $S_{3}$ or $S_{4}$ heart sound.
2. Monitor for increases in arterial pressures or decrease in cardiac output.
3. Assess for crackles on lung auscultation, dyspnea, orthopnea, or decreased oxygenation detected by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas values.
4. Report the above mentioned signs and symptoms to the physician.
5. Position patient with the head of bed up $45^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ as tolerated.
6. Administer diuretics as prescribed. Assess patient's response.

\section*{Sepsis}

2. Monitor wound and blood cultures and notify physician of positive cultures.
3. Administer fluids, vasoactive medications and antibiotics as prescribed. Monitor for therapeutic response. Check that infecting organisms are sensitive to prescribed antibiotics.
4. Monitor for therapeutic serum antibiotic levels.
1. These signs may indicate decreased cardiac output and the onset of CHF.
2. Increased pressures indicate increased preload and intravascular volumes. Decreasing cardiac output reflects less oxygen and nutrients available to the tissues and may indicate the onset of CHF.
3. Such signs may indicate progression of CHF to pulmonary edema.
4. Prompt medical intervention is needed.
5. Elevation facilitates gas exchange.
6. Diuretics increase urine output and decrease cardiac preload and intravascular volumes.
1. Such signs may indicate impending sepsis.
2. Positive cultures indicate infection and possible sepsis.
3. Antibiotics kill susceptible bacteria. Intravenous fluids and vasoactive medications maintain intravascular volume and blood pressure.

fruit baskets are not permitted in the patient's room because of the risk of microorganism growth. Visitors are screened to avoid exposing the immunocompromised burn patient to pathogens.

Patients can inadvertently promote migration of microorganisms from one burned area to another by touching their wounds or dressings. Bed linens also can spread infection through either colonization with wound microorganisms or fecal contamination. Regularly bathing unburned areas and changing linens can help prevent infection.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Oral fluids should be initiated slowly when bowel sounds resume. The patient's tolerance is noted. If vomiting and distention do not occur, fluids may be increased gradually and the patient may advance to a normal diet or to tube feedings.

The nurse collaborates with the dietitian or nutrition support team to plan a protein- and calorie-rich diet that is acceptable to the patient. Family members may be encouraged to bring nutritious and favorite foods to the hospital. Milkshakes and sandwiches made with meat, peanut butter, and cheese may be offered as snacks between meals and late in the evening. Nutritional supplements such as Ensure and Resource may be provided. Caloric intake must be documented. Vitamin and mineral supplements may be prescribed.

If caloric goals cannot be met by oral feeding, a feeding tube is inserted and used for continuous or bolus feedings of specific formulas. The volume of residual gastric secretions should be checked to ensure absorption. Parenteral nutrition may also be required but should be used only if gastrointestinal function is compromised (see Chap. 36).

Patients should be weighed each day and their weights graphed. Patients can use this information to set goals for their own nutritional intake and to monitor weight loss and gain. Ideally, the patient will lose no more than $5 \%$ of preburn weight if aggressive nutritional management is implemented.

The patient with anorexia requires encouragement and support from the nurse to increase food intake. The patient's surroundings should be as pleasant as possible at mealtime. Catering to food preferences and offering high-protein, high-vitamin snacks are ways of encouraging the patient to increase intake.

\section*{PROMOTING SKIN INTEGRITY}

Wound care is usually the single most time-consuming element of burn care after the emergent phase. The physician will prescribe the desired topical antibacterial agents and specific biologic, biosynthetic, or synthetic wound coverings and will plan for surgical excision and grafting. The nurse needs to make astute assessments of wound status, to use creative approaches to wound dressing, and to support the patient during the emotionally distressing and very painful experience of wound care.

The nurse serves as the coordinator of the complex aspects of wound care and dressing changes for the patient. The nurse must be aware of the rationale and nursing implications for the various wound management approaches. Nursing functions include assessing and recording any changes or progress in wound healing and keeping all members of the health care team informed of changes in the wound or treatment. A diagram, updated daily by the nurse responsible for the patient's care, helps to inform all those concerned about the latest wound care procedures in use for the patient.

The nurse also assists the patient and family by providing instruction, support, and encouragement to take an active part in dressing changes and wound care when appropriate. Discharge planning needs for wound care are anticipated early in the course of burn management, and the strengths of the patient and family are assessed and used in preparing for eventual discharge and home care.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Pain measures discussed earlier are continued during the acute phase of burn recovery. Analgesic agents and anxiolytic medications are administered as prescribed. Frequent assessment of pain and discomfort is essential. To increase its effectiveness, analgesic medication is provided before the pain becomes severe. Nursing interventions such as teaching the patient relaxation techniques, giving the patient some control over wound care and analgesia, and providing frequent reassurance are helpful. Guided imagery may be effective in altering the patient's perceptions of and responses to pain. Other pain-relieving approaches include distraction through video programs or video games, hypnosis, biofeedback, and behavioral modification.

The nurse works quickly to complete treatments and dressing changes to reduce pain and discomfort. The patient is encouraged to take analgesic medications before painful procedures. The patient's response to the medication and other interventions is assessed and documented.

Healing burn wounds are typically described by patients as itchy and tight. Oral antipruritic agents, a cool environment, fre-
quent lubrication of the skin with water or a silica-based lotion, exercise and splinting to prevent skin contracture, and diversional activities all help to promote comfort in this phase.

\section*{PROMOTING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

An early priority is to prevent complications resulting from immobility. Deep breathing, turning, and proper repositioning are essential nursing practices that prevent atelectasis and pneumonia, control edema, and prevent pressure ulcers and contractures. These interventions are modified to meet the patient's needs. Low-air-loss and rotation beds may be useful, and early sitting and ambulation are encouraged. Whenever the lower extremities are burned, elastic pressure bandages should be applied before the patient is placed in an upright position. These bandages promote venous return and minimize swelling.

The burn wound is in a dynamic state for a year or more after wound closure. During this time, aggressive efforts must be made to prevent contracture and hypertrophic scarring. Both passive and active range-of-motion exercises are initiated from the day of admission and are continued after grafting, within prescribed limitations. Splints or functional devices may be applied to extremities for contracture control. The nurse monitors the splinted areas for signs of vascular insufficiency and nerve compression.

\section*{STRENGTHENING COPING STRATEGIES}

In the acute phase of burn care, the patient is facing the reality of the burn trauma and is grieving over obvious losses. Depression, regression, and manipulative behavior are common responses of

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 57-1}

\section*{Burn Pain and Anxiety}

Beyers, J. F., Bridges, S., Kijek, J., \& LaBorde, P. J. (2001). Burn patients' pain and anxiety experiences. Journal of Burn Care and Rehabilitation, 22(2), 144-149.

\section*{Purpose}

Pain associated with burns and treatment of burn wounds is common and often excruciating. Its management is important in patient care and is often a nursing challenge. The purpose of this study was to examine burn patients' experiences with pain and anxiety during rest and during painful wound care procedures.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A descriptive study was conducted; the sample included 23 acutely burned adults in a southeastern level I trauma center who were undergoing wound care and who had not had previous surgery to treat their burn wounds. Ages ranged from 18 to 75 with a mean age of $33 \pm 13.2$. Data on pain and anxiety levels were collected in three phases: at the time of recruitment of subjects, at baseline (defined as at least 8 hours after the last procedure), and during burn wound care procedures (within 5 minutes of scrubbing/débridement/before dressings were reapplied).

Subjects completed the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-pain) to assess the level of pain they considered acceptable, with possible scores ranging from no pain to worst pain possible. The Short-Form McGill (SF-M) questionnaire was used to measure the sensory and affective dimensions of pain, as well as the patient's present pain on a Likerttype scale ( $0=$ no pain; $5=$ excruciating). A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-anxiety) was used to measure anxiety, with scores ranging along a continuum from no anxiety to worse anxiety possible. Subjects were asked to mark both VAS instruments with an X, indicating the severity of their pain and anxiety. Other data collected included demographic data, analgesic and sedative use, and use of nonpharmacologic
methods as distraction techniques during procedures. Descriptive and nonparametric statistical tests were used to analyze data.

\section*{Findings}

Results showed that burn patients report higher levels of pain during procedures than when at rest. A strong positive relationship between pain and anxiety was found. The most frequently reported pain descriptor on the SF-M was "tender" during baseline measurements. Frequent descriptors during procedures included "throbbing," "hotburning," and "aching." There were no significant differences in anxiety between resting conditions and procedural dressing changes ( $p> 0.16)$. There were significant differences between burn patients' acceptable level, resting level, and procedural pain levels ( $p=0.01$ ). Patients reported their baseline pain as less than their acceptable level of pain. Other findings noted that family presence during procedure was related to decreased procedural pain and decreased use of medications prescribed for relief of anxiety.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Because burn patients describe burn wound care procedures to be the most painful experience, efforts should be made to identify strategies that are effective in reducing pain intensity. Also, since pain and anxiety were linked, strategies need to be developed to decrease both. The researchers suggested that use of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions during wound care procedures may be warranted to help patients cope with anxiety, resting pain, and pain associated with wound care procedures. Future studies of the effect of different pharmacologic interventions with larger and more diverse samples are needed.
patients who have burn injuries. Withdrawal from participation in required treatments and regression must be viewed with an understanding that such behavior helps the patient cope with an enormously stressful event. Much of the patient's energy goes into maintaining vital physical functions and wound healing in the early postburn weeks, leaving little emotional energy for coping in a more effective manner. Nurses can assist patients to develop effective coping strategies by setting specific expectations for behavior, promoting truthful communication to build trust, helping patients practice appropriate strategies, and giving positive reinforcement when appropriate. Most importantly, the nurse and all members of the health care team must demonstrate acceptance of the patient.

The patient frequently vents feelings of anger. At times the anger may be directed inward because of a sense of guilt, perhaps for causing the fire or even for surviving when loved ones perished. The anger may reach outward toward those who escaped unharmed or to those who are now providing care. One way to help the patient handle these emotions is to enlist someone to whom the patient can vent feelings without fear of retaliation. A nurse, social worker, psychiatric liaison nurse, or clergy member who is not involved in direct care activities may fill this role successfully.

Burn patients are very dependent on health care team members during the long period of acute illness. However, even when physically unable to contribute much to self-care, they can be included in decisions regarding care and encouraged to assert their individuality in terms of preferences and recognition of their unique identities. As patients improve in mobility and strength, the nurse works with them to set realistic expectations for self-care, including self-feeding, assistance with wound care procedures, exercise, and planning for the future. Many patients respond positively to the use of contractual agreements and other strategies that recognize their independence and their specific role as part of the health care team moving toward the goal of self-care.

\section*{SUPPORTING PATIENT AND FAMILY PROCESSES}

Family functioning is disrupted with burn injury. One of the nurse's responsibilities is to support the patient and family and to address their spoken and unspoken concerns. Family members need to be instructed about ways that they can support the patient as adaptation to burn trauma occurs. The family also needs support by the health care team. The burn injury has tremendous psychological, economic, and practical impact on the patient and family. Referrals for social services or psychological counseling should be made as appropriate. This support continues into the rehabilitation phase.

Burn patients are commonly sent to burn centers far from home. Because burn injuries are not anticipated, family roles are disrupted. Therefore, both the patient and the family need thorough information about the patient's burn care and expected course of treatment. Patient and family education begins at the initiation of burn management. Barriers to learning are assessed and considered in teaching. The preferred learning styles of both the patient and family are assessed. This information is used to tailor teaching activities. The nurse assesses the ability of the patient and family to grasp and cope with the information. Verbal information is supplemented by videos, models, or printed materials if available. Patient and family education is a priority in the rehabilitation phase.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Heart Failure and Pulmonary Edema}

The patient is assessed for fluid overload, which may occur as fluid is mobilized from the interstitial compartment back into the intravascular compartment. If the cardiac and renal systems can-
not compensate for the excess vascular volume, congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema may result. The patient is assessed for signs of heart failure, including decreased cardiac output, oliguria, jugular vein distention, edema, and the onset of an $S_{3}$ or $S_{4}$ heart sound. Increasing central venous, pulmonary artery, and wedge pressures indicate increased fluid volume.

Crackles in the lungs and increased difficulty with respiration may indicate a fluid buildup in the lungs, which is reported promptly to the physician. In the meantime, the patient is positioned comfortably, with the head of the bed raised (if not contraindicated because of other treatments or injuries) to promote lung expansion and gas exchange. Management of this complication includes providing supplemental oxygen, administering IV diuretic agents, carefully assessing the patient's response, and providing vasoactive medications, if indicated.

\section*{Sepsis}

The signs of early systemic sepsis are subtle and require a high index of suspicion and very close monitoring of changes in the patient's status. Early signs of sepsis may include increased temperature, increased pulse rate, widened pulse pressure, and flushed dry skin in unburned areas. As with many observations of the burn patient, one needs to look for patterns or trends in the data. (See Chap. 15 for a more detailed discussion of septic shock.)

Wound and blood cultures are performed as prescribed, and results are reported to the physician immediately. The nurse also observes for and reports early signs of sepsis and promptly intervenes, administering prescribed IV fluids and antibiotics to prevent septic shock, a complication with a high mortality rate. Antibiotics must be given as scheduled to maintain proper blood concentrations. Serum antibiotic levels are monitored for evidence of maximal effectiveness, and the patient is monitored for toxic side effects.

\section*{Acute Respiratory Failure}

\section*{and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}

The patient's respiratory status is monitored closely for increased difficulty breathing, change in respiratory pattern, and onset of adventitious (abnormal) sounds. Typically at this stage, signs and symptoms of injury to the respiratory tract become apparent. Respiratory failure may follow. As described previously, signs of hypoxia (decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues), decreased breath sounds, wheezing, tachypnea, stridor, and sputum tinged with soot (or in some cases containing sloughed tracheal tissue) are among the many possible findings. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation must be assessed for a decrease in tidal volume and lung compliance. The key sign of the onset of ARDS is hypoxemia while receiving 100\% oxygen, decreased lung compliance, and significant shunting. The physician should be notified immediately of deteriorating respiratory status.

Medical management of the patient with acute respiratory failure requires intubation and mechanical ventilation (if not already in use). If ARDS has developed, higher oxygen levels, positive endexpiratory pressure, and pressure support are used with mechanical ventilation to promote gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane.

\section*{Visceral Damage}

The nurse must be alert to signs of necrosis of visceral organs due to electrical injury. Tissues affected are usually between the entrance and exit wounds of the electrical burn. All patients with electrical burns should undergo electrocardiographic monitoring, with dysrhythmias being reported to the physician. Careful attention must also be paid to signs or reports of pain related to
deep muscle ischemia. To minimize the severity of complications, visceral ischemia must be detected as early as possible. The physician can perform fasciotomies to relieve the swelling and ischemia in the muscles and fascia and to promote oxygenation of the injured tissues. Because of the deep incisions involved with fasciotomies, the patient must be monitored carefully for signs of excessive blood loss and hypovolemia.

\section*{REHABILITATION PHASE OF BURN CARE}

Although long-term aspects of burn care are discussed last in this chapter, rehabilitation begins immediately after the burn has occurred-as early as the emergent period-and often extends for years after injury. In the aftermath of the acute stages of injury, the burn patient increasingly focuses on the alterations in self-image and lifestyle that may occur. Wound healing, psychosocial support, and restoring maximal functional activity remain priorities. The focus on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance and improving nutritional status continues. Reconstructive surgery to improve body appearance and function may be needed.

Burn injuries can have a major impact on quality of life. Changes in physical activity and social, psychological, and employment status may occur. Therefore, psychological and vocational counseling and referral to support groups may be helpful to promote recovery and quality of life. Family members also need support and guidance in assisting the patient to return to optimal health.

\section*{Prevention of Hypertrophic Scarring}

The wound is in a dynamic state for 1.5 to 2 years after the burn occurs. If appropriate measures are instituted during this active period, the scar tissue loses its redness and softens. Healed areas that are prone to hypertrophic scarring require the patient to wear a pressure garment (Fig. 57-6). These devices are especially useful for partial-thickness wounds that required more than 2 weeks to heal and for the edges of grafted skin. Applying elastic pressure garments loosens collagen bundles and encourages parallel orientation of the collagen to the skin surface, with the disappearance of the dermal nodules. As pressure continues over time, there is a restructuring of the collagen and a decrease in vascularity and cellularity (Serghiou, Young, Ott et al., 2002).

The physical therapist, occupational therapist, or a representative of the manufacturer of elastic pressure garments measures the patient for correct fit. While awaiting the arrival of the garment, soft, tubular, knitted elastic pressure bandages can be used to help desensitize the patient's skin, protect healing areas, apply pressure, and promote venous return. Patients must be instructed about the need for lubrication and protection of the healing skin and the need for pressure garments for at least a year after the injury. A program including elastic pressure garments, splints, and exercise under the supervision of an experienced physical and occupational therapy team is recommended for optimal functional and cosmetic results.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT DURING THE REHABILITATION PHASE}

\section*{Assessment}

Information about the patient's educational level, occupation, leisure activities, cultural background, religion, and family interactions is obtained early. The patient's self-concept, mental status, emotional response to the injury and hospitalization, level of intellectual functioning, previous hospitalizations, response to pain and pain relief measures, and sleep pattern are also essential components of a comprehensive assessment. Information about the patient's general self-concept, self-esteem, and coping strategies in the past will be valuable in addressing emotional needs.

\end{figure}

Ongoing physical assessments related to rehabilitation goals include range of motion of affected joints, functional abilities in activities of daily living, early signs of skin breakdown from splints or positioning devices, evidence of neuropathies (neurologic damage), activity tolerance, and quality or condition of healing skin. The patient's participation in care and ability to demonstrate self-care in such areas as ambulation, eating, wound cleaning, and applying pressure wraps are documented on a regular basis. In addition to these assessment parameters, specific complications and treatments require additional specific assessments; for example, the patient undergoing primary excision requires postoperative assessment.

Recovery from burn injury involves every system of the body. Therefore, assessment of the burn patient must be comprehensive and continuous. Priorities will vary at different points during the rehabilitation phase. Understanding the pathophysiologic responses to burn injury forms the framework for detecting early progress or signs and symptoms of complications. Early detection leads to early intervention and enhances the potential for successful rehabilitation.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, priority nursing diagnoses in the longterm rehabilitation phase of burn care may include the following:
- Activity intolerance related to pain on exercise, limited joint mobility, muscle wasting, and limited endurance
- Disturbed body image related to altered physical appearance and self-concept
- Deficient knowledge about postdischarge home care and follow-up needs

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop in the rehabilitation phase include:
- Contractures
- Inadequate psychological adaptation to burn injury

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include increased participation in activities of daily living; increased understanding of the injury, treatment, and planned follow-up care; adaptation and adjustment to alterations in body image, self-concept, and lifestyle; and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING ACTIVITY TOLERANCE}

Nursing interventions that must be carried out according to a strict regimen and the pain that accompanies movement take their toll on a burn patient. The patient may become confused and disoriented and lack the energy to participate optimally in care. The nurse must schedule care in such a way that the patient has periods of uninterrupted sleep. A good time for planned patient rest is after the stress of dressing changes and exercise, while pain interventions and sedatives may still be effective. This plan must be communicated to family members and other care providers.

Burn patients may have insomnia related to frequent nightmares about the burn injury or to other fears and anxieties about the outcome of the injury. The nurse listens to and reassures the
patient and administers hypnotic agents, as prescribed, to promote sleep.

Reducing metabolic stress by relieving pain, preventing chilling or fever, and promoting the physical integrity of all body systems will help the patient conserve energy for therapeutic activities and wound healing.

The nurse incorporates physical therapy exercises in the patient's care to prevent muscle atrophy and to maintain the mobility required for daily activities. The patient's activity tolerance, strength, and endurance will gradually increase if activity occurs over increasingly longer periods. Fatigue, fever, and pain tolerance are monitored and used to determine the amount of activity to be encouraged on a daily basis. Activities such as family visits and recreational or play therapy (eg, video games, radio, TV) can provide diversion, improve the patient's outlook, and increase tolerance for physical activity.

\section*{IMPROVING BODY IMAGE AND SELF-CONCEPT}

Burn patients frequently suffer profound losses. These include not only a loss of body image due to disfigurement but also losses of personal property, homes, loved ones, and ability to work. They lack the benefit of anticipatory grief often seen in a patient approaching surgery or a person dealing with the terminal illness of a loved one.

As care progresses, the patient who is recovering from burns becomes aware of daily improvement and begins to exhibit basic concerns: Will I be disfigured? How long will I be in the hospital? What about my job and family? Will I ever be independent again? How can I pay for my care? Was my burn the result of my carelessness? As the patient expresses such concerns, the nurse must take time to listen and to provide realistic support. The nurse can refer patients to a support group, such as those usually available at regional burn centers or through organizations such as the Phoenix Society. Through participation in such groups, patients will meet others with similar experiences and learn coping strategies to help them deal with their losses. Interaction with other burn survivors allows the patient to see that adaptation to the burn injury is possible. If a support group is not available, visits from burn survivors can be helpful to the patient coping with such a traumatic injury.

A major responsibility of the nurse is to assess constantly the patient's psychosocial reactions. What are the patient's fears and concerns? Does the patient fear loss of control of care, independence, or sanity itself? Is the patient afraid of rejection by family and loved ones? Does he or she fear being unable to cope with pain or physical appearance? Does the patient have concerns about sexuality, including sexual function? Being aware of these anxieties and understanding the basis of the patient's fears enable the nurse to provide support and to cooperate with other members of the health care team in developing a plan to help the patient deal with these feelings.

When caring for burn patients, the nurse needs to be aware that there are prejudices and misunderstandings in society about those who are viewed as different. Opportunities and accommodations available to others are often denied those who are disfigured. Such amenities include social participation, employment, prestige, various roles, and status. The health care team must actively promote a healthy body image and self-concept in burn survivors so that they can accept or challenge others' perceptions of those who are disfigured. Survivors themselves must show others who they are, how they function, and how they want to be treated.

The nurse can help patients practice their responses to people who may stare or inquire about their injury once they are discharged from the hospital. The nurse can help patients build self-
esteem by recognizing their uniqueness-for example, with small gestures such as providing a birthday cake, combing the patient's hair before visiting hours, giving information about the availability of a cosmetician to enhance appearance, and teaching the patient ways to direct attention away from a disfigured body to the self within. Consultants such as psychologists, social workers, vocational counselors, and teachers are valuable participants in assisting burn patients to regain their self-esteem.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Contractures}

With early and aggressive physical and occupational therapy, contractures are rarely a long-term complication. However, surgical intervention is indicated if a full range of motion in the burn patient is not achieved. (See Chap. 11 for a discussion of prevention of contractures.)

\section*{Impaired Psychological Adaptation to the Burn Injury}

Some patients, particularly those with limited coping skills or psychological function or a history of psychiatric problems before the burn injury, may not achieve adequate psychological adaptation to the burn injury. Psychological counseling or psychiatric referral may be made to assess the patient's emotional status, to help the patient develop coping skills, and to intervene if major psychological issues or ineffective coping is identified.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

As the inpatient phase of recovery becomes shorter, the focus of rehabilitative interventions is directed toward outpatient care or care in a rehabilitation center. In the long term, much of the care of healing burns will be performed by the patient and others at home. Throughout the phases of burn care, efforts are made to prepare the patient and family for the care that will continue at home. Thus, they are instructed about the measures and procedures that they will need to perform. For example, patients commonly have small areas of clean, open wounds that are healing slowly. They are instructed to wash these areas daily with mild soap and water and to apply the prescribed topical agent or dressing.

In addition to instructions about wound care, patients and families require careful written and verbal instructions about prevention of complications, pain management, and nutrition. Information about specific exercises and use of pressure garments and splints is reviewed with both the patient and family; written instructions are provided for reference. They are taught to recognize abnormal signs and instructed to report them to the physician. All of this information will enable patients to progress successfully through the rehabilitative phase of burn management. The patient and family are assisted in planning for the patient's continued care by identifying and acquiring supplies and equipment that are needed at home (Chart 57-6).

\section*{Continuing Care}

Follow-up care by an interdisciplinary burn care team will be necessary. Preparations should begin during the early stages of care. Patients who receive care in a burn center usually return to the burn clinic or center periodically for evaluation by the burn team, modification of home care instructions, and planning for reconstructive surgery. Other patients receive ongoing care from the general or plastic surgeon who cared for them during the acute phase of their management. Still other patients require the services
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-240.jpg?height=2344&width=1783&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=109)
of a rehabilitation center and may be transferred to such a center for aggressive rehabilitation before going home. Many patients require outpatient physical or occupational therapy, often several times weekly. It is often the nurse who is responsible for coordinating all aspects of care and ensuring that the patient's needs are met. Such coordination is an important aspect in assisting a burn victim to achieve independence.

Patients who return home after a severe burn injury, those who cannot manage their own burn care, and those with inadequate support systems will need referral for home care. During visits to the patient at home, the home care nurse assesses the patient's physical and psychological status as well as the adequacy of the home setting for safe and adequate care. The nurse monitors the patient's progress and adherence to the plan of care and notes any problems that interfere with the patient's ability to carry out the care. During the visit, the nurse assists the patient and family with wound care and exercises. Patients with severe or persistent depression or difficulty adjusting to changes in their social and/or occupational roles are identified and referred to the burn team for possible referral to a psychologist, psychiatrist, or vocational counselor.

The burn team or home care nurse identifies community resources that may be helpful for the patient and family. Several burn patient support groups and other organizations throughout the United States offer services for burn victims. They provide caring people (often recovered burn victims) who can visit a burn patient in the hospital or home or telephone the patient and family periodically to provide support and counseling about skin care, cosmetics, and problems related to psychosocial adjustment. Such organizations, and many regional burn centers, sponsor group meetings and social functions at which outpatients are welcome. Some also provide school-reentry programs and are active in burn prevention activities. If more information is needed regarding burn prevention, the American Burn Association can help locate the nearest burn center and offer current burn prevention tips (see Chart 57-2).

Because so much attention is given to the burn wound and the treatments that are necessary to treat the burn wound and to prevent complications, the patient, family, and health care providers may inadvertently ignore the patient's ongoing needs for health promotion and screening. Thus, the patient and family are reminded of the importance of periodic health screening and preventive care (eg, gynecologic examinations, dental care).

\section*{Burn Care in the Home}

More and more burns are being treated exclusively in outpatient settings, including wound clinics, physicians' offices, and emergency department clinics. The outpatient setting is appropriate for the care of minor burns and most moderate burns. However, a number of factors must be considered in determining the appropriate site of care. These factors include the age of the patient, the extent and depth of the burn, the availability of family support systems and community resources to assist the patient, the patient's adherence to the prescribed plan of care, and the distance from home to the outpatient setting.

Initially, looking at and touching the burn wound may be difficult and even frightening to some family members and patients. However, with encouragement and support, most can handle burn wound care with little need for daily professional care. Instructions, both verbal and written, are given to the patient about burn wound care, pain management strategies, the need for adequate nutrition, and the importance of exercise and rest. Instruction is also given about signs and symptoms of infection that should be reported to the physician. The importance of notifying the physician about complications early and of keeping follow-up appointments is emphasized to the patient and family.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Nursing assessment of the elderly burn patient should include particular attention to pulmonary function, response to fluid resuscitation, and signs of mental confusion or disorientation. A careful history of preburn medications and preexisting illnesses is essential.

Nursing care promotes early mobilization, aggressive pulmonary care, and attention to preventing complications. Because of lowered resistance, burn wound sepsis and lethal systemic septicemia are more likely in elderly patients. Moreover, fever may not be present in the elderly to signal such events. Therefore, surveillance for other signs of infection becomes even more important.

Rehabilitation must take into account preexisting functional abilities and limitations, such as arthritis and low activity tolerance. Elderly patients commonly lack family members who can provide home care, so social services and community nursing services must be contacted to provide optimal care and supervision after hospital discharge.

\section*{2 Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 60 -year-old man weighing 50 kg is transferred to the emergency department after his tractor caught on fire, burning both of his legs circumferentially, his anterior chest, and his entire right upper extremity. Using the rule of nines chart, estimate the percent of TBSA burned. What are the emergent priorities for this patient? What are the fluid resuscitation requirements for this patient based on his percent burn and his weight? What assessment parameters would you be monitoring closely?
2. Your 25-year-old patient received burns over $60 \%$ of her body, including her upper extremities and face, as a result of a kitchen fire 2 weeks ago. She is depressed and distraught about the pain associated with wound care and the changes in her appearance. What assessments are important in her care, and what nursing interventions would be appropriate for her at this time?
3. Your 26-year-old burn patient is scheduled for surgery. The burn physician plans on using Integra on his upper extremity burns after débridement and to apply Acticoat to the superficial burns. What patient education would you give this patient about Integra and Acticoat? Explain what these two products are, their purpose, and the benefits of their use. Explain how the implications for nursing care differ for the two products.
4. Your 41-year-old patient, an attorney, is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a week following 6 weeks of treatment for severe burns to the lower part of her body. She has used a wheelchair for the last 20 years as a result of a spinal cord injury. The burns occurred when she was lighting a candle at home and it fell onto her clothing. What preparation would be important in making arrangements for referral and home care if she lives alone? What specific safety precautions should be included in discharge teaching for her?

\section*{Assessment and Management of Patients With Eye and Vision Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Identify significant eye structures and describe their functions.
2. Identify diagnostic tests for assessment of vision and evaluation of visual disabilities.
3. Discuss clinical features of ocular disorders, diagnostic assessment and examinations, medical or surgical management, and patient care.
4. Describe therapeutic effects of ophthalmic medications.
5. Define low vision and blindness and differentiate between functional and visual impairment.
6. List and describe assessment and management strategies for low vision.
7. Demonstrate orientation and mobility techniques for low-vision patients in a hospital setting.
8. Demonstrate instillation of eye drops and ointment.
9. Discuss general discharge instructions for patients after ocular surgery.

$T_{h}$he ability to see the world clearly can easily be taken for granted. The eye is a sensitive, highly specialized sense organ subject to various disorders, many of which lead to impaired vision. Impaired vision affects an individual's independence in self-care, work and lifestyle choices, sense of self-esteem, safety, ability to interact with society and the environment, and overall quality of life. Many of the leading causes of visual impairment are associated with aging (eg, cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration), and two thirds of the visually impaired population is older than 65 years of age. Younger people are also at risk for eye disorders, particularly traumatic injuries.

Although most people with eye disorders are treated in an ambulatory care setting, many patients receiving health care have an eye disease as a comorbid condition. In addition to understanding the prevention, treatment, and consequences of eye disorders, nurses in all settings should assess visual acuity in those at risk (eg, patients who are elderly, those with diabetes or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]), refer patients to eye care specialists as appropriate, implement measures to prevent further visual loss, and help patients adapt to impaired vision.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

Unlike most organs of the body, the eye is available for external examination, and its anatomy is more easily assessed than many other body parts (Fig. 58-1). The eyeball, or globe, sits in a protective bony structure known as the orbit. Lined with muscle and

connective and adipose tissues, the orbit is about 4 cm high, wide, and deep, and it is shaped roughly like a four-sided pyramid, surrounded on three sides by the sinuses: ethmoid (medially), frontal (superiorly), and maxillary (inferiorly). The optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery enter the orbit at its apex through the optic foramen. The eyeball is moved though all fields of gaze by the extraocular muscles. The four rectus muscles and two oblique muscles (Fig. 58-2) are innervated by cranial nerves (CN) III, IV, and VI. Normally, the movements of the two eyes are coordinated, and the brain perceives a single image.

The eyelids, composed of thin elastic skin that covers striated and smooth muscles, protect the anterior portion of the eye. The eyelids contain multiple glands, including sebaceous, sweat, and accessory lacrimal glands, and they are lined with conjunctival material. The upper lid normally covers the uppermost portion of the iris and is innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III). The lid margins contain meibomian glands, the inferior and superior puncta, and the eyelashes. The triangular spaces formed by the junction of the eyelids are known as the inner or medial canthus and the outer or lateral canthus. With every blink of the eyes, the lids wash the cornea and conjunctiva with tears.

Tears are vitally important to eye health. They are formed by the lacrimal gland and the accessory lacrimal glands. A healthy tear is composed of three layers: lipoid, aqueous, and mucoid. If there is a defect in the composition of any of these layers, the integrity of the cornea may be compromised. Tears are secreted in response to reflex or emotional stimuli.

The conjunctiva, a mucous membrane, provides a barrier to the external environment and nourishes the eye. The goblet cells of the conjunctiva secrete lubricating mucus. The bulbar conjunctiva covers the sclera, whereas the palpebral conjunctiva lines the inner surface of the upper and lower eyelids. The junction of the two portions is known as the fornix.

The sclera, commonly known as the white of the eye, is a dense, fibrous structure that comprises the posterior five sixths of the eye (Fig. 58-3). The sclera helps to maintain the shape of the eyeball and protects the intraocular contents from trauma. The sclera may have a slightly bluish tinge in young children, a dull white color in adults, and a slightly yellowish color in the elderly. Externally, it is overlaid with conjunctiva, which is a thin, transparent, mucous membrane that contains fine blood vessels. The conjunctiva meets the cornea at the limbus on the outermost edge of the iris.

\caption{FIGURE 58-2 The extraocular muscles responsible for eye movement. The medial rectus muscle (not shown) is responsible for opposing the movement of the lateral rectus muscle.}
\end{figure}

The cornea (Fig. 58-4), a transparent, avascular, domelike structure, forms the most anterior portion of the eyeball and is the main refracting surface of the eye. It is composed of five layers: epithelium, Bowman's membrane, stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium. The epithelial cells are capable of rapid replication and are completely replaced every 7 days.

Behind the cornea lies the anterior chamber, filled with a continually replenished supply of clear aqueous humor, which nourishes the cornea. The aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary body, and its production is related to the intraocular pressure (IOP). Normal pressure is 10 to 21 mm Hg .

The uvea consists of the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid. The iris, or colored part of the eye, is a highly vascularized, pigmented collection of fibers surrounding the pupil. The pupil is a space that dilates and constricts in response to light. Normal pupils are round and constrict symmetrically when a bright light shines on them. About $20 \%$ of the population has pupils that are slightly unequal in size but that respond equally to light. Dilation and constriction are controlled by the sphincter and dilator pupillae muscles. The dilator muscles are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, whereas the sphincter muscles are controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system.

Directly behind the pupil and iris lies the lens, a colorless and almost completely transparent, biconvex structure held in position by zonular fibers. It is avascular and has no nerve or pain fibers. The lens enables focusing for near vision and refocusing for distance vision. The ability to focus and refocus is called accommodation. The lens is suspended behind the iris by the zonules and is connected to the ciliary body. The ciliary body controls accommodation through the zonular fibers and the ciliary muscles. The aqueous humor is anterior to the lens; posterior to the lens is the vitreous humor. All cells formed throughout life are retained by the lens, which makes the cell structure of the lens susceptible to the degenerative effects of aging. The lens continues to grow throughout life, laying down fibers in concentric rings. This gradual thickening becomes evident in the fifth decade of life and eventually results in an increasingly dense core or nucleus, which can limit accommodative powers.

The posterior chamber is a small space between the vitreous and the iris. Aqueous fluid is manufactured in the posterior chamber by the ciliary body. This aqueous fluid flows from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber, from which it drains through the trabecular meshwork into the canal of Schlemm.

The choroid lies between the retina and the sclera. It is a vascular tissue, supplying blood to the portion of the sensory retina closest to it.

The ocular fundus is the largest chamber of the eye and contains the vitreous humor, a clear, gelatinous substance, composed mostly of water and encapsulated by a hyaloid membrane. The vitreous humor occupies about two thirds of the eye's volume and helps maintain the shape of the eye. As the body ages, the gel-like characteristics are gradually lost, and various cells and fibers cast shadows that the patient perceives as "floaters." The vitreous is in continuous contact with the retina and is attached to the retina by scattered collagenous filaments. The vitreous shrinks and shifts with age.

The innermost surface of the fundus is the retina. The retina is composed of 10 microscopic layers and has the consistency of wet tissue paper. It is neural tissue, an extension of the optic nerve. Viewed through the pupil, the landmarks of the retina are the optic disc, the retinal vessels, and the macula. The point of entrance of the optic nerve into the retina is the optic disc. The optic disc is oval or circular, is pink, and has sharp margins. In

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
the disc, a physiologic depression or cup is present centrally, with the retinal blood vessels emanating from it. The retinal tissues arise from the optic disc and line the inner surface of the vitreous chamber. The retinal vessels also enter the eye through the optic nerve, branching out through the retina and forming superior and inferior arcades. The area of the retina responsible for central vision is the macula. The rest of the retina is responsible for peripheral vision. In the center of the macula is the most sensitive
area, the fovea, which is avascular and surrounded by the superior and inferior vascular arcades. Two important layers of the retina are the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the sensory retina. A single layer of cells constitutes the RPE, and these cells have numerous functions, including the absorption of light. The sensory retina contains the photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Rods and cones are long, narrow cells shaped like rods or cones. The rods are mainly responsible for night vision or vision in low

light, whereas the cones provide the best vision for bright light, color vision, and fine detail. Cones are distributed throughout the retina with their greatest concentration in the fovea. Rods are absent in the fovea.

Good visual acuity depends on a healthy, functioning eyeball and an intact visual pathway (Fig. 58-5). This pathway is made up of the retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracks, lateral geniculate bodies, optic radiations, and the visual cortex area of the brain. The pathway is an extension of the central nervous system.

The optic nerve is also known as the second cranial nerve (CN II). Its purpose is to transmit impulses from the retina to the occipital lobe of the brain. The optic nerve head, or optic disc, is the physiologic blind spot in each eye. The optic nerve leaves the eye and then meets the optic nerve from the other eye at the optic chiasm. The chiasm is the anatomic point at which the nasal

FIGURE 58-5 The visual pathway. From Goldblum, K. (Ed.) (1997). Core curriculum for ophthalmic nursing, American Society of Ophthalmic Registered Nurses. Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hall Publishing.
fibers from the nasal retina of each eye cross to the opposite side of the brain. The nerve fibers from the temporal retina of each eye remain uncrossed. Fibers from the right half of each eye, which would be the left visual field, therefore carry impulses to the right occipital lobe. Fibers from the left half of each eye, or the right visual field, carry impulses to the left occipital lobe. Beyond the chiasm, these fibers are known as the optic tract. The optic tract continues on to the lateral geniculate body. The lateral geniculate body leads to the optic radiations and then to the cortex of the occipital lobe of the brain.

\section*{Assessment}

The health care provider, through careful questioning, elicits the necessary information that can lead to the diagnosis of an ophthalmic condition. Pertinent questions to ask during the interview can be found in Chart 58-1.

After the patient's chief complaint or concern has been identified and the history has been obtained, visual acuity should be assessed. This is an essential part of the eye examination and a measure against which all therapeutic outcomes are based.

\section*{Visual Acuity}

Most health care providers are familiar with the standard Snellen chart. This chart is composed of a series of progressively smaller rows of letters and is used to test distance vision. The fraction $20 / 20$ is considered the standard of normal vision. Most people can see the letters on the line designated as $20 / 20$ from a distance of 20 feet. A person whose vision is $20 / 200$ can see an object from 20 feet away that a person whose vision is $20 / 20$ can see from 200 feet away.

The patient is positioned at the proscribed distance, usually 20 feet, from the chart and is asked to read the smallest line that he or she can see. The patient should wear distance correction

\section*{Chart 58-1 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Taking an Ocular History}
- What does the patient perceive to be the problem?
- Is visual acuity diminished?
- Does the patient experience blurred, double, or distorted vision?
- Is there pain; is it sharp or dull; is it worse when blinking?
- Is the discomfort an itching sensation or more of a foreign body sensation?
- Are both eyes affected?
- Is there a history of discharge? If so, question color, consistency, odor.
- What is the duration of the problem?
- Is this a recurrence of a previous condition?
- How has the patient self-treated?
- What makes the symptoms improve or worsen?
- Are there any systemic diseases? What medications are used in their treatment?
- What concurrent ophthalmic conditions does the patient have?
- Is there an ophthalmic surgery history?
- Have other family members had the same symptoms or condition?
(eyeglasses or contact lenses) if required, and each eye should be tested separately. The right eye is commonly tested first and then the left. If the patient is unable to read the $20 / 20$ line, he or she is given a pinhole occluder and asked to read again using the eye in question. A makeshift occluder may be created by making a pinhole in an index card and asking the patient to look through the pinhole. Squinting produces the same effect. Patients should be encouraged to read more letters and to guess, if necessary. Often, patients avoid guessing and prefer not to try at all rather than to make a mistake. The patient should be encouraged to read every letter possible.

The visual acuity (VA) is recorded in the following way. If the patient reads all five letters from the 20/20 line with the right eye (OD) and three of the five letters on the $20 / 15$ line with the left eye (OS), the examiner writes OD 20/20, OS 20/15-2, or VA 20/20, 20/15-2.

If the patient is unable to read the largest letter on the chart (the 20/200 line), the patient should be moved toward the chart or the chart moved toward the patient, until the patient is able to identify the largest letter on the chart. If the patient can recognize only the letter E on the top line at a distance of 10 feet, the visual acuity would be recorded as $10^{\prime} / 200$. If the patient is unable to see the letter E at any distance, the examiner should determine if the patient can count fingers (CF). The examiner holds up a random number of fingers and asks the patient to count the number he or she sees. If the patient correctly identifies the number of fingers at 3 feet, the examiner would record $\mathrm{CF} / 3^{\prime}$.

If the patient is unable to count fingers, the examiner raises one hand up and down or moves it side to side and asks in which direction the hand is moving. This level of vision is known as hand motions (HM). A patient who can perceive only light is described as having light perception (LP). The vision of a patient who is unable to perceive light is described as no light perception (NLP).

\section*{The External Eye Examination}

After the visual acuity has been recorded, an external eye examination is performed. The position of the eyelids is noted. Commonly, the upper 2 mm of the iris is covered by the upper lid. The patient is examined for ptosis (ie, drooping eyelid) and for lid retraction (ie, too much of the eye exposed). Sometimes, the upper or lower lid turns out, affecting closure. The lid margins and lashes should have no edema, erythema, or lesions. The examiner looks for scaling or crusting, and the sclera is inspected. A normal sclera is opaque and white. Lesions on the conjunctiva, discharge, and tearing or blinking are noted.

The room should be darkened so that the pupils can be examined. The pupillary response should be checked with a penlight to be certain that the pupils are equally reactive and regular. A normal pupil is black. An irregular pupil may result from trauma, previous surgery, or a disease process.

The patient's eyes are observed in primary or direct gaze, and any head tilt is noted. A tilt may indicate cranial nerve palsy. The patient is asked to stare at a target; each eye is covered and uncovered quickly while the examiner looks for any shift in gaze. The examiner observes for nystagmus (ie, oscillating movement of the eyeball). The extraocular movements of the eyes are simply tested by having the patient follow the examiner's finger or hand light through the six cardinal directions of gaze (ie, up, down, right, left, and both diagonals). This is especially important when screening patients for ocular trauma or for neurologic disorders.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

\section*{DIRECT OPHTHALMOSCOPY}

A direct ophthalmoscope is a hand-held instrument with various plus and minus lenses. The lenses can be rotated into place, enabling the examiner to bring the cornea, lens, and retina into focus sequentially. The examiner holds the ophthalmoscope in the right hand and uses the right eye to examine the patient's right eye. The examiner switches to the left hand and left eye when examining the patient's left eye. During this examination, the room should be darkened, and the patient's eye should be on the same level as the examiner's eye. The patient and the examiner should be comfortable, and both should breathe normally. The patient is given a target to gaze on and is encouraged to keep both eyes open and steady.

When the fundus is examined, the vasculature comes into focus first. The veins are larger in diameter than the arteries. The examiner should focus on a large vessel and then follow it toward the midline of the body, which leads to the optic nerve. The central depression in the disc is known as the cup. The normal cup is about one third of the disc. The size of the physiologic optic cup should be estimated. Are the disc margins sharp, or are they blurred? Do the veins have a silvery or coppery appearance? The periphery of the retina can be examined by having the patient shift his or her gaze. The last area of the fundus to be examined should be the macula, because this area is the most light sensitive. The retina of a young person often has a glistening effect, which is sometimes referred to as a cellophane reflex.

The healthy fundus should be free of any lesions. The examiner should look for intraretinal hemorrhages, which may appear as red smudges or, if the patient has hypertension, may look somewhat flame shaped. Lipid may be present in the retina of patients with hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. This lipid has a yellowish appearance. Soft exudates that have a fuzzy, white appearance (ie, cotton-wool spots) should be noted. The examiner looks for microaneurysms, which look like little red dots, and nevi. Drusen (ie, small, hyaline, globular growths), commonly found in macular degeneration, appear to be yellowish areas with indistinct edges. Small drusen have a more distinct edge. The examiner should sketch the fundus and document any abnormalities.

\section*{INDIRECT OPHTHALMOSCOPY}

The indirect ophthalmoscope is an instrument commonly used by the ophthalmologist. It produces a bright and intense light. The light source is affixed with a pair of binocular lenses, which are mounted on the examiner's head. The ophthalmoscope is used with a hand-held, 20 -diopter lens. This instrument enables the examiner to see larger areas of the retina, although in an unmagnified state.

\section*{SLIT-LAMP EXAMINATION}

The slit lamp is a binocular microscope mounted on a table. This instrument enables the user to examine the eye with magnification of 10 to 40 times the real image. The illumination can be varied from a broad to a narrow beam of light for different parts of the eye. For example, by varying the width and intensity of the light, the anterior chamber can be examined for signs of inflammation. Cataracts may be evaluated by changing the angle of the light. When a hand-held contact lens, such as a three-mirror lens, is used with the slit lamp, the angle of the anterior chamber may be examined, as may the ocular fundus.

\section*{COLOR VISION TESTING}

The ability to differentiate colors has a dramatic effect on the activities of daily living. For example, the inability to differentiate between red and green can compromise traffic safety. Some careers (eg, commercial art, color photography, airline pilot, electrician) may be closed to people with significant color deficiencies. The photoreceptor cells responsible for color vision are the cones, and the greatest area of color sensitivity is in the macula, the area of densest cone concentration.

A screening test, such as the polychromatic plates discussed in the next paragraph, can be used to establish whether a person's color vision is within normal range. Color vision deficits can be inherited. For example, red/green color deficiencies are inherited in an X-linked manner, affecting approximately $8 \%$ of men and $0.4 \%$ of women. Acquired color vision losses may be caused by medications (eg, digitalis toxicity) or pathology such as cataracts. A simple test, such as asking a patient if the red top on a bottle of eye drops appears redder to one eye than the other, can be an effective tool. Changes in the appreciation of the gradations of the color red can indicate macular or optic nerve disease.

Because alteration in color vision is sometimes indicative of conditions of the optic nerve, color vision testing is often performed in a neuro-ophthalmologic workup. The most common color vision test is performed using Ishihara polychromatic plates. These plates are bound together in a booklet. On each plate of this booklet are dots of primary colors that are integrated into a background of secondary colors. The dots are arranged in simple patterns, such as numbers or geometric shapes. Patients with diminished color vision may be unable to identify the hidden shapes. Patients with central vision conditions (eg, macular degeneration) have more difficulty identifying colors than those with peripheral vision conditions (eg, glaucoma) because central vision identifies color.

\section*{AMSLER GRID}

The Amsler grid is a test often used for patients with macular problems, such as macular degeneration. It consists of a geometric grid of identical squares with a central fixation point. The grid should be viewed by the patient wearing normal reading glasses. Each eye is tested separately. The patient is instructed to stare at the central fixation spot on the grid and report any distortion in the squares of the grid itself. For patients with macular problems, some of the squares may look faded, or the lines may be wavy. Patients with age-related macular degeneration are commonly given these Amsler grids to take home. The patient is encouraged to check them frequently, as often as daily, to detect any early signs of distortion that may indicate the development of a neovascular choroidal membrane, an advanced stage of macular degeneration characterized by the growth of abnormal choroidal vessels.

\section*{ULTRASONOGRAPHY}

Lesions in the globe or the orbit may not be directly visible and are evaluated by ultrasonography. A probe placed against the eye aims the beam of sound. High-frequency sound waves emitted from a special transmitter are bounced back from the lesion and collected by a receiver that amplifies and displays the sound waves on a special screen. Ultrasonography can be used to identify orbital tumors, retinal detachment, and changes in tissue composition.

\section*{COLOR FUNDUS PHOTOGRAPHY}

Fundus photography is a technique used to detect and document retinal lesions. The patient's pupils are widely dilated during the procedure, and visual acuity is diminished for about 30 minutes due to retinal "bleaching" by the intense flashing lights.

\section*{FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAPHY}

Fluorescein angiography evaluates clinically significant macular edema, documents macular capillary nonperfusion, and identifies retinal and choroidal neovascularization (ie, growth of abnormal new blood vessels) in age-related macular degeneration. It is an invasive procedure in which fluorescein dye is injected, usually into an antecubital area vein. Within 10 to 15 seconds, this dye can be seen coursing through the retinal vessels. Over a 10 -minute period, serial black-and-white photographs are taken of the retinal vasculature. The dye may impart a gold tone to the skin of some patients, and urine may turn deep yellow or orange. This discoloration usually disappears in 24 hours.

\section*{TONOMETRY}

Tonometry measures IOP by determining the amount of force necessary to indent or flatten (applanate) a small anterior area of the globe of the eye. The principle involved is that a soft eye is dented more easily than a hard eye. Pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ). High readings indicate high pressure; low readings, low pressure. The three most common types of tonometers are indentation, applanation, and noncontact. The procedure is noninvasive and is usually painless. A topical anesthetic eye drop is instilled in the lower conjunctival sac, and the tonometer is then used to measure the IOP.

\section*{GONIOSCOPY}

Gonioscopy visualizes the angle of the anterior chamber to identify abnormalities in appearance and measurements. The gonioscope uses a refracting lens that can be a direct or indirect lens. The indirect lens views the mirror image of the opposite anterior chamber angle and can be used only with a slit lamp. The direct gonioscopic lens gives a direct view of the angle and its structures.

\section*{PERIMETRY TESTING}

Perimetry testing evaluates the field of vision. A visual field is the area or extent of physical space visible to an eye in a given position. Its average extent is 65 degrees upward, 75 degrees downward, 60 degrees inward, and 95 degrees outward when the eye is in the primary gaze (ie, looking directly forward). It is a threedimensional contour representing areas of relative retinal sensitivity. Visual acuity is sharpest at the very top of the field and declines progressively toward the periphery. Visual field testing (ie, perimetry) helps to identify which parts of the patient's central and peripheral visual fields have useful vision. It is most helpful in detecting central scotomas (ie, blind areas in the visual field) in macular degeneration and the peripheral field defects in glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa.

The two methods of perimetric testing are manual and automated perimetry. Manual perimetry involves the use of moving (kinetic) or stationary (static) stimuli or targets. An example of kinetic manual perimetry is the tangent screen. A tangent screen is a black felt material mounted on a wall that has a series of con-
centric circles dissected by straight lines emanating from the center. It tests the central 30 degrees of the visual field. Automated perimetry uses stationary targets, which are harder to detect than moving targets. In this test, a computer projects light randomly in different areas of a hollow dome while the patient looks through a telescopic opening and depresses a button whenever he or she detects the light stimulus. Automated perimetry is more accurate than manual perimetry.

\section*{ImpairedVision}

\section*{REFRACTIVE ERRORS}

In refractive errors, vision is impaired because a shortened or elongated eyeball prevents light rays from focusing sharply on the retina. Blurred vision from refractive error can be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses. The appropriate eyeglass or contact lens is determined by refraction. Refraction ophthalmology consists of placing various types of lenses in front of the patient's eyes to determine which lens best improves the patient's vision.

The depth of the eyeball is important in determining refractive error (Fig. 58-6). Patients for whom the visual image focuses precisely on the macula and who do not need eyeglasses or contact lenses are said to have emmetropia (normal vision). People who have myopia are said to be nearsighted. They have deeper eyeballs; the distant visual image focuses in front of, or short of, the retina. Myopic people experience blurred distance vision. When people have a shorter depth to their eyes, the visual image focuses beyond the retina; the eyes are shallower and are called hyperopic. People with hyperopia are farsighted. These patients experience near vision blurriness, whereas their distance vision is excellent.

Another important cause of refractive error is astigmatism, an irregularity in the curve of the cornea. Because astigmatism causes

\end{figure}
a distortion of the visual image, acuity of distance and near vision can be decreased. Eyeglasses with a cylinder correction or rigid or soft toric contact lenses are appropriate for these patients.

\section*{LOW VISION AND BLINDNESS}

Low vision is a general term describing visual impairment that requires patients to use devices and strategies in addition to corrective lenses to perform visual tasks. Low vision is defined as a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/70 to 20/200 (Table 58-1).

Blindness is defined as a BCVA of $20 / 400$ to no light perception. The clinical definition of absolute blindness is the absence of light perception. Legal blindness is a condition of impaired vision in which an individual has a BCVA that does not exceed 20/200 in the better eye or whose widest visual field diameter is 20 degrees or less. This definition does not equate with functional ability, nor does it classify the degrees of visual impairment. Legal blindness ranges from an inability to perceive light to having some vision remaining. An individual who meets the criteria for legal blindness may obtain government financial assistance. There are more than $1,046,000$ legally blind Americans who are 40 years of age or older. African Americans have a higher rate of blindness than do Caucasians (Preshel \& Prevent Blindness America, 2002).

Impaired vision is accompanied by difficulty in performing functional activities. Individuals with visual acuity of $20 / 80$ to 20/100 with a visual field restriction of 60 degrees to greater than 20 degrees can read at a nearly normal level with optical aids. Their visual orientation is near normal but requires increased scanning of the environment (ie, systematic use of head and eye movements). In a visual acuity range of $20 / 200$ to $20 / 400$ with a 20 -degree to greater than 10 -degree visual field restriction, the individual can read slowly with optical aids. His or her visual

orientation is slow, with constant scanning of the environment; individuals in this category have travel vision. Individuals with hand motion vision or no vision may benefit from the use of mobility devices (eg, cane, guide dog) and should be encouraged to learn Braille and to use computer aids.

The most common causes of blindness and visual impairment among adults 40 years of age or older are diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataracts, (Preshel \& Prevent Blindness America, 2002). Macular degeneration is more prevalent among Caucasians, whereas glaucoma is more prevalent among African Americans. Age-related changes in the eye are described in Table 58-2.

\section*{Low-Vision Assessment}

The assessment of low vision includes a thorough history and the examination of distance and near visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, glare, color perception, and refraction. Specially designed, low-vision visual acuity charts are used to evaluate patients.

\section*{PATIENT INTERVIEW}

During history taking, the cause and duration of the patient's visual impairment are identified. Patients with retinitis pigmentosa, for example, have a genetic abnormality. Patients with diabetic macular edema typically have fluctuating visual acuity. Patients with macular degeneration have central acuity problems. Central acuity problems cause difficulty in performing activities that require finer vision, such as reading. People with peripheral field defects have more difficulties with mobility. The patient's customary activities of daily living, medication regimen, habits (eg, smoking), acceptance of the physical limitations brought about by the visual impairment, and realistic expectations of low-vision aids must also be identified. These aspects of the patient's activities are important indicators for planning care that will include guidelines for safety and referrals to social services.

\begin{abstract}
ASSESSMENT
Contrast-sensitivity testing measures visual acuity in different degrees of contrast. The initial test may take the form of simply turning on the lights while testing the distance acuity. If the patient can read better with the lights on, the patient can benefit from magnification. Glare testing enables the examiner to obtain a more realistic evaluation of the patient's ability to function in his or her environment. Glare can reduce a person's ability to see, especially in patients with cataracts. Devices that test glare, such as the Brightness Acuity Tester, produce three degrees of bright light to create a dazzle effect while the patient is viewing a target, such as Snellen letters on the wall. The lights have been calibrated to imitate certain objects that create glare, such as the brightness of a car's headlights at night.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Medical Management}

Managing low vision involves magnification and image enhancement through the use of low-vision aids and strategies and through referrals to social services and community agencies serving the visually impaired. The goals are to enhance visual function and assist patients with low vision to perform customary activities. Low-vision aids include optical and nonoptical devices (Table 58-3). The optical devices include convex lens aids, such as magnifiers and spectacles; telescopic devices; anti-reflective lenses that diminish glare; and electronic reading systems, such as closed-circuit television and computers with large print. Continuing advances in computer software provide very useful products for patients with low vision. Scanners teamed with the appropriate software enable the user to scan printed data into the computer and have it read by computer voice or to increase the magnification for reading. Magnifiers can be hand-held or attached to a stand with or without illumination. Telescopic devices can be spectacle telescopes or clip-on or hand-held loupes.

Nonoptical aids include large-print publications and a variety of writing aids. The Internet continues to expand, and a tele-

Strategies that enhance the performance of visual tasks include modification of body movements and illumination and training for independent living skills. Head movements and po-
sitions can be modified to place images in functional areas of the visual field. Illumination is an added feature in magnifiers. Adjusting the lighting helps with reading and other activities. Simple optical and nonoptical aids are available in low-vision clinics.

Referrals to community agencies may be necessary for lowvision patients living alone who are unable to self-administer their medications. Community agencies, such as The Lighthouse National Center for Vision and Aging, offer services to low-vision patients that include training in independent living skills and the provision of occupational and recreational activities and a wide variety of assistive devices for vision enhancement and orientation and mobility.

\section*{VISION RESTORATION FOR THE BLIND}

Ophthalmologists have worked toward visual restoration for blind individuals for years, and computer technology now provides opportunities for restoring sight. For example, a multipleunit artificial retina chipset (MARC) has been devised for implanting within the eye. The MARC can be enabled to receive signals from an external camera mounted in a glasses frame. The acquired image is wirelessly transmitted to the chip, which provides a type of artificial vision and which, with training, allows the patient to achieve some useful vision. Although the device is still experimental, some work has been done with patients who have lost vision from retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration (Humayan et al., 1999).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Coping with blindness involves three types of adaptation: emotional, physical, and social. The emotional adjustment to blindness or severe visual impairment determines the success of the physical and social adjustments of the patient. Successful emotional adjustment means acceptance of blindness or severe visual impairment.

\section*{PROMOTING COPING EFFORTS}

Effective coping may not occur until the patient recognizes the permanence of the blindness. Clinging to false hopes of regaining vision hampers effective adaptation to blindness. A newly blind patient and his or her family members (especially those who live with the patient) undergo the various steps of grieving: denial and shock, anger and protest, restitution, loss resolution, and acceptance. The ability to accept the changes that must come with visual loss and willingness to adapt to those changes influence the successful rehabilitation of the patient who is blind. Additional aspects to consider are value changes, independence-dependence conflicts, coping with stigma, and learning to function in social settings without visual cues and landmarks.

\section*{PROMOTING SPATIAL ORIENTATION AND MOBILITY}

People who are blind detect and incorporate less information about their environment than do sighted people. The blind person relies on egocentric, sequential, and positional information, which centers on the person and his or her relationship to the objects in the environment. For example, the topographic concepts of front, back, left, right, above, and below and measures of distances are most useful in determining the exact position, sequence, and location of objects in relation to the person who is blind. Although their basis of information may be different from that of sighted people, people who are blind can comprehend spatial concepts.

The goal of orientation and mobility training is to foster independence in the environment. Training may be accomplished by using auditory and tactile cues and by providing anticipatory information. Having a concept of the spatial composition of the environment (ie, cognitive map) enhances independence of those who are blind. Orientation and mobility training programs are offered by community agencies serving the blind or visually impaired. Training includes using mobility devices for travel, the long cane, electronic travel aids, dog guides, and orientation aids. The basic orientation and mobility techniques used by a sighted person to assist a person who is blind or visually impaired to ambulate safely and efficiently are called sighted-guide techniques.

Spatial Orientation and Mobility in Institutional Settings. A blind or severely visually impaired patient requires strategies for adapting to the environment. The monocular postoperative patient whose functioning eye is restricted by a surgical patch or by postoperative inflammation requires early ambulation just like any postoperative patient. The activities of daily living, such as walking to a chair from a bed, require spatial concepts. The patient needs to know where he or she is in relation to the rest of the room, to understand the changes that may occur, and how to approach the desired location safely. This requires a collaborative effort between the patient and the nurse, who serves as the sighted guide.

Patients whose visual impairment results from a chronic progressive eye disorder, such as glaucoma, have better cognitive mapping skills than the suddenly blinded patient. They have developed the use of spatial and topographic concepts early and gradually; hence, remembering a room layout is easier for them. Suddenly blinded patients have more difficulty in adjusting; and emotional and behavioral issues of coping with blindness may hinder their learning. These patients require intensive emotional support. The nurse must assess the degree of physical assistance the patient with a visual deficit requires and communicate this to other health care personnel.

The food tray's composition is likened to the face of a clock. For example, the main plate may be described as being at 12 o'clock or the coffee cup at 3 o'clock. In the hospital, the bedside table and the call button must always be within reach. The parts of the call button are explained, and the patient is encouraged to touch and press the buttons or dials until the activity is mastered. The patient must be familiarized with the location of the telephone, water pitcher, and other objects on the bedside table. All articles and furniture must be replaced in the same positions. Introducing oneself on entering a patient's room is always a polite gesture and helps in the orientation of a blind patient.

The nurse should be aware of the importance of technique in providing physical assistance, developing independence, and ensuring safety. The readiness of the patient and his or her family to learn must be assessed before initiating orientation and mobility training.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse, social workers, family, and others collaborate to assess the patient's home condition and support system. If available, a low-vision specialist should be consulted before discharge, particularly for patients for whom identifying and administering medications pose problems. The level of visual acuity and patient preference help to determine appropriate interventions. For example, a plastic pill container with dividers that has been prefilled with a week's supply of medication can make medication administration easier for some patients, whereas others may prefer to have medication bottles marked with textured paints. Many patients require referral to social services. Patients with habits that may jeopardize safety, such as smoking, need to be cautioned and assisted to make their environment safe.

Community Programs and Services. In the United States, laws such as the Rehabilitation Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Americans With Disabilities Act support assistance of the blind. Governmental services include income assistance through Social Security Disability Income and Supplemental Security Income; health insurance through Medicaid and Medicare programs; support services, such as vocational rehabilitation programs offered by the Division of Blind Services; tax exemptions and tax deductions; Department of Veterans Affairs programs for visually impaired veterans; and U.S. Postal Service reduced postage for Braille materials and talking books. Some private and nonprofit services are identified in "Resources and Websites" at the end of this chapter.

\section*{Glaucoma}

Glaucoma is a group of ocular conditions characterized by optic nerve damage. The optic nerve damage is related to the IOP caused by congestion of aqueous humor in the eye. There is a range of pressures that have been considered "normal" but that may be associated with vision loss in some patients. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the world and is the leading cause of blindness among adults in the United States. It is estimated that at least 2 million Americans have glaucoma and that 5 to 10 million more are at risk (Margolis et al., 2002). Glaucoma is more prevalent among people older than 40 years of age, and the incidence increases with age. It is also more prevalent among men than women and in the African American and Asian populations (Chart 58-3). There is no cure for glaucoma, but research continues.

\section*{Risk Factors for Glaucoma}
- Family history of glaucoma
- African American race
- Older age
- Diabetes
- Cardiovascular disease
- Migraine syndromes
- Nearsightedness (myopia)
- Eye trauma
- Prolonged use of topical or systemic corticosteroids

\section*{Aqueous Humor and Intraocular Pressure}

Aqueous humor flows between the iris and the lens, nourishing the cornea and lens. Most ( $90 \%$ ) of the fluid then flows out of the anterior chamber, draining through the spongy trabecular meshwork into the canal of Schlemm and the episcleral veins (Fig. 58-7). About $10 \%$ of the aqueous fluid exits through the ciliary body into the suprachoroidal space and then drains into the venous circulation of the ciliary body, choroid, and sclera. Unimpeded outflow of aqueous fluid depends on an intact drainage system and an open angle (about 45 degrees) between the iris and the cornea. A narrower angle places the iris closer to the trabecular meshwork, diminishing the angle. The amount of aqueous humor produced tends to decrease with age, in systemic diseases such as diabetes, and in ocular inflammatory conditions.

IOP is determined by the rate of aqueous production, the resistance encountered by the aqueous humor as it flows out of the passages, and the venous pressure of the episcleral veins that drain into the anterior ciliary vein. When aqueous fluid production and drainage are in balance, the IOP is between 10 and 21 mm Hg . When aqueous fluid is inhibited from flowing out, pressure builds up within the eye. Fluctuations in IOP occur with time of day, exertion, diet, and medications. It tends to increase with blinking, tight lid squeezing, and upward gazing. Systemic conditions such as hypertension and intraocular conditions such as uveitis and retinal detachment have been associated with elevated IOP. Exposure to cold weather, alcohol, a fat-free diet, heroin, and marijuana have been found to lower IOP.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

There are two accepted theories regarding how increased IOP damages the optic nerve in glaucoma. The direct mechanical theory suggests that high IOP damages the retinal layer as it passes through the optic nerve head. The indirect ischemic theory suggests that high IOP compresses the microcirculation in the optic nerve head, resulting in cell injury and death. Some glaucomas appear as exclusively mechanical, and some are exclusively ischemic types. Typically, most cases are a combination of both.

Regardless of the cause of damage, glaucomatous changes typically evolve through clearly discernible stages:
1. Initiating events: precipitating factors include illness, emotional stress, congenital narrow angles, long-term use of

EIGURE 58-7 Normal outflow of aqueous humor. (A) Trabecular meshwork. (B) Uveoscleral route. From Kanski, J. J. (1999). Clinical ophthalmology. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.
corticosteroids, and mydriatics (ie, medications causing pupillary dilation). These events lead to the second stage.
2. Structural alterations in the aqueous outflow system: tissue and cellular changes caused by factors that affect aqueous humor dynamics lead to structural alterations and to the third stage.
3. Functional alterations: conditions such as increased IOP or impaired blood flow create functional changes that lead to the fourth stage.
4. Optic nerve damage: atrophy of the optic nerve is characterized by loss of nerve fibers and blood supply, and this fourth stage inevitably progresses to the fifth stage.
5. Visual loss: progressive loss of vision is characterized by visual field defects.

\section*{Classification of Glaucoma}

There are several types of glaucoma. Whether glaucoma is known as open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma depends on which mechanisms cause impaired aqueous outflow. Glaucoma can be pri-
mary or secondary, depending on whether associated factors contribute to the rise in IOP.

Although glaucoma classification is changing as knowledge increases, current clinical forms of glaucoma are open-angle glaucomas, angle-closure glaucomas (also called pupillary block), congenital glaucomas, and glaucomas associated with other conditions, such as developmental anomalies, corticosteroid use, and other ocular conditions. The two common clinical forms of glaucoma encountered in adults are open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Table 58-4 explains the general characteristics of the different types of open-angle and angle-closure glaucomas.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Glaucoma is often called the silent thief of sight because most patients are unaware that they have the disease until they have experienced visual changes and vision loss. The patient may not seek health care until he or she experiences blurred vision or "halos" around lights, difficulty focusing, difficulty adjusting eyes in low lighting, loss of peripheral vision, aching or discomfort around the eyes, and headache.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The purpose of a glaucoma workup is to establish the diagnostic category, assess the optic nerve damage, and formulate a treatment plan. The patient's ocular and medical history must be detailed to investigate the history of predisposing factors. There are four major types of examinations used in glaucoma evaluation, diagnosis, and management: tonometry to measure the IOP, ophthalmoscopy to inspect the optic nerve, gonioscopy to examine the filtration angle of the anterior chamber, and perimetry to assess the visual fields.

The changes in the optic nerve significant for the diagnosis of glaucoma are pallor and cupping of the optic nerve disc. The pallor of the optic nerve is caused by a lack of blood supply that results from cellular destruction. Cupping is characterized by exaggerated bending of the blood vessels as they cross the optic disc, resulting in an enlarged optic cup that appears more basinlike compared with a normal cup. The progression of cupping in glaucoma is caused by the gradual loss of retinal nerve fibers accompanied by the loss of blood supply, resulting in increased pallor of the optic disc.

As the optic nerve damage increases, visual perception in the area is lost. The localized areas of visual loss (ie, scotomas) represent loss of retinal sensitivity and are measured and mapped by perimetry. The results are mapped on a graph. In patients with glaucoma, the graph has a distinct pattern that is different from other ocular diseases and is useful in establishing the diagnosis. Figure 58-8 shows the progression of visual field defects caused by glaucoma.

\end{figure}

\section*{Medical Management}

The aim of all glaucoma treatment is prevention of optic nerve damage through medical therapy, laser or nonlaser surgery, or a combination of these approaches. Lifelong therapy is almost always necessary because glaucoma cannot be cured. Although treatment cannot reverse optic nerve damage, further damage can be controlled. The treatment goal is to maintain an IOP within a range unlikely to cause further damage.

The initial target for IOP among patients with elevated IOP and those with low-tension glaucoma with progressive visual field loss is typically set at $30 \%$ lower than the current pressure. The patient is monitored for the stability of the optic nerve. If there is evidence of progressive damage, the target IOP is again lowered until the optic nerve shows stability.

Treatment focuses on achieving the greatest benefit at the least risk, cost, and inconvenience to the patient. All treatment options have potential complications, especially surgery, which yields the best success rates. In the United States, medical management is the common approach, and surgical management is the last resort. In Great Britain, the initial treatment of choice is surgery (Fechtner \& Singh, 2001).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Medical management of glaucoma relies on systemic and topical ocular medications that lower IOP. Periodic follow-up examinations are essential to monitor IOP, appearance of the optic nerve, visual fields, and side effects of medications. In considering a therapeutic regimen, the ophthalmologist aims for the greatest effectiveness with the least side effects, inconvenience, and cost. Therapy takes into account the patient's health and stage of glaucoma. Comfort, affordability, convenience, lifestyle, and personality are factors to consider in the patient's compliance with the medical regimen.

The patient is usually started on the lowest dose of topical medication and then advanced to increased concentrations until the desired IOP level is reached and maintained. Because of their efficacy, minimal dosing (can be used once each day), and low cost, beta-blockers are the preferred initial topical medications. One eye is treated first, with the other eye used as a control in determining the efficacy of the medication; once efficacy has been established, treatment of the fellow eye is started. If the IOP is elevated in both eyes, both are treated. When results are not satisfactory, a new medication is substituted. The main markers of the efficacy of the medication in glaucoma control are lowering of the IOP to the target pressure, appearance of the optic nerve head, and the visual field.

Several types of ocular medications are used to treat glaucoma (Table 58-5), including miotics (ie, cause pupillary constriction), adrenergic agonists (ie, sympathomimetic agents), beta-blockers, alpha $_{2}$-agonists (ie, adrenergic agents), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and prostaglandins. Cholinergics (ie, miotics) increase the outflow of the aqueous humor by affecting ciliary muscle contraction and pupil constriction, allowing flow through a larger opening between the iris and the trabecular meshwork. Adrenergic agonists increase aqueous outflow but primarily decrease aqueous production with an action similar to beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In laser trabeculoplasty for glaucoma, laser burns are applied to the inner surface of the trabecular meshwork to open the intratrabecular spaces and widen the canal of Schlemm, thereby pro-

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline MEDICATION & ACTION & SIDE EFFECTS & NURSING IMPLICATIONS \\
\hline Cholinergics (miotics) (pilocarpine, carbachol) & Increases aqueous fluid outflow by contracting the ciliary muscle and causing miosis (constriction of the pupil) and opening of trabecular meshwork & Periorbital pain, blurry vision, difficulty seeing in the dark & Caution patients about diminished vision in dimly lit areas \\

\hline Beta-blockers (betaxolol, timolol) & Decreases aqueous humor production & Can have systemic effects, including bradycardia, exacerbation of pulmonary disease, and hypotension & Contraindicated in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, second- or third-degree heart block, bradycardia, or cardiac failure; teach patients punctal occlusion to limit systemic effects \\

\end{table}
moting outflow of aqueous humor and decreasing IOP. The procedure is indicated when IOP is inadequately controlled by medications; it is contraindicated when the trabecular meshwork cannot be fully visualized because of narrow angles. A serious complication of this procedure is a transient rise in IOP (usually 2 hours after surgery) that may become persistent. IOP assessment in the immediate postoperative period is essential.

In laser iridotomy for pupillary block glaucoma, an opening is made in the iris to eliminate the pupillary block. Laser iridotomy is contraindicated in patients with corneal edema, which interferes with laser targeting and strength. Potential complications are burns to the cornea, lens, or retina; transient elevated IOP; closure of the iridotomy; uveitis; and blurring. Pilocarpine is usually prescribed to prevent closure of the iridotomy.

Filtering procedures for chronic glaucoma are used to create an opening or fistula in the trabecular meshwork to drain aqueous humor from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space into a bleb, thereby bypassing the usual drainage structures. This allows the aqueous humor to flow and exit by different routes (ie, absorption by the conjunctival vessels or mixing with tears). Trabeculectomy is the standard filtering technique used to remove part of the trabecular meshwork. Complications include hemorrhage, an extremely low (hypotony) or elevated IOP, uveitis, cataracts, bleb failure, bleb leak, and endophthalmitis. Unlike other surgical procedures, the filtering procedure's goal in glau-
coma treatment is to achieve incomplete healing of the surgical wound. The outflow of aqueous humor in a newly created drainage fistula is circumvented by the granulation of fibrovascular tissue or scar tissue formation on the surgical site. Scarring is inhibited by using antifibrosis agents such as the antimetabolites fluorouracil (Efudex) and mitomycin (Mutamycin). Like all antineoplastic agents, they require special handling procedures before, during, and after the procedure. Fluorouracil can be administered intraoperatively and by subconjunctival injection during followup; mitomycin is much more potent and is administered only intraoperatively.

Drainage implants or shunts are open tubes implanted in the anterior chamber to shunt aqueous humor to an attached plate in the conjunctival space. A fibrous capsule develops around the episcleral plate and filters the aqueous humor, thereby regulating the outflow and controlling IOP.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS ABOUT GLAUCOMA CARE}

The medical and surgical management of glaucoma slows the progression of glaucoma but does not cure it. The lifelong therapeutic regimen mandates patient education. The nature of the disease and the importance of strict adherence to the medication regimen must be explained to help ensure compliance. A thor-
ough patient interview is essential to determine systemic conditions, current systemic and ocular medications, family history, and problems with compliance to glaucoma medications. Then the medication program can be discussed, particularly the interactions of glaucoma-control medications with other medications. For example, the diuretic effect of acetazolamide has an additive effect on the diuretic effects of other antihypertensive medications and can result in hypokalemia. The effects of glaucomacontrol medications on vision must also be explained. Miotics and sympathomimetics result in altered focus; therefore, patients need to be cautious in navigating their surroundings. Information about instilling ocular medication and preventing systemic absorption with punctal occlusion is described in the section on ophthalmic medications.

Nurses in all settings encounter patients with glaucoma. Even patients with long-standing disease and those with glaucoma as a secondary diagnosis should be assessed for knowledge level and compliance with the therapeutic regimen. Chart 58-4 contains points to review with glaucoma patients.

\section*{CONTINUING GLAUCOMA CARE AT HOME}

For patients with severe glaucoma and impaired function, referral to services that assist the patient in performing customary activities may be needed. The loss of peripheral vision impairs mobility the most. These patients need to be referred to lowvision and rehabilitation services. Patients who meet the criteria for legal blindness should be offered referrals to agencies that assist in obtaining federal assistance.

Reassurance and emotional support are important aspects of care. A lifelong disease involving a possible loss of sight has psychological, physical, social, and vocational ramifications. The

family must be integrated into the plan of care, and because the disease has a familial tendency, family members should be encouraged to undergo examinations at least once every 2 years to detect glaucoma early.

\section*{Cataracts}

A cataract is a lens opacity or cloudiness (Fig. 58-9). Cataracts rank only behind arthritis and heart disease as a leading cause of disability in older adults. Cataracts affect nearly 20.5 million Americans who are 40 years of age or older, or about one in every six people in this age range. By age 80, more than half of all Americans have cataracts. According to the World Health Organization, cataract is the leading cause of blindness in the world (Preshel \& Prevent Blindness America, 2002).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Cataracts can develop in one or both eyes at any age for a variety of causes (Chart 58-5). Visual impairment normally progresses at the same rate in both eyes over many years or in a matter of months. The three most common types of senile (age-related) cataracts are defined by their location in the lens: nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular. The extent of visual impairment depends on the size, density, and location in the lens. More than one type can be present in one eye.

A nuclear cataract is associated with myopia (ie, nearsightedness), which worsens when the cataract progresses. If dense, the cataract severely blurs vision. Periodic changes in prescription eyeglasses help manage this problem.

A cortical cataract involves the anterior, posterior, or equatorial cortex of the lens. A cataract in the equator or periphery of the cortex does not interfere with the passage of light through the center of the lens and has little effect on vision. Cortical cataracts progress at a highly variable rate. Vision is worse in very bright light. Studies show that people with the highest levels of sunlight exposure have twice the risk of developing cortical cataracts than those with low-level sunlight exposure (West et al., 1998).

Posterior subcapsular cataracts occur in front of the posterior capsule. This type typically develops in younger people and, in some cases, is associated with prolonged corticosteroid use, inflammation, or trauma. Near vision is diminished, and the eye is increasingly sensitive to glare from bright light (eg, sunlight, headlights).

\section*{Risk Factors for Cataract Formation}

\section*{Aging}
- Loss of lens transparency
- Clumping or aggregation of lens protein (which leads to light scattering)
- Accumulation of a yellow-brown pigment due to the breakdown of lens protein
- Decreased oxygen uptake
- Increase in sodium and calcium
- Decrease in levels of vitamin C, protein, and glutathione (an antioxidant)

\section*{Associated Ocular Conditions}
- Retinitis pigmentosa
- Myopia
- Retinal detachment and retinal surgery
- Infection (eg, herpes zoster, uveitis)

\section*{Toxic Factors}
- Corticosteroids, especially at high doses and in long-term use
- Alkaline chemical eye burns, poisoning
- Cigarette smoking
- Calcium, copper, iron, gold, silver, and mercury, which tend to deposit in the pupillary area of the lens

\section*{Nutritional Factors}
- Reduced levels of antioxidants
- Poor nutrition
- Obesity

\section*{Physical Factors}
- Dehydration associated with chronic diarrhea, use of purgatives in anorexia nervosa, and use of hyperbaric oxygenation
- Blunt trauma, perforation of the lens with a sharp object or foreign body, electric shock
- Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight and x-ray

\section*{Systemic Diseases and Syndromes}
- Diabetes mellitus
- Down syndrome
- Disorders related to lipid metabolism
- Renal disorders
- Musculoskeletal disorders

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Painless, blurry vision is characteristic of cataracts. The patient perceives that surroundings are dimmer, as if glasses need cleaning. Light scattering is common, and the individual experiences reduced contrast sensitivity, sensitivity to glare, and reduced visual acuity. Other effects include myopic shift, astigmatism, monocular diplopia (ie, double vision), color shift (ie, the aging lens becomes progressively more absorbent at the blue end of the spectrum), brunescens (ie, color values shift to yellow-brown), and reduced light transmission.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Decreased visual acuity is directly proportionate to cataract density. The Snellen visual acuity test, ophthalmoscopy, and slitlamp biomicroscopic examination are used to establish the degree of cataract formation. The degree of lens opacity does not always correlate with the patient's functional status. Some patients can perform normal activities despite clinically significant cataracts. Others with less lens opacification have a disproportionate de-
crease in visual acuity; hence, visual acuity is an imperfect measure of visual impairment.

\section*{Medical Management}

No nonsurgical treatment cures cataracts. Ongoing studies are investigating ways to slow cataract progression, such as intake of antioxidants (eg, vitamin C, beta-carotene, vitamin E) (Age-Related Eye Disease Research Study Group, 2001). In the early stages of cataract development, glasses, contact lenses, strong bifocals, or magnifying lenses may improve vision. Reducing glare with proper light and appropriate lighting can facilitate reading. Mydriatics can be used as short-term treatment to dilate the pupil and allow more light to reach the retina, although this increases glare.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Fewer than 15\% of people with cataracts suffer vision problems severe enough to require surgery. In general, if reduced vision from cataract does not interfere with normal activities, surgery may not be needed. However, in deciding when cataract surgery is to be performed, the patient's functional and visual status should be a primary consideration. Surgery is performed on an outpatient basis and usually takes less than 1 hour, with the patient being discharged in 30 minutes or less afterward. Although complications from cataract surgery are uncommon, they can have significant effects on vision (Table 58-6). Restoration of visual function through a safe and minimally invasive procedure is the surgical goal, which is achieved with advances in topical anesthesia, smaller wound incision (ie, clear cornea incision), and lens design (ie, foldable and more accurate intraocular lens measurements).

Topical anesthesia, such as lidocaine gel applied to the surface of the eye, eliminates the hazards of regional anesthesia, such as ocular perforation, retrobulbar hemorrhage, optic injuries, diplopia, and ptosis, and is ideal for patients receiving anticoagulants. Moreover, patients can communicate and cooperate during surgery.

When both eyes have cataracts, one eye is treated first, with at least several weeks, preferably months, separating the two operations. Because cataract surgery is performed to improve visual functioning, the delay for the other eye gives time for the patient and the surgeon to evaluate whether the results from the first surgery are adequate enough to preclude the need for a second operation. The delay also provides time for the first eye to recover; if there are any complications, the surgeon may decide to perform the second procedure differently.

Intracapsular Cataract Extraction. From the late 1800s until the 1970s, the technique of choice for cataract extraction was intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE). The entire lens (ie, nucleus, cortex, and capsule) is removed, and fine sutures close the incision. ICCE is infrequently performed today; however, it is indicated when there is a need to remove the entire lens, such as with a subluxated cataract (ie, partially or completely dislocated lens).

Extracapsular Surgery. Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) achieves the intactness of smaller incisional wounds (less trauma to the eye) and maintenance of the posterior capsule of the lens, reducing postoperative complications, particularly aphakic retinal detachment and cystoid macular edema. In ECCE, a portion of the anterior capsule is removed, allowing extraction of the lens nucleus and cortex. The posterior capsule and zonular support are left intact. An intact zonular-capsular diaphragm provides the needed safe anchor for the posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL). After the pupil has been dilated and the surgeon has made

Chronic endophthalmitis

May result in loss of vitreous
Extrusion of intraocular contents from the eye or opposition of retinal surfaces

Characterized by marked visual loss, pain, lid edema, hypopyon, corneal haze, and chemosis

Toxic reactions or mechanical injury from broken or loose sutures

Results in astigmatism, sensitivity to glare, or appearance of halos
Persistent, low-grade inflammation and granuloma

Visual acuity is diminished.

Emergent lateral canthotomy (slitting of the canthus) is performed to stop central retinal perfusion when the IOP is dangerously elevated. If this procedure fails to reduce IOP, a puncture of the anterior chamber with removal of fluid is considered. The patient must be closely monitored for at least a few hours. Postponement of cataract surgery for 2 to 4 weeks is advised. Complications such as iris prolapse, vitreous loss, and choroidal hemorrhage could result in a catastrophic visual outcome.

Anterior vitrectomy is required if vitreous loss occurs. Closure of the incision and administration of a hyperosmotic agent to reduce IOP or corticosteroids to reduce intraocular inflammation. Vitrectomy is performed 1 to 2 weeks later. Visual prognosis is poor; some useful vision may be salvaged on rare occasions.

Managed by aggressive antibiotic therapy. Broadspectrum antibiotics are administered while awaiting culture and sensitivity results. Once results are obtained, the appropriate antibiotics are administered via intravitreal injection. Corticosteroid therapy is also administered.

Suture removal relieves the symptoms. Topical corticosteroids are used when the incision is not healed and sutures cannot be removed.
Miotics are used for mild cases, whereas IOL removal and replacement is necessary for severe cases.
Corticosteroids and antibiotics are administered systemically. If the condition persists, removal of the IOL and capsular bag, vitrectomy, and intravitreal injection of antibiotics are required.
YAG laser is used to create a hole in the posterior capsule. Blurred vision is cleared immediately.
a small incision on the upper edge of the cornea, a viscoelastic substance (clear gel) is injected into the space between the cornea and the lens. This prevents the space from collapsing and facilitates insertion of the IOL.

Phacoemulsification. This method of extracapsular surgery uses an ultrasonic device that liquefies the nucleus and cortex, which are then suctioned out through a tube. The posterior capsule is left intact. Because the incision is even smaller than the standard ECCE, the wound heals more rapidly, and there is early stabilization of refractive error and less astigmatism. Hardware and software advances in ultrasonic technology-including new phaco needles that are used to cut and aspirate the cataractpermit safe and efficient removal of nearly all cataracts through a clear cornea incision that is as small or smaller than required for available foldable lenses. Ultimately, advances in technology will achieve an injectable IOL.

Lens Replacement. After removal of the crystalline lens, the patient is referred to as aphakic (ie, without lens). The lens, which focuses light on the retina, must be replaced for the patient to see clearly. There are three lens replacement options: aphakic eyeglasses, contact lenses, and IOL implants.

Aphakic glasses are effective but heavy. Objects are magnified by $25 \%$, making them appear closer than they actually are. Objects are magnified unequally, creating distortion. Peripheral vision is also limited, and binocular vision (ie, ability of both eyes to focus on one object and fuse the two images into one) is impossible if the other eye is phakic (normal).

Contact lenses provide patients with almost normal vision, but because contact lenses need to be removed occasionally, the patient also needs a pair of aphakic glasses. Contact lenses are not advised for patients who have difficulty inserting, removing, and cleaning them. Frequent handling and improper disinfection increase the risk for infection.

Insertion of IOLs during cataract surgery is the usual approach to lens replacement. After ICCE, the surgeon implants an anterior chamber IOL in front of the iris. Posterior chamber lenses, generally used in ECCE, are implanted behind the iris. ECCE and posterior chamber IOLs are associated with a relatively low incidence of complications (eg, hyphema, macular edema, secondary glaucoma, damage to the corneal endothelium). IOL implantation is contraindicated in patients with recurrent uveitis, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, or rubeosis iridis. Like any device, IOLs can malfunction and cause complications.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with cataracts should receive the usual preoperative care for ambulatory surgical patients undergoing eye surgery. According to the study on Medical Testing for Cataract Surgery, routine preoperative testing before cataract surgery does not improve health or clinical outcomes. Hence, the standard battery of preoperative tests should be prescribed only when they would have been indicated by the patient's medical history (Schein et al., 2000).

\section*{PROVIDING PREOPERATIVE CARE}

To reduce the risk for retrobulbar hemorrhage (after retrobulbar injection), any anticoagulation therapy that the patient is receiving is withheld, if medically appropriate. Aspirin should be withheld for 5 to 7 days, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for 3 to 5 days, and warfarin (Coumadin) until the prothrombin time of 1.5 is almost reached.

Dilating drops are administered every 10 minutes for four doses at least 1 hour before surgery. Additional dilating drops may be administered in the operating room (immediately before surgery) if the affected eye is not fully dilated. Antibiotic, corticosteroid, and NSAID drops may be administered prophylactically to prevent postoperative infection and inflammation.

\section*{PROVIDING POSTOPERATIVE CARE}

After recovery from anesthesia, the patient receives verbal and written instruction regarding how to protect the eye, administer medications, recognize signs of complications, and obtain emergency care. Activities to be avoided are identified in Chart 58-6. The nurse also explains that there is minimal discomfort after surgery and in-
structs the patient to take a mild analgesic agent, such as acetaminophen, as needed. Antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and corticosteroid eye drops or ointments are prescribed postoperatively. A clinical pathway for the care of patients undergoing ambulatory cataract surgery is presented in Appendix A at the end of the book.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. To prevent accidental rubbing or poking of the eye, the patient wears a protective eye patch for 24 hours after surgery, followed by eyeglasses worn during the day and a metal shield worn at night for 1 to 4 weeks. The nurse instructs the patient and family in applying and caring for the eye shield. Sunglasses should be worn while outdoors during the day because the eye is sensitive to light.

Slight morning discharge, some redness, and a scratchy feeling may be expected for a few days. A clean, damp washcloth may be used to remove slight morning eye discharge. Because cataract surgery increases the risk for retinal detachment, the patient must know to notify the surgeon if new floaters (ie, dots) in vision, flashing lights, decrease in vision, pain, or increase in redness occurs.

Continuing Care. The eye patch is removed after the first followup appointment. Patients may experience blurring of vision for several days to weeks. Sutures left in the eye alter the curvature of the cornea, resulting in temporary blurring and some astigmatism. Vision gradually improves as the eye heals. Patients with IOL implants have visual improvement faster than those waiting for aphakic glasses or contact lenses. Vision is stabilized when the eye is completely healed, usually within 6 to 12 weeks, when final corrective prescription is completed. Visual correction is needed for any remaining nearsightedness or farsightedness (even in patients with IOL implants).

\section*{Corneal Disorders}

\section*{CORNEAL DYSTROPHIES}

Corneal dystrophies are inherited as autosomal dominant traits and manifest when the person is about 20 years of age. They are characterized by deposits in the corneal layers. Decreased vision
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-264.jpg?height=821&width=1783&top_left_y=1789&top_left_x=109)
is caused by the irregular corneal surface and corneal deposits. Corneal endothelial decompensation leads to corneal edema and blurring of vision. Persistent edema leads to bullous keratopathy, which is formation of blisters that cause pain and discomfort on rupturing. This condition is usually associated with primary openangle glaucoma.

A bandage contact lens is used to flatten the bullae, protect the exposed corneal nerve endings, and relieve discomfort. Symptomatic treatments, such as hypertonic drops or ointment ( $5 \%$ sodium chloride), may reduce epithelial edema; lowering the IOP also reduces stromal edema. Penetrating keratoplasty has a high success rate in advanced cases (see "Corneal Surgeries"). For diffuse bullous keratopathy, amniotic membrane transplantation may become the procedure of choice for patients with limited visual potential (Rapuano, 2000).

\section*{KERATOCONUS}

Keratoconus is a condition characterized by a conical protuberance of the cornea with progressive thinning on protrusion and irregular astigmatism. The hereditary condition has a higher incidence among women. Onset occurs at puberty; the condition may progress for more than 20 years and is bilateral. Corneal scarring occurs in severe cases. Blurred vision is a prominent symptom. Rigid, gas-permeable contact lenses correct irregular astigmatism and improve vision. Advances in contact lens design have reduced the need for surgery. Penetrating keratoplasty is indicated when contact lens correction is no longer effective.

\section*{CORNEAL SURGERIES}

Among the surgical procedures used to treat diseased corneal tissue are phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) and keratoplasty.

\section*{Phototherapeutic Keratectomy}

PTK is a laser procedure that is used to treat diseased corneal tissue by removing or reducing corneal opacities and smoothing the anterior corneal surface to improve functional vision. PTK is a safer, more effective (when indicated) alternative than penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty. PTK is contraindicated in patients with active herpetic keratitis because the ultraviolet rays may reactivate latent virus. Common side effects are induced hyperopia and stromal haze. Complications are delayed re-epithelialization (particularly in patients with diabetes) and bacterial keratitis. Postoperative management consists of oral analgesics for eye pain. Re-epithelialization is promoted with a pressure patch or therapeutic soft contact lens. Antibiotic and corticosteroid ointment and NSAIDs are prescribed postoperatively. Follow-up examinations are required for up to 2 years.

\section*{Keratoplasty}

Keratoplasty (ie, corneal transplantation or corneal grafting) involves replacing abnormal host tissue with a healthy donor corneal tissue. Common indications are keratoconus, corneal dystrophy, corneal scarring from herpes simplex keratitis, and chemical burns.

Several factors affect the success of the graft: ocular structures (eg, lids, conjunctiva), tear film function, adequacy of blinking, and viability of the donor endothelium. Tissue that is the possible source of disease transmission from donor to recipient or
cornea with functionally compromised endothelium is typically not used for grafting (Chart 58-7), nor is corneal tissue used from donors who have undergone laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) because the cornea is no longer intact. Conditions such as glaucoma, retinal disease, and strabismus (ie, deviation in ocular alignment) can negatively influence the outcome. Promising experimental therapies include stem cell transplants (Rongé, 2001) and autologous limbal epithelial cell transplants (Tsai et al., 2000).

The surgeon determines the graft size before the procedure, and the appropriate size is marked on the surface of the cornea. The surgeon prepares the donor cornea and the recipient bed, removes the diseased cornea, places the donor cornea on the recipient bed, and sutures it in place. Sutures remain in place for 12 to 18 months. Potential complications include early graft failure due to poor quality of donor tissue, surgical trauma, acute infection, and persistently increased IOP and late graft failure due to rejection.

Postoperatively, the patient receives mydriatic medications (2 weeks) and topical corticosteroids (12 months; daily doses for 6 months and tapered doses thereafter). Patients typically describe a sensation of postoperative eye discomfort rather than acute pain.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse reinforces the surgeon's recommendations and instructions regarding visual rehabilitation and visual improvement by explaining why a technically successful graft may initially produce disappointing results because the procedure has produced a new optical surface and only after several months do patients start seeing the natural and true colors of their environment. Correction of a resultant refractive error with eyeglasses or contact lenses determines the final visual outcome. The nurse assesses the patient's support system and his or her ability to comply with longterm follow-up, which includes frequent clinic visits for several months for tapering of topical corticosteroid therapy, selective suture removal, and ongoing evaluation of the graft site and visual
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-265.jpg?height=94&width=127&top_left_y=1768&top_left_x=1132)

acuity. The nurse also initiates appropriate referral to community services when indicated.

Because graft failure is an ophthalmic emergency that can occur at any time, the primary goal of nursing care is to teach the patient to identify signs and symptoms of graft failure. The early symptoms are blurred vision, discomfort, tearing, or redness of the eye. Decreased vision results after graft destruction. Patients must contact the ophthalmologist as soon as symptoms occur. Treatment of graft rejection is prompt administration of hourly topical corticosteroids and periocular corticosteroid injections. Systemic immunosuppressive agents may be necessary for severe, resistant cases.

\section*{REFRACTIVE SURGERIES}

Refractive surgeries are cosmetic, elective procedures performed to reshape corneal tissue and correct refractive errors so that eyeglasses or contact lenses are no longer needed. Current procedures include radial keratotomy, photorefactive keratectomy (PFK), and LASIK.

Refractive surgery alters the major optical function of the eye and thereby carries certain surgical risks. The patient must fully understand benefits, potential risks and complications, common side effects, and limitations of the procedure. Refractive surgery does not alter the normal aging process of the eye. If the reason for the procedure is occupational vision requirements, the results must satisfy both the patient and the employer. Precise visual outcome cannot be guaranteed with certainty. Typically, patients must be at least 18 years of age.

The corneal structure must be normal and refractive error stable. Patients are required to discontinue using contact lenses for a period before the procedure (ie, 2 to 3 weeks for soft lenses and 4 weeks for hard lenses). Patients with conditions that are likely to adversely affect corneal wound healing (eg, corticosteroid use, immunosuppression, elevated IOP) are not good candidates for the procedure. Any superficial eye disease must be diagnosed and fully treated before a refractive procedure.

\section*{Radial Keratotomy}

Radial keratotomy (RK) is indicated for low myopia (less than 8D). The procedure involves making four to eight, deep, radial incisions in the paracentral and peripheral cornea with a metal or diamond blade. The corneal contour then becomes flatter. Glare, photosensitivity, fluctuations of vision during the day, and occasional diplopia are common side effects. As the popularity of laser refractive surgery grows, RK procedures decrease.

\section*{Laser Vision Correction Photorefractive Keratectomy}

Laser vision correction photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a procedure used to treat myopia and hyperopia with or without astigmatism. The $193-\mathrm{mm}$ argon fluoride excimer laser is applied directly to the cornea according to carefully calculated measurements. For myopia, the relative curvature is decreased; for hyperopia, the relative curvature is increased. A bandage contact lens is placed over the cornea to promote epithelial healing and reduce pain similar to that of severe corneal abrasion. PRK requires a longer visual recovery period than RK, but PRK provides more predictable and stable results. Except for the side effect of corneal haze and night vision problems, PRK has not
been associated with the two major disadvantages of RK: hyperopic drift and weakening of the structural integrity of the cornea.

\section*{Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK)}

An improvement over PRK, particularly for correcting high (severe) myopia, LASIK involves flattening the anterior curvature of the cornea by removing a stromal lamella or layer. The surgeon creates a corneal flap with a microkeratome, which is an automatic corneal shaper similar to a carpenter's plane. The surgeon retracts a flap of corneal tissue less than one third of the thickness of a human hair to access the corneal stroma and then uses the excimer laser on the stromal bed to reshape the cornea according to calculated measurements (Fig. 58-10). The corneal flap, a naturally adhering bandage, is rolled back and repositioned. LASIK also appears to be an effective, predictable, stable, and safe procedure for correcting residual myopia after cataract surgery (Ayala et al., 2001).

LASIK causes less postoperative discomfort, has fewer side effects, and is safer than PRK. The patient has no corneal haze and requires less postoperative care. With LASIK, however, the cornea has been invaded at a deeper level, and any complications are more significant than those that can occur with PRK.

\section*{PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS}

Ablation-Related Complications. Ablation complications of LASIK include an elevated area within the corneal treatment ablation zone (ie, central island). Signs and symptoms of this complication include ghosting, blurred vision, halo formation around lights, decreased visual activity, and contrast sensitivity in low light. Most of the island formations resolve over time; reablation is considered only after the island appears stable after repeated examinations for at least 3 months.

Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis. As LASIK increases in popularity and is performed more often, the vision-threatening complication known as diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK) is reported more often. DLK is a peculiar, noninfectious, inflammatory reaction in the lamellar interface after LASIK. DLK is characterized by a white, granular, diffuse, culture-negative lamellar keratitis occurring in

FIGURE 58-10 LASIK combines delicate surgical procedures and laser treatment. A flap is surgically created and lifted to one side. A laser is then applied to the cornea to reshape it. With permission from The Wilmer Laser Vision Center, Lutherville, MD.
the first week after surgery. Studies suggest that, because no single agent appears to be solely the cause of DLK, the cause is multifactorial (Holland et. al., 2000).

DLK is diagnosed by identifying cells in the lamellar interface by slit-lamp examination from postoperative day 1. Depending on the severity of the condition, treatment methods range from administering corticosteroid drops to intervening surgically.

Central Islands and Decentered Ablations. Decentered or eccentric ablation involves a shift of the center of the ablation pattern from the pupil or visual axis to a more eccentric location. Symptoms include decreased visual acuity, halos, glare, and ghosting, especially in low-light settings.

\section*{LASIK Enhancements}

LASIK enhancements are surgical options from improved technology and software used to treat a wider range of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism in eyes with a history of LASIK surgery. Astigmatic keratotomy continues to work well for patients with significant regular astigmatism. A newer procedure, Intacs implantation, is performed for patients left with significant myopia but who have thin corneas. Hyperopic excimer laser enhancements are indicated for patients who have undergone myopic LASIK and have consecutive hyperopia.

\section*{IMPLANTABLE DEVICES}

Because the results of refractive surgery on high (severe) myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism are less predictable, there has been increasing interest in the use of phakic IOLs. Anterior and posterior chamber IOLs are now in use, and design improvements continue to be made. Phakic IOL implantation does not compromise the central optical zone and retains the normal aspheric contour of the cornea. Most importantly, it is reversible. Early research results on vision quality favor phakic IOL over LASIK. Potential complications include cataract, iritis or uveitis, endothelial cell loss, and increased IOP.

Intacs is an implantable intrastromal corneal ring used to correct mild to moderate myopia. The intrastromal corneal ring segments are placed in the corneal stroma outside of the central optical zone and reshape the anterior surface of the cornea.

\section*{Management}

Patient satisfaction is the ultimate goal; therefore, patient education and counseling about potential risks, complications, and postoperative follow-up are critical. Minimal postoperative care includes topical corticosteroid drops. The length of postoperative follow-up depends on the refractive procedure, with PRK requiring a longer course, followed by RK and then LASIK.

\section*{Retinal Disorders}

Although the retina is composed of multiple microscopic layers, the two innermost layers, the sensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), are the most relevant to common retinal disorders. Just as the film in a camera captures an image, so does the retina, the neural tissue of the eye. The rods and cones, the photoreceptor cells, are found in the sensory layer of the retina. Beneath the sensory layer lies the RPE, the pigmented layer. When the rods and cones are stimulated by light, an electrical impulse is generated, and the image is transmitted to the brain.

\section*{RETINAL DETACHMENT}

Retinal detachment refers to the separation of the RPE from the sensory layer. The four types of retinal detachment are rhegmatogenous, traction, a combination of rhegmatogenous and traction, and exudative. Rhegmatogenous detachment is the most common form. In this condition, a hole or tear develops in the sensory retina, allowing some of the liquid vitreous to seep through the sensory retina and detach it from the RPE (Fig. 58-11). People at risk for this type of detachment include those with high myopia or aphakia after cataract surgery. Trauma may also play a role in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Between 5\% and $10 \%$ of all rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are associated with proliferative retinopathy, a retinopathy associated with diabetic neovascularization (see Chap. 41).

Tension, or a pulling force, is responsible for traction retinal detachment. An ophthalmologist must ascertain all of the areas of retinal break and identify and release the scars or bands of fibrous material providing traction on the retina. Generally, patients with this condition have developed fibrous scar tissue from conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, or the retinopathy of prematurity. The hemorrhages and fibrous proliferation associated with these conditions exert a pulling force on the delicate retina.

Patients can have both rhegmatogenous and traction retinal detachment. Exudative retinal detachments are the result of the production of a serous fluid under the retina from the choroid. Conditions such as uveitis and macular degeneration may cause the production of this serous fluid.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients may report the sensation of a shade or curtain coming across the vision of one eye, cobwebs, bright flashing lights, or the sudden onset of a great number of floaters. Patients do not complain of pain.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

After visual acuity is determined, the patient must have a dilated fundus examination using an indirect ophthalmoscope and a Goldmann three-mirror examination. This examination is detailed

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-267.jpg?height=731&width=840&top_left_y=1826&top_left_x=1121}

\end{figure}
and prolonged, and it can be very uncomfortable for the patient. Many patients describe this as looking directly into the sun. All retinal breaks, all fibrous bands that may be causing traction on the retina, and all degenerative changes must be identified. A detailed retinal drawing is made by the ophthalmologist.

\section*{Surgical Management}

In rhegmatogenous detachment, an attempt is made to reattach the sensory retina to the RPE surgically. The retinal surgeon compresses the sclera (often with a scleral buckle or a silicone band; Fig. 58-12) to indent the scleral wall from the outside of the eye and bring the two retinal layers in contact with each other. Gas bubbles, silicone oil, or perfluorocarbon and liquids may also be injected into the vitreous cavity to help push the sensory retina up against the RPE. Argon laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy is also used to "spot-weld" small holes.

In traction retinal detachment, a vitrectomy is performed. A vitrectomy is an intraocular procedure in which 1 - to $4-\mathrm{mm}$ incisions are made at the pans plana. One incision allows the introduction of a light source (ie, endoilluminator), and another incision serves as the portal for the vitrectomy instrument. The surgeon dissects preretinal membranes under direct visualization while the retina is stabilized by an intraoperative vitreous substitute. Technologic advances, including the use of operating microscopes, microinstrumentation, irrigating contact lenses, and instruments that combine vitreous cutting, aspiration, and illumination capabilities into one device, have allowed tremendous progress in vitreoretinal surgery. The techniques of vitreoretinal surgery can be used in various procedures, including the removal of foreign bodies, vitreous opacities such as blood, and dislocated lenses. Traction on the retina may be relieved through vitrectomy and may be combined with scleral buckling to repair retinal breaks. Treatment of macular holes includes vitrectomy, laser photocoagulation, air-fluid-gas exchanges, and the use of growth factor.

\section*{Nursing Management}

For the most part, nursing interventions consist of educating the patient and providing supportive care.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-268.jpg?height=760&width=845&top_left_y=1797&top_left_x=112}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 58-12 Scleral buckle.}
\end{figure}

\section*{PROMOTING COMFORT}

If gas tamponade is used to flatten the retina, the patient may have to be specially positioned to make the gas bubble float into the best position. Some patients must lie face down or on their side for days. Patients and family members should be made aware of these special needs beforehand, so that the patient can be made as comfortable as possible.

\section*{TEACHING ABOUT COMPLICATIONS}

In many cases, vitreoretinal procedures are performed on an outpatient basis, and the patient is seen the next day for a follow-up examination and closely monitored thereafter as required. Postoperative complications in these patients may include increased IOP, endophthalmitis, development of other retinal detachments, development of cataracts, and loss of turgor of the eye. Patients must be taught the signs and symptoms of complications, particularly of increasing IOP and postoperative infection.

\section*{RETINAL VASCULAR DISORDERS}

Loss of vision can occur from occlusion of a retinal artery or vein. Such occlusions may result from atherosclerosis, cardiac valvular disease, venous stasis, hypertension, or increased blood viscosity.

\section*{Central Retinal Vein Occlusion}

Blood supply to and from the ocular fundus is provided by the central retinal artery and vein. Patients who have suffered a central retinal vein occlusion report decreased visual acuity, which may range from mild blurring to vision that is limited to only hand-motion vision.

Direct ophthalmoscopy of the retina shows optic disc swelling, venous dilation and tortuousness, retinal hemorrhages, cottonwool spots, and a "blood and thunder" (extremely bloody) appearance of the retina. The better the initial visual acuity, the better the general prognosis.

Fluorescein angiography may show extensive areas of capillary closure. The patient should be monitored carefully over the ensuing several months for signs of neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma. Laser panretinal photocoagulation may be necessary to treat the abnormal neovascularization. Neovascularization of the iris may cause neovascular glaucoma, which may be difficult to control.

\section*{Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion}

Some patients with branch retinal vein occlusions are symptom free, whereas others complain of a sudden loss of vision if the macular area is involved. A more gradual loss of vision may occur if macular edema associated with the branch retinal vein occlusion develops.

On examination, the ocular fundus appears similar to that found with central retinal vein occlusion; however, only those portions of the retina affected by the obstructive veins have what is known as a "blood and thunder" appearance. The diagnostic evaluation and follow-up assessments are the same as for central retinal vein occlusion. Potential complications are similar. Potential associated conditions include glaucoma, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hyperviscosity syndrome.

\section*{Central Retinal Artery Occlusion}

The patient with central retinal artery occlusion presents with a sudden loss of vision. Visual acuity is reduced to counting the examiner's fingers, or the field of vision is tremendously restricted. A relative afferent pupillary defect is present. Examination of the ocular fundus reveals a pale retina with a cherry-red spot at the fovea. The retinal arteries are thin, and emboli are occasionally seen in the central retinal artery or its branches. Central retinal artery occlusion is a true ocular emergency. Various treatments are used, including ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, intravenous administration of hyperosmotic agents such as acetazolamide, and high concentrations of oxygen.

\section*{MACULAR DEGENERATION}

Macular degeneration is the most common cause of visual loss in people older than age 60 (Margolis et al., 2002). Commonly called age-related macular degeneration (AMD), it is characterized by tiny, yellowish spots called drusen (Fig. 58-13) beneath the retina. Most people older than 60 years of age have at least a few small drusen. There is a wide range of visual loss in patients with macular degeneration, but most patients do not experience total blindness. Central vision is generally the most affected, with most patients retaining peripheral vision (Fig. 58-14). There are two types of AMD, commonly known as the dry type and wet type.

Between $85 \%$ and $90 \%$ of people with AMD have the dry or nonexudative type in which the outer layers of the retina slowly break down (Fig. 58-15). With this breakdown comes the appearance of drusen. When the drusen occur outside of the macular area, patients generally have no symptoms. When the drusen occur within the macula, there is a gradual blurring of vision that patients may notice when they try to read. There is no known treatment that can slow or cure this type of AMD.

The second type of AMD, the wet or exudative type, may have an abrupt onset. Patients complain that straight lines appear crooked and distorted or that letters in words appear broken up. This effect results from proliferation of abnormal blood vessels growing under the retina, within the choroid layer of the eye, a condition known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The affected vessels can leak fluid and blood, elevating the retina. Some patients can be treated with the laser to stop the leakage from these vessels. This treatment is not ideal because vision may

be affected by the laser treatment and abnormal vessels often grow back after treatment.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY}

Visual loss from CNV lesions in AMD is a growing problem. With the growth of these new vessels from the choriocapillar layer, fibrous tissue develops that can, over months, destroy central vision. Laser treatment has been used to close these abnormal vessels, but the very process of photocoagulation carries with it some level of retinal destruction, albeit less than the natural scarring that would occur in the untreated eye. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed in an attempt to ameliorate the CNV while causing minimal damage to the retina. The Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration With Photodynamic Therapy (TAP) study group (1999) has shown that PDT can reduce the risk of visual loss for certain groups of patients who have classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due to macular degeneration.

PDT is a two-step process (Fig. 58-16). Verteporfin, a photosensitive dye, is infused intravenously over 10 minutes. Fifteen minutes after the start of the infusion, a diode laser is used to treat the abnormal network of vessels. The dye within the vessels takes up the energy of the diode laser, but the surrounding retina does not, avoiding damage to adjacent areas. Retreatment may be necessary over time.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management is primarily educational. Verteporfin is a light-activated dye, and patient education is important preoperatively. The patient should be instructed to bring dark sunglasses, gloves, a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, and slacks to the PDT setting. The patient must be cautioned to avoid exposure to direct sunlight or bright light for 5 days after treatment. The dye within the blood vessels near the surface of the skin could become activated with exposure to strong light. This would include bright sunlight, tanning booths, halogen lights, and the bright lights used in dental offices and operating rooms. Ordinary indoor light is not a problem. If a patient must go outdoors within the first 5 days after treatment, he or she should be counseled to wear

\end{figure}
long-sleeved shirts and slacks made of tightly woven fabrics. Gloves, shoes, socks, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat should also be worn if the patient has to go outdoors during daylight hours during this period. Inadvertent sunlight exposure can lead to severe blistering of the skin and sunburn that may require plastic surgery.

\section*{Macular Translocation}

Wet macular degeneration is characterized by the development of an abnormal CNV membrane to the detriment of central vision. One approach to this problem is the surgical procedure known as macular translocation, in which a 360 -degree retinal detachment is surgically created and the retina is gently lifted and resettled, placing the macular area a slight distance away from the
area of CNV. Laser treatment can then be applied to the abnormal neovascular network with minimal damage occurring to the macula. Pilot studies are evaluating whether this surgical approach is an effective alternative to laser treatments of CNV due to AMD.

\section*{Angiogenesis}

An important component of the effort against neovascular AMD is the investigation into the causes of the development and progression of angiogenesis (ie, abnormal blood vessel formation). Investigations continue in the laboratory to search for agents that can inhibit angiogenesis. This has implications for ocular neovascularization and treatment of other disorders such as solid tumors.

\section*{Management}

Most patients benefit from the use of bright lighting and magnification devices and from referral to a low-vision center. Some low-vision centers send representatives into the patient's home or place of employment to evaluate the living and working conditions and make recommendations to improve lighting, thereby improving vision and promoting safety. The home care nurse can make the same assessment and recommendations.

Amsler grids are given to patients to use in their home to monitor for a sudden onset or distortion of vision. These may provide the earliest sign that macular degeneration is getting worse. Patients should be encouraged to use these grids and to look at them, one eye at a time, several times each week with glasses on. If there is a change in the grid (eg, if the lines or squares appear distorted or faded), the patient should be instructed to notify the ophthalmologist immediately and to arrange to be seen promptly.

The Age-Related Eye Disease Study Group (2001), a multicenter clinical trial, has provided promising information about the prevention and treatment of AMD. The study was designed
to determine whether large doses of macronutrients are effective in preventing or slowing the course of AMD. The study revealed that use of antioxidants (ie, vitamin C, vitamin E, and betacarotene) and minerals (ie, zinc oxide) can slow the progression of AMD and vision loss for people at high risk for developing advanced AMD.

\section*{Orbital and OcularTrauma}

Whether affecting the eye or the orbit, trauma to the eye and surrounding structures may have devastating consequences for vision. It is preferable to prevent injury rather than treat it. Chart 58-8 details safety measures to prevent orbital and ocular trauma.

\section*{ORBITAL TRAUMA}

Injury to the orbit is usually associated with a head injury; hence, the patient's general medical condition must first be stabilized before conducting an ocular examination. Only then is the globe assessed for soft tissue injury. During inspection, the face is meticulously assessed for underlying fractures, which should always be suspected in cases of blunt trauma. To establish the extent of ocular injury, visual acuity is assessed as soon as possible, even if it is only a rough estimate. Soft tissue orbital injuries often result in damage to the optic nerve. Major ocular injuries indicated by a soft globe, prolapsing tissue, ruptured globe, hemorrhage, and loss of red reflex require immediate surgical attention.

\section*{Soft Tissue Injury and Hemorrhage}

The signs and symptoms of soft tissue injury from blunt or penetrating trauma include tenderness, ecchymosis, lid swelling, proptosis (ie, downward displacement of the eyeball), and hemorrhage. Closed injuries lead to contusions with subconjunctival hemorrhage, commonly known as a black eye. Blood accumulates in the tissues of the conjunctiva. Hemorrhage may be caused by a soft tissue injury to the eyelid or by an underlying fracture.

Management of soft tissue hemorrhage that does not threaten vision is usually conservative and consists of thorough inspection, cleansing, and repair of wounds. Cold compresses are used in the early phase, followed by warm compresses. Hematomas that appear as swollen, fluctuating areas may be surgically drained or aspirated; if they are causing significant orbital pressure, they may be surgically evacuated.

Penetrating injuries or severe blow to the head can result in severe optic nerve damage. Visual loss can be sudden or delayed and progressive. Immediate loss of vision after an ocular injury is usually irreversible. Delayed visual loss has a better prognosis. Corticosteroid therapy is indicated to reduce optic nerve swelling. Surgery, such as optic nerve decompression, may be performed.

\section*{Orbital Fractures}

Orbital fractures are detected by facial x-rays. Depending on the orbital structures involved, orbital fractures can be classified as blow-out, zygomatic or tripod, maxillary, midfacial, orbital apex, and orbital roof fractures. Blow-out fractures result from compression of soft tissue and sudden increase in orbital pressure when the force is transmitted to the orbital floor, the area of least resistance.

- Wear goggles when grinding metal or striking metal against metal while performing auto body repair.
- When using jumper cables to start the car, wear goggles; make sure the cars are not touching one another; make sure the jumper cable clamps never touch each other; never lean over the battery when attaching cables. Never attach a cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery.

\section*{In Sports}
- Wear protective safety glasses, especially for sports such as racquetball, squash, tennis, baseball, and basketball.
- Wear protective caps, helmets, or face protectors when appropriate, especially for sports such as ice hockey.

\section*{Around Fireworks}
- Wear eye glasses or safety goggles.
- Do not use explosive fireworks.
- Never allow children to ignite fireworks.
- Do not stand near others when lighting fireworks.
- Do not try to relight duds. Douse them in water.

The inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, with their fat and fascial attachments, or the nerve that courses along the inferior oblique muscle may become entrapped, and the globe may be displaced inward (ie, enophthalmos). Computed tomography (CT) can firmly identify the muscle and its auxiliary structures that are entrapped. These fractures are usually caused by blunt small objects, such as a fist, knee, elbow, or tennis or golf balls.

Orbital roof fractures are dangerous because of potential complications to the brain. Surgical management of these fractures requires a neurosurgeon and an ophthalmologist. The most common indications for surgical intervention are displacement of bone fragments disfiguring the normal facial contours, interference with normal binocular vision caused by extraocular muscle entrapment, interference with mastication in zygomatic fracture, and obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. Surgery is usually nonemergent, and a period of 10 to 14 days gives the ophthalmologist time to assess ocular function, especially the extraocular muscles and the nasolacrimal duct. Emergency surgical repair is usually not performed unless the globe is displaced to the maxillary sinus. Operative repair is primarily directed at freeing the entrapped ocular structures and restoring the integrity of the orbital floor. Cosmetic surgery for deformities of the globe and enophthalmos may follow after 4 to 6 months, but successful repair is usually difficult.

\section*{Foreign Bodies}

Foreign bodies that enter the orbit are usually tolerated, except for copper, iron, and vegetable materials such as those from plants or trees, which may cause purulent infection. X-rays and

CT scans are used to identify the foreign body. Careful history taking is important, especially if the foreign body has been in the orbit for a period of time and the incident forgotten. It is important to identify metallic foreign bodies because they prohibit the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic tool.

After the extent of the orbital damage is assessed, the decision is made between conservative treatment and surgical removal. In general, orbital foreign bodies are usually removed if they are superficial and anterior in location, have sharp edges that may affect adjacent orbital structures, or are composed of copper, iron, or vegetable material. The surgical intervention is directed at prevention of further ocular injury and maintaining the integrity of the affected areas. Cultures are usually obtained, and the patient is placed on prophylactic intravenous antibiotics that are later changed to oral antibiotics.

\section*{OCULAR TRAUMA}

Ocular trauma is the leading cause of blindness among children and young adults, especially male trauma victims. The most common circumstances of ocular trauma are occupational injuries (eg, construction industry), sports (eg, baseball, basketball, racket sports, boxing), weapons (eg, air guns, BB guns), assault, motor vehicle crashes (eg, broken windshields), and war (eg, blast fragments).

For the nonophthalmic practitioner, initial intervention is performed in only two conditions: chemical burns, for which irrigation of the eye with normal saline solution or even plain tap water must occur immediately, and a foreign body, for which
absolutely no attempt is made to remove the foreign material, small or big, or apply pressure or patch to the injured eye. The eye must be protected using a metal shield, if available, or a stiff paper cup (Fig. 58-17). All traumatic eye injuries should be properly shielded.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A thorough history is obtained, particularly assessing the patient's ocular history, such as preinjury vision in the affected eye or past ocular surgery. Details related to the injury that help in the diagnosis and assessment of need for further tests include the nature of the ocular injury (ie, blunt or penetrating trauma), the type of activity causing the injury to determine the nature of the force striking the eye, and whether onset of vision loss was sudden, slow, or progressive. For chemical eye burns, the chemical agent must be identified and tested for pH if a sample is available. The corneal surface is examined for foreign bodies, wounds, and abrasions, after which the other external structures of the eye are examined. Pupillary size, shape, and light reaction of the pupil of the affected eye are compared with the other eye. Ocular motility, which is the ability of the eyes to move synchronously up, down, right, and left, is also assessed.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{SPLASH INJURIES}

Splash injuries are irrigated with normal saline solution before further evaluation. In cases of ruptured globe, cycloplegic agents (ie, agents that paralyze the ciliary muscle) or topical antibiotics must be deferred because of potential toxicity to exposed intraocular tissues. Further manipulation of the eye must be avoided until the patient is under general anesthesia. Parenteral, broadspectrum antibiotics are initiated. Tetanus antitoxin is administered, if indicated, as well as analgesics. (Tetanus prophylaxis is recommended for full-thickness ocular and skin wounds.) Any topical medication (eg, anesthetic, dyes) must be sterile.

\section*{FOREIGN BODIES AND CORNEAL ABRASIONS}

After removal of a foreign body from the surface of the eye, an antibiotic ointment is applied, and the eye is patched. The eye is examined daily for evidence of infection until the wound is completely healed.

Contact lens wear is a common cause of corneal abrasion. The patient experiences severe pain and photophobia (ie, ocular pain on exposure to light). Corneal epithelial defects are treated with antibiotic ointment and a pressure patch to immobilize the eyelids. It is of utmost importance that topical anesthetic eye drops are not given to a patient for repeated use after corneal injury because their effects mask further damage, delay healing, and can
lead to permanent corneal scarring. Corticosteroids are avoided while the epithelial defect exists.

\section*{Penetrating Injuries and Contusions of the Eyeball}

Sharp penetrating injury or blunt contusion force can rupture the eyeball. When the eye wall, cornea, and sclera rupture, rapid decompression or herniation of the orbital contents into adjacent sinuses can occur. In general, blunt traumatic injuries (with an increased incidence of retinal detachment, intraocular tissue avulsion, and herniation) have a worse prognosis than penetrating injuries. Most penetrating injuries result in marked loss of vision with the following signs: hemorrhagic chemosis (ie, edema of the conjunctiva), conjunctival laceration, shallow anterior chamber with or without an eccentrically placed pupil, hyphema (ie, hemorrhage within the chamber), or vitreous hemorrhage.

Hyphema is caused by contusion forces that tear the vessels of the iris and damage the anterior chamber angle. Preventing rebleeding and prolonged increased IOP are the goals of treatment for hyphema. In severe cases in which patient compliance is questionable, the patient is hospitalized with moderate activity restriction. An eye shield is applied. Topical corticosteroids are prescribed to reduce inflammation. An antifibrinolytic agent, aminocaproic acid (Amicar), stabilizes clot formation at the site of hemorrhage. Aspirin is contraindicated.

A ruptured globe and severe injuries with intraocular hemorrhage require surgical intervention. Vitrectomy is performed for traumatic retinal detachments. Primary enucleation (ie, complete removal of the eyeball and part of the optic nerve) is considered only if the globe is irreparable and has no light perception. It is a general rule that enucleation is performed within 2 weeks of the initial injury (in an eye that has no useful vision after sustaining penetrating injury) to prevent the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia, an inflammation created in the fellow eye by the affected eye that can result in blindness of the fellow eye.

\section*{Intraocular Foreign Bodies}

A patient who complains of blurred vision and discomfort should be questioned carefully about recent injuries and exposures. Patients may be injured in a number of different situations and suffer an intraocular foreign body (IOFB). Precipitating circumstances can include working in construction, striking metal against metal, being involved in motor vehicle crashes with facial injury, gunshot wounds, and grinding-wheel work.

IOFB is diagnosed and localized by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy, as well as CT or ultrasonography. MRI is contraindicated because most foreign bodies are metallic

and magnetic. It is important to determine the composition, size, and location of the IOFB and affected eye structures. Every effort should be made to identify the type of IOFB and whether it is magnetic. Iron, steel, copper, and vegetable matter cause intense inflammatory reactions. The incidence of endophthalmitis is also high. If the cornea is perforated, tetanus prophylaxis and intravenous antibiotics are administered. The extraction route (ie, surgical incision) of the foreign body depends on its location and composition and associated ocular injuries. Specially designed IOFB forceps and magnets are used to grasp and remove the foreign body. Any damaged area of the retina is treated to prevent retinal detachment.

\section*{OCULAR BURNS}

Alkali, acid, and other chemically active organic substances, such as mace and tear gas, cause chemical burns. Alkali burns (eg, lye, ammonia) result in the most injury because they penetrate the ocular tissues rapidly and continue to cause damage long after the initial injury is sustained. They also cause an immediate rise in IOP. Acids (eg, bleach, car batteries, refrigerant) generally cause less damage because the precipitated necrotic tissue proteins form a barrier to further penetration and damage. Chemical burns may appear as superficial punctate keratopathy (ie, spotty damage to the cornea), subconjunctival hemorrhage, or complete marbleizing of the cornea.

In treating chemical burns, every minute counts. Immediate tap-water irrigation should be started on site before transport of the patient to an emergency department. Only a brief history and examination are performed. The corneal surfaces and conjunctival fornices are immediately and copiously irrigated with normal saline or any neutral solution. A local anesthetic is instilled, and a lid speculum is applied to overcome blepharospasm (ie, spasms of the eyelid muscles that result in closure of the lids). Particulate matter must be removed from the fornices using moistened, cottontip applicators and minimal pressure on the globe. Irrigation continues until the conjunctival pH normalizes (between 7.3 and 7.6). The pH of the corneal surface is checked by placing a pH paper strip in the fornix. Antibiotics are instilled, and the eye is patched.

The goal of intermediate treatment is to prevent tissue ulceration and promote re-epithelialization. Intense lubrication using nonpreserved (ie, without preservatives to avoid allergic reactions) tears is essential. Re-epithelialization is promoted with patching or therapeutic soft lenses. The patient is usually monitored daily for several days. Prognosis depends on the type of injury and adequacy of the irrigation immediately after exposure. Long-term treatment consists of two phases: restoration of the ocular surface through grafting procedures and surgical restoration of corneal integrity and optical clarity.

Thermal injury is caused by exposure to a hot object (eg, curling iron, tobacco, ash), whereas photochemical injury results from ultraviolet irradiation or infrared exposure (eg, exposure to the reflections from snow, sun gazing, viewing an eclipse of the sun without an adequate filter). These injuries can cause corneal epithelial defect, corneal opacity, conjunctival chemosis and injection (ie, congestion of blood vessels), and burns of the eyelids and periocular region. Antibiotics and a pressure patch for 24 hours constitute the treatment of mild injuries. Scarring of the eyelids may require oculoplastic surgery, whereas corneal scarring may require corneal surgery.

\section*{Infectious and Inflammatory Conditions}

Inflammation and infection of eye structures are common. Eye infection is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Table 58-7 describes selected common infections and their treatment.

\section*{DRY EYE SYNDROME}

Dry eye syndrome, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a deficiency in the production of any of the aqueous, mucin, or lipid tear film components; lid surface abnormalities; or epithelial abnormalities related to systemic diseases (eg, thyroid disorders, Parkinson's disease), infection, injury, or complications of medications (eg, antihistamines, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The most common complaint in dry eye syndrome is a scratchy or foreign body sensation. Other symptoms include itching, excessive mucus secretion, inability to produce tears, a burning sensation, redness, pain, and difficulty moving the lids.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Slit-lamp examination shows an absent or interrupted tear meniscus at the lower lid margin, and the conjunctiva is thickened, edematous, hyperemic, and has lost its luster. A tear meniscus is the crescent-shaped edge of the tear film in the lower lid margin. Chronic dry eyes may result in chronic conjunctival and corneal irritation that can lead to corneal erosion, scarring, ulceration, thinning, or perforation that can seriously threaten vision. Secondary bacterial infection can occur.

\section*{Management}

Management of dry eye syndrome requires the complete cooperation of the patient with a regimen that needs to be followed at home for a long period, or complete relief of symptoms is unlikely. Instillation of artificial tears during the day and an ointment at night is the usual regimen to hydrate and lubricate the eye through stimulating tears and preserving a moist ocular surface. Anti-inflammatory medications are also used, and moisture chambers (eg, moisture chamber spectacles, swim goggles) may provide additional relief.

Patients may become hypersensitive to chemical preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride and thimerosal. For these patients, preservative-free ophthalmic solutions are used. Management of the dry eye syndrome also includes the concurrent treatment of infections, such as chronic blepharitis and acne rosacea, and treating the underlying systemic disease, such as Sjögren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease).

In advanced cases of dry eye syndrome, surgical treatment that includes punctal occlusion, grafting procedures, and lateral tarsorrhaphy (ie, uniting the edges of the lids) are options. Punctal plugs are made of silicone material for the temporary or permanent occlusion of the puncta. This helps preserve the natural tears and prolongs the effects of artificial tears. Short-term occlusion is performed by inserting punctal or silicone rods in all four puncta. If tearing is induced, the upper plugs are removed, and the remaining lower plugs are removed in another week. Permanent occlusion is performed only in severe cases among adults who do not develop tearing after partial occlusion and who have results

The lid is red and edematous with a small collection of pus in the form of an abscess. There is considerable discomfort. & Warm compresses are applied directly to the affected lid area three to four times a day for 10 to 15 minutes. If the condition is not improved after 48 hours, incision and drainage may be indicated. Application of topical antibiotics may be prescribed thereafter. \\
\hline Chalazion & Sterile inflammatory process involving chronic granulomatous inflammation of the meibomian glands; can appear as a single granuloma or multiple granulomas in the upper or lower eyelids. & Warm compresses applied three to four times a day for 10 to 15 minutes may resolve the inflammation in the early stages. Most often, however, surgical excision is indicated. Corticosteroid injection to the chalazion lesion may be used for smaller lesions. \\
\hline Blepharitis & Chronic bilateral inflammation of the eyelid margins. There are two types: staphylococcal and seborrheic. Staphylococcal blepharitis is usually ulcerative and is more serious due to the involvement of the base of hair follicles. Permanent scarring can result. & The seborrheic type is chronic and is usually resistant to treatment, but the milder cases may respond to lid hygiene. Staphylococcal blepharitis requires topical antibiotic treatment. Instructions on lid hygiene (to keep the lid margins clean and free of exudates) are given to the patient. \\
\hline Bacterial keratitis & Infection of the cornea by S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and $P_{\text {seudomonas aeruginosa }}$ & Fortified (high-concentration) antibiotic eyedrops are administered every 30 minutes around the clock for the first few days, then every 1-2 hours. Systemic antibiotics may be administered. Cycloplegics are administered to reduce pain caused by ciliary spasm. Corticosteroid therapy and subconjunctival injections of antibiotics are controversial. \\
\hline Herpes simplex keratitis & Leading cause of corneal blindness in the United States. Symptoms are severe pain, tearing, and photophobia. The dendritic ulcer has a branching, linear pattern with feathery edges and terminal bulbs at its ends. Herpes simplex keratitis can lead to recurrent stromal keratitis and persist to 12 months with residual corneal scarring. & Many lesions heal without treatment and residual effects. The treatment goal is to minimize the damaging effect of the inflammatory response and eliminate viral replication within the cornea. Penetrating keratoplasty is indicated for corneal scarring and must be performed when the herpetic disease has been inactive for many months. \\

\section*{CONJUNCTIVITIS}

Conjunctivitis (ie, inflammation of the conjunctiva) is the most common ocular disease worldwide. It is characterized by a pink appearance (hence the common term pink eye) because of subconjunctival blood vessel hemorrhages.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

General symptoms include foreign body sensation, scratching or burning sensation, itching, and photophobia. Conjunctivitis may be unilateral or bilateral, but the infection usually starts in one eye and then spreads to the other eye by hand contact.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The four main clinical features important to evaluate are the type of discharge (ie, watery, mucoid, purulent, or mucopurulent), type of conjunctival reaction (ie, follicular or papillary), presence of pseudomembranes or true membranes, and presence or ab-
sence of lymphadenopathy (ie, enlargement of the preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes where the eyelids drain). Pseudomembranes consist of coagulated exudate that adheres to the surface of the inflamed conjunctiva. True membranes form when the exudate adheres to the superficial layer of the conjunctiva, and removal results in bleeding. Follicles are multiple, slightly elevated lesions encircled by tiny blood vessels; they look like grains of rice. Papillae are hyperplastic conjunctival epithelium in numerous projections that are usually seen as a fine mosaic pattern under slit-lamp examination. Diagnosis is based on the distinctive characteristics of ocular signs, acute or chronic presentation, and identification of any precipitating events. Positive results of swab smear preparations and cultures confirm the diagnosis.

\section*{Types of Conjunctivitis}

Conjunctivitis is classified according to its cause. The major causes are microbial infection, allergy, and irritating toxic stimuli. A wide spectrum of exogenous microbes can cause conjunctivitis, including bacteria (eg, Chlamydia), viruses, fungus, and parasites. Conjunctivitis can also result from infection of an existing ocular infection or can be a manifestation of a systemic disease.

\section*{MICROBIAL CONJUNCTIVITIS}

Bacterial conjunctivitis can be acute or chronic. The acute type can develop into a chronic condition. Signs and symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis is usually seen in patients with lacrimal duct obstruction, chronic dacryocystitis, and chronic blepharitis. The most common causative microorganisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus.

Bacterial conjunctivitis manifests with an acute onset of redness, burning, and discharge. There is papillary formation, conjunctival irritation, and injection in the fornices. The exudates are variable but are usually present on waking in the morning. The eyes may be difficult to open because of adhesions caused by the exudate. Purulent discharge occurs in severe acute bacterial infections, whereas mucopurulent discharge appears in mild cases. In gonococcal conjunctivitis, the symptoms are more acute. The exudate is profuse and purulent, and there is lymphadenopathy. Pseudomembranes may be present.

Viral conjunctivitis (Fig. 58-18) can also be acute and chronic. The discharge is watery, and follicles are prominent. Severe cases include pseudomembranes. The common causative organisms are adenovirus and herpes simplex virus. Conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus is highly contagious. The symptoms include extreme tearing, redness, and foreign body sensation that can involve one or both eyes. The condition is usually preceded by symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Corneal involvement causes extreme photophobia. There is lid edema, ptosis, conjunctival hyperemia (ie, dilation of the conjunctival blood vessels), watery discharge, follicles, and papillae. These signs and symptoms vary from mild to severe and may last for 2 weeks. Viral conjunctivitis, although self-limited, tends to last longer than bacterial conjunctivitis.

Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is most often accompanied by preauricular lymphadenopathy and occasionally periorbital pain. There are marked follicular and papillary formations. EKC can lead to keratopathy. EKC is a highly contagious viral conjunctivitis that is easily transmitted from one person to another among household members, school children, and health care workers. The outbreak of epidemics is seasonal, especially during the summer when people frequent swimming pools.

Chlamydial conjunctivitis includes trachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis. Trachoma is an ancient disease and is the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world. It is prevalent in areas with hot, dry, and dusty climates and in areas with poor living conditions. It is spread by direct contact or fomites, and the vectors can be insects such as flies and gnats.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 58-18 Conjunctival hyperemia in viral conjunctivitis.}
\end{figure}

Trachoma is a bilateral chronic follicular conjunctivitis of childhood that leads to blindness during adulthood, if left untreated. The onset in children is usually insidious, but it can be acute or subacute in adults. The initial symptoms include red inflamed eyes, tearing, photophobia, ocular pain, purulent exudates, preauricular lymphadenopathy, and lid edema. Initial ocular signs include follicular and papillary formations. At the middle stage of the disease, there is an acute inflammation with papillary hypertrophy and follicular necrosis, after which trichiasis (turning inward of hair follicles) and entropion begin to develop. The lashes that are turned in rub against the cornea and, after prolonged irritation, cause corneal erosion and ulceration. The late stage of the disease is characterized by scarred conjunctiva, subepithelial keratitis, abnormal vascularization of the cornea (pannus), and residual scars from the follicles that look like depressions in the conjunctiva (ie, Herbert's pits). Severe corneal ulceration can lead to perforation and blindness.

Inclusion conjunctivitis affects sexually active young people who have genital chlamydial infection. Transmission is by oralgenital sex or hand-to-eye transmission. It has been reported that indirect transmission has been acquired from inadequately chlorinated swimming pools. The eye lesions usually appear a week after exposure and may be associated with a nonspecific urethritis or cervicitis. The discharge is mucopurulent, follicles are present, and there is lymphadenopathy.

\section*{ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS}

Immunologic or allergic conjunctivitis is a hypersensitivity reaction as a part of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), or it can be an independent allergic reaction. The patient usually has a history of an allergy to pollens and other environmental allergens. There is extreme itching, epiphora (ie, excessive secretion of tears), injection, and usually severe photophobia. The stringlike mucoid discharge is usually associated with rubbing the eyes because of severe itching. Vernal conjunctivitis is also known as seasonal conjunctivitis because it appears mostly during warm weather. There may be large formations of papillae that have a cobblestone appearance. It is more common in children and young adults. Most affected individuals have a history of asthma or eczema.

\section*{TOXIC CONJUNCTIVITIS}

Chemical conjunctivitis can be the result of medications, chlorine from swimming pools (more common during the summer), exposure to toxic fumes among industrial workers, or exposure to other irritants such as smoke, hair sprays, acids, and alkalis.

\section*{Management}

The management of conjunctivitis depends on the type. Most types of mild and viral conjunctivitis are self-limiting, benign conditions that may not require treatment and laboratory procedures. For more severe cases, topical antibiotics, eye drops, or ointment are prescribed.

Patients with gonococcal conjunctivitis require urgent antibiotic therapy. If left untreated, this ocular disease can lead to corneal perforation and blindness. The systemic complications can include meningitis and generalized septicemia.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is almost always self-limiting. If left untreated, the disease follows a 2-week course with resolution of symptoms. If treated with appropriate antibiotics, it may last for a few days, with the exception of gonococcal and staphylococcal conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis is not responsive to any treatment. Cold compresses may alleviate some symptoms. It is
extremely important to remember that viral conjunctivitis, especially EKC, is highly transmissible. Patients must be made aware of the contagious nature of the disease, and adequate instructions must be given. These instructions should include an emphasis on handwashing and avoiding sharing hand towels, face cloths, and eye drops. Tissues should be directly discarded into a trashcan.

Proper steps must be taken to avoid nosocomial infections. Frequent hand hygiene, procedures for environmental cleaning, and disinfection of equipment used for eye examination must be strictly followed at all times (Chart 58-9). During outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus, it is necessary that health care facilities assign specified areas for treating patients with or suspected of having conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus to prevent spread. All forms of tonometry must be avoided unless medically indicated. All multidose medications must be discarded at the end of each day or when contaminated. Infected employees and others must not be allowed to work or attend school until symptoms have resolved, which can take 3 to 7 days.

Patients with allergic conjunctivitis, especially recurrent vernal or seasonal conjunctivitis, are usually given corticosteroids in ophthalmic preparations. Depending on the severity of the disease, they may be given oral preparations. Use of vasoconstrictors, such as topical epinephrine solution, cold compresses, ice packs, and cool ventilation usually provide comfort by decreasing swelling.

For trachoma, treatment is usually broad-spectrum antibiotics administered topically and systemically. Surgical management includes the correction of trichiasis to prevent conjunctival scarring. Adult inclusion conjunctivitis requires a 1 -week course of antibiotics. Prevention of reinfection is important, and affected individuals and their sexual partners must be advised to seek assessment and treatment for sexually transmitted disease, if indicated.

For conjunctivitis caused by chemical irritants, the eye must be irrigated immediately and profusely with saline or sterile water.

\section*{UVEITIS}

Inflammation of the uveal tract is called uveitis and can affect the iris, the ciliary body, or the choroid. There are two types of uveitis: nongranulomatous and granulomatous.

The most common type of uveitis is the nongranulomatous type, which manifests as an acute condition with pain, photophobia, and a pattern of conjunctival injection, especially around the cornea. The pupil is small or irregular, and vision is blurred. There may be small, fine precipitates on the posterior corneal surface and cells in the aqueous humor (ie, cell and flare). If severe, a hypopyon (ie, accumulation of pus in the anterior chamber) may occur. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral and may be recurrent. Repeated attacks of nongranulomatous anterior uveitis can cause anterior synechia (ie, peripheral iris adheres to the cornea and impedes outflow of aqueous humor). The development of posterior synechia (ie, adherence of the iris and lens) blocks aqueous outflow from the posterior chamber. Secondary glaucoma can result from either anterior or posterior synechia. Cataracts may also occur as a sequela to uveitis.

Granulomatous uveitis can have a more insidious onset and can involve any portion of the uveal tract. It tends to be chronic. Symptoms such as photophobia and pain may be minimal. The keratic precipitate may be large and grayish. Vision is markedly and adversely affected. Conjunctival injection is diffuse, and there may be vitreous clouding. In a severe posterior uveitis, such as chorioretinitis, there may be retinal and choroidal hemorrhages.

\section*{Management}

Because photophobia is a common complaint, patients should wear dark glasses outdoors. Ciliary spasm and synechia are best avoided through mydriasis; cylopentolate (Cyclogyl) and atropine are commonly used. Local corticosteroid drops, such as Pred Forte $1 \%$ and Flarex $0.1 \%$, instilled four to six times a day are also used to decrease inflammation. In very severe cases, systemic corticosteroids, as well as intravitreal corticosteroids, may be used.

If the uveitis is recurrent, a medical workup should be initiated to discover any underlying causes. This evaluation should include a physical examination, complete systems review, and diagnostic tests, including a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), VDRL, and Lyme disease titer. Underlying causes include toxoplasmosis, herpes zoster virus, ocular candidiasis, histoplasmosis, herpes simplex virus, tuberculosis, and syphilis.

\section*{ORBITAL CELLULITIS}

Orbital cellulitis is inflammation of the tissues surrounding the eye and may result from bacterial, fungal, or viral inflammatory conditions of contiguous structures, such as the face, oropharynx, dental structures, or intracranial structures. It can also result from
foreign bodies and from a preexisting ocular infection, such as dacryocystitis and panophthalmitis, or from generalized septicemia. Infection of the sinuses is the most frequent cause. Infection originating in the sinuses can spread easily to the orbit through the thin bony walls and foramina or by means of the interconnecting venous system of the orbit and sinuses. The most common causative organisms are staphylococci and streptococci in adults and $H$. influenzae in children.

The severe intraorbital tension caused by abscess formation and the impairment of optic nerve function in orbital cellulitis can result in permanent visual loss. Because of the orbit's proximity to the brain, orbital cellulitis can lead to life-threatening complications, such as intracranial abscess and cavernous sinus thrombosis.

\section*{Management}

Immediate administration of high-dose, broad-spectrum, systemic antibiotics is indicated. Cultures and Gram-stained smears are obtained. Monitoring changes in visual acuity, degree of proptosis, central nervous system function (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, level of consciousness), displacement of the globe, extraocular movements, pupillary signs, and the fundus is extremely important. Consultation with an otolaryngologist is necessary, especially when sinusitis is suspected. In the event of abscess formation or progressive loss of vision, surgical drainage of the abscess or sinus is performed. Sinusotomy and antibiotic irrigation are also performed.

\section*{Orbital and OcularTumors}

\section*{BENIGN TUMORS OF THE ORBIT}

Benign tumors can develop from infancy and grow rapidly or slowly and present themselves in later life. Some benign tumors are superficial and are easily identifiable by external presentation, palpation, and x-rays, but some are deep and may require a CT scan for a more thorough and precise diagnosis. There can be a significant proptosis, and visual function may be jeopardized. Benign tumors are masses characterized by the lack of infiltration in the surrounding tissues. Examples are cystic dermoid cysts and mucocele, hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, lacrimal tumors, and neurofibromas.

\section*{Management}

To prevent recurrence, benign masses are excised completely when possible. Sometimes, excision is difficult because of the involvement of some portions of the orbital bones, such as deep dermoid cysts, in which dissection of the bone is required. Subtotal resection may be indicated in deep benign tumors that intertwine with other orbital structures, such as optic nerve meningiomas. Complete removal of the tumor may endanger visual function.

\section*{BENIGN TUMORS OF THE EYELIDS}

Benign tumors include a wide variety of neoplasms and increase in frequency with age. Nevi may be unpigmented at birth and may enlarge and darken in adolescence or may never acquire any pigment at all. Hemangiomas are vascular capillary tumors that may be bright, superficial, strawberry-red lesions (ie, strawberry nevus) or bluish and purplish deeper lesions. Milia are small,
white, slightly elevated cysts of the eyelid that, when in multiples, create a blemish. Xanthelasma are yellowish, lipoid deposits on both lids near the inner angle of the eye that commonly appear as a result of the aging of the skin or a lipid disorder. Molluscum contagiosum lesions are flat, symmetric growths along the lid margin caused by a virus that can result in conjunctivitis and keratitis after debris gets into the conjunctival sac.

\section*{Management}

Treatment of benign congenital lid lesions is rarely indicated, except when visual function is affected. Corticosteroid injection to the hemangioma lesion is usually effective, but surgical excision may be performed. Benign lid lesions usually present aesthetic problems rather than visual function problems. Surgical excision, or electrocautery, is primarily performed for cosmetic reasons, except for cases of molluscum contagiosum, for which surgical intervention is performed to prevent an infectious process that may ensue.

\section*{BENIGN TUMORS OF THE CONJUNCTIVA}

Conjunctival nevus, a congenital, benign neoplasm, is a flat, slightly elevated, brown spot that becomes pigmented during late childhood or adolescence. This should be differentiated from the pigmented lesion melanosis acquired at middle age, which tends to wax and wane and become malignant melanoma. Keratin- and sebum-containing dermoid cysts are congenital and can be found in the conjunctiva. Dermolipoma is a congenital tumor that manifests as a smooth, rounded growth in the conjunctiva near the lateral canthus. Papillomas are usually soft with irregular surfaces and appear on the lid margins. Treatment consists of surgical excision.

\section*{MALIGNANT TUMORS OF THE ORBIT}

Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignant primary orbital tumor in childhood, but it can also develop in elderly persons. The symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma include sudden painless proptosis of one eye followed by lid swelling, conjunctival chemosis, and impairment of ocular motility. Imaging of these tumors establishes the size, configuration, location, and stage of the disease; delineates the degree of bone destruction; and is useful in estimating the field for radiation therapy, if needed. The most common site of metastasis is the lung.

\section*{Management}

Management of these primary malignant orbital tumors involves three major therapeutic modalities: surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The degree of orbital destruction is important in planning the surgical approach. In the orbit, resection often involves removal of the globe. The psychological needs of the patient and family, especially the parents of a pediatric patient, are paramount in planning the management approach.

\section*{MALIGNANT TUMORS OF THE EYELID}

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the eyelid. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs less frequently but is considered the second most common malignant tumor. Malignant melanoma is rare. Malignant eyelid tumors occur more fre-
quently among people with fair complexion who have a history of chronic exposure to the sun.

Basal cell carcinoma appears as a painless nodule that may ulcerate. The lesion is invasive, spreads to the surrounding tissues, and grows slowly but does not metastasize. It usually appears on the lower lid margin near the inner canthus with a pearly white margin. Squamous cell carcinoma of the eyelids may resemble basal cell carcinoma initially because it also grows slowly and painlessly. It tends to ulcerate and invade the surrounding tissues, but it can metastasize to the regional lymph nodes. Malignant melanoma may not be pigmented and can arise from nevi. It spreads to the surrounding tissues and metastasizes to other organs.

\section*{Management}

Complete excision of these carcinomas is followed by reconstruction with skin grafting if the surgical excision is extensive. The ocular postoperative site and the graft donor site are monitored for bleeding. Donor graft sites may include the buccal mucosa, the thigh, or the abdomen. The patient is referred to an oncologist for evaluation for the need for radiation therapy treatment and monitoring for metastasis. Early diagnosis and surgical management are the basis of a good prognosis. These conditions have life-threatening consequences, and surgical excisions may result in facial disfigurement. Emotional support and reassurance are important aspects of nursing management.

\section*{MALIGNANT TUMORS OF THE CONJUNCTIVA}

Conjunctival carcinoma most often grows in the exposed areas of the conjunctiva. The typical lesions are usually gelatinous and whitish due to keratin formation. They grow gradually, and deep invasion and metastasis are rare. Malignant melanoma is rare but may arise from a preexisting nevus or acquired melanosis during middle age. Squamous cell carcinoma is also rare but invasive.

\section*{Management}

The management is surgical incision. Some benign tumors and most malignant tumors recur. To avoid recurrences, patients usually undergo radiation therapy and cryotherapy after the excision of malignant tumors. Cosmetic disfigurement may result from extensive excision when deep invasion by the malignant tumor is involved.

\section*{MALIGNANT TUMOR OF THE GLOBE: OCULAR MELANOMA}

A malignant tumor of the retina, retinoblastoma, occurs in childhood, is hereditary, and requires complete enucleation if there is to be a chance for successful outcome. Another cancer that primarily occurs in adults is ocular melanoma. This rare, malignant choroidal tumor is often discovered on a retinal examination. In its early stages, it could be mistaken for a nevus. Many ophthalmologists may practice for decades and never encounter this lesion. For this reason, any patient who is suspected of having ocular melanoma should be immediately referred to an ocular oncologist with experience in this disease.

Although many patients do not have symptoms in the early stages, some patients complain of blurred vision or a change in eye color. A number of such tumors have been found in people with blindness who have painful eyes. In addition to a complete physical examination to discover any evidence of metastasis (to the liver, lung, and breast), retinal fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and ultrasonography are performed. The diagnosis is confirmed at biopsy after enucleation.

\section*{Management}

Tumors are classified according to size (ie, small, medium, and large). Very small tumors are generally monitored, whereas medium and large tumors require treatment. Treatment consists of radiation, enucleation, or both. Radiation therapy is achieved by external beam performed in repeated doses over several days or

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE-Genes and the Eye}

The mapping of the human genome enhances the opportunity to understand the genetic component of ophthalmic disorders and to develop new methods of prevention and treatment. Apparently more than one gene is involved in any particular condition, making genetic counseling an important part of the care and prevention of inherited diseases. Ocular effects of some genetic conditions follow.

\section*{MARFAN'S SYNDROME}

Ophthalmic consequences may include amblyopia and dislocation of the lens. Patients are often myopic and may be at increased risk for retinal detachment.

\section*{LEBER'S CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS}

To date, four genes are implicated in this disorder, which is characterized by decreased vision and onset in childhood, generally before 7 years of age. It accounts for 10\% to 18\% of congenital
blindness (some infants may be blind from birth). Other signs and symptoms include strabismus, nystagmus, photophobia, cataracts, and keratoconus.

\section*{RETINOBLASTOMA}

A malignant retinal tumor occurring in 1 of every 15,000 live births, it is hereditary in $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of cases. All bilateral cases are hereditary. The retinoblastoma gene is found on chromosome 13 , region q14. If this gene is inhibited, the growth in retinal cells is unchecked and the retinoblastoma results. Signs and symptoms include an initial leukocoria or "white" pupil with a peculiar light reflection and possibly strabismus as well. Less frequent signs are uveitis, glaucoma, hyphema, nystagmus, and periorbital cellulitis. Treatment for this life-threatening tumor is enucleation, if the tumor is large and unilateral. If the eye is removed before cancer spreads to the optic nerve, the cure rate is greater than $90 \%$.
through the surgical implantation of a radioactive plaque, which is removed after several days.

\section*{Surgical Procedures and Enucleation}

\section*{ORBITAL SURGERIES}

Orbital surgeries may be performed to repair fractures, remove a foreign body, or remove benign or malignant growths. Surgical procedures involving the orbit and lids affect facial appearance (ie, cosmesis). The goals are to recover and preserve visual function and to maintain the anatomic relationship of the ocular structures to achieve cosmesis. During the repair of orbital fractures, the orbital bones are realigned to follow the anatomic positions of facial structures.

Orbital surgical procedures involve working around delicate structures of the eye, such as the optic nerve, retinal blood vessels, and ocular muscles. Complications of orbital surgical procedures may include blindness as a result of damage to the optic nerve and its blood supply. Sudden pain and loss of vision may indicate intraorbital hemorrhage or compression of the optic nerve. Ptosis and diplopia may result from trauma to the extraocular muscles during the surgical procedure, but these conditions typically resolve after a few weeks.

\section*{Postoperative Management}

Prophylaxis with intravenous antibiotics is the usual postoperative regimen after orbital surgery, especially with repair of orbital fractures and intraorbital foreign body removal. Intravenous corticosteroids are used if there is a concern about optic nerve swelling. Topical ocular antibiotics are typically instilled, and antibiotic ointments are applied externally to the skin suture sites.

For the first 24 to 48 hours postoperatively, ice compresses are applied over the periocular area to decrease periorbital swelling, facial swelling, and hematoma. The head of the patient's bed should be elevated to a comfortable position ( 30 to 45 degrees).

Discharge teaching should include medication instructions for oral antibiotics, instillation of ophthalmic medications, and application of ocular compresses.

\section*{ENUCLEATION}

Enucleation is the removal of the entire eye and part of the optic nerve. It may be performed for the following conditions:
- Severe injury resulting in prolapse of uveal tissue or loss of light projection or perception
- An irritated, blind, painful, deformed, or disfigured eye, usually caused by glaucoma, retinal detachment, or chronic inflammation
- An eye without useful vision that is producing or has produced sympathetic ophthalmia in the other eye
- Intraocular tumors that are untreatable by other means

The procedure for enucleation involves the separation and cutting of each of the ocular muscles, dissection of the Tenon's capsule (ie, fibrous membrane covering the sclera), and the cutting of the optic nerve from the eyeball. The insertion of an orbital implant typically follows, and the conjunctiva is closed. A large pressure dressing is applied over the area.

Evisceration involves the surgical removal of the intraocular contents through an incision or opening in the cornea or sclera. The optic nerve, sclera, extraocular muscles, and sometimes, the
cornea are left intact. The main advantage of evisceration over enucleation is that the final cosmetic result and motility after fitting the ocular prosthesis are enhanced. This procedure would be more acceptable to a patient whose concept of the alteration of body image is severely threatened. The main disadvantage is the high risk of sympathetic ophthalmia.

Exenteration is the removal of the eyelids, the eye, and various amounts of orbital contents. It is indicated in malignancies in the orbit that are life threatening or when more conservative modalities of treatment have failed or are inappropriate. An example is squamous cell carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses, skin, and conjunctiva with deep orbital involvement. In its most extensive form, exenteration may include the removal of all orbital tissues and resection of the orbital bones.

\section*{Ocular Prostheses}

Orbital implants and conformers (ie, ocular prostheses usually made of silicone rubber) maintain the shape of the eye after enucleation or evisceration to prevent a contracted sunken appearance. The temporary conformer is placed over the conjunctival closure after the implantation of an orbital implant. A conformer is placed after the enucleation or evisceration procedure to protect the suture line, maintain the fornices, prevent contracture of the socket in preparation for the ocular prosthesis, and promote the integrity of the eyelids.

All ocular prosthetics have limitations in their motility. There are two designs of eye prostheses. The anophthalmic ocular prostheses are used in the absence of the globe. Scleral shells look just like the anophthalmic prosthesis (Fig. 58-19) but are thinner and fit over a globe with intact corneal sensation. An eye prosthesis usually lasts about 6 years, depending on the quality of fit, comfort, and cosmetic appearance. When the anophthalmic socket is completely healed, conformers are replaced with prosthetic eyes.

An ocularist is a specially trained and skilled professional who makes prosthetic eyes. After the ophthalmologist is satisfied that the anophthalmic socket is completely healed and is ready for prosthetic fitting, the patient is referred to an ocularist. The healing period is usually 6 to 8 weeks. It is advisable for the patient to have a consultation with the ocularist before the fitting. Obtaining accurate information and verbalizing concerns can lessen anxiety about wearing an ocular prosthesis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Removal of an eye has physical, social, and psychological ramifications for any person. The significance of loss of the eye and vision must be addressed in the plan of care. The patient's preparation should include information about the surgical procedure and placement of orbital implants and conformers and the availability of ocular prosthetics to enhance cosmetic appearance. In some cases, patients may choose to see an ocularist before the surgery to discuss ocular prosthetics.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{TEACHING ABOUT POSTSURGICAL AND PROSTHETIC CARE}

Patients who undergo eye removal need to know that they will usually have a large ocular pressure dressing, which is typically removed after a week, and that an ophthalmic topical antibiotic ointment is applied in the socket three times daily.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-281.jpg?height=426&width=858&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=208}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 58-19 Eye prostheses. (Left) Anophthalmic ocular prosthesis. (Right) Scleral shell.}
\end{figure}

After the removal of an eye, there is a loss of depth perception. Patients must be advised to take extra caution in their ambulation and movement to avoid miscalculations that may result in injury. It may take some time to adjust to monocular vision.

The patient must be advised that conformers may accidentally fall out of the socket. If this happens, the conformer must be washed, wiped dry, and placed back in the socket. When surgical eye removal is unexpected, such as in severe ocular trauma, leaving no time for the patient and family to prepare for the loss, the nurse's role in providing reassurance and emotional support is crucial.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Patients need to be taught how to insert, remove, and care for the prosthetic eye. Proper hand washing must be observed before inserting and removing an ocular prosthesis. A suction cup may be used if there are problems with manual dexterity. Precautions, such as draping a towel over the sink and closing the sink drain, must be taken to avoid loss of the prosthesis. When instructing patients or family members, a return demonstration is important to assess the level of understanding and ability to perform the procedure.

Before insertion, the inner punctal or outer lateral aspects and the superior and inferior aspects of the prosthesis must be identified by locating the identifying marks, such as a reddish color in the inner punctal area. For people with low vision, other forms of identifying markers, such as dots or notches, are used. The upper lid is raised high enough to create a space; then the patient learns to slide the prosthesis up, underneath, and behind the upper eyelid. Meanwhile, the patient pulls the lower eyelid down to help put the prosthesis in place and to have its inferior edge fall back gradually to the lower eyelid. The lower eyelid is checked for correct positioning.

To remove the prosthesis, the patient cups one hand on the cheek to catch the prosthesis, places the forefinger of the free hand against the midportion of the lower eyelid, and gazes upward. Gazing upward brings the inferior edge of the prosthesis nearer the inferior eyelid margin. With the finger pushing inward, downward, and laterally against the lower eyelid, the prosthesis slides out, and the cupped hand acts as the receptacle.

Continuing Care. An eye prosthesis can be worn and left in place for several months. Hygiene and comfort are usually maintained with daily irrigation of the prosthesis in place with the use of a
balanced salt solution, hard contact lens solution, or artificial tears. In the case of dry eye symptoms, the use of ophthalmic ointment lubricants or oil-based drops, such as vitamin E and mineral oil, can be helpful. Removing crusting and mucous discharge that accumulates overnight is performed with the prosthesis in place. Malpositions may occur when wiping or rubbing the prosthesis in the socket. The prosthesis can be turned back in place with the use of clean fingers. Proper wiping of the prosthesis should be a gentle temporal-to-nasal motion to avoid malpositions.

The prosthesis needs to be removed and cleaned when it becomes uncomfortable and when there is increased mucous discharge. The socket should also be rendered free of mucus and inspected for any signs of infection. Any unusual discomfort, irritation, or redness of the globe or eyelids may indicate excessive wear, debris under the shell, or lack of proper hygiene. Any infection or irritation that does not subside needs medical attention.

\section*{Ocular Consequences of Systemic Disease}
\section*{DIABETIC RETINOPATHY}

Of all of the medical disorders that the nurse encounters, diabetes mellitus is one of the most common and one that can have devastating effects on the patient. Diabetes affects every system of the body in a deleterious way and consequently affects the patient's family and society in general. Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in people between 20 and 74 years of age in the United States today. Before the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, diabetic retinopathy was relatively rare. Most people with diabetes did not survive for more than 1 or 2 years; however, with the use of insulin, more and more patients are able to survive and enjoy relatively normal life spans. They are also confronted with the complications of long-term diabetes. One of the most serious complications is retinopathy. Chapter 41 provides a detailed discussion of diabetic retinopathy (Aiello et al., 2001).

\section*{CYTOMEGALOVIRUS RETINITIS}

Many ophthalmic complications are associated with AIDS. On autopsy, up to $90 \%$ of patients have ocular lesions directly related to AIDS. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of retinal inflammation in patients with AIDS. About $40 \%$ of patients who have CMV retinitis lose their central vision in both eyes by the time of death.

Early symptoms of CMV retinitis vary from patient to patient. Some patients complain of floaters or a decrease in peripheral vision. Some patients have a paracentral or central scotoma, whereas others have a fluctuation in vision from macular edema. The retina often becomes thin and atrophic and susceptible to retinal tears and breaks.

CMV retinitis generally takes one of three forms: hemorrhagic, brushfire, or granular. In the hemorrhagic type, large areas of white, necrotic retina may be associated retinal hemorrhage. The brushfire form appears to have a yellow-white margin, which begins at the edge of burned-out atrophic retina. This retinitis expands and, if untreated, involves the entire retina. The granular form of CMV retinitis consists of white, granular lesions in the periphery of the retina that gradually expand. The white, feathery infiltration of the retina destroys sensory retina and leads to necrosis, optic atrophy, and retinal detachment.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Pharmacologic agents available for treatment of CMV retinitis include ganciclovir (Cytovene), foscarnet (Foscavir), and cidofovir (Vistide).

Ganciclovir is administered intravenously, orally, or intravitreously in the acute stage of CMV retinitis. A surgically implanted intraocular device has provided a new mode of effective ganciclovir administration. This enables a higher, more effective dose of medication to be administered and is well tolerated by patients. This constant intraocular concentration of ganciclovir lasts for about 6 to 10 months before the inserts must be replaced. Once begun, ganciclovir must be given continuously. A study that combined the use of the intravitreous implant with oral ganciclovir demonstrated a reduction in the risk of new CMV disease as well as a delay in the progression of the retinitis (Martin et al., 1999). This very potent medication, when administered systemically, can cause neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated serum creatinine levels. Although the surgically implanted sustained release device enables higher concentrations of ganciclovir to reach the CMV retinitis, there are risks and complications associated with the devices, including endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and hypotony.

Foscarnet inhibits viral DNA replication. It may be the medication of choice when ganciclovir is ineffective. It may be administered intravenously or locally by intravitreal injections. The combination of foscarnet and ganciclovir has been more effective than either medication alone. Nephrotoxicity may occur with systemic foscarnet, and renal function must be monitored carefully.

Cidofovir impedes CMV replication. This medication is administered intravenously. Cidofovir has been shown to delay the progression of CMV retinitis significantly. Nephrotoxicity, proteinuria, and increased serum creatinine levels are significant side effects of its administration.

\section*{HYPERTENSION-RELATED EYE CHANGES}

Hypertension, known as the silent killer, can shorten the life span by as many as 20 years. End-organ damage affects the heart, brain, kidney, and eye. Hypertension may be manifested in one of two forms: chronic or acute. This differentiation is determined by the rapidity in rise of the blood pressure as well as the degree of elevation. The retinal changes observed with each form are different and have different consequences for the eye.

Chronic hypertension and atherosclerosis go hand in hand, and the associated retinal changes are evidenced by the development of retinal arteriolar changes, such as tortuousness, narrowing, and a change in light reflex. Funduscopic examination reveals a copper or silver coloration of the arterioles and venous compression (arteriovenous nicking) at the arteriolar and venous crossings. Intraretinal hemorrhages from hypertension appear flame shaped because they occur in the nerve fiber layer of the retina.

Acute hypertension can result from pheochromocytoma, acute renal failure, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and malignant essential hypertension. The retinopathy associated with these crisis states is extensive, and the manifestations include cotton-wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, retinal edema, and retinal exudates, often clustered around the macula.

The choroid is also affected by the profound and abrupt rise in blood pressure and resulting vasoconstriction, and ischemia may result in serous retinal detachments and infarction of the
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Ischemic optic neuropathy and papilledema (ie, swelling of the optic disc due to increased IOP) may also result.

\section*{Concepts in Ocular Medication Administration}

The main objective of ocular medication delivery is to maximize the amount of medication that reaches the ocular site of action in sufficient concentration to produce a beneficial therapeutic effect. This is determined by the dynamics of ocular pharmacokinetics: absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

Topical administration of ocular medications results in only a $1 \%$ to $7 \%$ absorption rate by the ocular tissues. Ocular absorption involves the entry of a medication into the aqueous humor through the different routes of ocular drug administration. The rate and extent of aqueous humor absorption are determined by the characteristics of the medication and the barriers imposed by the anatomy and physiology of the eye. The natural barriers of absorption that diminish the efficacy of ocular medications include the following:
- Limited size of the conjunctival sac. The conjunctival sac can hold only $50 \mu \mathrm{~L}$, and any excess is wasted. The volume of one eye drop from commercial topical ocular solutions typically ranges from 20 to $35 \mu \mathrm{~L}$.
- Corneal membrane barriers. The epithelial, stromal, and endothelial layers are barriers to absorption.
- Blood-ocular barriers. Blood-ocular barriers prevent high ocular tissue concentration of most ophthalmic medications because they separate the bloodstream from the ocular tissues and keep foreign substances from entering the eye, thereby limiting a medication's efficacy.
- Tearing, blinking, and drainage. Increased tear production and drainage due to ocular irritation or an ocular condition may dilute or wash out an instilled eye drop; blinking expels an instilled eye drop from the conjunctival sac.
Distribution of an ocular medication into the ocular tissues involves partitioning and compartmentalizing of the medication between the tissues of the conjunctiva, cornea, lens, iris, ciliary body, choroid, and vitreous. Medications penetrate the corneal epithelium by diffusion by passing through the cells (intracellular) or by passing between the cells (intercellular). Water-soluble (hydrophilic) medications diffuse through the intracellular route, and fat-soluble (lipophilic) medications diffuse through the intercellular route. Topical administration usually does not reach the retina in significant concentrations. Because the space between the ciliary process and the lens is small, medication diffusion in the vitreous is slow. When high therapeutic medication concentration in the vitreous is required, intraocular injection is often chosen to bypass the natural ocular anatomic and physiologic barriers.

Aqueous solutions are most commonly used for the eye. They are the least expensive medications and interfere least with vision. However, corneal contact time is brief because tears dilute the medication. Ophthalmic ointments have extended retention time in the conjunctival sac and a higher concentration than eye drops. The major disadvantage of ointments is the blurred vision that results after application. In general, eyelids and eyelid margins are best treated with ointments. The conjunctiva, limbus, cornea, and anterior chamber are treated most effectively with instilled solutions or suspensions. Subconjunctival injection may be necessary for better absorption in the anterior chamber. If high med-
ication concentrations are required in the posterior chamber, intravitreal injections or systemically absorbed medications are considered. Contact lenses and collagen shields soaked in antibiotics are alternative delivery methods for treating corneal infections. Of all these delivery methods, the topical route of administra-tion-instilled eye drops and applied ointments-remain the most common. Topical instillation, which is the least invasive method, permits self-administration of medication. It also produces fewer side effects.

Preservatives are commonly used in ocular medications. Benzalkonium chloride, for example, prevents the growth of organisms and enhances the corneal permeability of most medications. Some patients are allergic to this preservative. This may be suspected even if the patient had never before experienced an allergic reaction to systemic use of the medication in question. Eye drops without preservatives can be prepared by pharmacists.

\section*{COMMONLY USED OCULAR MEDICATIONS}

Common ocular medications include topical anesthetic, mydriatic, and cycloplegic agents that reduce IOP; anti-infective medications, corticosteroids, NSAIDS, antiallergy medications, eye irrigants, and lubricants.

\section*{Topical Anesthetics}

One to two drops of proparacaine hydrochloride (Ophthaine $0.5 \%$ ) and tetracaine hydrochloride (Pontocaine $0.5 \%$ ) are instilled before diagnostic procedures such as tonometry and gonioscopy and in minor ocular procedures such as removal of sutures or conjunctival or corneal scrapings. The nurse must instruct patients not to rub their eyes while anesthetized because this may result in corneal damage. Patients must never be allowed to take topical anesthetics home. Prolonged use can delay wound healing and
can lead to permanent corneal opacification and scarring, resulting in visual loss. Topical anesthetic is also used for severe eye pain to allow the patient to open his or her eyes for examination or treatment (eg, eye irrigation for chemical burns). Anesthesia occurs within 20 seconds to 1 minute and lasts 10 to 20 minutes.

\section*{Mydriatics and Cycloplegics}

Mydriasis, or pupil dilation, is the main objective of the administration of mydriatic and cycloplegic agents (Table 58-8). These two medications function differently and are used in combination to achieve the maximal dilation that is needed during surgery and fundus examinations to give the ophthalmologist a better view of the internal eye structures. Mydriatics potentiate alpha-adrenergic sympathetic effects that result in the relaxation of the ciliary muscle. This causes the pupil to dilate. This sympathetic action alone, however, is not enough to sustain mydriasis because of its short duration of action. The strong light used during an eye examination also stimulates miosis (ie, pupillary contraction). Cycloplegic medications are administered to paralyze the iris sphincter.

Patients are instructed about the temporary effects of mydriasis on vision, such as glare and the inability to focus properly. Patients may not be able to read and should not drive. The effects of the various mydriatics and cycloplegics can last 3 hours to several days. Patients are advised to wear sunglasses (most eye clinics provide protective sunglasses) and to have a responsible adult drive them home.

Mydriatic and cycloplegic agents affect the central nervous system. Their effects are most prominent in children and elderly patients; these patients must be assessed closely for symptoms, such as rise in blood pressure, tachycardia, dizziness, ataxia, confusion, disorientation, incoherent speech, and hallucination. These medications are contraindicated in patients with narrow

angles or shallow anterior chambers and in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.

\section*{Medications Used to Treat Glaucoma}

Therapeutic medications for glaucoma are used to lower IOP by decreasing aqueous production or increasing aqueous outflow. Because glaucoma calls for lifetime therapy, patients must be instructed regarding both the ocular and systemic side effects of the medications.

Most antiglaucoma medications affect the accommodation of the lens and limit light entry through a constricted pupil. Visual acuity and the ability to focus may be affected. Factors to consider in selecting glaucoma medications are efficacy, systemic and ocular side effects, convenience, and cost.

\section*{Anti-Infective Medications}

Anti-infective medications include antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agents. Most are available as drops, ointments, or subconjunctival or intravitreal injections. Antibiotics include penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. The main antifungal agent is amphotericin B. Side effects of amphotericin are serious and include severe pain, conjunctival necrosis, iritis, and retinal toxicity. Antiviral medications include acyclovir and ganciclovir. They are used to treat ocular infections associated with herpesvirus and CMV. Patients receiving ocular anti-infective agents are subject to the same side effects and adverse reactions as those receiving oral or parenteral medications.

\section*{Corticosteroids and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs}

The topical preparations of corticosteroids are commonly used in inflammatory conditions of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, lens, and uvea. In posterior segment diseases that involve the posterior sclera, retina, and optic nerve, the topical agents are less effective, and parenteral and oral routes are preferred. The topical eye drop preparation is prepared in suspension; the patient is instructed to shake the bottle several times to obtain the maximum therapeutic effect of the medication.

The most common ocular side effects of long-term topical corticosteroid administration are glaucoma, cataracts, susceptibility to infection, impaired wound healing, mydriasis, and ptosis. High IOP may develop, which is reversible after corticosteroid use is discontinued. To avoid the side effects of corticosteroids, NSAIDS are used as an alternative in controlling inflammatory eye conditions and postoperatively to reduce inflammation. NSAID therapy in combination with topical and oral preparations is an important adjunct therapy in managing uveitis.

\section*{Antiallergy Medications}

Ocular hypersensitivity reactions, such as allergic conjunctivitis, are extremely common. These conditions result primarily from responses to environmental allergens. Most allergens are airborne or carried to the eye by the hand or by other means, although allergic reactions may also be drug induced. Corticosteroids are also commonly used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents to control ocular hypersensitivity reaction.

\section*{Ocular Irrigants}

Most irrigating solutions are used to cleanse the external lids to maintain lid hygiene, to irrigate the external corneal surface to regain normal pH (such as in chemical burns), to irrigate the corneal surface to eliminate debris, or to inflate the globe intraoperatively. These solutions have various compositions that include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, bicarbonate, glucose, and glutathione (ie, substance found in the aqueous humor). Sterile irrigating solutions, such as Dacriose, for lid hygiene are available. Irrigating solutions are safe to use with an intact corneal surface; however, the corneal surface should not be irrigated in cases of threatened corneal perforation. For patients with severe corneal ulcer, specific orders must be obtained regarding whether it is safe to irrigate the corneal surface or just to cleanse the external lids. Although it is good practice to promote hygiene, prevention of complications must be the primary concern. Normal saline solutions are commonly used to irrigate the corneal surface when chemical burns occur.

\section*{Ocular Lubricants}

Lubricants, such as artificial tears, help to alleviate corneal irritation, such as dry eye syndrome. Artificial tears are topical preparations of methyl or hydroxypropyl cellulose that are prepared as eye drop solutions, ointments, or ocular inserts (inserted at the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac once each day). The eye drops can be instilled as often as every hour, depending on the severity of symptoms.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}

The objectives in administering ocular medications are to ensure proper administration to maximize the therapeutic effects and to ensure the safety of the patient by monitoring manifestations of possible systemic and local side effects. Absorption of eye drops by the nasolacrimal duct is undesirable because of the potential systemic side effects of ocular medications. To diminish systemic absorption and minimize the side effects, it is important to occlude the puncta (Chart 58-10). This is especially important for patients most vulnerable to medication overdose, including elderly people, children, infants, women who are lactating or are pregnant, and patients with cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or renal disease.

A 30 -second interval between eye drop instillations has a $45 \%$ rate of washout loss. A 1-minute interval between instillation of differing types of ocular drops is recommended (Margolis et al., 2002).

Before the administration of ocular medications, the nurse should warn the patient that blurred vision, stinging, and a burning sensation are symptoms that ordinarily occur after instillation and are temporary. Risk for interactions of the ocular medication with other ocular and systemic medications must be emphasized; therefore, a careful patient interview regarding medications being taken must be obtained.

Emphasis must be placed on hand-washing techniques before and after medication instillation. The tip of the eye drop bottle or the ointment tube must never touch any part of the eye. The medication must be recapped immediately after each use. If patients who instill their own medications cannot feel the eye drops when they are instilled, the eye medication may be refrigerated, because a cold drop is easier to detect. A 5-minute interval between successive eye drop administration allows adequate drug retention and absorption. The patient or the caregiver at home should be asked to demonstrate actual eye drop or ointment instillation and punctal occlusion.

\section*{Guidelines for Instilling Eye Medications}

Follow these general guidelines when instilling eye medications:
- Shake suspensions or "milky" solutions to obtain the desired medication level.
- Wash hands thoroughly before and after the procedure.
- Ensure adequate lighting.
- Read the label of the eye medication to make sure it is the correct medication.
- Assume a comfortable position.
- Do not touch the tip of the medication container to any part of the eye or face.
- Hold the lower lid down; do not press on the eyeball. Apply gentle pressure to the cheek bone to anchor the finger holding the lid.
- Instill eye drops before applying ointments.
- Apply a $1 / 2$-inch ribbon of ointment to the lower conjunctival sac.

- Keep the eyelids closed, and apply gentle pressure on the inner canthus (punctal occlusion) near the bridge of the nose for 1 or 2 minutes immediately after instilling eyedrops.
- Using a clean tissue, gently pat skin to absorb excess eyedrops that run onto the cheeks.
- Wait 5 to 10 minutes before instilling another eye medication.

\section*{Issues in Ophthalmology}

Issues that arise in any area of health care usually pose more questions than answers. In ophthalmology, the well-being of the patient physically, emotionally, financially, socially, and spiritually can be at risk when vision is threatened. Patients with a deteriorating eye condition often worry about the impact that visual loss will have on their lives. As they experience visual distortions, scotomas, or gradual visual loss, what was a vague worry can become a consuming preoccupation. The patient may equate a decrease in visual acuity with a loss of independence. The loss of a driver's license may force a patient to relocate his or her home or give up or change careers.

These vulnerable patients may be easy targets for unscrupulous practitioners, who may offer unproven treatments, often at great expense to the patient who is desperate for any treatment that may prove beneficial. Patients travel from one physician to another in search of any treatment that may forestall visual loss. For example, a patient with $20 / 200$ vision may wrongly believe that there is nothing to lose and will submit to invasive surgeries, only to end with a visual acuity of 20/800.

Not all patients who are contemplating ophthalmic surgical procedures are in great distress from a sight-threatening condition. Increasingly, patients are encouraged by friends and family or even by advertisement to have elective procedures such as refractive surgery. Patients are enticed by the thought of being free of eye-
glasses or contact lens. Refractive surgery sites are springing up in shopping malls and offering discounts and sales on procedures.

Some cataract surgeons remove cataracts before there is a visual deficit or with the full knowledge that such surgery may offer no increase in vision. Patients should be counseled before such procedures about the potential risk versus the potential benefit. Patients who have an ongoing retinal problem, such as AMD, should be evaluated by both a retinal expert and a cataract surgeon.

\section*{Nursing Considerations}

Fundamental goals in ophthalmic nursing should include the preservation of vision and the prevention of further visual loss in those patients who have already experienced some degree of loss. The maximal practical use should be sought for any remaining vision.

Skillful listening and interviewing on the part of the nurse or provider are critical tools for the rehabilitation of the distressed patient. The health care provider together with the patient should determine which goals are possible. A referral to a low-vision center for evaluation may be an appropriate intervention, but for some patients, it may be a signal that all hope of vision restoration is lost.

To be effective, the nurse listens to the patient, tries to determine his or her level of health care need, and makes suggestions and recommendations that can be of real value to the patient. Lines of communication must be kept open so that the patient is comfortable exploring all treatment modalities without fear of being ridiculed or patronized.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are making a home visit to a 73 -year-old patient in an assisted living facility. She has had diabetes mellitus for many years. Her renal function has been deteriorating, and her blood pressure has become increasingly harder to control. She complains that, although her reading vision is better, her distance vision seems to be blurry most of the time. She asks whether she should get her glasses changed (it has been several years since her last eye examination) or wait until her blood pressure medication regimen is settled. How often should a patient with diabetes have a dilated eye examination? What could be the underlying reason for her decrease in distance acuity? How can her fluctuating renal and hypertensive status affect the condition of the retina?
2. A 19-year-old, female student arrives at the college infirmary with scratchy eyes, blurred vision, and photophobia. She has just returned to the campus after spring break. She states that her nose has been running, her eyelids have been stuck together in the mornings, and she has used some eye drops with a red cap that she found in her medicine cabinet at home. She denies any use of other medications. Examination reveals crusting on the lids and lashes, hyperemic conjunctiva, purulent discharge, and fixed, dilated pupils. What should be included in the differential diagnosis? What could account for the photophobia? For the unresponsive pupils? What eyelid hygiene measure will promote ocular comfort? What precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of ocular infection to other students in the dormitory?

$T_{h}$he ear is a sensory organ with dual functions-hearing and balance. The sense of hearing is essential for normal development and maintenance of speech and the ability to communicate with others. Balance, or equilibrium, is essential for maintaining body movement, position, and coordination.

The delicate structure and function of the ear make early detection and accurate diagnosis of disorders necessary for preservation of normal hearing and balance. Among the professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders are otolaryngologists, pediatricians, internists, and nurses. Nurses involved in the specialty of otolaryngology can become certified through the Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head-Neck Nurses, Inc.

This chapter addresses the assessment and management of hearing and balance disorders common to the adult population. The pediatric otolaryngology literature provides information on otologic disorders pertaining to that population.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The cranium encloses and protects the brain and surrounding structures, providing attachment for various muscles that control head and jaw movements. Eight bones form the cranium: the occipital bone, the frontal bone, two parietal bones, two temporal bones, the sphenoid bone, and the ethmoid bone. Some of these bones contain sinuses, which are cavities lined with mucous membranes and connected to the nasal cavity. The ears are located on either side of the cranium at approximately eye level.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE EXTERNAL EAR}

The external ear, housed in the temporal bone, includes the auricle (i.e., pinna) and the external auditory canal (Fig. 59-1). The external ear is separated from the middle ear by a disklike structure called the tympanic membrane (ie, eardrum).

\section*{Auricle}

The auricle, attached to the side of the head by skin, is composed mainly of cartilage, except for the fat and subcutaneous tissue in the earlobe. The auricle collects the sound waves and directs vibrations into the external auditory canal.

\section*{External Auditory Canal}

The external auditory canal is approximately 2.5 cm long. The lateral third is an elastic cartilaginous and dense fibrous framework to which thin skin is attached. The medial two thirds is bone lined with thin skin. The external auditory canal ends at the tympanic membrane (Chart 59-1).

The skin of the canal contains hair, sebaceous glands, and ceruminous glands, which secrete a brown, waxlike substance called cerumen (ie, ear wax). The ear's self-cleaning mechanism moves old skin cells and cerumen to the outer part of the ear.

Just anterior to the external auditory canal is the temporomandibular joint. The head of the mandible can be felt by placing a fingertip in the external auditory canal while the patient opens and closes the mouth.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE MIDDLE EAR}

The middle ear, an air-filled cavity, includes the tympanic membrane laterally and the otic capsule medially. The middle ear cleft lies between the two. The middle ear is connected by the eustachian tube to the nasopharynx and is continuous with air-filled cells in the adjacent mastoid portion of the temporal bone.

The eustachian tube, which is approximately 1 mm wide and 35 mm long, connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. Normally, the eustachian tube is closed, but it opens by action of the tensor veli palatini muscle when performing a Valsalva maneuver or when yawning or swallowing. The tube serves as a drainage channel for normal and abnormal secretions of the middle ear and equalizes pressure in the middle ear with that of the atmosphere.

\section*{Tympanic Membrane}

The tympanic membrane (ie, eardrum), about 1 cm in diameter and very thin, is normally pearly gray and translucent. The tympanic membrane consists of three layers of tissue: an outer layer, continuous with the skin of the ear canal; a fibrous middle layer; and an inner mucosal layer, continuous with the lining of the middle ear cavity. Approximately $80 \%$ of the tympanic membrane is composed of all three layers and is called the pars
acute otitis media: inflammation in the middle ear lasting less than 6 weeks
cholesteatoma: tumor of the middle ear or mastoid, or both, that can destroy structures of the temporal bone

nystagmus: involuntary rhythmic eye movement
ossiculoplasty: surgical reconstruction of the middle ear bones to restore hearing otalgia: sensation of fullness or pain in the ear otitis externa (ie, external otitis): inflammation of the external auditory canal
otorrhea: drainage from the ear
otosclerosis: a condition characterized by abnormal spongy bone formation around the stapes
presbycusis: progressive hearing loss associated with aging
rhinorrhea: drainage from the nose
sensorineural hearing loss: loss of hearing related to damage of the end organ for hearing or cranial nerve VIII, or both
tinnitus: subjective perception of sound with internal origin; unwanted noises in the head or ear
tympanoplasty: surgical repair of the tympanic membrane
vertigo: illusion of movement in which the individual or the surroundings are sensed as moving

\section*{Cheurts \\ 59-1 Definition of Terms: Ear Anatomy}

Acoustic: pertaining to sound or the sense of hearing
Cerumen: yellow or brown, waxlike secretion found in the external auditory canal
Cochlea: the winding, snail-shaped bony tube that forms a portion of the inner ear and contains the organ of Corti, the transducer for hearing
Cochlear (acoustic) nerve: the division of the eighth cranial (vestibulocochlear) nerve, which goes to the cochlea
Eustachian tube: the $3-$ to $4-\mathrm{cm}$ tube that extends from the middle ear to the nasopharynx
External auditory canal: the canal leading from the external auditory meatus to the tympanic membrane; about 2.5 cm in length
External ear: the portion of the ear that consists of the auricle and external auditory canal; it is separated from the middle ear by the tympanic membrane
Incus: the second of the three ossicles in the middle ear; it articulates with the malleus and stapes; the anvil
Inner ear: the portion of the ear that consists of the cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular canals
Internal auditory canal: a canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, which houses the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves (cranial nerves VII and VIII)
Malleus: the first (most lateral) and largest of the three ossicles in the middle ear; it is connected to the tympanic membrane laterally and articulates with the incus; the hammer

Middle ear: the small, air-filled cavity in the temporal bone that contains the three ossicles
Organ of Corti: the end organ of hearing, located in the cochlea
Ossicle: a small bone; there are three in the middle ear: malleus, incus, and stapes
Oval window: a fenestra (aperture) between the vestibule of the inner ear and the middle ear, occupied by the base of the stapes
Pinna: the outer part of the external ear, which collects and directs sound waves into the external auditory canal; the auricle
Round window: a fenestra between the middle ear and the inner ear at the base of the cochlea, occupied by the round window membrane
Semicircular canals: the superior, posterior, and lateral bony tubes that form part of the inner ear; contain the receptor organs for balance

Temporal bone: a bone on both sides of the skull at its base; composed of the squamous, mastoid, and petrous portions
Tympanic membrane: the membrane that separates the middle ear from the external auditory canal; also referred to as the eardrum
Vestibulocochlear nerve: cranial nerve VIII; cochlear (acoustic) nerve and vestibular nerve
tensa. The other $20 \%$ of the tympanic membrane lacks the middle layer and is called the pars flaccida. The absence of this fibrous middle layer makes the pars flaccida more vulnerable to pathologic disorders than the pars tensa. Distinguishing landmarks of the tympanic membrane include the annulus, the fibrous border that attaches the eardrum to the temporal bone; the short process of the malleus; the long process of the malleus; the umbo of the malleus, which attaches to the tympanic membrane in the center; the pars flaccida; and the pars tensa (Fig. 59-2).

The tympanic membrane protects the middle ear and conducts sound vibrations from the external canal to the ossicles. The sound pressure is magnified 22 times as a result of transmission from a larger area to a smaller one.

\section*{Ossicles}

The middle ear contains the three smallest bones (ie, ossicles) of the body: malleus, incus, and stapes. The ossicles, which are held in place by joints, muscles, and ligaments, assist in the transmission of sound. Two small fenestrae (ie, oval and round windows), located in the medial wall of the middle ear, separate the middle ear from the inner ear. The footplate of the stapes sits in the oval window, secured by a fibrous annulus, or ring-shaped structure. The footplate transmits sound to the inner ear. The round window, covered by a thin membrane, provides an exit for sound vibrations (see Fig. 59-1).

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE INNER EAR}

The inner ear is housed deep within the temporal bone. The organs for hearing (ie, cochlea) and balance (ie, semicircular canals), as well as cranial nerves VII (ie, facial nerve) and VIII (ie, vestibulocochlear nerve), are all part of this complex anatomy (see Fig. 59-1). The cochlea and semicircular canals are housed in the bony labyrinth. The bony labyrinth surrounds and pro-
tects the membranous labyrinth, which is bathed in a fluid called perilymph.

\section*{Membranous Labyrinth}

The membranous labyrinth is composed of the utricle, the saccule, the cochlear duct, the semicircular canals, and the organ of Corti. The membranous labyrinth contains a fluid called endolymph. The three semicircular canals-posterior, superior, and lateral, which lie at 90 -degree angles to one another-contain sensory receptor organs, arranged to detect rotational movement. These receptor end organs are stimulated by changes in the rate or direction of an individual's movement. The utricle and saccule are involved with linear movements.

\section*{Organ of Corti}

The organ of Corti is located in the cochlea, a snail-shaped, bony tube about 3.5 cm long with two and one-half spiral turns. Membranes separate the cochlear duct (ie, scala media) from the scala vestibuli, and the scala tympani from the basilar membrane. The organ of Corti is located on the basilar membrane stretching from the base to the apex of the cochlea. As sound vibrations enter the perilymph at the oval window and travel along the scala vestibuli, they pass through the scala tympani, enter the cochlear duct, and cause movement of the basilar membrane. The organ of Corti, also called the end organ for hearing, transforms mechanical energy into neural activity and separates sounds into different frequencies. This electrochemical impulse travels through the acoustic nerve to the temporal cortex of the brain to be interpreted as meaningful sound. In the internal auditory canal, the cochlear (acoustic) nerve, arising from the cochlea, joins the vestibular nerve, arising from the semicircular canals, utricle, and saccule, to become the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). This canal also houses the facial nerve and the blood supply from the ear to the brain.

\section*{FUNCTION OF THE EARS}

\section*{Hearing}

Hearing is conducted over two pathways: air and bone. Sounds transmitted by air conduction travel over the air-filled external and middle ear through vibration of the tympanic membrane and ossicles. Sounds transmitted by bone conduction travel directly through bone to the inner ear, bypassing the tympanic membrane and ossicles. Normally, air conduction is the more efficient pathway. However, defects in the tympanic membrane or interruption of the ossicular chain disrupt normal air conduction, which results in a loss of the sound-to-pressure ratio and subsequently in a conductive hearing loss.

\section*{SOUND CONDUCTION AND TRANSMISSION}

Sound enters the ear through the external auditory canal and causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate. These vibrations transmit sound through the lever action of the ossicles to the oval window as mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is then transmitted through the inner ear fluids to the cochlea, stimulating the hair cells, and is subsequently converted to electrical energy. The electrical energy travels through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the central nervous system, where it is analyzed and interpreted in its final form as sound.

Vibrations transmitted by the tympanic membrane to the ossicles of the middle ear are transferred to the cochlea, lodged in the labyrinth of the inner ear. The stapes rocks, causing vibrations (ie, waves) in fluids contained in the inner ear. These fluid waves cause movement of the basilar membrane to occur that then stimulates the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea to move in a wavelike manner. The movements of the tympanic membrane set up electrical currents that stimulate the various areas of the cochlea. The hair cells set up neural impulses that are encoded and then transferred to the auditory cortex in the brain, where they are decoded into a sound message.

The footplate of the stapes receives impulses transmitted by the incus and the malleus from the tympanic membrane. The round window, which opens on the opposite side of the cochlear duct, is protected from sound waves by the intact tympanic membrane, permitting motion of the inner ear fluids by sound wave stimulation. For example, in the normally intact tympanic membrane, sound waves stimulate the oval window first, and a lag occurs before the terminal effect of the stimulus reaches the round window. This lag phase is changed, however, when a perforation of the tympanic membrane is large enough to allow sound waves to impinge on the oval and round windows simultaneously. This effect cancels the lag and prevents the maximal effect of inner ear fluid motility and its subsequent effect in stimulating the hair cells in the organ of Corti. The result is a reduction in hearing ability (Fig. 59-3).

\section*{Balance and Equilibrium}

Body balance is maintained by the cooperation of the muscles and joints of the body (ie, proprioceptive system), the eyes (ie, visual system), and the labyrinth (ie, vestibular system). These areas send their information about equilibrium, or balance, to the brain (ie, cerebellar system) for coordination and perception in the cerebral cortex. The brain obtains its blood supply from the heart and arterial system. A problem in any of these areas, such as arteriosclerosis or impaired vision, can cause a balance disturbance. The vestibular apparatus of the inner ear provides feedback regarding the movements and the position of the head and body in space.

\section*{Assessment}

The external ear is examined by inspection and direct palpation, and the tympanic membrane is inspected with an otoscope and indirect palpation with a pneumatic otoscope. Until the advent of middle ear endoscopy, inspection of the middle ear was impossible. Evaluation of gross auditory acuity also is included in every physical examination.

\section*{INSPECTION OF THE EXTERNAL EAR}

Inspection of the external ear is a simple procedure, but it is often overlooked. The auricle and surrounding tissues should be inspected for deformities, lesions, and discharge, as well as size, symmetry, and angle of attachment to the head. Manipulation of the auricle does not normally elicit pain. If this maneuver is painful, acute external otitis is suspected. Tenderness on palpation in the area of the mastoid may indicate acute mastoiditis or inflammation of the posterior auricular node. Occasionally, sebaceous cysts and tophi (ie, subcutaneous mineral deposits) are present on the pinna. A flaky scaliness on or behind the auricle usually indicates seborrheic dermatitis and can be present on the scalp and facial structures as well.

\section*{OTOSCOPIC EXAMINATION}

To examine the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane, the otoscope should be held in the examiner's right hand, in a pencil-hold position, with the bottom of the scope pointing up (Fig. 59-4). This position prevents the examiner from inserting the otoscope too far into the external canal. Using the opposite hand, the auricle is grasped and gently pulled back to straighten the canal in the adult. If the canal is not straightened with this technique, the tympanic membrane is harder to visualize because of the canal obstructing the view.

The speculum is slowly inserted into the ear canal, with the examiner's eye held close to the magnifying lens of the otoscope to visualize the canal and tympanic membrane. The largest speculum that the canal can accommodate (usually 5 mm in an adult) is guided gently down into the canal and slightly forward. Because the distal portion of the canal is bony and covered by a sensitive layer of epithelium, only light pressure can be used without causing pain. The examiner looks for any discharge, inflammation, or foreign body in the external auditory canal.

The healthy tympanic membrane is pearly gray and is positioned obliquely at the base of the canal. The landmarks are identified, if visible (see Fig. 59-2): the pars tensa, the umbo, the manubrium of the malleus, and its short process. A slow, circular movement of the speculum allows further visualization of the malleolar folds and periphery. The position and color of the membrane and any unusual markings or deviations from normal are documented. The presence of fluid, air bubbles, blood, or masses in the middle ear also are noted.

Proper otoscopic examination of the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane requires that the canal be free of large amounts of cerumen. Cerumen is normally present in the external canal, and small amounts should not interfere with otoscopic examination. If the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized because of cerumen, the cerumen may be removed by gently irrigating the external canal with warm water (if there are no contraindications to this). If adherent cerumen is present, a small amount of mineral oil or over-the-counter cerumen softener may be instilled within the ear canal, and the patient is instructed to

\end{figure}
return for subsequent removal of the cerumen and inspection of the ear. The use of instruments such as a cerumen curette for cerumen removal is reserved for otolaryngologists and nurses with specialized training because of the danger of perforating the tympanic membrane or excoriating the external auditory canal. Cerumen buildup is a common cause of hearing loss and local irritation.

\section*{EVALUATION OF GROSS AUDITORY ACUITY}

A general estimation of hearing can be made by assessing the patient's ability to hear a whispered phrase or a ticking watch, testing one ear at a time. The Weber and Rinne tests may be used to distinguish conductive loss from sensorineural loss when hearing is impaired. These tests are part of the usual screening physical examination and are useful if a more specific assessment is needed, if hearing loss is detected, or if confirmation of audiometric results is desired.

\section*{Whisper Test}

To exclude one ear from the testing, the examiner covers the untested ear with the palm of the hand. Then the examiner whispers softly from a distance of 1 or 2 feet from the unoccluded ear and out of the patient's sight. The patient with normal acuity can correctly repeat what was whispered.

\section*{Weber Test}

The Weber test uses bone conduction to test lateralization of sound. A tuning fork (ideally, 512 Hz ), set in motion by grasping it firmly by its stem and tapping it on the examiner's knee or hand, is placed on the patient's head or forehead (Fig. 59-5). A person with normal hearing will hear the sound equally in both ears or describe the sound as centered in the middle of the head. In cases of conductive hearing loss, such as from otosclerosis or otitis media, the sound is heard better in the affected ear. In cases of sen-

\begin{figure}

\caption{FIGURE 59-5 The Weber test assesses bone conduction of sound. From Weber, J. W., \& Kelley, J. (2003). Health assessment in nursing (2nd ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}
\end{figure}
sorineural hearing loss, resulting from damage to the cochlear or vestibulocochlear nerve, the sound lateralizes to the better-hearing ear. The Weber test is useful for detecting unilateral hearing loss (Table 59-1).

\section*{Rinne Test}

In the Rinne test (pronounced rin-ay), the examiner shifts the stem of a vibrating tuning fork between two positions: 2 inches from the opening of the ear canal (ie, for air conduction) and against the mastoid bone (ie, for bone conduction) (Fig. 59-6). As the position changes, the patient is asked to indicate which tone is louder or when the tone is no longer audible. Normally, sound heard by air conduction is audible longer than sound heard by bone conduction. The Rinne test is useful for distinguishing between conductive and sensorineural hearing losses. With a conductive hearing loss, bone-conducted sound is heard as long as or longer than air-conducted sound, whereas with a sensorineural hearing loss, air-conducted sound is audible longer than boneconducted sound. In a normal hearing ear, air-conducted sound is louder than bone-conducted sound.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

Many diagnostic procedures are available to measure the auditory and vestibular systems indirectly. These tests are usually performed by an audiologist who is recognized by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association with a certificate of clinical competence in audiology.

\section*{AUDIOMETRY}

In detecting hearing loss, audiometry is the single most important diagnostic instrument. Audiometric testing is of two kinds: pure-tone audiometry, in which the sound stimulus consists of a pure or musical tone (the louder the tone before the patient perceives it, the greater the hearing loss), and speech audiometry, in

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 59-1 - Comparison of Weber and Rinne Tests}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline HEARING STATUS & WEBER & RINNE \\
\hline Normal hearing & Sound is heard equally in both ears. & Air conduction is audible longer than bone conduction. \\
\hline Conductive hearing loss & Sound heard best in affected ear (hearing loss). & Sound heard as long or longer in affected ear (hearing loss). \\
\hline Sensorineural hearing loss & Sound heard best in normal hearing ear. & Air conduction is audible longer than bone conduction in affected ear. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
which the spoken word is used to determine the ability to hear and discriminate sounds and words.

When evaluating hearing, three characteristics are important: frequency, pitch, and intensity. Frequency refers to the number of sound waves emanating from a source per second, measured as cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). The normal human ear perceives sounds ranging in frequency from 20 to $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$. The frequencies from 500 to $2,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ are important in understanding everyday speech and are referred to as the speech range or speech frequencies. Pitch is the term used to describe frequency; a tone with 100 Hz is considered of low pitch, and a tone of $10,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ is considered of high pitch.

The unit for measuring loudness (ie, intensity of sound) is the decibel (dB), the pressure exerted by sound. Hearing loss is measured in decibels, a logarithmic function of intensity that is not easily converted into a percentage. The critical level of loudness is approximately 30 dB . The shuffling of papers in quiet surroundings

is about 15 dB ; a low conversation, 40 dB ; and a jet plane 100 feet away, about 150 dB . Sound louder than 80 dB is perceived by the human ear to be harsh and can be damaging to the inner ear. Table 59-2 classifies hearing loss based on decibel level. In surgical treatment of patients with hearing loss, the aim is to improve the hearing level to 30 dB or better within the speech frequencies.

With audiometry, the patient wears earphones and signals to the audiologist when a tone is heard. When the tone is applied directly over the external auditory canal, air conduction is measured. When the stimulus is applied to the mastoid bone, bypassing the conductive mechanism (ie, ossicles), nerve conduction is tested. For accuracy, audiometric evaluations are performed in a soundproof room. Responses are plotted on a graph known as an audiogram, which differentiates conductive from sensorineural hearing loss. Speech discrimination is also measured (Fig. 59-7).

\section*{TYMPANOGRAM}

A tympanogram, or impedance audiometry, measures middle ear muscle reflex to sound stimulation and compliance of the tympanic membrane by changing the air pressure in a sealed ear canal. Compliance is impaired with middle ear disease.

\section*{AUDITORY BRAIN STEM RESPONSE}

The auditory brain stem response is a detectable electrical potential from cranial nerve VIII and the ascending auditory pathways of the brain stem in response to sound stimulation. Electrodes are placed on the patient's forehead. Acoustic stimuli, usually in the form of clicks, are made in the ear. The resulting electrophysiologic measurements can determine at which decibel level a patient hears and whether there are any impairments along the nerve pathways (eg, tumor on cranial nerve VIII).

\section*{ELECTRONYSTAGMOGRAPHY}

Electronystagmography is the measurement and graphic recording of the changes in electrical potentials created by eye movements during spontaneous, positional, or calorically evoked nystagmus.

\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 59-2 - Severity of Hearing Loss} \\

\end{table}

It is also used to assess the oculomotor and vestibular systems and their corresponding interaction. It helps in diagnosing conditions such as Ménière's disease and tumors of the internal auditory canal or posterior fossa. Any vestibular suppressants, such as sedatives, tranquilizers, antihistamines, and alcohol are withheld for 24 hours before testing. Prior to the test the procedure is explained to the patient.

\section*{PLATFORM POSTUROGRAPHY}

Platform posturography is used to investigate postural control capabilities. The integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive cues (ie, sensory integration) with motor response output and coordination of the lower limbs is tested. The patient stands on a platform, surrounded by a screen, and different conditions such as a moving platform with a moving screen or a stationary platform with a moving screen are presented. The responses from the patient on six different conditions are measured and indicate which of the anatomic systems may be impaired. Preparation for the testing is the same as for electronystagmography.

\section*{SINUSOIDAL HARMONIC ACCELERATION}

Sinusoidal harmonic acceleration, or a rotary chair, is used to assess the vestibulo-ocular system by analyzing compensatory eye movements in response to the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the chair. Although such testing cannot identify the side of the lesion in unilateral disease, it helps identify disease and evaluate the course of recovery. The same patient preparation is required as for electronystagmography.

\section*{MIDDLE EAR ENDOSCOPY}

With endoscopes with very small diameters and acute angles, the ear can be examined endoscopically by an endoscopist specializing in otolaryngology. Middle ear endoscopy is performed safely and effectively as an office procedure to evaluate suspected perilymphatic fistula and new-onset conductive hearing loss, the anatomy of the round window before transtympanic treatment of Ménière's disease, and the tympanic cavity before ear surgery to treat chronic middle ear and mastoid infections.

The tympanic membrane is anesthetized topically for about 10 minutes. Then, the external auditory canal is irrigated with sterile normal saline solution. With the aid of a microscope, a tympanotomy is created with a laser beam or a myringotomy knife, so that the endoscope can be inserted into the middle ear cavity. Video and photo documentation can be accomplished through the scope.

\section*{Hearing Loss}

More than 26 million people in the United States have some form of hearing impairment (Larson et. al., 2000). Most can be helped with medical or surgical therapies or with a hearing aid. By the year 2050, about one of every five people in the United States, or almost 58 million people, will be 55 years of age or older. Of this population, almost one half can expect a hearing impairment (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000).

Approximately 10 million persons in the United States have irreversible hearing loss (National Strategic Research Plan of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [NIDCD], 1998). It is estimated that more than 30 million people are exposed to noise levels that produce hearing loss on a daily basis. Occupations such as carpentry, plumbing, and coal mining have the highest risk of noise-induced hearing loss. Researchers report greater than $90 \%$ of coal miners are estimated to have hearing loss by the age of 52 years (Franks, 1996).

Conductive hearing loss usually results from an external ear disorder, such as impacted cerumen, or a middle ear disorder, such as otitis media or otosclerosis. In such instances, the efficient transmission of sound by air to the inner ear is interrupted. A sensorineural loss involves damage to the cochlea or vestibulocochlear nerve.

Mixed hearing loss and functional hearing loss also may occur. The patient with mixed hearing loss has conductive loss and sensorineural loss, resulting from dysfunction of air and bone conduction. A functional (or psychogenic) hearing loss is nonorganic and unrelated to detectable structural changes in the hearing mechanisms; it is usually a manifestation of an emotional disturbance.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Early manifestations of hearing impairment and loss may include tinnitus, increasing inability to hear in groups, and a need to turn up the volume of the television. Hearing impairment can also trigger changes in attitude, the ability to communicate, the awareness of surroundings, and even the ability to protect oneself, affecting the person's quality of life. In a classroom, a student with impaired hearing may be disinterested and inattentive and have failing grades. A person at home may feel isolated because of an inability to hear the clock chime, the refrigerator hum, the birds sing, or the traffic pass. A hearing-impaired pedestrian may attempt to cross the street and fail to hear an approaching car. Hearing-impaired people may miss parts of a conversation. Many people are unaware of their gradual hearing impairment. Often, it is not the person with the hearing loss, but the people with whom he or she is communicating who recognize the impairment first (see Chart 59-2).

For various reasons, some people with hearing loss refuse to seek medical attention or wear a hearing aid. Others feel self-conscious wearing a hearing aid. Insightful patients generally ask those with whom they are trying to communicate to let them know whether difficulties in communication exist. These attitudes and behaviors should be taken into account when counseling patients who need hearing assistance. The decision to wear a hearing aid is a personal one that is affected by these attitudes and behaviors.

\section*{Prevention}

Many environmental factors have an adverse effect on the auditory system and, with time, result in permanent sensorineural hearing loss. The most common is noise.

\section*{Chart 59-2 • ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Symptoms of Hearing Loss}

Speech deterioration: The person who slurs words or drops word endings, or produces flat-sounding speech, may not be hearing correctly. The ears guide the voice, both in loudness and in pronunciation.
Fatigue: If a person tires easily when listening to conversation or to a speech, fatigue may be the result of straining to hear. Under these circumstances, the person may become irritable very easily.
Indifference: It is easy for the person who cannot hear what others say to become depressed and disinterested in life in general.
Social withdrawal: Not being able to hear what is going on causes the hearing-impaired person to withdraw from situations that might prove embarrassing.
Insecurity: Lack of self-confidence and fear of mistakes create a feeling of insecurity in many hearing-impaired people. No one likes to say the wrong thing or do anything that might appear foolish.
Indecision and procrastination: Loss of self-confidence makes it increasingly difficult for a hearing-impaired person to make decisions.
Suspiciousness: The hearing-impaired person, who often hears only part of what is being said, may suspect that others are talking about him or her, or that portions of the conversation are deliberately spoken softly so that he or she will not hear them.
False pride: The hearing-impaired person wants to conceal the hearing loss and thus often pretends to be hearing when he or she actually is not.
Loneliness and unhappiness: Although everyone wishes for quiet now and then, enforced silence can be boring and even somewhat frightening. People with a hearing loss often feel isolated.
Tendency to dominate the conversation: Many hearing-impaired people tend to dominate the conversation, knowing that as long as it is centered on them and they can control it, they are not so likely to be embarrassed by some mistake.

Noise (ie, unwanted and unavoidable sound) has been identified as one of the environmental hazards of the 20th century. The sheer volume of noise that surrounds us daily has increased from a simple annoyance into a potentially dangerous source of physical and psychological damage.

In terms of physical impact, loud, persistent noise has been found to cause constriction of peripheral blood vessels, increased blood pressure and heart rate (because of increased secretion of adrenalin), and increased gastrointestinal activity. Additional research is needed to address the overall effects of noise on the human body. It seems certain, however, that a quiet environment is more conducive to peace of mind. A person who is ill feels more at ease when noise is kept to a minimum. There are numerous factors that contribute to hearing loss (see Chart 59-3).

The term noise-induced hearing loss is used to describe hearing loss that follows a long period of exposure to loud noise (eg, heavy machinery, engines, artillery). Acoustic trauma refers to the hearing loss caused by a single exposure to an extremely intense noise, such as an explosion. Usually, noise-induced hearing loss occurs at a high frequency (around $4,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ ). However, with continued noise exposure, the hearing loss can become more severe and include adjacent frequencies. The minimum noise level known to cause noise-induced hearing loss, regardless of duration, is about 85 to 90 dB .

Noise exposure is inherent in many jobs (eg, mechanics, printers, pilots, musicians) and in hobbies such as woodworking and

\section*{Risk Factors for Hearing Loss}
- Family history of sensorineural impairment
- Congenital malformations of the cranial structure (ear)
- Low birth weight ( $<1500 \mathrm{~g}$ )
- Use of ototoxic medications (eg, gentamicin, loop diuretics)
- Recurrent ear infections
- Bacterial meningitis
- Chronic exposure to loud noises
- Perforation of the tympanic membrane
hunting. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that workers wear ear protection to prevent noise-induced hearing loss when exposed to noise above the legal limits. There are no medications that protect against noise-induced hearing loss; hearing loss is permanent because the hair cells in the organ of Corti are destroyed. Ear protection against noise is the most effective preventive measure available.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

About $30 \%$ of people 65 years of age and older and $50 \%$ of people 75 years and older have hearing difficulties. The cause is unknown; linkages to diet, metabolism, arteriosclerosis, stress, and heredity have been inconsistent (Cruickshanks et al., 1998).

With aging, changes occur in the ear that may eventually lead to hearing deficits. Although few changes occur in the external ear, cerumen tends to become harder and drier, posing a greater chance of impaction. In the middle ear, the tympanic membrane may atrophy or become sclerotic. In the inner ear, cells at the base of the cochlea degenerate. A familial predisposition to sensorineural hearing loss is also seen, manifested by a loss in the ability to hear high-frequency sounds, followed in time by the loss of middle and lower frequencies. The term presbycusis is used to describe this progressive hearing loss.

In addition to age-related changes, other factors can affect hearing in the elderly population, such as lifelong exposure to loud noises (eg, jets, guns, heavy machinery, circular saws). Certain medications, such as aminoglycosides and aspirin, have ototoxic effects when renal changes (eg, in the older person) result in delayed medication excretion and increased levels of the medications in the blood. Many older people take quinine for treatment of leg cramps; quinine can cause a hearing loss. Psychogenic factors and other disease processes (eg, diabetes) also may be partially responsible for sensorineural hearing loss.

When a hearing problem occurs, an evaluation is warranted. Even with the best medical care, the person must learn to adjust to various degrees of hearing loss. Care of elderly patients includes recognizing emotional reactions related to hearing loss, such as suspicion of others because of an inability to hear adequately; frustration and anger, with repeated statements such as, "I didn't hear what you said"; and feelings of insecurity because of the inability to hear the telephone or alarms.

\section*{Medical Management}

If a hearing loss is permanent or untreatable with medical or surgical intervention or if the patient elects not to have surgery, aural rehabilitation (discussed at the end of the chapter) may be beneficial.

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Hearing Disorders}

\section*{SELECTED HEARING DISORDERS INFLUENCED BY GENETIC FACTORS}
- Autosomal dominant hearing loss
- Autosomal recessive hearing loss (eg, connexin 26 gene)
- Otosclerosis

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Assess for other family members in several generations with hearing loss (autosomal dominant hearing loss)
- Inquire about genetic relatedness (eg, individuals who are related, such as first cousins, have a higher chance to share the same recessive genes-autosomal recessive hearing loss)
- Inquire about age at onset of hearing loss

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- Assess for related genetic conditions, such as vision impairment (eg, retinitis pigmentosa in Usher syndrome; thyroid disorder in Pendred syndrome)

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether DNA gene mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on affected family members.
- If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of genetic testing, and gene-based interventions.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to families with newly diagnosed geneticrelated sensorineural disorders.
- Participate in management and coordination of care of patients with genetic conditions, and individuals predisposed to develop or pass on a genetic condition.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse who understands the different types of hearing loss will be more successful in adopting a communication style to fit the patient's needs. Trying to speak in a loud voice to a person who cannot hear high-frequency sounds only makes understanding more difficult. However, strategies such as talking into the less-
impaired ear and using gestures and facial expressions can help (see Chart 59-4).

A major issue for many deaf and hearing-impaired people is that they have other health problems that often do not receive attention, in large part because of communication problems with their health care practitioners. To effectively meet the health care needs of these patients, practitioners are legally obligated to make

\section*{59-4 Guidelines for Communicating With the Hearing-Impaired Person}

For the hearing-impaired person whose speech is difficult to understand:
- Devote full attention to what the person is saying. Look and listen-do not try to attend to another task while listening.
- Engage the speaker in conversation when it is possible for you to anticipate the replies. This enables you to become accustomed to any peculiarities in speech patterns.
- Try to determine the essential context of what is being said; you can often fill in the details from context.
- Do not try to appear as if you understand if you do not.
- If you cannot understand at all or have serious doubt about your ability to understand what is being said, have the person write the message rather than risk misunderstanding. Having the person repeat the message in speech, after you know its content, also aids you in becoming accustomed to the person's pattern of speech.

For the hearing-impaired person who speech reads:
- When speaking, always face the person as directly as possible.
- Make sure your face is as clearly visible as possible. Locate yourself so that your face is well lighted; avoid being silhouetted against strong light. Do not obscure the person's view of your mouth in any way; avoid talking with any object held in your mouth.
- Be sure that the patient knows the topic or subject before going ahead with what you plan to say. This enables the person to use contextual clues in speech reading.
- Speak slowly and distinctly, pausing more frequently than you would normally.
- If you question whether some important direction or instruction has been understood, check to be certain that the patient has the full meaning of your message.
- If for any reason your mouth must be covered (as with a mask) and you must direct or instruct the patient, write the message.
accommodations for the patient's inability to hear. Providing the services of interpreters or those who can communicate through sign language is essential in many situations so that the practitioner can effectively communicate with the patient.

During health care and screening procedures, the practitioner (eg, dentist, physician, nurse) must be aware that patients who are deaf or hearing impaired are unable to read lips, see a signer, or read written materials in dark rooms required during some diagnostic tests. The same situation exists if the practitioner is wearing a mask or not in sight (eg, x-ray studies, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], colonoscopy).

Nurses and other health care practitioners must work with deaf and hearing-impaired patients and their families to identify workable and effective means of communication. Nurses can serve as catalysts throughout the health care system to ensure that accommodations are made to meet the communication needs of these patients.

\section*{Conditions of the External Ear}

\section*{CERUMEN IMPACTION}

Cerumen normally accumulates in the external canal in various amounts and colors. Although wax does not usually need to be removed, impaction occasionally occurs, causing otalgia, a sensation of fullness or pain in the ear, with or without a hearing loss. Accumulation of cerumen is especially significant in the geriatric population as a cause of hearing deficit. Attempts to clear the external auditory canal with matches, hairpins, and other implements are dangerous because trauma to the skin, infection, and damage to the tympanic membrane can occur.

\section*{Management}

Cerumen can be removed by irrigation, suction, or instrumentation. Unless the patient has a perforated eardrum or an inflamed external ear (ie, otitis externa), gentle irrigation usually helps remove impacted cerumen, particularly if it is not tightly packed in the external auditory canal. For successful removal, the water stream must flow behind the obstructing cerumen to move it first laterally and then out of the canal. To prevent injury, the lowest effective pressure should be used. If the eardrum behind the impaction is perforated, however, water can enter the middle ear, producing acute vertigo and infection. If irrigation is unsuccessful, direct visual, mechanical removal can be performed on a cooperative patient by a trained health care provider.

Instilling a few drops of warmed glycerin, mineral oil, or halfstrength hydrogen peroxide into the ear canal for 30 minutes can soften cerumen before its removal. Ceruminolytic agents, such as peroxide in glyceryl (Debrox), are available; however, these compounds may cause an allergic dermatitis reaction. Using any softening solution two or three times a day for several days is generally sufficient. If the cerumen cannot be dislodged by these methods, instruments, such as a cerumen curette, aural suction, and a binocular microscope for magnification, can be used.

\section*{FOREIGN BODIES}

Some objects are inserted intentionally into the ear by adults who may have been trying to clean the external canal or relieve itching or by children who introduce the objects. Other objects, such as insects, peas, beans, pebbles, toys, and beads, may enter or be introduced into the ear canal. In either case, the effects may range from no symptoms to profound pain and decreased hearing.

\section*{Management}

Removing a foreign body from the external auditory canal can be quite challenging. The three standard methods for removing foreign bodies are the same as those for removing cerumen: irrigation, suction, and instrumentation. The contraindications for irrigation are also the same. Foreign vegetable bodies and insects tend to swell; thus, irrigation is contraindicated. Usually, an insect can be dislodged by instilling mineral oil, which will kill the insect and allow it to be removed.

Attempts to remove any foreign body from the external canal may be dangerous in unskilled hands. The object may be pushed completely into the bony portion of the canal, lacerating the skin and perforating the tympanic membrane. In difficult cases, the foreign body may have to be extracted in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia.

\section*{EXTERNAL OTITIS (OTITIS EXTERNA)}

External otitis, or otitis externa, refers to an inflammation of the external auditory canal. Causes include water in the ear canal (ie, swimmer's ear); trauma to the skin of the ear canal, permitting entrance of organisms into the tissues; and systemic conditions, such as vitamin deficiency and endocrine disorders. Bacterial or fungal infections are most frequently encountered. The most common bacterial pathogens associated with external otitis are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species. The most common fungus isolated in both normal and infected ears is $A_{s}$ pergillus. External otitis is often caused by a dermatosis such as psoriasis, eczema, or seborrheic dermatitis. Even allergic reactions to hair spray, hair dye, and permanent wave lotions can cause dermatitis, which clears when the offending agent is removed.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient usually reports pain, discharge from the external auditory canal, aural tenderness (usually not present in middle ear infections), and occasionally fever, cellulitis, and lymphadenopathy. Other symptoms may include pruritus and hearing loss or a feeling of fullness. On otoscopic examination, the ear canal is erythematous and edematous. Discharge may be yellow or green and foul smelling. In fungal infections, the hairlike black spores may even be visible.

\section*{Medical Management}

The principles of therapy are aimed at relieving the discomfort, reducing the swelling of the ear canal, and eradicating the infection. Patients may require analgesics for the first 48 to 92 hours. If the tissues of the external canal are edematous, a wick should be inserted to keep the canal open so that liquid medications (eg, Burow's solution, antibiotic otic preparations) can be introduced. These medications may be administered by dropper at room temperature. Such medications usually combine antibiotic and corticosteroid agents to soothe the inflamed tissues. For cellulitis or fever, systemic antibiotics may be prescribed. For fungal disorders, antifungal agents are prescribed.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nurses need to teach patients not to clean the external auditory canal with cotton-tipped applicators, to avoid swimming, and not to allow water to enter the ear when shampooing or shower-
ing. A cotton ball can be covered in a water-insoluble gel such as petroleum jelly and placed in the ear as a barrier to water contamination. Infection can be prevented by using antiseptic otic preparations after swimming (eg, Swim Ear, Ear Dry), unless there is a history of tympanic membrane perforation or a current ear infection.

\section*{MALIGNANT EXTERNAL OTITIS}

A more serious, although rare, external ear infection is malignant external otitis (ie, temporal bone osteomyelitis). This is a progressive, debilitating, and occasionally fatal infection of the external auditory canal, the surrounding tissue, and the base of the skull. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is usually the infecting organism in patients with low resistance to infection (eg, patients with diabetes). Successful treatment includes control of the diabetes, administration of antibiotics (usually intravenously), and aggressive local wound care. Standard parenteral antibiotic treatment includes the combination of an antipseudomonal agent and an aminoglycoside, both of which have potentially serious side effects. Because aminoglycosides are nephrotoxic and ototoxic, serum aminoglycoside levels and renal and auditory function must be monitored during therapy. Local wound care includes limited débridement of the infected tissue, including bone and cartilage, depending on the extent of the infection.

\section*{MASSES OF THE EXTERNAL EAR}

Exostoses are small, hard, bony protrusions found in the lower posterior bony portion of the ear canal; they usually occur bilaterally. The skin covering the exostosis is normal. Many people think exostoses are caused by an exposure to cold water, as in scuba diving or surfing. The usual treatment, if any, is surgical excision.

Malignant tumors also may be found in the external ear. Most common are basal cell carcinomas on the pinna and squamous cell carcinomas in the ear canal. If untreated, squamous cell carcinoma may spread through the temporal bone, causing facial nerve paralysis and hearing loss. Carcinomas must be treated surgically.

\section*{GAPPING EARRING PUNCTURE}

Gapping earring puncture results from wearing heavy pierced earrings for a long time or after an infection, or as a reaction from the earring or other impurities in the earring. One or more gapping punctures may result from wearing more than one earring. Whatever its cause, this deformity can only be corrected surgically. The edges of the perforations are excised on the lateral and medial surfaces of the earlobe. Next, the entire tract is removed, joining the above two incisions and resulting in a much larger defect that is closed separately on each surface. Then, an antibiotic dressing is applied.

\section*{Conditions of the Middle Ear}

\section*{TYMPANIC MEMBRANE PERFORATION}

Perforation of the tympanic membrane is usually caused by infection or trauma. Sources of trauma include skull fracture, explosive injury, or a severe blow to the ear. Less frequently, perforation is caused by foreign objects (eg, cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, keys) that have been pushed too far into the external auditory canal. In addition to tympanic membrane perforation, injury to the ossicles and even the inner ear may result from this type of
action. Attempts by patients to clear the external auditory canal should be discouraged. During infection, the tympanic membrane can rupture if the pressure in the middle ear exceeds the atmospheric pressure in the external auditory canal.

\section*{Medical Management}

Although most tympanic membrane perforations heal spontaneously within weeks after rupture, some may take several months to heal. Some perforations persist because scar tissue grows over the edges of the perforation, preventing extension of the epithelial cells across the margins and final healing. In the case of a head injury or temporal bone fracture, a patient is observed for evidence of cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or rhinorrhea-a clear, watery drainage from the ear or nose, respectively. While healing, the ear must be protected from water.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Perforations that do not heal on their own may require surgery. The decision to perform a tympanoplasty (ie, surgical repair of the tympanic membrane) is usually based on the need to prevent potential infection from water entering the ear or the desire to improve the patient's hearing. Performed on an outpatient basis, tympanoplasty may involve a variety of surgical techniques. In all techniques, tissue is placed across the perforation to allow healing. Surgery is usually successful in closing the perforation permanently and improving hearing.

\section*{ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA}

Acute otitis media is an acute infection of the middle ear, usually lasting less than 6 weeks. The primary cause of acute otitis media is usually Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, which enter the middle ear after eustachian tube dysfunction caused by obstruction related to upper respiratory infections, inflammation of surrounding structures (eg, sinusitis, adenoid hypertrophy), or allergic reactions (eg, allergic rhinitis). Bacteria can enter the eustachian tube from contaminated secretions in the nasopharynx and the middle ear from a tympanic membrane perforation. A purulent exudate is usually present in the middle ear, resulting in a conductive hearing loss.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms of otitis media vary with the severity of the infection. The condition, usually unilateral in adults, may be accompanied by otalgia. The pain is relieved after spontaneous perforation or therapeutic incision of the tympanic membrane. Other symptoms may include drainage from the ear, fever, and hearing loss. On otoscopic examination, the external auditory canal appears normal. The patient reports no pain with movement of the auricle. The tympanic membrane is erythematous and often bulging. Table 59-3 differentiates acute external otitis from acute otitis media.

\section*{Medical Management}

The outcome of acute otitis media depends on the efficacy of therapy (ie, the prescribed dose of an oral antibiotic and the duration of therapy), the virulence of the bacteria, and the physical status of the patient. With early and appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, otitis media may resolve with no serious sequelae.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 59-3 - Clinical Features of Otitis}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline FEATURE & ACUTE OTITIS EXTERNA & ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA \\
\hline Otorrhea & May or may not be present & Present if tympanic membrane perforates; discharge is profuse \\
\hline Otalgia & Persistent, may awaken patient at night & Relieved if tympanic membrane ruptures \\
\hline Aural tenderness & Present on palpation of auricle & Usually absent \\
\hline Systemic symptoms & Absent & Fever, upper respiratory infection, rhinitis \\
\hline Edema of external auditory canal & Present & Absent \\
\hline Tympanic membrane & May appear normal & Erythema, bulging, may be perforated \\
\hline Hearing loss & Conductive type & Conductive type \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If drainage occurs, an antibiotic otic preparation is usually prescribed. The condition may become subacute (lasting 3 weeks to 3 months), with persistent purulent discharge from the ear. Rarely does permanent hearing loss occur. Secondary complications involving the mastoid and other serious intracranial complications, such as meningitis or brain abscess, although rare, can occur.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

An incision in the tympanic membrane is known as myringotomy or tympanotomy. The tympanic membrane is numbed with a local anesthetic such as phenol or by iontophoresis (ie, electrical current flows through a lidocaine-and-epinephrine solution to numb the ear canal and tympanic membrane). The procedure is painless and takes less than 15 minutes. Under microscopic guidance, an incision is made through the tympanic membrane to relieve pressure and to drain serous or purulent fluid from the middle ear.

Normally, this procedure is unnecessary for treating acute otitis media, but it may be performed if pain persists. Myringotomy also allows the drainage to be analyzed (by culture and sensitivity testing) so that the infecting organism can be identified and appropriate antibiotic therapy prescribed. The incision heals within 24 to 72 hours.

If episodes of acute otitis media recur and there is no contraindication, a ventilating, or pressure-equalizing, tube may be inserted. The ventilating tube, which temporarily takes the place of the eustachian tube in equalizing pressure, is retained for 6 to 18 months. The ventilating tube is then extruded with normal skin migration of the tympanic membrane, with the hole healing in nearly every case. Ventilating tubes are more commonly used to treat recurrent episodes of acute otitis media in children than in adults.

\section*{SEROUS OTITIS MEDIA}

Serous otitis media (ie, middle ear effusion) implies fluid, without evidence of active infection, in the middle ear. In theory, this fluid results from a negative pressure in the middle ear caused by eustachian tube obstruction. This condition is found primarily in children. When it occurs in adults, an underlying cause for the eustachian tube dysfunction must be sought. Middle ear effusion is frequently seen in patients after radiation therapy or barotrauma and in patients with eustachian tube dysfunction from a concurrent upper respiratory infection or allergy. Barotrauma results from sudden pressure changes in the middle ear caused by changes in barometric pressure, as in scuba diving or airplane descent. A carcinoma (eg, nasopharyngeal cancer) obstructing the
eustachian tube should be ruled out in an adult with persistent unilateral serous otitis media.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients may complain of hearing loss, fullness in the ear or a sensation of congestion, and perhaps even popping and crackling noises, which occur as the eustachian tube attempts to open. The tympanic membrane appears dull on otoscopy, and air bubbles may be visualized in the middle ear. Usually, the audiogram shows a conductive hearing loss.

\section*{Management}

Serous otitis media need not be treated medically unless infection occurs (ie, acute otitis media). If the hearing loss associated with middle ear effusion is a problem for the patient, a myringotomy can be performed, and a tube may be placed to keep the middle ear ventilated. Corticosteroids in small doses sometimes decrease the edema of the eustachian tube in cases of barotrauma. Decongestants have not proved effective. A Valsalva maneuver, which forcibly opens the eustachian tube by increasing nasopharyngeal pressure, may be cautiously performed. Performing the Valsalva maneuver may cause worsening pain or perforation of the tympanic membrane.

\section*{CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA}

Chronic otitis media is the result of repeated episodes of acute otitis media causing irreversible tissue pathology and persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane. Chronic infections of the middle ear damage the tympanic membrane, destroy the ossicles, and involve the mastoid. Before the discovery of antibiotics, infections of the mastoid were life-threatening. The use of medications in acute otitis media has made acute mastoiditis a rare condition in developed countries.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms may be minimal, with varying degrees of hearing loss and the presence of a persistent or intermittent, foul-smelling otorrhea. Pain is not usually experienced, except in cases of acute mastoiditis, when the postauricular area is tender to the touch and may be erythematous and edematous. Otoscopic evaluation of the tympanic membrane may show a perforation, and cholesteatoma can be identified as a white mass behind the tympanic membrane or coming through to the external canal from a perforation.

Cholesteatoma is an ingrowth of the skin of the external layer of the eardrum into the middle ear. It is generally caused by a chronic retraction pocket of the tympanic membrane, creating a persistently high negative pressure of the middle ear. The skin forms a sac that fills with degenerated skin and sebaceous materials. The sac can attach to the structures of the middle ear or mastoid, or both. Cholesteatoma alone usually does not cause pain; however, if treatment or surgery is delayed, the cholesteatoma may destroy structures of the temporal bone. In cases of cholesteatoma, audiometric tests often show a conductive or mixed hearing loss.

\section*{Medical Management}

Local treatment of chronic otitis media consists of careful suctioning of the ear under microscopic guidance. Instillation of antibiotic drops or application of antibiotic powder is used to treat a purulent discharge. Systemic antibiotics are usually not prescribed except in cases of acute infection.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical procedures, including tympanoplasty, ossiculoplasty, and mastoidectomy, are used after medical treatments are determined to be ineffective. Chronic otitis media can cause chronic mastoiditis and lead to the formation of cholesteatoma. It can occur in the middle ear, mastoid cavity, or both, often dictating the type of surgery to be performed. If untreated, cholesteatoma will continue to enlarge, possibly causing damage to the facial nerve and horizontal canal and destruction of other surrounding structures.

Tympanoplasty. The most common surgical procedure for chronic otitis media is a tympanoplasty, or surgical reconstruction of the tympanic membrane. Reconstruction of the ossicles may also be required. The purposes of a tympanoplasty are to reestablish middle ear function, close the perforation, prevent recurrent infection, and improve hearing.

There are five types of tympanoplasties. The simplest surgical procedure, type I (myringoplasty), is designed to close a perforation in the tympanic membrane. The other procedures, types II through V, involve more extensive repair of middle ear structures. The structures and the degree of involvement can differ, but all tympanoplasty procedures include restoring the continuity of the sound conduction mechanism.

Tympanoplasty is performed through the external auditory canal with a transcanal approach or through a postauricular incision. The contents of the middle ear are carefully inspected, and the ossicular chain is evaluated. Ossicular interruption is most frequent in chronic otitis media, but problems of reconstruction can also occur with malformations of the middle ear and ossicular dislocations due to head injuries. Dramatic improvement in hearing can result from closure of a perforation and reestablishment of the ossicles. Surgery is usually performed in an outpatient environment under moderate sedation or general anesthesia.

Ossiculoplasty. Many people use the term tympanoplasty to include ossiculoplasty, or surgical reconstruction of the middle ear bones to restore hearing. Prostheses made of materials such as Teflon, stainless steel, and hydroxyapatite are used to reconnect the ossicles, thereby reestablishing the sound conduction mechanism. However, the greater the damage, the lower the success rate for restoring normal hearing.

Mastoidectomy. The objectives of mastoid surgery are to remove the cholesteatoma, gain access to diseased structures, and create a dry and healthy ear. If possible, the ossicles are reconstructed during the initial surgical procedure. Occasionally, extensive disease dictates that this be performed as part of a planned second-stage operation.

A mastoidectomy is usually performed through a postauricular incision. Infection is eliminated by removing the mastoid air cells. Although infrequently injured, the facial nerve, which runs through the middle ear and mastoid, is at some risk for injury during mastoid surgery. As the patient awakens from anesthesia, any evidence of facial paresis should be reported to the physician. A second mastoidectomy may be necessary to check for recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. The hearing mechanism may be reconstructed at this time. The success rate for correcting this conductive hearing loss is approximately $75 \%$. Surgery is usually performed in an outpatient setting. The patient has a mastoid pressure dressing, which can be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS:}

\section*{THE PATIENT UNDERGOING MASTOID SURGERY}

Although several otologic surgical procedures are performed under moderate sedation, mastoid surgery is performed using general anesthesia.

\section*{Assessment}

The health history includes a complete description of the ear problem, including infection, otalgia, otorrhea, hearing loss, and vertigo. Data are collected about the duration and intensity of the problem, its causes, and previous treatments. Information is obtained about other health problems and all medications that the patient is taking. Medication allergies and family history of ear disease also should be obtained.

Physical assessment includes observation for erythema, edema, otorrhea, lesions, and characteristics such as odor and color of discharge. The results of the audiogram should be reviewed.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Anxiety related to surgical procedure, potential loss of hearing, potential taste disturbance, and potential loss of facial movement
- Acute pain related to mastoid surgery
- Risk for infection related to mastoidectomy, placement of grafts, prostheses, electrodes, and surgical trauma to surrounding tissues and structures
- Disturbed auditory sensory perception related to ear disorder, surgery, or packing
- Risk for trauma related to balance difficulties or vertigo during the immediate postoperative period
- Disturbed sensory perception related to potential damage to facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) and chorda tympani nerve
- Impaired skin integrity related to ear surgery, incisions, and graft sites
- Deficient knowledge about mastoid disease, surgical procedure, and postoperative care and expectations

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals of caring for a patient undergoing mastoidectomy include reduction of anxiety; freedom from pain and discomfort; prevention of infection; stable or improved hearing and communication; absence of injury from vertigo; absence of or adjustment to sensory or perceptual alterations; return of skin integrity; and increased knowledge regarding the disease, surgical procedure, and postoperative care.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Information that the otologic surgeon has discussed with the patient, including anesthesia, the location of the incision (postauricular), and expected surgical results (eg, hearing, balance, taste, facial movement), is reinforced. The patient also is encouraged to discuss any anxieties and concerns about the surgery.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Although most patients complain very little about incisional pain after mastoid surgery, they do have some ear discomfort. Aural fullness or pressure after surgery is caused by residual blood or fluid in the middle ear. The prescribed analgesic may be taken for the first 24 hours after surgery and then only as needed. The patient is instructed in the use of and side effects of the medication.

A tympanoplasty may also be performed at the time of the mastoidectomy. A wick or external auditory canal packing is used after a tympanoplasty to stabilize the tympanic membrane. Patients should be informed that they may experience intermittent sharp, shooting pains in the ear for 2 to 3 weeks after surgery as the eustachian tube opens and allows air to enter the middle ear.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Measures are initiated to prevent infection in the operated ear. The external auditory canal wick, or packing, may be impregnated with an antibiotic solution before instillation. Prophylactic antibiotics are administered as prescribed, and the patient is instructed to prevent water from entering the external auditory canal for 6 weeks. A cotton ball or lamb's wool covered with a water-insoluble substance (eg, petroleum jelly) and placed loosely in the ear canal usually prevents water contamination. The postauricular incision should be kept dry for 2 days. Signs of infection such as an elevated temperature and purulent drainage are reported. Some serosanguineous drainage from the external auditory canal is normal after surgery.

\section*{IMPROVING HEARING AND COMMUNICATION}

Hearing in the operated ear may be reduced for several weeks because of edema, accumulation of blood and tissue fluid in the middle ear, and dressings or packing. Measures are initiated to improve hearing and communication, such as reducing environmental noise, facing the patient when speaking, speaking clearly and distinctly without shouting, providing good lighting if the patient relies on speech reading, and using nonverbal clues (eg, facial expression, pointing, gestures) and other forms of communication. Family members or significant others are instructed about effective ways to communicate with the patient. If the patient uses assistive hearing devices, one can be used in the unaffected ear.

\section*{PREVENTING INJURY}

Vertigo may occur after mastoid surgery if the semicircular canals or other areas of the inner ear are traumatized. This symp-
tom is relatively uncommon after this type of ear surgery and usually is temporary. Antiemetics or antivertiginous medications (eg, antihistamines) can be prescribed if a balance disturbance or vertigo occurs. The patient should be instructed about the expected effects and potential side effects. Safety measures such as assisted ambulation are implemented to prevent falls. Safety measures must also be implemented at home to prevent falls and injury.

\section*{PREVENTING ALTERED SENSORY PERCEPTION}

Facial nerve injury is a potential, although rare, complication of mastoid surgery. The patient is instructed to report immediately any evidence of facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) weakness, such as drooping of the mouth on the operated side. A more frequent occurrence is a temporary disturbance in the chorda tympani nerve, a small branch of the facial nerve that runs through the middle ear. Patients experience a taste disturbance and dry mouth on the side of surgery for several months until the nerve regenerates.

\section*{PROMOTING WOUND HEALING}

The patient is instructed to avoid heavy lifting, straining, exertion, and nose blowing for 2 to 3 weeks after surgery to prevent dislodging the tympanic membrane graft or ossicular prosthesis.

\section*{INCREASING KNOWLEDGE}

The patient is informed about the surgery and operating room environment. Discussing postoperative expectations helps to decrease anxiety about the unknown. Because postoperative instructions for mastoid surgery vary among otologic surgeons, it is important for the nurse to be aware of the surgeon's preferences when teaching the patient.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients require instruction about prescribed medication therapy, such as analgesics, antivertiginous agents, and antihistamines prescribed for balance disturbance. Teaching includes information about the expected effects and potential side effects of the medication. Patients also need instruction about any activity restrictions. Possible complications such as infection, facial nerve weakness, or taste disturbances, including the signs and symptoms to report immediately, should be addressed (see Chart 59-5).

\section*{Continuing Care}

Some patients, particularly elderly patients, who have had mastoid surgery may require the services of a home care nurse for a few days after returning home. However, most people find that assistance from a family member or a friend is sufficient. The caregiver and patient are cautioned that the patient may experience some vertigo and will therefore require help with ambulation to avoid falling. Any symptoms of complications are to be reported promptly to the surgeon. The importance of scheduling and keeping follow-up appointments is also stressed.

\section*{OTOSCLEROSIS}

Otosclerosis involves the stapes and is thought to result from the formation of new, abnormal spongy bone, especially around the oval window, with resulting fixation of the stapes. The efficient transmission of sound is prevented because the stapes cannot vibrate and carry the sound as conducted from the malleus and incus to the inner ear. More common in women and frequently hereditary, otosclerosis may be worsened by pregnancy.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The condition can involve one or both ears and manifests as a progressive conductive or mixed hearing loss. The patient may or may not complain of tinnitus. Otoscopic examination usually reveals a normal tympanic membrane. Bone conduction is better than air conduction on Rinne testing. The audiogram confirms conductive hearing loss or mixed loss, especially in the low frequencies.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is no known nonsurgical treatment for otosclerosis. However, some physicians believe the use of Florical (a fluoride supplement) can mature the abnormal spongy bone growth. Amplification with a hearing aid also may help.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

A stapedectomy, performed through the canal, involves removing the stapes superstructure and part of the footplate and inserting a tissue graft and a suitable prosthesis (Fig. 59-8). Some surgeons elect to remove only a small part of the stapes footplate (ie, stapedotomy). Regardless of the method used, the prosthesis bridges the gap between the incus and the inner ear, providing better sound conduction. Stapes surgery is very successful in improving hearing. Balance disturbance or true vertigo, which rarely occurs in other middle ear surgical procedures, can occur for a short time after stapedectomy.

\section*{MIDDLE EAR MASSES}

Other than cholesteatoma, masses in the middle ear are rare. Glomus jugulare is a tumor that arises from the jugular bulb. A histologically identical tumor that arises from Jacobson's nerve and remains limited to the middle ear is known as a glomus tympanicum. On otoscopy, a red blemish on or behind the tympanic membrane is indicative of a glomus tumor. The treatment for glomus tumors is surgical excision, except in poor surgical candidates, in whom radiation therapy is used.

A facial nerve neuroma is a tumor on cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve. These types of tumors are usually not visible on otoscopic examination but are suspected when a patient presents with a facial nerve paresis. X-ray evaluation is necessary to determine

\end{figure}
the site of the tumor along the facial nerve. The treatment is surgical removal.

Other less common problems of the middle ear include cholesterin granuloma and tympanosclerosis. Cholesterin granuloma is an immune system reaction to the byproducts of blood (ie, cholesterol crystals) within the middle ear. Tympanosclerosis is a deposit of collagen and minerals within the middle ear that can harden around the ossicles as a result of repeated infections. It can also be found as plaque on the tympanic membrane; this can decrease hearing.

\section*{Conditions of the Inner Ear}

Disorders of balance and the vestibular system involving the inner ear afflict more than 30 million Americans 17 years of age or older. Falls resulting from these disorders account for more than 100,000 hip fractures in elderly people each year (NIDCD, 1998).

The term dizziness is used frequently by patients and health care providers to describe any altered sensation of orientation in space. Vertigo is defined as the misperception or illusion of motion of the person or the surroundings. Most people with vertigo describe a spinning sensation or say they feel as though objects are moving around them. Ataxia is a failure of muscular coordination
and may be present in patients with vestibular disease. Syncope, fainting, and loss of consciousness are not forms of vertigo, nor are they characteristic of an ear problem; they usually indicate disease in the cardiovascular system.

Nystagmus is an involuntary rhythmic movement of the eyes. Nystagmus occurs normally when a person watches a rapidly moving object (eg, through the side window of a moving car or train). However, pathologically it is an ocular disorder associated with vestibular dysfunction. Nystagmus can be horizontal, vertical, or rotary and can be caused by a disorder in the central or peripheral nervous system.

\section*{MOTION SICKNESS}

Motion sickness is a disturbance of equilibrium caused by constant motion. For example, it can occur aboard a ship, while riding on a merry-go-round or swing, or in the back seat of a car.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The syndrome manifests itself in sweating, pallor, nausea, and vomiting caused by vestibular overstimulation. These manifestations may persist for several hours after the stimulation stops.

\section*{Management}

Over-the-counter antihistamines used to treat vertigo, such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) or meclizine hydrochloride (Bonine), provide some relief. Anticholinergic medications, such as scopolamine patches, may be helpful. These must be replaced every few days. Side effects such as dry mouth and drowsiness occur with these medications, which may prove to be more troublesome than helpful. Potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery should be avoided if the patient experiences drowsiness.

\section*{MÉNIÈRE'S DISEASE}

Ménière's disease is an abnormal inner ear fluid balance caused by a malabsorption in the endolymphatic sac. Evidence indicates that many people with Ménière's disease may have a blockage in the endolymphatic duct. Regardless of the cause, endolymphatic hydrops, a dilation in the endolymphatic space, develops. Either increased pressure in the system or rupture of the inner ear membranes occurs, producing symptoms of Ménière's disease.

Ménière's disease affects more than 2.4 million people in the United States. More common in adults, it has an average age of onset in the 40s, with symptoms usually beginning between the ages of 20 and 60 years. However, the disease has been reported in children as young as age 4 years and in adults up to the 90 s. Ménière's disease appears to be equally common in both genders. The right and left ears are affected with equal frequency; the disease occurs bilaterally in about $20 \%$ of patients. About $20 \%$ of the patients have a positive family history for the disease (Knox \& McPherson, 1997).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Ménière's disease involves the following symptoms: fluctuating, progressive sensorineural hearing loss; tinnitus or a roaring sound; a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear; and episodic, incapacitating vertigo, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The effects of these symptoms range from a minor nuisance to extreme disability, especially if the attacks of vertigo are severe. At the onset of the disease, perhaps only one or two of the symptoms are manifested.

Some clinicians believe that there are two subsets of the disease, known as atypical Ménière's disease: cochlear and vestibular. Cochlear Ménière's disease is recognized as a fluctuating, progressive sensorineural hearing loss associated with tinnitus and aural pressure in the absence of vestibular symptoms or findings. Vestibular Ménière's disease is characterized as the occurrence of episodic vertigo associated with aural pressure but no cochlear symptoms. In some patients, cochlear or vestibular Ménière's disease develops first. In most patients, however, all of the symptoms develop eventually.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Vertigo is usually the most troublesome complaint. A careful history is taken to determine the frequency, duration, severity, and character of the vertigo attacks. Typically, the patient reports that vertigo lasts minutes to hours, possibly accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Patients also complain of diaphoresis and a persistent feeling of imbalance or disequilibrium, which may last for days. They may complain of attacks that awaken them at night. Between attacks, however, they usually feel well. The hearing loss may fluctuate, with tinnitus and aural pressure waxing and wan-
ing with changes in hearing. The tinnitus and feeling of aural pressure may occur only during or before attacks, or they may be constant.

Findings of the physical examination are usually normal, with the exception of the evaluation of cranial nerve VIII. Sounds from a tuning fork (ie, Weber test) may lateralize to the ear opposite the hearing loss, the one affected with Ménière's disease. An audiogram typically reveals a sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear. This can be in the form of a "Pike's Peak" pattern, which looks like a hill or mountain, or it may show a sensorineural loss in the low frequencies. As the disease progresses, the hearing loss increases. The electronystagmogram may be normal or may show reduced vestibular response. There is, however, no absolute diagnostic test.

\section*{Medical Management}

Most patients with Ménière's disease can be successfully treated with diet and medication therapy. Many patients can control their symptoms by adhering to a low-sodium ( $2,000 \mathrm{mg} /$ day ) diet. The amount of sodium is one of many factors that regulate the balance of fluid within the body. Sodium and fluid retention disrupts the delicate balance between endolymph and perilymph in the inner ear. Psychological evaluation may be indicated if the patient is anxious, uncertain, fearful, or depressed.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Pharmacologic therapy for Ménière's disease consists of antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert), which suppress the vestibular system. Tranquilizers such as diazepam (Valium) may be used in acute instances to help control vertigo. Antiemetics such as promethazine (Phenergan) suppositories help control the nausea and vomiting and the vertigo because of their antihistamine effect. Diuretic therapy (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) sometimes relieves symptoms by lowering the pressure in the endolymphatic system. Intake of foods containing potassium (eg, bananas, tomatoes, oranges) is necessary if the patient takes a diuretic that causes potassium loss.

Vasodilators, such as nicotinic acid, papaverine hydrochloride (Pavabid), and methantheline bromide (Banthine), have no scientific basis for alleviating the symptoms, but they are often used in conjunction with other therapies.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Although most patients respond well to conservative therapy, some continue to have disabling attacks of vertigo. If these attacks reduce their quality of life, patients may elect to undergo surgery for relief. However, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness may continue, because the surgical treatment of Ménière's disease is aimed at eliminating the attacks of vertigo.

Endolymphatic Sac Decompression. Endolymphatic sac decompression, or shunting, theoretically equalizes the pressure in the endolymphatic space. A shunt or drain is inserted in the endolymphatic sac through a postauricular incision. This procedure is favored by many otolaryngologists as a first-line surgical approach to treat the vertigo of Ménière's disease because it is relatively simple and safe and can be performed on an outpatient basis.

Middle and Inner Ear Perfusion. Ototoxic medications, such as streptomycin or gentamicin, can be given to patients by infusion into the middle and inner ear. These medications are used to decrease vestibular function and decrease vertigo. The success rate
for eliminating vertigo is high, about $85 \%$, but the risk of significant hearing loss is also high. This procedure of inner ear perfusion usually requires an overnight stay in the hospital. After the procedure, many patients have a period of imbalance that lasts several weeks.

Intraotologic Catheters. In an attempt to deliver medication directly to the inner ear, catheters are being developed to provide a conduit from the outer ear to the inner ear. The route of the catheter is from the external ear canal through or around the tympanic membrane and to the round window niche or membrane. Medicinal fluids can be placed against the round window for a direct route to the inner ear fluids.

Potential uses of these catheters include treatment for sudden hearing loss and various disorders causing intractable vertigo. Future applications may include tinnitus and slowly progressing sensorineural hearing loss. Intratympanic injections of ototoxic medications for round window membrane diffusion can be used to decrease vestibular function. Established surgical techniques can be used for the patient with vertigo who has not responded to medical or physical therapeutic modalities.

Vestibular Nerve Section. Vestibular nerve section provides the greatest success rate (approximately $98 \%$ ) in eliminating the attacks of vertigo. It can be performed by a translabyrinthine approach (ie, through the hearing mechanism) or in a manner that can conserve hearing (ie, suboccipital or middle cranial fossa), depending on the degree of hearing loss. Most patients with incapacitating Ménière's disease have little or no effective hearing. Cutting the nerve prevents the brain from receiving input from the semicircular canals. This procedure requires a brief hospital stay. Nursing care for the patient with vertigo is presented in Plan of Nursing Care 59-1.

\section*{LABYRINTHITIS}

Labyrinthitis, an inflammation of the inner ear, can be bacterial or viral in origin. Although rare because of antibiotic therapy, bacterial labyrinthitis usually occurs as a complication of otitis media. The infection can enter the inner ear by penetrating the membranes of the oval or round windows. Viral labyrinthitis is a common medical diagnosis, but little is known about this disorder, which affects hearing and balance. The most commonly identified viral causes are mumps, rubella, rubeola, and influenza. Viral illnesses of the upper respiratory tract and herpetiform disorders of the facial and acoustic nerves (ie, Ramsay Hunt syndrome) also cause labyrinthitis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Labyrinthitis is characterized by a sudden onset of incapacitating vertigo, usually with nausea and vomiting, various degrees of hearing loss, and possibly tinnitus. The first episode is usually the worst; subsequent attacks, which usually occur over a period of several weeks to months, are less severe.

\section*{Management}

Treatment of bacterial labyrinthitis includes intravenous antibiotic therapy, fluid replacement, and administration of a vestibular suppressant, such as meclizine, and antiemetic medications. Treatment of viral labyrinthitis is tailored to the patient's symptoms.

\section*{BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO}

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a brief period of incapacitating vertigo that occurs when the position of the patient's head is changed with respect to gravity, typically by placing the head back with the affected ear turned down. The onset is sudden and followed by a predisposition for positional vertigo, usually for hours to weeks but occasionally for months or years.

It is speculated to be caused by the disruption of debris within the semicircular canal. This debris is formed from small crystals of calcium carbonate from the inner ear structure, the utricle. This is frequently stimulated by head trauma, infection, or other events. In severe cases, vertigo may easily be induced by any head movement. The vertigo is usually accompanied by nausea and vomiting; however, hearing impairment does not generally occur (Hain, 2002).

Bed rest is recommended for patients with acute symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (CRP) may be used to provide resolution of vertigo. The Epley procedure is a repositioning technique that is safe, inexpensive, and easy to perform for these patients. However, this procedure is not recommended for patients with acute vertigo or for patients diagnosed with vestibular neuronitis (a paroxysmal attack of severe vertigo).

Patients with acute vertigo may be medicated with meclizine for 1 to 2 weeks. After this time, the meclizine is stopped and the patient is reassessed. Patients who continue to have severe positional vertigo may be premedicated with prochloperazine (Compazine) 1 hour before performing the CRP. The Dix-Hallpike test is used to assess for BPPV. When the Dix-Hallpike test results are positive on the right side, a left-sided CRP is used (Fig. 59-9).

Vestibular rehabilitation can be used in the management of vestibular disorders. This strategy promotes active use of the vestibular system through a multidisciplinary team approach, including medical and nursing care, stress management, biofeedback, vocational rehabilitation, and physical therapy. A physical therapist prescribes balance exercises that help the brain compensate for the impairment to the balance system.

\section*{OTOTOXICITY}

A variety of medications may have adverse effects on the cochlea, vestibular apparatus, or cranial nerve VIII. All but a few, such as aspirin and quinine, cause irreversible hearing loss. At high doses, aspirin toxicity also can produce tinnitus. Intravenous medications, especially the aminoglycosides, are the most common cause of ototoxicity, and they destroy the hair cells in the organ of Corti (see Chart 59-6).

To prevent loss of hearing or balance, patients receiving potentially ototoxic medications should be counseled about the side effects of these medications. Blood levels of the medications should be monitored and patients receiving long-term intravenous antibiotics should be monitored with an audiogram twice each week during therapy.

\section*{ACOUSTIC NEUROMA}

An acoustic neuroma is a slow-growing, benign tumor of cranial nerve VIII, usually arising from the Schwann cells of the vestibular portion of the nerve. Most acoustic tumors arise within the internal auditory canal and extend into the cerebellopontine angle to press on the brain stem. Acoustic neuromas account for 5\% to $10 \%$ of all intracranial tumors and seem to occur with equal frequency in men and women at any age, although most occur during

middle age. Most acoustic neuromas are unilateral, except in von Recklinghausen's disease (ie, neurofibromatosis type 2), in which bilateral tumors occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The most common findings of assessment of patients with an acoustic neuroma are unilateral tinnitus and hearing loss with or without vertigo or balance disturbance. It is important to identify asymmetry in audiovestibular test results so that further
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-312.jpg?height=533&width=866&top_left_y=2077&top_left_x=109)
workup can be performed to rule out an acoustic neuroma. MRI with a paramagnetic contrast agent (ie, gadolinium or Magnevist) is the imaging study of choice. If the patient is claustrophobic or cannot tolerate an MRI or if the scan is unavailable, a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast dye is performed. However, MRI is more sensitive in delineating a small tumor than is CT.

\section*{Management}

Surgical removal of acoustic tumors is the treatment of choice because these tumors do not respond well to irradiation or chemotherapy. Because treatment of acoustic tumors crosses several specialties, the multidisciplinary treatment approach involves a neurotologist and a neurosurgeon. The objective of the surgery is to remove the tumor while preserving facial nerve function. Most acoustic tumors have damaged the cochlear portion of cranial nerve VIII, and no serviceable hearing exists before surgery. In these patients, the surgery is performed using a translabyrinthine approach, and the hearing mechanism is destroyed. If hearing is still good before surgery, a suboccipital or middle cranial fossa approach to removing the tumor may be used, and intraoperative monitoring of cranial nerve VIII is performed to save the hearing.

Complications of surgery for acoustic neuroma include facial nerve paralysis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, meningitis, and cerebral edema. Death from acoustic neuroma surgery is rare.

\section*{Aural Rehabilitation}

If hearing loss is permanent or cannot be treated by medical or surgical means or if the patient elects not to undergo surgery, aural rehabilitation may be beneficial. The purpose of aural rehabilitation is to maximize the hearing-impaired person's communication skills. Aural rehabilitation includes auditory training, speech reading, speech training, and the use of hearing aids and hearing guide dogs.

Auditory training emphasizes listening skills, so the hearingimpaired person concentrates on the speaker. Speech reading (formerly known as lip reading) can help fill the gaps left by missed or misheard words. Speech training attempts to conserve, develop, and prevent deterioration of current skills.

It is important to identify the type of hearing impairment a person has so that rehabilitative efforts can be directed at his or her particular need. Surgical correction may be all that is necessary to treat and improve a conductive hearing loss (Fig. 59-10). With advances in hearing aid technology, amplification for patients with sensorineural hearing loss is more helpful than ever before.

\section*{HEARING AIDS}

A hearing aid is a device through which speech and environmental sounds are received by a microphone, converted to electrical signals, amplified, and reconverted to acoustic signals. Many aids available for sensorineural hearing loss depress the low frequencies, or tones, and enhance hearing for the high frequencies. A general guideline for assessing the patient's need for a hearing aid is a hearing loss exceeding 30 dB in the range of 500 to 2000 Hz in the better-hearing ear.

The evolution in technology has led to the availability of many smaller and more effective hearing aids. It is estimated that $98 \%$ of all hearing aids sold today are behind-the-ear, in-the-ear, or in-the-canal types (Table 59-4).

A hearing aid should be fitted according to the patient's needs (eg, type of hearing loss, manual dexterity), rather than the brand
name, by a certified audiologist licensed to dispense hearing aids. Many states have a consumer protection law that allows the hearing aid to be returned after a trial use if the patient is not completely satisfied.

A hearing aid makes sounds louder, but it does not improve a patient's ability to discriminate words or understand speech. People
who have low discrimination scores (ie, 20\%) on audiograms may derive little benefit from a hearing aid. Hearing aids amplify all sounds, including background noise, which may be disturbing to the wearer. Chart 59-7 identifies additional problems associated with hearing aid use. There are, however, computerized hearing aids available that compensate for background noise or allow

amplification at certain programmed frequencies rather than at all frequencies. Occasionally, depending on the type of hearing loss, binaural aids (ie, one for each ear) may be indicated. Chart 59-8 provides tips for hearing aid care.

To protect the health and safety of people with hearing impairments, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established certain regulations. A medical evaluation of the impairment by a licensed physician must be obtained within 6 months before the purchase of a hearing aid. The written statement from a physician may be waived, however, if the patient (a fully informed adult 18 years of age or older) signs a document to this effect.

\end{figure}

Cleaning
The ear mold is the only part of the hearing aid that may be washed frequently (even daily if necessary) with soap and water. The ear mold must be dry before it is snapped into the receiver. The cannula is cleaned with a small pipe cleaner-like device.
Malfunctioning
Inadequate amplification, a whistling noise, or pain from the mold can occur when a hearing aid is not functioning properly. Check for malfunctions: Is the switch on? Are the batteries charged and positioned correctly? If the hearing aid still does not work properly, the hearing aid dealer should be notified. If the unit requires extended time for repair, the dealer may lend the patient a hearing aid until the repair can be accomplished.
Recognizing Complications
When occluded by a hearing aid, the external auditory canal can become moist. Common medical problems among hearing aid wearers include external otitis and pressure ulcers in the external auditory canal or meatus.

Children must be evaluated by a physician. Health care professionals who dispense hearing aids are required to refer prospective users to a physician if any of the following otologic conditions are evident:
- Visible congenital or traumatic deformity of the ear
- Active drainage from the ear within the previous 90 days
- Sudden or rapidly progressive hearing loss within the previous 90 days
- Complaints of dizziness or tinnitus
- Unilateral hearing loss that occurred suddenly or within the previous 90 days
- Audiometric air-bone gap of 15 dB or more at 500,1000 , and 2000 Hz
- Significant accumulation of cerumen or a foreign body in the external auditory canal
- Pain or discomfort in the ear

A user instruction brochure is to accompany every hearing aid device. In this brochure, the following information is presented:
- Specification that good health practice requires a medical evaluation before purchasing a hearing aid
- Notification that any of the eight otologic conditions previously listed should be investigated by a physician before purchase of a hearing aid
- Instructions for proper use, maintenance, and care of the hearing aid, as well as instructions for replacing or recharging the batteries
- Repair service information
- Description of avoidable conditions that could damage the hearing aid
- List of any known side effects that may warrant physician consultation (eg, skin irritation, accelerated cerumen accumulation)

\section*{IMPLANTED HEARING DEVICES}

Three types of implanted hearing devices are commercially available or in the investigational stage: the cochlear implant, the bone conduction device, and the semi-implantable hearing device. Cochlear implants are for patients with little or no hearing. Bone conduction devices, which transmit sound through the skull to the inner ear, are used in patients with a conductive hearing loss if a hearing aid is contraindicated (eg, those with chronic infection). The device is implanted postauricularly under the skin into the skull, and an external device-worn above the ear, not in the canal-transmits the sound through the skin. Semi-implantable hearing aids, although not yet approved by the FDA except in testing sites, still require the use of an external device. However, research to develop a fully implantable hearing aid continues.

\section*{Cochlear Implant}

A cochlear implant is an auditory prosthesis used for people with profound sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally who do not benefit from conventional hearing aids. The hearing loss may be congenital or acquired. An implant does not restore normal hearing; rather, it helps the person detect medium to loud environmental sounds and conversation. The implant is designed to provide stimulation directly to the auditory nerve, bypassing the hair cells of the inner ear, which are not functioning. The microphone and signal processor are worn outside the body and transmit electrical stimuli inside the body to the implanted electrodes. The electrical signals stimulate the auditory nerve fibers and then the brain, where they are interpreted.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 59-11 The cochlear implant. The internal coil has a stranded electrode lead. The electrode is inserted through the round window into the scala tympani of the cochlea. The external coil (the transmitter) is held in alignment with the internal coil (the receiver) by a magnet. The microphone receives the sound. The stimulator wire receives the signal after it has been filtered, adjusted, and modified so that the sound is at a comfortable level for the patient. Sound is passed by the external transmitter to the inner coil receiver by magnetic conduction and is then carried by the electrode to the cochlea.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-315.jpg?height=831&width=1251&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=710}
\end{figure}

Candidates for a cochlear implant, who are usually at least 1 year old, are selected after careful screening by otologic history, physical examination, audiologic testing, x-rays, and psychological testing. Several criteria apply for choosing adults who may benefit from a cochlear implant:
- Profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears
- Inability to hear and recognize speech well with hearing aids
- No medical contraindication to a cochlear implant or general anesthesia
- Indications that being able to hear would enhance the patient's life
The surgery involves implanting a small receiver in the temporal bone through a postauricular incision and placing electrodes into the inner ear (Fig. 59-11). The microphone and transmitter are worn on an external unit. The patient undergoes extensive cochlear rehabilitation with the multidisciplinary team, which includes an audiologist and speech pathologist. Several months may be needed to learn to interpret the sounds heard. Children and adults who lost their hearing before they learned to speak take much longer to acquire speech. There are wide variations of success with cochlear implants, and there is also controversy about their use, especially among the Deaf community. Patients who have had a cochlear implant are cautioned that an MRI will cause the implant to become inactivated; MRI is to be used only when unavoidable.

\section*{HEARING GUIDE DOGS}

Specially trained dogs are available to assist the person with a hearing loss. People who live alone are eligible to apply for a dog trained by International Hearing Dog, Inc. At home, the dog reacts to the sound of a telephone, a doorbell, an alarm clock, a baby's cry, a knock at the door, a smoke alarm, or an intruder. The dog does not bark but alerts its master by physical contact; the dog then runs to the source of the noise. In public, the dog positions itself between the hearing-impaired person and any potential hazard that the person cannot hear, such as an oncoming vehicle or a loud, hostile person. In many states, a hearing-impaired person with a certified hearing guide dog is legally permitted access to public transportation, public eating places, and stores, including food markets.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. An 82-year-old patient in an extended care facility appears withdrawn and distrustful of others. She does not participate in conversations with other residents. You suspect that she has a hearing loss. Describe the strategies you would use to assess this patient's hearing. What intervention strategies would you implement if your assessment confirms that the woman has a hearing loss? What intervention strategies would you implement if your assessment indicates that she does not have a hearing loss?
2. An antiemetic and a tranquilizer have been prescribed for a patient with Ménière's disease. You realize that safety precautions are indicated. Devise a teaching plan for this patient, and explain the reasons behind each part of the plan.
3. A teenage boy has decided to play the drums in a local band. The music consists of loud, hard rock music. The group practices for 2 to 3 hours each day, approximately 4 nights per week. Describe the teaching plan you would devise for this teenage boy, including rationale.
4. A patient presents with severe vertigo. She lives alone and is afraid of injuring herself because of her dizziness, which is unpredictable. Devise a teaching plan for this patient, including methods to prevent injury. Include interventions and outcomes that will address her fears and anxiety.
5. A patient with severe hearing loss is admitted for abdominal surgery to treat a bowel obstruction. It is anticipated that a colostomy will be created. Explain modifications in preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative nursing care needed because of her impaired hearing.

\section*{Assessment of Neurologic Function}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the structures and functions of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
2. Differentiate between pathologic changes that affect motor control and those that affect sensory pathways.
3. Compare the functioning of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
4. Describe the significance of physical assessment to the diagnosis of neurologic dysfunction.
5. Describe changes in neurologic function associated with aging and their impact on neurologic assessment findings.
6. Describe diagnostic tests used for assessment of suspected neurologic disorders and the related nursing implications.

Nuurses in many types of practice settings encounter patients with altered neurologic function. Disorders of the nervous system can occur at any time during the life span and can vary from mild, self-limiting symptoms to devastating, life-threatening disorders. The nurse must be skilled in the assessment of the neurologic system whether the assessment is generalized or focused on specific areas of function. Assessment in either case requires knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system and an understanding of the array of tests and procedures used to diagnose neurologic disorders. Knowledge about the nursing implications and interventions related to assessment and diagnostic testing is also essential.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The nervous system consists of two divisions: the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, made up of the cranial and spinal nerves. The peripheral nervous system can be further divided into the somatic, or voluntary, nervous system, and the autonomic, or involuntary, nervous system. The function of the nervous system is to control all motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, and behavioral activities. The nervous system has approximately 10 million sensory neurons that send information about the internal and external environment to the brain and 500,000 motor neurons that control the muscles and glands. The brain itself contains more than 20 billion nerve cells that link the motor and sensory pathways, monitor the body's processes, respond to the internal and external environment, maintain homeostasis, and direct all psychological, biologic, and physical activity through complex chemical and electrical messages (Bradley, Daroff, Fenichel \& Marsden, 2000).

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM}

\section*{Cells of the Nervous System}

The basic functional unit of the brain is the neuron (Fig. 60-1). It is composed of a cell body, a dendrite, and an axon. The dendrite is a branch-type structure with synapses for receiving electrochemical messages. The axon is a long projection that carries
impulses away from the cell body. Nerve cell bodies occurring in clusters are called ganglia or nuclei. A cluster of cell bodies with the same function is called a center (eg, the respiratory center). Neuroglial cells, another type of nerve cell, support, protect, and nourish neurons.

\section*{Neurotransmitters}

Neurotransmitters communicate messages from one neuron to another or from a neuron to a specific target tissue. Neurotransmitters are manufactured and stored in synaptic vesicles. They enable conduction of impulses across the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter has an affinity for specific receptors in the postsynaptic bulb. When released, the neurotransmitter crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors in the postsynaptic cell membrane. The action of a neurotransmitter is to potentiate, terminate, or modulate a specific action and can either excite or inhibit the target cell's activity. There are usually multiple neurotransmitters at work in the neural synapse. There are various types of neurotransmitters (Bradley et al., 2000; Hickey, 2003); major neurotransmitters are described in Table 60-1.

Many neurologic disorders are due, at least in part, to an imbalance in neurotransmitters-that is, a lack of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine in Huntington's disease (Bradley et al., 2000), low serotonin levels in some forms of epilepsy (Blows, 2000), and a decrease in dopamine in Parkinson's disease. In fact, probably all brain functions are modulated through neurotransmitter receptor site activity, including memory and other cognitive processes.

There are two types of receptors: direct and indirect. Direct receptors are also known as inotropic because they are linked to ion channels and allow passage of ions when opened. They can be excitatory or inhibitory and are rapid-acting (measured in milliseconds). Indirect receptors affect metabolic processes in the cell, which can take from seconds to hours to occur. Receptor sites are an expanding area of research because they are often the target for the action and development of new medications. These medications either block or stimulate neurotransmitters at receptor sites and thus provide relief from symptoms (Blows, 2000). Receptor sites are also sites for the action of addictive drugs.

Another important area of ongoing research is diagnostic testing that can detect abnormal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. Positron emission tomography (PET), for example, can detect dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine (Gjedde et al., 2001). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is similar to PET. Both PET and SPECT are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

\section*{The Central Nervous System}

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE BRAIN}

The brain is divided into three major areas: the cerebrum, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. The cerebrum is composed of two hemispheres, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the basal ganglia. Additionally, connections for the olfactory (cranial nerve I) and optic (cranial nerve III) nerves are found in the cerebrum. The brain stem includes the midbrain, pons, medulla, and connections for cranial nerves II and IV through XII. The cerebellum is located under the cerebrum and behind the brain stem (Fig. 60-2). The brain accounts for approximately $2 \%$ of the total body weight; it weighs approximately $1,400 \mathrm{~g}$ in an average young adult (Hickey, 2003). In the elderly, the average brain weighs approximately $1,200 \mathrm{~g}$.

Cerebrum. The cerebrum consists of two hemispheres that are incompletely separated by the great longitudinal fissure. This sulcus separates the cerebrum into the right and left hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined at the lower portion of the fis-
sure by the corpus callosum. The outside surface of the hemispheres has a wrinkled appearance that is the result of many folded layers or convolutions called gyri, which increase the surface area of the brain, accounting for the high level of activity carried out by such a small-appearing organ. The external or outer portion of the cerebrum (the cerebral cortex) is made up of gray matter approximately 2 to 5 mm in depth; it contains billions of neurons/cell bodies, giving it a gray appearance. White matter makes up the innermost layer and is composed of nerve fibers and neuroglia (support tissue) that form tracts or pathways connecting various parts of the brain with one another (transverse and association pathways) and the cortex to lower portions of the brain and spinal cord (projection fibers). The cerebral hemispheres are divided into pairs of frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The four lobes are as follows (see Fig. 60-2):
- Frontal-the largest lobe. The major functions of this lobe are concentration, abstract thought, information storage or memory, and motor function. It also contains Broca's area, critical for motor control of speech. The frontal lobe is also responsible in large part for an individual's affect, judgment, personality, and inhibitions.
- Parietal-a predominantly sensory lobe. The primary sensory cortex, which analyzes sensory information and relays the interpretation of this information to the thalamus and other cortical areas, is located in the parietal lobe. It is also essential to an individual's awareness of the body in space, as well as orientation in space and spatial relations.

- Temporal-contains the auditory receptive areas. Contains a vital area called the interpretive area that provides integration of somatization, visual, and auditory areas and plays the most dominant role of any area of the cortex in cerebration.
- Occipital-the posterior lobe of the cerebral hemisphere is responsible for visual interpretation.
The corpus callosum (Fig. 60-3) is a thick collection of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain and is responsible for the transmission of information from one side of the brain to the other. Information transferred includes sensation, memory, and learned discrimination. Right-handed people and some left-handed people have cerebral dominance on the left side of the brain for verbal, linguistic, arithmetical, calculating, and

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 60-3 Medial view of the brain.}
\end{figure}
analytic functions. The nondominant hemisphere is responsible for geometric, spatial, visual, pattern, and musical functions.

The basal ganglia are masses of nuclei located deep in the cerebral hemispheres that are responsible for control of fine motor movements, including those of the hands and lower extremities.

The thalamus (see Fig. 60-3) lies on either side of the third ventricle and acts primarily as a relay station for all sensation except smell. All memory, sensation, and pain impulses also pass through this section of the brain.

The hypothalamus is located anterior and inferior to the thalamus. The hypothalamus lies immediately beneath and lateral to the lower portion of the wall of the third ventricle. It includes the optic chiasm (the point at which the two optic tracts cross) and the mamillary bodies (involved in olfactory reflexes and emotional response to odors). The infundibulum of the hypothalamus connects it to the posterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus plays an important role in the endocrine system because it regulates the pituitary secretion of hormones that influence metabolism, reproduction, stress response, and urine production. It works with the pituitary to maintain fluid balance and maintains temperature regulation by promoting vasoconstriction or vasodilatation.

The hypothalamus is the site of the hunger center and is involved in appetite control. It contains centers that regulate the sleep-wake cycle, blood pressure, aggressive and sexual behavior, and emotional responses (ie, blushing, rage, depression, panic, and fear). The hypothalamus also controls and regulates the autonomic nervous system.

The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica at the base of the brain and is connected to the hypothalamus. The pituitary is a common site for brain tumors in adults; frequently they are detected by physical signs and symptoms that can be traced to the pituitary, such as hormonal imbalance or visual disturbances
secondary to pressure on the optic chiasm (further information on brain tumors is found later in this unit in Chap. 65).

Nerve fibers from all portions of the cortex converge in each hemisphere and exit in the form of a tight bundle of nerve fibers known as the internal capsule. Having entered the pons and the medulla, each bundle crosses to the corresponding bundle from the opposite side. Some of these axons make connections with axons from the cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus; some connect with the cranial nerve cells. Other fibers from the cortex and the subcortical centers are channeled through the pons and the medulla into the spinal cord.

Although the various cells in the cerebral cortex are quite similar in appearance, their functions vary widely, depending on location. The topography of the cortex in relation to certain of its functions is shown in Figure 60-4. The posterior portion of each hemisphere (ie, the occipital lobe) is devoted to all aspects of visual perception. The lateral region, or temporal lobe, incorporates the auditory center. The midcentral zone, or parietal zone, posterior to the fissure of Rolando, is concerned with sensation; the anterior portion is concerned with voluntary muscle movements. The large area behind the forehead (ie, the frontal lobes) contains the association pathways that determine emotional attitudes and responses and contribute to the formation of thought processes. Damage to the frontal lobes as a result of trauma or disease is by no means incapacitating from the standpoint of muscular control or coordination, but it affects a person's personality, as reflected by basic attitudes, sense of humor and propriety, selfrestraint, and motivations. (Neurologic trauma and disease states that may result in frontal damage are discussed in later chapters in this unit.)

Brain Stem. The brain stem consists of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata (see Fig. 60-2). The midbrain connects the
pons and the cerebellum with the cerebral hemispheres; it contains sensory and motor pathways and serves as the center for auditory and visual reflexes. Cranial nerves III and IV originate in the midbrain. The pons is situated in front of the cerebellum between the midbrain and the medulla and is a bridge between the two halves of the cerebellum, and between the medulla and the cerebrum. Cranial nerves V through VIII connect to the brain in the pons. The pons contains motor and sensory pathways. Portions of the pons also control the heart, respiration, and blood pressure.

The medulla oblongata contains motor fibers from the brain to the spinal cord and sensory fibers from the spinal cord to the brain. Most of these fibers cross, or decussate, at this level. Cranial nerves IX through XII connect to the brain in the medulla.

Cerebellum. The cerebellum is separated from the cerebral hemispheres by a fold of dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli. The cerebellum has both excitatory and inhibitory actions and is largely responsible for coordination of movement. It also controls fine movement, balance, position sense (awareness of where each part of the body is), and integration of sensory input.

\section*{STRUCTURES PROTECTING THE BRAIN}

The brain is contained in the rigid skull, which protects it from injury. The major bones of the skull are the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital bones. These bones join at the suture lines (Fig. 60-5).

The meninges (fibrous connective tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord) provide protection, support, and nourishment to the brain and spinal cord. The layers of the meninges are the dura, arachnoid, and pia mater (Fig. 60-6).
- Dura mater-the outermost layer; covers the brain and the spinal cord. It is tough, thick, inelastic, fibrous, and gray.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-321.jpg?height=1064&width=1307&top_left_y=1551&top_left_x=106}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 60-5 Bones and sutures of the skull.}
\end{figure}

There are four extensions of the dura: the falx cerebri, which separates the two hemispheres in a longitudinal plane; the tentorium, which is an infolding of the dura that forms a tough membranous shelf; the falx cerebelli, which is between the two lateral lobes of the cerebellum; and the diaphragm sellae, which provides a "roof" for the sella turcica. The tentorium supports the hemispheres and separates them from the lower part of the brain. When excess pressure occurs in the cranial cavity, brain tissue may be compressed against the tentorium or displaced downward, a
process called herniation. Between the dura mater and the skull in the cranium, and between the periosteum and the dura in the vertebral column, is the epidural space, a potential space.
- Arachnoid-the middle membrane; an extremely thin, delicate membrane that closely resembles a spider web (hence the name arachnoid). It appears white because it has no blood supply. The arachnoid layer contains the choroid plexus, which is responsible for the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This membrane also has unique fingerlike projections, arachnoid villi, that absorb CSF. In the normal adult, approximately 500 mL of CSF is produced each day; all but 125 to 150 mL is absorbed by the villi (Hickey, 2003). When blood enters the system (from trauma or hemorrhagic stroke), the villi become obstructed and hydrocephalus (increased size of ventricles) may result. The subdural space is between the dura and the arachnoid layer, and the subarachnoid space is located between the arachnoid and pia layers and contains the CSF.
- Pia mater-the innermost membrane; a thin, transparent layer that hugs the brain closely and extends into every fold of the brain's surface.

\section*{CEREBROSPINAL FLUID}

CSF, a clear and colorless fluid with a specific gravity of 1.007 , is produced in the ventricles and is circulated around the brain and the spinal cord through the ventricular system. There are four ventricles: the right and left lateral, and the third and fourth ventricles. The two lateral ventricles open into the third ventricle at the interventricular foramen or the foramen of Monro. The third and fourth ventricles connect via the aqueduct of Sylvius. The fourth ventricle supplies CSF to the subarachnoid space and

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-322.jpg?height=1048&width=1309&top_left_y=1562&top_left_x=673}
\end{figure}
down the spinal cord on the dorsal surface. CSF is returned to the brain and is then circulated around the brain, where it is absorbed by the arachnoid villi.

CSF is produced in the choroid plexus of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. The ventricular and subarachnoid system contains approximately 125 to 150 mL of fluid, while 15 to 25 mL of CSF is located in each lateral ventricle.

The composition of CSF is similar to other extracellular fluids (such as blood plasma), but the concentrations of the various constituents are different. The analysis and laboratory report of CSF usually contains information on color, specific gravity, protein count, white blood cell count, glucose, and other electrolyte levels; it may also be tested for immunoglobulins or lactate (Hickey, 2003). Normal CSF contains a minimal number of white blood cells and no red blood cells.

\section*{CEREBRAL CIRCULATION}

The cerebral circulation receives approximately $15 \%$ of the cardiac output, or 750 mL per minute. The brain does not store nutrients and has a high metabolic demand that requires the high blood flow. The brain's blood pathway is unique because it flows against gravity; its arteries fill from below and the veins drain from above. In contrast to other organs that may tolerate decreases in blood flow because of their adequate collateral circulation, the brain lacks additional collateral blood flow, which may result in irreversible tissue damage when blood flow is occluded for even short periods of time.

Arteries. Two internal carotid arteries and two vertebral arteries and their extensive system of branches provide the blood supply to the brain. The internal carotids arise from the bifurcation of the common carotid and supply much of the anterior circulation of the brain. The vertebral arteries branch from the subclavian arteries, flow back and upward on either side of the cervical vertebrae, and enter the cranium through the foramen magnum. The vertebral arteries join to become the basilar artery at the level of the brain stem; the basilar artery divides to form the two branches of the posterior cerebral arteries. The vertebrobasilar arteries supply most of the posterior circulation of the brain.

At the base of the brain surrounding the pituitary gland, a ring of arteries is formed between the vertebral and internal carotid arterial chains. This ring is called the circle of Willis and is formed from the branches of the internal carotid arteries, anterior and middle cerebral arteries, and anterior and posterior communicating arteries (Fig. 60-7). Functionally, the posterior portion of the circulation and the anterior or carotid circulation usually remain separate. The arteries of the circle of Willis can provide collateral circulation if one or more of the four vessels supplying it become occluded or are ligated.

The arterial anastomoses along the circle of Willis are frequent sites of aneurysms. These can be formed when the pressure at a weakened arterial wall causes the artery to balloon out. Aneurysms may be congenital or the result of degenerative changes in the vessel wall associated with arteriosclerotic vascular disease. If an artery with an aneurysm bursts or becomes occluded by vasospasm, an embolus, or a thrombus, the neurons distal to the occlusion are deprived of their blood supply and the cells quickly die. The result is a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebrovascular accident or infarction). The effects of the occlusion depend on which vessels are involved and which areas of the brain these vessels supply. Aneurysms and cerebrovascular accidents are discussed in more detail in Chapter 62.

Veins. Venous drainage for the brain does not follow the arterial circulation as in other body structures. The veins reach the brain's surface, join larger veins, then cross the subarachnoid space and empty into the dural sinuses, which are the vascular channels lying within the tough dura mater (see Fig. 60-6). The network of the sinuses carries venous outflow from the brain and empties into the internal jugular vein, returning the blood to the heart. Cerebral veins and sinuses are unique because, unlike other veins in the body, they do not have valves to prevent blood from flowing backward and depend on both gravity and blood pressure.

\section*{BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER}

The CNS is inaccessible to many substances that circulate in the blood plasma (eg, dyes, medications, and antibiotics). After being injected into the blood, many substances cannot reach the neu-

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 60-7 Arterial blood supply of the brain, including the circle of Willis, as viewed from the ventral surface.}
\end{figure}
rons of the CNS because of the blood-brain barrier. This barrier is formed by the endothelial cells of the brain's capillaries, which form continuous tight junctions, creating a barrier to macromolecules and many compounds. All substances entering the CSF must filter through the capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes (Hickey, 2003). Often altered by trauma, cerebral edema, and cerebral hypoxemia, the blood-brain barrier has implications in the treatment and selection of medication for CNS disorders as well as serving a protective function.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE SPINAL CORD}

The spinal cord and medulla form a continuous structure extending from the cerebral hemispheres and serving as the connection between the brain and the periphery. Approximately 45 cm ( 18 in ) long and about the thickness of a finger, it extends from the foramen magnum at the base of the skull to the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra, where it tapers to a fibrous band called the conus medullaris. Continuing below the second lumbar space are the nerve roots that extend beyond the conus, which are called the cauda equina because they resemble a horse's tail. Similar to the brain, the spinal cord consists of gray and white matter. Gray matter in the brain is external and white matter is internal; in the spinal cord, gray matter is in the center and is surrounded on all sides by white matter (Fig. 60-8).

The spinal cord is surrounded by the meninges, dura, arachnoid, and pia layers. Between the dura mater and the vertebral canal is the epidural space. The spinal cord is an H-shaped structure with nerve cell bodies (gray matter) surrounded by ascending and descending tracts (white matter) (see Fig. 60-8). The lower portion of the H is broader than the upper portion and corresponds to the anterior horns. The anterior horns contain cells with fibers that form the anterior (motor) root end and are essential for the voluntary and reflex activity of the muscles they innervate. The thinner posterior (upper horns) portion contains cells with fibers that enter over the posterior (sensory) root end and thus serve as a relay station in the sensory/reflex pathway.

The thoracic region of the spinal cord has a projection from each side at the crossbar of the H of gray matter called the lateral horn. It contains the cells that give rise to the autonomic fibers of the sympathetic division. The fibers leave the spinal cord through the anterior roots in the thoracic and upper lumbar segments.

Sensory and Motor Pathways: The Spinal Tracts. The white matter of the cord is composed of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. The fast-conducting myelinated fibers form bundles that also contain glial cells. Fiber bundles with a common function are called tracts. There are six ascending tracts. Two conduct sensation, principally the perception of touch, pressure, vibration, position, and passive motion from the same side of the body. Before reaching the cerebral cortex, these fibers cross to the opposite side in the medulla. The two spinocerebellar tracts conduct sensory impulses from muscle spindles, providing necessary input for coordinated muscle contraction. They ascend essentially uncrossed and terminate in the cerebellum. The last two spinothalamic tracts are responsible for conduction of pain, temperature, proprioception, fine touch, and vibratory sense from the upper body to the brain. They ascend, cross to the opposite side of the brain, and terminate in the thalamus (Hickey, 2003).

There are eight descending tracts, seven of which are engaged in motor function. The two corticospinal tracts conduct motor impulses to the anterior horn cells from the opposite side of the brain and control voluntary muscle activity. The three vestibulospinal tracts descend uncrossed and are involved in some autonomic functions (sweating, pupil dilation, and circulation) and involuntary muscle control. The corticobulbar tract conducts impulses responsible for voluntary head and facial muscle movement and crosses at the level of the brain stem. The rubrospinal and reticulospinal tracts conduct impulses involved with involuntary muscle movement.

Vertebral Column. The bones of the vertebral column surround and protect the spinal cord and normally consist of 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumber vertebrae, as well as the sacrum (a fused mass of five vertebrae), and terminate in the coccyx. Nerve roots exit from the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramina (openings). The vertebrae are separated by disks, except for the first and second cervical, the sacral, and the coccygeal vertebrae. Each vertebra has a ventral solid body and a dorsal segment or arch, which is posterior to the body. The arch is composed of two pedicles and two laminae supporting seven processes. The vertebral body, arch, pedicles, and laminae all encase the vertebral canal.

\end{figure}

\section*{The Peripheral Nervous System}

The peripheral nervous system includes the cranial nerves, the spinal nerves, and the autonomic nervous system.

\section*{CRANIAL NERVES}

There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that emerge from the lower surface of the brain and pass through the foramina in the skull. Three are entirely sensory (I, II, VIII), five are motor (III, IV, VI, XI, and XII), and four are mixed (V, VII, IX, and X) as they have both sensory and motor functions (Downey \& Leigh, 1998; Hickey, 2003). The cranial nerves are numbered in the order in which they arise from the brain. For example, cranial nerves I and II attach in the cerebral hemispheres, whereas cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII attach at the medulla (Fig. 60-9). Most cranial nerves innervate the head, neck, and special sense structures. Table 60-2 lists the names and primary functions of the cranial nerves.

\section*{SPINAL NERVES}

The spinal cord is composed of 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal. Each spinal nerve has a ventral root and a dorsal root (Fig. 60-10).

The dorsal roots are sensory and transmit sensory impulses from specific areas of the body known as dermatomes (Fig. 60-11) to the dorsal ganglia. The sensory fiber may be somatic, carrying information about pain, temperature, touch, and position sense (proprioception) from the tendons, joints, and body surfaces; or visceral, carrying information from the internal organs.

The ventral roots are motor and transmit impulses from the spinal cord to the body. These fibers are also either somatic or visceral. The visceral fibers include autonomic fibers that control the cardiac muscles and glandular secretions.

\section*{AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM}

The autonomic nervous system regulates the activities of internal organs such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, digestive organs, and glands. Maintenance and restoration of internal homeostasis is largely the responsibility of the autonomic nervous system. There are two major divisions: the sympathetic nervous system,

\end{table}
with predominantly excitatory responses, most notably the "fight or flight" response, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls mostly visceral functions.

The autonomic nervous system innervates most body organs. Although usually considered part of the peripheral nervous system, it is regulated by centers in the spinal cord, brain stem, and

hypothalamus. The autonomic nervous system has two neurons in a series extending between the centers in the CNS and the organs innervated. The first neuron, the preganglionic neuron, is located in the brain or spinal cord, and its axon extends to the autonomic ganglia. There, it synapses with the second neuron, the postganglionic neuron, located in the autonomic ganglia, and its axon synapses with the target tissue and innervates the effector
organ. Its regulatory effects are exerted not on individual cells but on large expanses of tissue and on entire organs. The responses elicited do not occur instantaneously but after a lag period. These responses are sustained far longer than other neurogenic responses to ensure maximal functional efficiency on the part of receptor organs, such as blood vessels.

The quality of these responses is explained by the fact that the autonomic nervous system transmits its impulses by way of nerve pathways, enhanced by chemical mediators, resembling in this respect the endocrine system. Electrical impulses, conducted through nerve fibers, stimulate the formation of specific chemical agents at strategic locations within the muscle mass; the diffusion of these chemicals within the muscle is responsible for the contraction.

The hypothalamus is the major subcortical center for the regulation of visceral and somatic activities, with an inhibitoryexcitatory role in the autonomic nervous system. The hypothalamus has connections that link the autonomic system with the thalamus, the cortex, the olfactory apparatus, and the pituitary gland. Located here are the mechanisms for the control of visceral and somatic reactions that were originally important for defense or attack, and are associated with emotional states (eg, fear, anger, anxiety); for the control of metabolic processes, including fat, carbohydrate, and water metabolism; for the regulation of body temperature, arterial pressure, and all muscular and glandular activities of the gastrointestinal tract; for control of genital functions; and for the sleep cycle.

The autonomic nervous system is separated into the anatomically and functionally distinct sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Most of the tissues and the organs under autonomic control are innervated by both systems. Sympathetic stimuli are mediated by norepinephrine and parasympathetic impulses are mediated by acetylcholine. These chemicals produce opposing and mutually antagonistic effects. Both divisions produce stimulatory and inhibitory effects. For example, the parasympathetic division causes contraction (stimulation) of the urinary bladder muscles and a decrease (inhibition) in heart rate, whereas the sympathetic division produces relaxation (inhibition) of the urinary bladder and an increase (stimulation) in the rate and force of the heartbeat. Table 60-3 compares the sympathetic and the parasympathetic effects on the different systems of the body.

Sympathetic Nervous System. The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is best known for its role in the body's "fight-or-flight" response. Under stress conditions from either physical or emotional causes, sympathetic impulses increase greatly. As a result, the bronchioles dilate for easier gas exchange; the heart's contractions are stronger and faster; the arteries to the heart and voluntary muscles dilate, carrying more blood to these organs; peripheral blood vessels constrict, making the skin feel cool but shunting blood to essential organs; the pupils dilate; the liver releases glucose for quick energy; peristalsis slows; hair stands on end; and perspiration increases. The sympathetic neurotransmitter is norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and this increase in sympathetic discharge is the same as if the body has been given an injection of adrenalin-hence, the term adrenergic is often used to refer to this division.

Sympathetic neurons are located in the thoracic and the lumbar segments of the spinal cord; their axons, or the preganglionic fibers, emerge by way of anterior nerve roots from the eighth cervical or first thoracic segment to the second or third lumbar segment. A short distance from the cord, these fibers diverge to join a chain, composed of 22 linked ganglia, that extends the entire length of the spinal column, adjacent to the vertebral bodies on both sides. Some form multiple synapses with nerve cells within the chain. Others traverse the chain without making connections or losing continuity to join large "prevertebral" ganglia in the thorax, the abdomen, or the pelvis or one of the "terminal" ganglia in the vicinity of an organ, such as the bladder or the rectum (Fig. 60-12). Postganglionic nerve fibers originating in the sympathetic chain rejoin the spinal nerves that supply the extremities and are distributed to blood vessels, sweat glands, and smooth muscle tissue in the skin. Postganglionic fibers from the prevertebral plexuses (eg, the cardiac, pulmonary, splanchnic, and pelvic plexuses) supply structures in the head and neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, respectively, having been joined in these plexuses by fibers from the parasympathetic division.

The adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, spleen, stomach, and duodenum are under the control of the giant celiac plexus, commonly known as the solar plexus. This receives its sympathetic nerve components by way of the three splanchnic nerves, composed of preganglionic fibers from nine segments of the spinal cord (T4 to L1), and is joined by the vagus nerve, representing the parasympathetic division. From the celiac plexus, fibers of both divisions travel along the course of blood vessels to their target organs.

Sympathetic Syndromes. Certain syndromes are distinctive to diseases of the sympathetic nerve trunks. Among these are dilation of the pupil of the eye on the same side as a penetrating wound of the neck (evidence of disturbance of the cervical sympathetic cord); temporary paralysis of the bowel (indicated by the
absence of peristaltic waves and the distention of the intestine by gas) after fracture of any one of the lower dorsal or upper lumbar vertebrae with hemorrhage into the base of the mesentery; and the marked variations in pulse rate and rhythm that often follow compression fractures of the upper six thoracic vertebrae.

Parasympathetic Nervous System. The parasympathetic nervous system functions as the dominant controller for most visceral effectors. During quiet, nonstressful conditions, impulses from parasympathetic fibers (cholinergic) predominate. The fibers of the parasympathetic system are located in two sections, one in the
brain stem and the other from spinal segments below L2. Because of the location of these fibers, the parasympathetic system is referred to as the craniosacral division, as distinct from the thoracolumbar (sympathetic) division of the autonomic nervous system.

The parasympathetic nerves arise from the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. Fibers from cells in the midbrain travel with the third oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglia, where postganglionic fibers of this division are joined by those of the sympathetic system, creating controlled opposition, with a delicate balance maintained between the two at all times.

\section*{Motor and Sensory Functions of the Nervous System}

\section*{MOTOR SYSTEM FUNCTION}

The motor cortex, a vertical band within each cerebral hemisphere, controls the voluntary movements of the body. The exact locations within the brain at which the voluntary movements of the muscles of the face, thumb, hand, arm, trunk, and leg originate are known (Fig. 60-13). To initiate muscle movement, these particular cells must send the stimulus down along their fibers. Stimulation of these cells with an electric current will also result in muscle contraction. En route to the pons, the motor fibers con-

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
verge into a tight bundle known as the internal capsule. A comparatively small injury to the capsule causes paralysis in more muscles than does a much larger injury to the cortex itself.

Within the medulla, the motor axons from the cortex form the motor pathways or tracts, notably the corticospinal or pyramidal tracts. Here, most of the fibers cross (or decussate) to the opposite side, continuing as a crossed pyramidal tract. The remaining fibers enter the spinal cord on the same side as the direct pyramidal tract. Each fiber in this tract finally crosses to the opposite side of the cord and terminates within the gray matter of the anterior horn on that side, in proximity to a motor nerve cell. Fibers of the crossed pyramidal tract terminate within the anterior horn and make connections with anterior horn cells on the same side. All of the motor fibers of the spinal nerves represent extensions of these anterior horn cells, with each of these fibers communicating with only one particular muscle fiber.

The motor system is complex, and motor function depends on the integrity of the corticospinal tracts, the extrapyramidal system, and cerebellar function. A motor impulse consists of a two-neuron pathway (described below). The motor nerve pathways are contained in the spinal cord. Some represent the pathways of the so-called extrapyramidal system, establishing connections between the anterior horn cells and the automatic control centers located in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Others are

\end{figure}
components of reflex arcs, forming synaptic connections between anterior horn cells and sensory fibers that have entered adjacent or neighboring segments of the cord.

Upper and Lower Motor Neurons. The voluntary motor system consists of two groups of neurons: upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the brain stem and modulate the activity of the lower motor neurons. Upper motor neuron fibers make up the descending motor pathways and are located entirely within the CNS. Lower motor neurons are located either in the anterior horn of the spinal cord gray matter or within cranial nerve nuclei in the brain stem. Axons of both extend through peripheral nerves and terminate in skeletal muscle. Lower motor neurons are located in both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system.

The motor pathways from the brain to the spinal cord, as well as from the cerebrum to the brain stem, are formed by upper motor neurons. They begin in the cortex of one side of the brain, descend through the internal capsule, cross to the opposite side in the brain stem, descend through the corticospinal tract, and synapse with the lower motor neurons in the cord. The lower motor neurons receive the impulse in the posterior part of the cord and run to the myoneural junction located in the peripheral muscle. The clinical features of lesions of upper and lower motor neurons are discussed in the sections that follow and in Table 60-4.

Upper Motor Neuron Lesions. Upper motor neuron lesions can involve the motor cortex, the internal capsule, the spinal cord, and other structures of the brain through which the corticospinal tract descends. If the upper motor neurons are damaged or destroyed, as frequently occurs with stroke or spinal cord injury, paralysis (loss of voluntary movement) results. However, because the inhibitory influences of intact upper motor neurons are now impaired, reflex (involuntary) movements are uninhibited, and
hence hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, diminished or absent superficial reflexes, and pathologic reflexes such as a Babinski response occur. Severe leg spasms can occur as the result of an upper motor neuron lesion; the spasms result from the preserved reflex arc, which lacks inhibition along the spinal cord below the level of injury.

There is little or no muscle atrophy, and muscles remain permanently tense, exhibiting spastic paralysis or paresis (weakness). Paralysis associated with upper motor neuron lesions usually affects a whole extremity, both extremities, and an entire half of the body. Hemiplegia (paralysis of an arm and leg on the same side of the body) can be the result of an upper motor neuron lesion. If hemorrhage, an embolus, or a thrombus destroys the fibers from the motor area in the internal capsule, the arm and the leg of the opposite side become stiff and very weak or paralyzed, and the reflexes are hyperactive (further discussion of hemiplegia is found in Chap. 62). When both legs are paralyzed, the condition is called paraplegia; paralysis of all four extremities is quadriplegia (more discussion of these can be found in Chap. 63).

Lower Motor Neuron Lesions. A patient is considered to have lower motor neuron damage if a motor nerve is severed between

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 60-4 - Comparison of Upper Motor Neuron and Lower Motor Neuron Lesions} \\

\hline No muscle atrophy & Muscle atrophy \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
the muscle and the spinal cord. The result of lower motor neuron damage is muscle paralysis. Reflexes are lost, and the muscle becomes flaccid (limp) and atrophied from disuse. If the patient has injured the spinal trunk and it can heal, use of the muscles connected to that section of the spinal cord may be regained. If the anterior horn motor cells are destroyed, however, the nerves cannot regenerate and the muscles are never useful again. Flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the affected muscles are the principal signs of lower motor neuron disease. Lower motor neuron lesions can be the result of trauma, infection (poliomyelitis), toxins, vascular disorders, congenital malformations, degenerative processes, and neoplasms. Compression of nerve roots by herniated intervertebral disks is a common cause of lower motor neuron dysfunction.

Coordination of Movement. The smoothness, accuracy, and strength that characterize the muscular movements of a normal person are attributable to the influence of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia.

The cerebellum (refer to Fig. 60-2), described earlier, is located beneath the occipital lobe of the cerebrum; it is responsible for the coordination, balance, and timing of all muscular movements that originate in the motor centers of the cerebral cortex. Through the action of the cerebellum, the contractions of opposing muscle groups are adjusted in relation to each other to maximal mechanical advantage; muscle contractions can be sustained evenly at the desired tension and without significant fluctuation, and reciprocal movements can be reproduced at high and constant speed, in stereotyped fashion and with relatively little effort.

The basal ganglia, masses of gray matter in the midbrain beneath the cerebral hemispheres, border the lateral ventricles and lie in proximity to the internal capsule. The basal ganglia play an important role in planning and coordinating motor movements and posture. Complex neural connections link the basal ganglia with the cerebral cortex. The major effect of these structures is to inhibit unwanted muscular activity; disorders of the basal ganglia result in exaggerated, uncontrolled movements.

Impaired cerebellar function, which may occur as a result of an intracranial injury or some type of an expanding mass (eg, a hemorrhage, abscess, or tumor), results in loss of muscle tone, weakness, and fatigue. Depending on the area of the brain affected, the patient has different motor symptoms or responses. The patient may demonstrate decorticate, decerebrate, or flaccid posturing, usually as a result of cerebral trauma (Bateman, 2001). For further explanation of this, see Figure 61-1 in Chapter 61. Decortication (decorticate posturing) is the result of lesions of the internal capsule or cerebral hemispheres; the patient has flexion and internal rotation of the arms and wrists and extension, internal rotation, and plantar flexion of the feet. Decerebration (decerebrate posturing), the result of lesions at the midbrain, is more ominous than decortication. The patient has extension and external rotation of the arms and wrists and extension, plantar flexion, and internal rotation of the feet. Flaccid posturing is usually the result of lower brain stem dysfunction; the patient has no motor function, is limp, and lacks motor tone.

Flaccidity preceded by decerebration in a patient with cerebral injury indicates severe neurologic impairment, which may herald brain death. However, before the declaration of brain death, the patient must have spinal cord injury ruled out, the effects of all neuromuscular paralyzing agents must have worn off, and any other possible treatable causes of neurologic impairment must be investigated.

Tumors, infection, or abscess and increased intracranial pressure can all affect the cerebellum. Cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, incoordination, and seizures, as well as CSF obstruction and compression of the brain stem may be seen. Signs of increased intracranial pressure, including vomiting, headache, and changes in vital signs and level of consciousness, are especially common when CSF flow is obstructed.

Destruction or dysfunction of the basal ganglia leads not to paralysis but to muscle rigidity, with disturbances of posture and movement. Such patients tend to have involuntary movements. These may take the form of coarse tremors, most often in the upper extremities, particularly in the distal portions; athetosis, movement of a slow, squirming, writhing, twisting type; or chorea, marked by spasmodic, purposeless, irregular, uncoordinated motions of the trunk and the extremities, and facial grimacing. Disorders due to lesions of the basal ganglia include Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease (see Chap. 65), and spasmodic torticollis.

\section*{SENSORY SYSTEM FUNCTION}

Integrating Sensory Impulses. The thalamus, a major receiving and transmitting center for the afferent sensory nerves, is a large structure connected to the midbrain. It lies next to the third ventricle and forms the floor of the lateral ventricle (see Fig. 60-3). The thalamus integrates all sensory impulses except olfaction. It plays a role in the conscious awareness of pain and the recognition of variation in temperature and touch. The thalamus is responsible for the sense of movement and position and the ability to recognize the size, shape, and quality of objects.

Receiving Sensory Impulses. Afferent impulses travel from their points of origin to their destinations in the cerebral cortex via the ascending pathways directly, or they may cross at the level of the spinal cord or in the medulla, depending on the type of sensation that is registered. Sensory information may be integrated at the level of the spinal cord or may be relayed to the brain. Knowledge of these pathways is important for neurologic assessment and for understanding symptoms and their relationship to various lesions.

Sensory impulses enter the spinal cord by way of the posterior root. These axons convey sensations of heat, cold, and pain and enter the posterior gray column of the cord, where they make connections with the cells of secondary neurons. Pain and temperature fibers cross immediately to the opposite side of the cord and course upward to the thalamus. Fibers carrying sensations of touch, light pressure, and localization do not connect immediately with the second neuron but ascend the cord for a variable distance before entering the gray matter and completing this connection. The axon of the secondary neuron crosses the cord and proceeds upward to the thalamus.

Position and vibratory sensation are produced by stimuli arising from muscles, joints, and bones. These stimuli are conveyed, uncrossed, all the way to the brain stem by the axon of the primary neuron. In the medulla, synaptic connections are made with cells of the secondary neurons, whose axons cross to the opposite side and then proceed to the thalamus.

Sensory Losses. Destruction of a sensory nerve results in total loss of sensation in its area of distribution. Transection of the spinal cord yields complete anesthesia below the level of injury. Selective destruction or degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord is responsible for a loss of position and vibratory sense in segments distal to the lesion, without loss of touch, pain, or temperature perception. A lesion, such as a cyst, in the center of the spinal cord causes dissociation of sensation-loss of pain
at the level of the lesion. This occurs because the fibers carrying pain and temperature cross within the cord immediately on entering; thus, any lesion that divides the cord longitudinally divides these fibers. Other sensory fibers ascend the cord for variable distances, some even to the medulla, before crossing, thereby bypassing the lesion and avoiding destruction.

Lesions affecting the posterior spinal nerve roots may cause impairment of tactile sensation, including intermittent severe pain that is referred to their areas of distribution. Tingling of the fingers and the toes can be a prominent symptom of spinal cord disease, presumably due to degenerative changes in the sensory fibers that extend to the thalamus (ie, belonging to the spinothalamic tract).

\section*{Assessment: The Neurologic Examination}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

An important aspect of the neurologic assessment is the history of the present illness. The initial interview provides an excellent opportunity to systematically explore the patient's current condition and related events while simultaneously observing overall appearance, mental status, posture, movement and affect. Depending on the patient's condition, the nurse may need to rely on yes-or-no answers to questions, on a review of the medical record, or input from the family or a combination of these.

Neurologic disease may be stable or progressive, with both intermittent symptom-free periods as well as times with fluctuations in symptoms. The health history therefore includes details about the onset, character, severity, location, duration, and frequency of symptoms and signs; associated complaints; precipitating, aggravating, and relieving factors; progression, remission, and exacerbation; and the presence or absence of similar symptoms among family members. The nurse may also use the interview to inquire about any family history of genetic diseases. See the Genetics chart for assessment guidelines and Chapter 9 for additional information about genetics.

Included in the health history is a review of the medical history, including a system-by-system evaluation. The nurse should be aware of any history of trauma or falls that may have involved the head or spinal cord. Questions regarding the use of alcohol, medications, and recreational drugs are also included. The historytaking portion of the neurologic examination is critical and, in many cases of neurologic disease, leads to an accurate diagnosis.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

The clinical manifestations of neurologic disease are as varied as the disease processes themselves. Symptoms can be subtle or intense, fluctuating or permanent, an inconvenience or devastating. An introduction to some of the most common symptoms associ-

ated with neurologic disease follows; detailed discussions regarding how specific symptoms relate to a particular disorder will be covered in later chapters in this unit.

\section*{Pain}

Pain is considered an unpleasant sensory perception and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Pain is therefore considered multidimensional and entirely subjective (Loeser, 2001). Pain can be acute or chronic. In general, acute pain lasts for a relatively short period of time and remits as the pathology resolves. In neurologic disease, this type of pain is often associated with spinal disc disease, trigeminal neuralgia, or other neuropathic pathology (eg, postherpetic neuralgia, or painful neuropathies). In contrast, chronic pain extends for long periods of time and may represent a low level of pathology. This type of pain might also occur with discogenic disease.

\section*{Seizures}

Seizures are the result of abnormal paroxysmal discharges in the cerebral cortex, which then manifest as an alteration in sensation, behavior, movement, perception, or consciousness (Hickey, 2003). The alteration may be short, as in a blank stare lasting only a second, or of longer duration, such as a tonic-clonic grand mal seizure that can last several minutes. The type of seizure activity is a direct result of the area of the brain affected. Seizures can occur as isolated events, such as when induced by a high fever, alcohol or drug withdrawal, or hypoglycemia. A seizure may also be the first obvious sign of a brain lesion.

\section*{Dizziness}

Dizziness is an abnormal sensation of imbalance or movement. It is fairly common in the elderly and one of the most common complaints encountered by health professionals. Dizziness can have a variety of causes, including viral syndromes, hot weather, roller coaster rides, and middle ear infections, to name a few. One difficulty confronting health care providers when assessing dizziness is the vague and varied terms patients use to describe the sensation. Vertigo, a specific form of dizziness, is defined as a sensation that is usually a manifestation of vestibular dysfunction. It can be so severe as to result in spatial disorientation, loss of equilibrium, and nausea and vomiting (Greenberg, Aminoff, \& Simon, 2002).

\section*{Visual Disturbances}

Visual defects that cause people to seek health care can range from the decreased visual acuity associated with aging to sudden blindness caused by glaucoma. Normal vision depends upon functioning visual pathways through the retina and optic chiasm and the radiations into the visual cortex in the occipital lobes. Lesions of the eye itself (eg, cataract), lesions along the pathway (eg, tumor), or lesions in the visual cortex (from stroke) interfere with normal visual acuity. Abnormalities of eye movement (as in the nystagmus associated with multiple sclerosis) can also compromise vision by causing diplopia or double vision.

\section*{Weakness}

Weakness, specifically muscle weakness, is a common manifestation of neurologic disease. Weakness frequently coexists with other symptoms of disease and can affect a variety of muscles, causing a
wide range of disability. Weakness can be sudden and permanent, as in stroke, or progressive, as in many neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Any muscle group can be affected.

\section*{Abnormal Sensation}

Numbness, abnormal sensation, or loss of sensation is a neurologic manifestation of both central and peripheral nervous system disease. Altered sensation can affect small or large areas of the body. It is frequently associated with weakness or pain and is potentially disabling. Both numbness and weakness can significantly affect balance and coordination.

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

The neurologic examination is a systematic process that includes a variety of clinical tests, observations, and assessments designed to evaluate a complex system. Although the neurologic examination is often limited to a simple screening, the examiner must be able to conduct a thorough neurologic assessment when the patient's history or other physical findings warrant it. Many neurologic rating scales exist; some of the more common ones are discussed here, but an in-depth discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter (see Herndon [1997] and Rapp, Wakefield, Kundrat et al. [2000] for full descriptions of neurologic rating scales).

The brain and spinal cord cannot be examined as directly as other systems of the body. Thus, much of the neurologic examination is an indirect evaluation that assesses the function of the specific body part or parts controlled or innervated by the nervous system. A neurologic assessment is divided into five components: cerebral function, cranial nerves, motor system, sensory system, and reflexes. As in other parts of the physical assessment, the neurologic examination follows a logical sequence and progresses from higher levels of cortical function such as abstract thinking to lower levels of function such as the determination of the integrity of peripheral nerves.

\section*{Assessing Cerebral Function}

Cerebral abnormalities may cause disturbances in mental status, intellectual functioning, and thought content and in patterns of emotional behavior. There may also be alterations in perception, motor and language abilities, as well as lifestyle.

\section*{MENTAL STATUS}

An assessment of mental status begins by observing the patient's appearance and behavior, noting dress, grooming, and personal hygiene. Posture, gestures, movements, facial expressions, and motor activity often provide important information about the patient. The patient's manner of speech and level of consciousness are also assessed. Is the patient's speech clear and coherent? Is the patient alert and responsive, or drowsy and stuporous?

Assessing orientation to time, place, and person assists in evaluating mental status. Does the patient know what day it is, what year it is, and the name of the president of the United States? Is the patient aware of where he or she is? Is the patient aware of who the examiner is and of his or her purpose for being in the room? Is the capacity for immediate memory intact? (See Chart 12-1: Mini-Mental State Examination in Chap. 12.)

\section*{INTELLECTUAL FUNCTION}

A person with an average IQ can repeat seven digits without faltering and can recite five digits backward. The examiner might
ask the patient to count backward from 100 or to subtract 7 from 100, then 7 from that, and so forth (called serial 7s) (Johnson, 2001). The capacity to interpret well-known proverbs tests abstract reasoning, which is a higher intellectual function; for example, does the patient know what is meant by "the early bird catches the worm"? Patients with damage to the frontal cortex appear superficially normal until one or more tests of integrative capacity are performed. Questions designed to assess this capacity might include the ability to recognize similarities: how are a mouse and dog or pen and pencil alike? Can the patient make judgements about situations-for instance, if the patient arrived home without a house key, what alternatives are there?

\section*{THOUGHT CONTENT}

During the interview, it is important to assess the patient's thought content. Are the patient's thoughts spontaneous, natural, clear, relevant, and coherent? Does the patient have any fixed ideas, illusions, or preoccupations? What are his or her insights into these thoughts? Preoccupation with death or morbid events, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation are examples of unusual thoughts or perceptions that require further evaluation.

\section*{EMOTIONAL STATUS}

An assessment of cerebral functioning also includes the patient's emotional status. Is the patient's affect (external manifestation of mood) natural and even, or irritable and angry, anxious, apathetic or flat, or euphoric? Does his or her mood fluctuate normally, or does the patient unpredictably swing from joy to sadness during the interview? Is affect appropriate to words and thought content? Are verbal communications consistent with nonverbal cues?

\section*{PERCEPTION}

The examiner may now consider more specific areas of higher cortical function. Agnosia is the inability to interpret or recognize objects seen through the special senses. The patient may see a pencil but not know what it is called or what to do with it. The patient may even be able to describe it but not to interpret its function. The patient may experience auditory or tactile agnosia as well as visual agnosia. Each of the dysfunctions implicates a different part of the cortex (Chart 60-1).

Screening for visual and tactile agnosia provides insight into the patient's cortical interpretation ability. The patient is shown a familiar object and asked to identify it by name. Placing a familiar object (eg, key, coin) in the patient's hand and having him or her identify it with both eyes closed is an easy way to assess tactile interpretation.

\section*{MOTOR ABILITY}

Assessment of cortical motor integration is carried out by asking the patient to perform a skilled act (throw a ball, move a chair).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\begin{tabular}{l}
Chempt 60-1 \\
Types of Agnosia and Corresponding Sites of Lesions
\end{tabular}} \\
\hline Type of Agnosia & Affected Cerebral Area \\
\hline Visual & Occipital lobe \\
\hline Auditory & Temporal lobe (lateral and superior portions) \\
\hline Tactile & Parietal lobe \\
\hline Body parts and relationships & Parietal lobe (posteroinferior regions) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Successful performance requires the ability to understand the activity desired and normal motor strength. Failure signals cerebral dysfunction.

\section*{LANGUAGE ABILITY}

The person with normal neurologic function can understand and communicate in spoken and written language. Does the patient answer questions appropriately? Can he or she read a sentence from a newspaper and explain its meaning? Can the patient write his or her name or copy a simple figure that the examiner has drawn? A deficiency in language function is called aphasia. Different types of aphasia result from injury to different parts of the brain (Chart 60-2). Aphasia is discussed in detail in Chapter 62.

\section*{IMPACT ON LIFESTYLE}

The nurse assesses the impact the neurologic impairment has on the patient's lifestyle. Issues to consider include the limitations imposed on the patient by any deficit and the patient's role in society, including family and community roles. The plan of care that the nurse develops needs to address and support adaptation to the neurologic deficit and continued function to the extent possible within the patient's support system.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION OF FINDINGS}

Interpretation and documentation of neurologic abnormalities, particularly mental status abnormalities, should be specific and nonjudgmental. Lengthy descriptions and the use of terms such as "inappropriate" or "demented" should be avoided. Terms such as these often mean different things to different people and are therefore not useful when describing behavior. The examiner records and reports specific observations regarding orientation, level of consciousness, emotional state, or thought content, all of which permit comparison by others over time. Analysis and the conclusions that may be drawn from these findings usually depend on the examiner's knowledge of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neuropathology.

\section*{Examining the Cranial Nerves}

Table 60-5 describes how to assess the cranial nerves. Opposite sides of the face and neck are compared throughout the examination.

\section*{Examining the Motor System}

A thorough examination of the motor system includes an assessment of muscle size, tone, and strength, coordination, and balance. The patient is instructed to walk across the room while the examiner observes posture and gait. The muscles are inspected, and palpated if necessary, for their size and symmetry. Any evidence of atrophy or involuntary movements (tremors, tics) is noted. Muscle tone (the tension present in a muscle at rest) is evaluated by palpating various muscle groups at rest and during passive movement. Resistance to these movements is assessed and documented.

\end{table}

Abnormalities in tone include spasticity (increased muscle tone), rigidity (resistance to passive stretch), and flaccidity.

\section*{MUSCLE STRENGTH}

Assessing the patient's ability to flex or extend the extremities against resistance tests muscle strength. The function of an individual muscle or group of muscles is evaluated by placing the muscle at a disadvantage. The quadriceps, for example, is a powerful muscle responsible for straightening the leg. Once the leg is straightened, it is exceedingly difficult for the examiner to flex the knee. Conversely, if the knee is flexed and the patient is asked to straighten the leg against resistance, a more subtle disability can be elicited. The evaluation of muscle strength compares the sides of the body to each other. For example, the right upper extremity is compared to the left upper extremity. In this way, subtle differences in muscle strength can be more easily detected and accurately described.

Clinicians use a five-point scale to rate muscle strength (O'Hanlon-Nichols, 1999). A 5 indicates full power of contraction against gravity and resistance or normal muscle strength; 4 indicates fair but not full strength against gravity and a moderate amount of resistance or slight weakness; 3 indicates just sufficient strength to overcome the force of gravity or moderate weakness; 2 indicates the ability to move but not to overcome the force of gravity or severe weakness; 1 indicates minimal contractile power-weak muscle contraction can be palpated but no move-
ment is noted —or very severe weakness; and 0 indicates complete paralysis. A stick figure may be used to record muscle strength and is a precise form of documenting findings. Distal and proximal strength in both upper and lower extremities is recorded using the five-point scale (Fig. 60-14).

Assessment of muscle strength can be as detailed as necessary. One may quickly test the strength of the proximal muscles of the upper and lower extremities, always comparing both sides. The strength of the finer muscles that control the function of the hand (hand grasp) and the foot (dorsiflexion and plantar flexion) can then be assessed.

\section*{BALANCE AND COORDINATION}

Cerebellar influence on the motor system is reflected in balance control and coordination. Coordination in the hands and upper extremities is tested by having the patient perform rapid, alternating movements and point-to-point testing. First, the patient is instructed to pat his or her thigh as fast as possible with each hand separately. Then the patient is instructed to alternately pronate and supinate the hand as rapidly as possible. Lastly, the patient is asked to touch each of the fingers with the thumb in a consecutive motion. Speed, symmetry, and degree of difficulty are noted.

Point-to-point testing is accomplished by having the patient touch the examiner's extended finger and then his or her own nose. This is repeated several times. This assessment is then carried out with the patient's eyes closed.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-335.jpg?height=653&width=327&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=371}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 60-14 A stick figure may be used to record muscle strength as follows: 5, full range of motion against gravity and resistance; 4, full range of motion against gravity and a moderate amount of resistance; 3 , full range of motion against gravity only; 2 , full range of motion when gravity is eliminated; 1 , a weak muscle contraction when muscle is palpated, but no movement; and 0 , complete paralysis.}
\end{figure}

Coordination in the lower extremities is tested by having the patient run the heel down the anterior surface of the tibia of the other leg. Each leg is tested in turn. Ataxia is defined as incoordination of voluntary muscle action, particularly of the muscle groups used in activities such as walking or reaching for objects. The presence of ataxia or tremors (rhythmic, involuntary movements) during these movements suggests cerebellar disease.

It is not necessary to carry out each of these assessments for coordination. During a routine examination, it is advisable to perform a simple screening of the upper and lower extremities by having the patient perform either rapid, alternating movements or point-to-point testing. When abnormalities are observed, a more thorough examination is indicated.

The Romberg test is a screening test for balance. The patient stands with feet together and arms at the side, first with eyes open and then with both eyes closed for 20 to 30 seconds. The examiner stands close to reassure the patient of support if he or she begins to fall. Slight swaying is normal, but a loss of balance is abnormal and is considered a positive Romberg test. Additional cerebellar tests for balance in the ambulatory patient include hopping in place, alternating knee bends, and heel-to-toe walking (both forward and backward).

\section*{Examining the Reflexes}

The motor reflexes are involuntary contractions of muscles or muscle groups in response to abrupt stretching near the site of the muscle's insertion. The tendon is struck directly with a reflex hammer or indirectly by striking the examiner's thumb, which is placed firmly against the tendon. Testing these reflexes enables the examiner to assess involuntary reflex arcs that depend on the presence of afferent stretch receptors, spinal synapses, efferent motor fibers, and a variety of modifying influences from higher levels. Common reflexes that may be tested include the deep tendon reflexes (biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, patellar, and ankle reflexes) and superficial or cutaneous reflexes (abdominal reflexes and plantar or Babinski response) (Fig. 60-15).

\section*{TECHNIQUE}

A reflex hammer is used to elicit a deep tendon reflex. The handle of the hammer is held loosely between the thumb and index finger, allowing a full swinging motion. The wrist motion is similar to that used during percussion. The extremity is positioned so that the tendon is slightly stretched. This requires a sound knowledge of the location of muscles and their tendon attachments. The tendon is then struck briskly, and the response is compared with that on the opposite side of the body. A wide variation in reflex response may be considered normal; it is more important, however, that the reflexes be symmetrically equivalent. When the comparison is made, both sides should be equivalently relaxed and each tendon struck with equal force.

Valid findings depend on several factors: proper use of the reflex hammer, proper positioning of the extremity, and a relaxed patient. If the reflexes are symmetrically diminished or absent, the examiner may use reinforcement to increase reflex activity. This involves the isometric contraction of other muscle groups. If lower extremity reflexes are diminished or absent, the patient is instructed to lock the fingers together and pull in opposite directions. Having the patient clench the jaw or press the heels against the floor or examining table may similarly elicit more reliable biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes.

\section*{GRADING THE REFLEXES}

The absence of reflexes is significant, although ankle jerks (Achilles reflex) may be normally absent in older people. Deep tendon reflex responses are often graded on a scale of 0 to $4+$. A $4+$ indicates a hyperactive reflex, often indicating pathology; 3+ indicates a response that is more brisk than average but may be normal or indicative of disease; 2+ indicates an average or normal response; 1+ indicates a hypoactive or diminished response; and 0 indicates no response. As stated previously, scale ratings are highly subjective. Findings can be recorded as a fraction, indicating the scale range (eg, 2/4). Some examiners prefer to use the terms present, absent, and diminished when describing reflexes. As with muscle strength recording, a stick figure such as the one shown in Chart 60-3 may also be used to record numerical findings.

\section*{BICEPS REFLEX}

The biceps reflex is elicited by striking the biceps tendon of the flexed elbow. The examiner supports the forearm with one arm while placing the thumb against the tendon and striking the thumb with the reflex hammer. The normal response is flexion at the elbow and contraction of the biceps (see Fig. 60-15A).

\section*{TRICEPS REFLEX}

To elicit a triceps reflex, the patient's arm is flexed at the elbow and positioned in front of the chest. The examiner supports the patient's arm and identifies the triceps tendon by palpating 2.5 to 5 cm ( 1 to 2 in ) above the elbow. A direct blow on the tendon normally produces contraction of the triceps muscle and extension of the elbow (see Fig. 60-15B).

\section*{BRACHIORADIALIS REFLEX}

With the patient's forearm resting on the lap or across the abdomen, the brachioradialis reflex is assessed. A gentle strike of the hammer 2.5 to 5 cm ( 1 to 2 in ) above the wrist results in flexion and supination of the forearm.

\section*{PATELLAR REFLEX}

The patellar reflex is elicited by striking the patellar tendon just below the patella. The patient may be in a sitting or a lying posi-

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
tion. If the patient is supine, the examiner supports the legs to facilitate relaxation of the muscles. Contractions of the quadriceps and knee extension are normal responses (see Fig. 60-15C).

\section*{ANKLE REFLEX}

To elicit an ankle (Achilles) reflex, the foot is dorsiflexed at the ankle and the hammer strikes the stretched Achilles tendon (see Fig. 60-15D). This reflex normally produces plantar flexion. If the examiner cannot elicit the ankle reflex and suspects that the patient cannot relax, the patient is instructed to kneel on a chair or similar elevated, flat surface. This position places the ankles in dorsiflexion and reduces any muscle tension in the gastrocnemius. The Achilles tendons are struck in turn, and plantar flexion is usually demonstrated.

\section*{CLONUS}

When reflexes are very hyperactive, a phenomenon called clonus may be elicited. If the foot is abruptly dorsiflexed, it may continue to "beat" two or three times before it settles into a position of rest. Occasionally with central nervous system disease this activity persists and the foot does not come to rest while the tendon is being stretched but persists in repetitive activity. The unsustained clonus associated with normal but hyperactive reflexes is not considered pathologic. Sustained clonus always indicates the presence of central nervous system disease and requires further evaluation.

\section*{SUPERFICIAL REFLEXES}

The major superficial reflexes include corneal, gag or swallowing, upper/lower abdominal, cremasteric (men only), plantar, and
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-337.jpg?height=631&width=1777&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=112)
perianal. These reflexes are graded differently than the motor reflexes and are noted to be present (+) or absent (-). Of these, only three are tested commonly. The corneal reflex is tested carefully using a clean wisp of cotton and lightly touching the outer corner of each eye on the sclera. The reflex is present if the action elicits a blink. Conditions such as a cerebrovascular accident or coma might result in loss of this reflex, either unilaterally or bilaterally. Loss of this reflex indicates the need for eye protection and possible lubrication to prevent corneal damage.

The gag reflex is elicited by gently touching the posterior pharynx with a cotton-tipped applicator; first on one side of the uvula and then the other. Positive response is an equal elevation of the uvula and "gag" with stimulation. Absent response on one or both sides can be seen following a cerebrovascular accident and requires careful evaluation and treatment of the resultant swallowing dysfunction to prevent aspiration of food and fluids into the lungs.

The plantar reflex is elicited by stroking the lateral side of the foot with a tongue blade or the handle of a reflex hammer. Stimulation normally causes toe flexion. Toe fanning (positive Babinski) is an abnormal response and is discussed below (O’Hanlon-Nichols, 1999).

\section*{BABINSKI RESPONSE}

A well-known reflex indicative of central nervous system disease affecting the corticospinal tract is the Babinski reflex. In someone with an intact central nervous system, if the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot is stroked, the toes contract and are drawn together (see Fig. 60-15E). In patients who have central nervous system disease of the motor system, however, the toes fan out and are drawn back. This is normal in newborns but represents a serious abnormality in adults. Several other reflexes convey similar information. Many of them are interesting but not particularly informative.

\section*{Sensory Examination}

The sensory system is even more complex than the motor system because sensory modalities are carried in different tracts located in different portions of the spinal cord. The sensory examination is largely subjective and requires the cooperation of the patient. The examiner should be familiar with dermatomes that represent the distribution of the peripheral nerves that arise from the spinal
cord (see Fig. 60-11). Most sensory deficits result from peripheral neuropathy and follow anatomic dermatomes. Exceptions to this include major destructive lesions of the brain; loss of sensation, which may affect an entire side of the body; and the neuropathies associated with alcoholism, which occur in a glove-and-stocking distribution or over the entire hand or foot in areas traditionally covered by a glove or sock.

Assessment of the sensory system involves tests for tactile sensation, superficial pain, vibration, and position sense (proprioception). During the sensory assessment, the patient's eyes are closed. Simple directions and reassurance that the examiner will not hurt or startle the patient encourage the cooperation of the patient.

Tactile sensation is assessed by lightly touching a cotton wisp to corresponding areas on each side of the body. The sensitivity of proximal parts of the extremities is compared with that of distal parts.

Pain and temperature sensations are transmitted together in the lateral part of the spinal cord, so it is unnecessary to test for temperature sense in most circumstances. Determining the patient's sensitivity to a sharp object can assess superficial pain perception. The patient is asked to differentiate between the sharp and dull ends of a broken wooden cotton swab or tongue blade; using a safety pin is inadvisable because it breaks the integrity of the skin. Both the sharp and dull sides of the object are applied with equal intensity at all times, and as with the motor evaluation the two sides are compared.

Vibration and proprioception are transmitted together in the posterior part of the cord. Vibration may be evaluated through the use of a low-frequency ( $128-$ or $256-\mathrm{Hz}$ ) tuning fork. The handle of the vibrating fork is placed against a bony prominence, and the patient is asked whether he or she feels a sensation and is instructed to signal the examiner when the sensation ceases. Common locations used to test for vibratory sense include the distal joint of the great toe and the proximal thumb joint. If the patient does not perceive the vibrations at the distal bony prominences, the examiner progresses upward with the tuning fork until the patient perceives the vibrations. As with all measurements of sensation, a side-to-side comparison is made.

Position sense or proprioception may be determined by asking the patient to close both eyes and indicate, as the great toe is alternately moved up and down, in which direction movement has taken place. Vibration and position sense are often lost
together, frequently in circumstances in which all others remain intact.

Integration of sensation in the brain is evaluated next. This may be performed by testing two-point discrimination-when the patient is touched with two sharp objects simultaneously, are they perceived as two or as one? If touched simultaneously on opposite sides of the body, the patient should normally report being touched in two places. If only one site is reported, the one not being recognized is said to demonstrate extinction. Another test of higher cortical sensory ability is stereognosis. The patient is instructed to close both eyes and identify a variety of objects (eg, keys, coins) that are placed in one hand by the examiner.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The nervous system undergoes many changes during the normal aging process and is extremely vulnerable to general systemic illness. Changes throughout the nervous system vary in degree as the person ages. Nerve fibers that connect directly to muscles show little decline in function with age, as do simple neurologic functions that involve a number of connections in the spinal cord. Disease in the elderly often makes it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal changes. However, it is important for clinicians not to attribute abnormality or dysfunction to aging without appropriate investigation (Kaye \& Quinn, 2000).

Structural Changes. There are a number of alterations that occur with increasing age. Brain weight decreases, as does the number of synapses. A loss of neurons occurs in select regions of the brain. There is a reduction in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Temperature regulation becomes less efficient. In the peripheral nervous system, myelin is lost, resulting in a decrease in conduction velocity in some nerves. There is an overall reduction in muscle bulk and the electrical activity within muscles. Taste buds atrophy and nerve cell fibers in the olfactory bulb degenerate. Nerve cells in the vestibular system of the inner ear, cerebellum, and proprioceptive pathways also degenerate. Deep tendon reflexes can be decreased or in some cases absent. Hypothalamic function is modified such that stage IV sleep is reduced. There is an overall slowing of autonomic nervous system responses. Pupillary responses are reduced or may not appear at all in the presence of cataracts (Kaye \& Quinn, 2000).

Motor Alterations. There is an overall reduction in muscle bulk, with atrophy most easily noted in the hands (Kaye \& Quinn, 2000). Changes in motor function often result in a flexed posture, shuffling gait, and rigidity of movement. These changes can create difficulties for the older person in maintaining or recovering balance. Strength and agility are diminished, and reaction time and movement time are decreased. Repetitive movements and mild tremors may be noted during an examination and may be of concern to the individual. Observation of gait may reveal a wide-based gait with balance difficulties.

Sensory Alterations. Sensory isolation due to visual and hearing loss can cause confusion, anxiety, disorientation, misinterpretation of the environment, and feelings of inadequacy. Sensory alterations may require modification of the home environment, such as large-print reading materials or sound enhancement for the telephone, as well as extra orientation to new surroundings. Simple explanations of routines, the location of the bathroom, and how to operate the call bell are just a few examples of information the elderly patient needs when hospitalized.

Temperature Regulation and Pain Perception. Other manifestations of neurologic changes are related to temperature regulation and pain. The elderly patient may feel cold more readily than heat and may require extra covering when in bed; a room temperature somewhat higher than usual may be desirable. Reaction to painful stimuli may be decreased with age. Because pain is an important warning signal, caution must be used when hot or cold packs are used. The older patient may be burned or suffer frostbite before being aware of any discomfort. Complaints of pain, such as abdominal discomfort or chest pain, may be more serious than the patient's perception might indicate and thus require careful evaluation.

Taste and Smell Alterations. The acuity of the taste buds decreases with age; along with an altered olfactory sense, this may cause a decreased appetite and subsequent weight loss. Extra seasoning often increases food intake as long as it does not cause gastric irritation. A decreased sense of smell due to atrophy of olfactory organs may present a safety hazard, because elderly people living alone may be unable to detect household gas leaks or fires. Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, important for all, are critical for the elderly.

Tactile and Visual Alterations. Another neurologic alteration in the elderly patient is the dulling of tactile sensation due to a decrease in the number of areas of the body responding to all stimuli and in the number and sensitivity of sensory receptors. There may be difficulty in identifying objects by touch, and because fewer tactile cues are received from the bottom of the feet, the person may get confused as to body position and location.

These factors, combined with sensitivity to glare, decreased peripheral vision, and a constricted visual field, may result in disorientation, especially at night when there is little or no light in the room. Because the elderly person takes longer to recover visual sensitivity when moving from a light to dark area, night-lights and a safe and familiar arrangement of furniture are essential.

Mental Status. Mental status is evaluated while the history is obtained, and areas of judgment, intelligence, memory, affect, mood, orientation, speech, and grooming are assessed. Family members who bring the patient to the attention of the health care provider may have noticed changes in the patient's mental status. Drug toxicity should always be suspected as a causative factor when the patient has a change in mental status. Delirium (mental confusion, usually with delusions and hallucinations) is seen in elderly patients who have underlying central nervous system damage or are experiencing an acute condition such as infection, adverse medication reaction, or dehydration. About $25 \%$ of patients over the age of 70 admitted to the hospital have delirium (Johnson, 2001). The cause is often reversible and treatable (as in drug toxicity, vitamin B deficiency, or thyroid disease). Depression may produce impairment of attention and memory. For elderly patients, delirium, which is an acute change in mental status attributable to a treatable medical problem, must be differentiated from dementia, which is a chronic and irreversible deterioration of cognitive status.

Nursing Implications. Nursing care for patients with age-related changes to the nervous system and for patients with long-term neurologic disability who are aging should include the modifications previously described. In addition, the consequences of any neurologic deficit and its impact on overall function such as activities of daily living, use of assistive devices, and individual
coping need to be assessed and considered in planning care for patients.

Patient teaching is also affected because the nurse must understand the altered responses and the changing needs of the elderly patient before beginning to teach. When caring for the elderly patient, the nurse adapts activities such as preoperative teaching, diet therapy, and instruction about new medications, their timing, and doses to the patient's needs and capabilities. The nurse considers the presence of decline in fine motor movement and failing vision. When using visual materials for teaching or menu selection, adequate lighting without glare, contrasting colors, and large print are used to offset visual difficulties caused by rigidity and opacity of the lens in the eye and slower pupillary reaction.

Procedures and preparations needed for diagnostic tests are explained, taking into account the possibility of impaired hearing and slowed responses in the elderly. Even with hearing loss, the elderly patient often hears adequately if the speaker uses a lowpitched, clear voice; shouting only makes it harder for the patient to understand the speaker. Providing auditory and visual cues aids understanding; if the patient has a significant hearing or visual loss, assistive devices, a signer, or a translator may be needed.

Teaching at an unrushed pace and using reinforcement enhance learning and retention. Material should be short, concise, and concrete. Vocabulary is matched to the patient's ability, and terms are clearly defined. The elderly patient requires adequate time to receive and respond to stimuli, to learn, and to react. These measures allow comprehension, memory, and formation of association and concepts.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

\section*{COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANNING}

Computed tomography (CT) makes use of a narrow x-ray beam to scan the head in successive layers. The images provide crosssectional views of the brain, with distinguishing differences in tissue densities of the skull, cortex, subcortical structures, and ventricles. The brightness of each slice of the brain in the final image is proportional to the degree to which it absorbs x-rays. The image is displayed on an oscilloscope or TV monitor and is photographed and stored digitally (Hinkle, 1999a).

Lesions in the brain are seen as variations in tissue density differing from the surrounding normal brain tissue. Abnormalities of tissue indicate possible tumor masses, brain infarction, displacement of the ventricles, and cortical atrophy. Whole-body CT scanners allow sections of the spinal cord to be visualized. The injection of a water-soluble iodinated contrast agent into the subarachnoid space through lumbar puncture improves the visualization of the spinal and intracranial contents on these images. The CT scan, along with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has largely replaced myelography as a diagnostic procedure for the diagnosis of herniated lumbar disks.

CT scanning is usually performed first without contrast material and then with intravenous contrast enhancement. The patient lies on an adjustable table with the head held in a fixed position, while the scanning system rotates around the head and produces cross-sectional images. The patient must lie with the head held perfectly still without talking or moving the face, because head motion will distort the image.

CT scanning is noninvasive and painless and has a high degree of sensitivity for detecting lesions. With advances in CT scan-
ning, the number of disorders and injuries that can be diagnosed is increasing.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Essential nursing interventions include preparation for the procedure and patient monitoring. Preparation includes teaching the patient about the need to lie quietly throughout the procedure. A review of relaxation techniques may be helpful for claustrophobic patients.

Sedation can be used if agitation, restlessness, or confusion will interfere with a successful study (Hinkle, 1999a). Ongoing patient monitoring during sedation is necessary. If a contrast agent is used, the patient must be assessed before the CT scan for an iodine/shellfish allergy, as the contrast agent is iodine-based. An intravenous line for injection of the contrast agent and a period of fasting (usually 4 hours) are required prior to the study. Patients who receive an intravenous or inhalation contrast agent are monitored during and after the procedure for allergic reactions and other side effects, including flushing, nausea, and vomiting.

\section*{POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY}

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a computer-based nuclear imaging technique that produces images of actual organ functioning. The patient either inhales a radioactive gas or is injected with a radioactive substance that emits positively charged particles. When these positrons combine with negatively charged electrons (normally found in the body's cells), the resultant gamma rays can be detected by a scanning device that produces a series of two-dimensional views at various levels of the brain. This information is integrated by a computer and gives a composite picture of the brain at work.

PET permits the measurement of blood flow, tissue composition, and brain metabolism and thus indirectly evaluates brain function. The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs, consuming $80 \%$ of the glucose the body uses. PET measures this activity in specific areas of the brain and can detect changes in glucose use.

This test is useful in showing metabolic changes in the brain (Alzheimer's disease), locating lesions (brain tumor, epileptogenic lesions), identifying blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with strokes, evaluating new therapies for brain tumors, and revealing biochemical abnormalities associated with mental illness. The isotopes used have a very short half-life and are expensive to produce, requiring specialized equipment for production. PET scanning has been useful in research settings for the last 20 years and is now becoming more available in clinical settings. Improvements in scanning itself and the production of isotopes, as well as the advent of reimbursement by third-party payers, has increased the availability of PET studies (Gjedde et al., 2001).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Key nursing interventions include patient preparation, which involves explaining the test and teaching the patient about inhalation techniques and the sensations (eg, dizziness, lightheadedness, and headache) that may occur. The intravenous injection of the radioactive substance produces similar side effects. Relaxation exercises may reduce anxiety during the test.

\section*{SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY}

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a three-dimensional imaging technique that uses radionuclides and instruments to detect single photons. It is a perfusion study that captures a moment of cerebral blood flow at the time of injection of a radionuclide (Huntington, 1999). Gamma photons are emitted from a radiopharmaceutical agent administered to the patient and are detected by a rotating gamma camera or cameras; the image is sent to a minicomputer. This approach allows areas behind overlying structures or background to be viewed, greatly increasing the contrast between normal and abnormal tissue. It is relatively inexpensive, and the duration is similar to that of a CT scan.

SPECT is useful in detecting the extent and location of abnormally perfused areas of the brain, thus allowing detection, localization, and sizing of stroke (before it is visible by CT scan), localization of seizure foci in epilepsy, and evaluation of perfusion before and after neurosurgical procedures. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications to SPECT.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The nursing interventions for SPECT primarily include patient preparation and patient monitoring. Teaching about what to expect before the test can allay anxiety and ensure patient cooperation during the test. Premenopausal women are advised to practice effective contraception before and for several days after testing, and the woman who is breastfeeding is instructed to stop nursing for the period of time recommended by the nuclear medicine department.

The nurse may need to accompany and monitor the patient during transport to the nuclear medicine department for the scan. Patients are monitored during and after the procedure for allergic reactions to the radiopharmaceutical agent. In a few institutions nurses with special education and training inject the contrast agent before a SPECT scan (Fischbach, 2002; Huntington, 1999).

\section*{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a powerful magnetic field to obtain images of different areas of the body (Fig. 60-16). This diagnostic test involves altering hydrogen ions in the body. Placing the patient into a powerful magnetic field causes the hydrogen nuclei (protons) within the body to align like small

magnets in a magnetic field. In combination with radiofrequency pulses, the protons emit signals, which are converted to images. MRI has the potential for identifying a cerebral abnormality earlier and more clearly than other diagnostic tests. It can provide information about the chemical changes within cells, allowing the clinician to monitor a tumor's response to treatment. It is particularly useful in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and can describe the activity and extent of disease in the brain and spinal cord. MRI does not involve ionizing radiation.

Several newer MRI techniques, including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), are becoming more widely used (Hinkle, 1999b; Shellock, 2001). The use of MRA allows visualization of the cerebral vasculature without the administration of an arterial contrast agent. A substantial amount of research on the techniques of DWI, PWI, and FLAIR shows promise for clearer visualization and the early diagnosis of ischemic stroke (Hinkle, 1999b). At present MRI is most valuable in the diagnosis of nonacute conditions, as the test takes up to an hour to complete.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Patient preparation should include teaching relaxation techniques and informing the patient that he or she will be able to talk to the staff by means of a microphone located inside the scanner. Many MRI suites provide headphones so patients can listen to the music of their choice during the procedure.

Before the patient enters the room where the MRI is to be performed, all metal objects and credit cards (the magnetic field can erase them) are removed. No metal objects may be brought into the room where the MRI is located (Shellock, 2001): this includes oxygen tanks, traditional ventilators, or even stethoscopes. The magnetic field generated by the unit is so strong that any metal-containing items will be strongly attracted and literally can be pulled away with such force that they fly like projectiles toward the magnet. There is a risk of severe injury and death; furthermore, damage to a very expensive piece of equipment may occur. A patient history is obtained to determine the presence of any metal objects (eg, aneurysm clips, orthopedic hardware, pacemakers, artificial heart valves, intrauterine devices). These objects could malfunction, be dislodged, or heat up as they absorb energy. Cochlear implants will be inactivated by MRI; therefore, other imaging procedures are considered.

> NURSING ALERT For patient safety, the nurse must make sure no patient care equipment (eg, portable oxygen tanks) that contains metal or metal parts enters the room where the MRI is located.

The patient lies on a flat platform that is moved into a tube housing the magnet. The scanning process is painless, but the patient hears loud thumping of the magnetic coils as the magnetic field is being pulsed. Because the MRI scanner is a narrow tube, patients may experience claustrophobia; sedation may be prescribed in these circumstances. Newer versions of MRI machines are less claustrophobic than the earlier devices and are available in some locations. However, the images produced on these machines are not optimal, and the traditional device is preferable for accurate diagnosis.

\section*{CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAPHY}

Cerebral angiography is an x-ray study of the cerebral circulation with a contrast agent injected into a selected artery. Cerebral angiography is a valuable tool to investigate vascular disease, aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformations. It is frequently performed before craniotomy to assess the patency and adequacy of the cerebral circulation and to determine the site, size, and nature of the pathologic processes (Fischbach, 2002; Frizzell, 1998).

Most cerebral angiograms are performed by threading a catheter through the femoral artery in the groin and up to the desired vessel. Alternatively, direct puncture of the carotid or vertebral artery or retrograde injection of a contrast agent into the brachial artery may be performed.

In digital subtraction angiography (DSA), x-ray images of the area in question are obtained before and after the injection of a contrast agent. The computer analyzes the differences between the two images and produces an enhanced image of the carotid and vertebral arterial systems. The injection for a DSA can be given through a peripheral vein (Fischbach, 2002; Rowland, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The patient should be well hydrated, and clear liquids are usually permitted up to the time of a regular arteriogram or DSA. Before going to the x-ray department, the patient is instructed to void. The locations of the appropriate peripheral pulses are marked with a felt-tip pen. The patient is instructed to remain immobile during the angiogram process and is told to expect a brief feeling of warmth in the face, behind the eyes, or in the jaw, teeth, tongue, and lips, and a metallic taste when the contrast agent is injected.

After the groin is shaved and prepared, a local anesthetic is administered to prevent pain at the insertion site and to reduce arterial spasm. A catheter is introduced into the femoral artery, flushed with heparinized saline, and filled with contrast agent. Fluoroscopy is used to guide the catheter to the appropriate vessels. During injection of the contrast agent, images are made of the arterial and venous phases of circulation through the brain.

Nursing care after cerebral angiography includes observation for signs and symptoms of altered cerebral blood flow. In some instances, patients may experience major or minor arterial blockage due to embolism, thrombosis, or hemorrhage, producing a neurologic deficit. Signs of such an occurrence include alterations in the level of responsiveness and consciousness, weakness on one side of the body, motor or sensory deficits, and speech disturbances. Therefore, it is necessary to observe the patient frequently for these signs and to report them immediately if they occur.

The injection site is observed for hematoma formation (a localized collection of blood), and an ice bag may be applied intermittently to the puncture site to relieve swelling and discomfort. Because a hematoma at the puncture site or embolization to a distant artery affects the peripheral pulses, these pulses are monitored frequently. The color and temperature of the involved extremity are assessed to detect possible embolism.

\section*{MYELOGRAPHY}

A myelogram is an x-ray of the spinal subarachnoid space taken after the injection of a contrast agent into the spinal subarachnoid space through a lumbar puncture. It outlines the spinal subarachnoid space and shows any distortion of the spinal cord or spinal dural sac caused by tumors, cysts, herniated vertebral disks,
or other lesions. Water-based agents have replaced oil-based agents and their use has reduced side effects and complications; these agents disperse upward through the CSF. Myelography is performed less frequently today because of the sensitivity of CT scanning and MRI (Hickey, 2003).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Because many patients have misconceptions about this procedure, the nurse clarifies the explanation given by the physician and answers questions. The patient is informed about what to expect during the procedure and should be aware that changes in position may be made during the procedure. The meal that normally would be eaten before the procedure is omitted. A sedative may be prescribed to help the patient cope with this rather lengthy test. Patient preparation for lumbar puncture is discussed later in this chapter.

After myelography, the patient lies in bed with the head of the bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees. The patient is advised to remain in bed in the recommended position for 3 hours or as prescribed by the physician. The patient is encouraged to drink liberal amounts of fluid for rehydration and replacement of CSF and to decrease the incidence of postlumbar puncture headache. The blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature are monitored, as well as the patient's ability to void. Untoward signs include headache, fever, stiff neck, photophobia (sensitivity to light), seizures, and signs of chemical or bacterial meningitis.

\section*{NONINVASIVE CAROTID FLOW STUDIES}

Noninvasive carotid flow studies use ultrasound imagery and Doppler measurements of arterial blood flow to evaluate carotid and deep orbital circulation. The graph produced indicates blood velocity. Increased blood velocity can indicate stenosis or partial obstruction. These tests are often obtained before arteriography, which carries a higher risk of stroke or death (Fischbach, 2002; Hickey, 2003). Carotid Doppler, carotid ultrasonography, oculoplethysmography, and ophthalmodynamometry are four common noninvasive vascular techniques that permit evaluation of arterial blood flow and detection of arterial stenosis, occlusion, and plaques.

\section*{TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER}

Transcranial Doppler uses the same noninvasive techniques as carotid flow studies except that it records the blood flow velocities of the intracranial vessels. Flow velocities of the basal artery can be measured through thin areas of the temporal and occipital bones of the skull. A hand-held Doppler probe emits a pulsed beam; the signal is reflected by the moving red blood cells within the blood vessels (Falyar, 1999). Transcranial Doppler sonography is a noninvasive technique that is helpful in assessing vasospasm (a complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage), altered cerebral blood flow found in occlusive vascular disease or stroke, and other cerebral pathology.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

When a carotid flow study or transcranial Doppler is scheduled, the procedure is described to the patient. The patient is informed that this is a noninvasive test, that a hand-held transducer will be placed over the neck and orbits of the eyes, and that some type of water-soluble jelly is used on the transducer. Either one of these low-risk tests can be performed at the patient's bedside.

\section*{ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY}

An electroencephalogram (EEG) represents a record of the electrical activity generated in the brain. It is obtained through electrodes applied on the scalp or through microelectrodes placed within the brain tissue. It provides a physiologic assessment of cerebral activity.

The EEG is a useful test for diagnosing and evaluating seizure disorders, coma, or organic brain syndrome. Tumors, brain abscesses, blood clots, and infection may cause abnormal patterns in electrical activity. The EEG is also used in making a determination of brain death.

Electrodes are applied to the scalp to record the electrical activity in various regions of the brain. The amplified activity of the neurons between any two of these electrodes is recorded on continuously moving paper; this record is called the encephalogram.

For a baseline recording, the patient lies quietly with both eyes closed. The patient may be asked to hyperventilate for 3 to 4 minutes and then look at a bright, flashing light for photic stimulation. These activation procedures are performed to evoke abnormal electrical discharges, such as seizure potentials. A sleep EEG may be recorded after sedation because some abnormal brain waves are seen only when the patient is asleep. If the epileptogenic area is inaccessible to conventional scalp electrodes, nasopharyngeal electrodes may be used.

Depth recording of EEG is performed by introducing electrodes stereotactically (radiologically placed using instrumentation) into a target area of the brain, as indicated by the patient's seizure pattern and scalp EEG. It is used to identify patients who may benefit from surgical excision of epileptogenic foci.

Special transsphenoidal, mandibular, and nasopharyngeal electrodes can be used, and video recording combined with EEG monitoring and telemetry is used in hospital settings to capture epileptiform abnormalities and their sequelae. Some epilepsy centers provide long-term ambulatory EEG monitoring with portable recording devices.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

To increase the chances of recording seizure activity, it is sometimes recommended that the patient be deprived of sleep on the night before the EEG. Antiseizure agents, tranquilizers, stimulants, and depressants should be withheld 24 to 48 hours before an EEG because these medications can alter the EEG wave patterns or mask the abnormal wave patterns of seizure disorders (Hickey, 2003). Coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks are omitted in the meal before the test because of their stimulating effect. The meal is not omitted, however, because an altered blood glucose level can also cause changes in the brain wave patterns.

The patient is informed that the standard EEG takes 45 to 60 minutes, 12 hours for a sleep EEG. The patient is assured that the procedure does not cause an electric shock and that the EEG is a diagnostic test, not a form of treatment. An EEG requires patient cooperation and ability to lie quietly during the test. Sedation is not advisable as it may lower the seizure threshold in patients with a seizure disorder and alter brain wave activity in all patients. Patients with seizures do not stop taking their antiseizure medication prior to testing.

Routine EEGs use a water-soluble lubricant for electrode contact, which at the conclusion of the study can be wiped off and removed by shampooing. Sleep EEGs involve the use of collodion glue for electrode contact, which requires acetone for removal.

\section*{EVOKED POTENTIAL STUDIES}

In evoked potential studies, electrodes are applied to the scalp and an external stimulus is applied to peripheral sensory receptors to elicit changes in the brain waves. Evoked changes are detected with the aid of computerized devices that extract the signal, display it on an oscilloscope, and store the data on magnetic tape or disk. These studies are based on the concept that any insult or dysfunction that can alter neuronal metabolism or disturb membrane function may change evoked responses in brain waves. In neurologic diagnosis, they reflect conduction times in the peripheral nervous system. In clinical practice, the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems are most often tested.

In visual evoked responses, the patient looks at a visual stimulus (flashing lights, a checkerboard pattern on a screen). The average of several hundred stimuli is recorded by EEG leads placed over the occiput. The transit time from the retina to the occipital area is measured using computer-averaging methods.

Auditory evoked responses or brain stem evoked responses are measured by applying an auditory stimulus (a repetitive auditory click) and measuring the transit time up the brain stem into the cortex. Specific lesions in the auditory pathway modify or delay the response.

In somatosensory evoked responses, the peripheral nerves are stimulated (electrical stimulation through skin electrodes) and the transit time up the spinal cord to the cortex is measured and recorded from scalp electrodes.

This test is used to detect a deficit in spinal cord conduction and to monitor spinal cord function during operative procedures. Because myelinated fibers conduct impulses at a higher rate of speed, nerves with an intact myelin sheath record the highest velocity. Demyelination of nerve fibers leads to a decrease in speed of conduction, as found in Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and polyneuropathies.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

There is no specific patient preparation other than to explain the procedure and to reassure the patient and encourage him or her to relax. The patient is advised to remain perfectly still throughout the recording to prevent artifacts (signals not generated by the brain) that interfere with the recording and interpretation of the test.

\section*{ELECTROMYOGRAPHY}

An electromyogram (EMG) is obtained by introducing needle electrodes into the skeletal muscles to measure changes in the electrical potential of the muscles and the nerves leading to them. The electrical potentials are shown on an oscilloscope and amplified by a loudspeaker so that both the sound and appearance of the waves can be analyzed and compared simultaneously.

An EMG is useful in determining the presence of a neuromuscular disorder and myopathies. They help to distinguish weakness due to neuropathy (functional or pathologic changes in the peripheral nervous system) from weakness due to other causes.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The procedure is explained and the patient is warned to expect a sensation similar to that of an intramuscular injection as the needle is inserted into the muscle. The muscles examined may ache for a short time after the procedure.

\section*{NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES}

Nerve conduction studies are performed by stimulating a peripheral nerve at several points along its course and recording the muscle action potential or the sensory action potential that results. Surface or needle electrodes are placed on the skin over the nerve to stimulate the nerve fibers. This test is useful in the study of peripheral neuropathies.

\section*{LUMBAR PUNCTURE AND EXAMINATION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID}

A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is carried out by inserting a needle into the lumbar subarachnoid space to withdraw CSF. The test may be performed to obtain CSF for examination, to measure and reduce CSF pressure, to determine the presence or absence of blood in the CSF, to detect spinal subarachnoid block, and to administer antibiotics intrathecally (into the spinal canal) in certain cases of infection.

The needle is usually inserted into the subarachnoid space between the third and fourth or fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. Because the spinal cord divides into a sheaf of nerves at the first lumbar vertebra, insertion of the needle below the level of the third lumbar vertebra prevents puncture of the spinal cord.

A successful lumbar puncture requires that the patient be relaxed; an anxious patient is tense, and this may increase the pressure reading. CSF pressure with the patient in a lateral recumbent position is normally 70 to $200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Pressures of more than $200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ are considered abnormal.

A lumbar puncture may be risky in the presence of an intracranial mass lesion because intracranial pressure is decreased by the removal of CSF, and the brain may herniate downward through the tentorium and the foramen magnum.

\section*{Queckenstedt's Test}

A lumbar manometric test (Queckenstedt's test) may be performed by compressing the jugular veins on each side of the neck during the lumbar puncture. The increase in pressure caused by the compression is noted; then the pressure is released and pressure readings are made at 10 -second intervals. Normally, CSF pressure rises rapidly in response to compression of the jugular veins and returns quickly to normal when the compression is released. A slow rise and fall in pressure indicates a partial block due to a lesion compressing the spinal subarachnoid pathways. If there is no pressure change, a complete block is indicated. This test is not performed if an intracranial lesion is suspected.

See Chart 60-4 for nursing guidelines for assisting with a lumbar puncture.

\section*{Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis}

The CSF should be clear and colorless. Pink, blood-tinged, or grossly bloody CSF may indicate a cerebral contusion, laceration, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Sometimes with a difficult lumbar puncture, the CSF initially is bloody because of local trauma but then becomes clearer.

Usually, specimens are obtained for cell count, culture, and glucose and protein testing. The specimens should be sent to the laboratory immediately because changes will take place and alter
the result if the specimens are allowed to stand. (See Appendix B for the normal values of CSF.)

\section*{Post-Lumbar Puncture Headache}

A post-lumbar puncture headache, ranging from mild to severe, may appear a few hours to several days after the procedure. This is the most common complication, occurring in $15 \%$ to $30 \%$ of patients (Connolly, 1999). It is a throbbing bifrontal or occipital headache, dull and deep in character. It is particularly severe on sitting or standing but lessens or disappears when the patient lies down.

The headache is caused by CSF leakage at the puncture site. The fluid continues to escape into the tissues by way of the needle track from the spinal canal. It is then absorbed promptly by the lymphatics. As a result of this leak, the supply of CSF in the cranium is depleted to a point at which it is insufficient to maintain proper mechanical stabilization of the brain. This leakage of CSF allows settling of the brain when the patient assumes an upright position, producing tension and stretching the venous sinuses and pain-sensitive structures. Both traction and pain are lessened and the leakage is reduced when the patient lies down.

Post-lumbar puncture headache may be avoided if a smallgauge needle is used and if the patient remains prone after the procedure. When a large volume of fluid (more than 20 mL ) is removed, the patient is positioned prone for 2 hours, then flat in a side-lying position for 2 to 3 hours, and then supine or prone for 6 more hours. Keeping the patient flat overnight may reduce the incidence of headaches.

The postpuncture headache is usually managed by bed rest, analgesic agents, and hydration (Connolly, 1999). Occasionally, if the headache persists, the epidural blood patch technique may be used. Blood is withdrawn from the antecubital vein and injected into the epidural space, usually at the site of the previous spinal puncture. The rationale is that the blood acts as a gelatinous plug to seal the hole in the dura, preventing further loss of CSF.

\section*{Other Complications of Lumbar Puncture}

Herniation of the intracranial contents, spinal epidural abscess, spinal epidural hematoma, and meningitis are rare but serious complications of lumbar puncture. Other complications include temporary voiding problems, slight elevation of temperature, backache or spasms, and stiffness of the neck.

\section*{HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Many diagnostic tests that were once performed as part of a hospital stay are now carried out in short-procedure units or outpatient testing settings or units. As a result, family members often provide the postprocedure care. Therefore, the patient and family must receive clear verbal and written instructions about precautions to take after the procedure, complications to watch for, and steps to take if complications occur. Because many patients undergoing neurologic diagnostic studies are elderly or have neurologic deficits, provisions must be made to ensure that transportation and postprocedure care and monitoring are available.

\section*{Guidelines for Assisting with a Lumbar Puncture}

A needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space through the third and fourth or fourth and fifth lumbar interface to withdraw spinal fluid.

\section*{Preprocedure}
1. Determine whether written consent for the procedure has been obtained.
2. Explain the procedure to the patient and describe sensations that are likely during the procedure (ie, a sensation of cold as the site is cleansed with solution, a needle prick when local anesthetic is injected).
3. Determine whether the patient has any questions or misconceptions about the procedure; reassure the patient that the needle will not enter the spinal cord or cause paralysis.
4. Instruct the patient to void before the procedure.

\section*{Procedure (performed by the physician)}
1. The patient is positioned on one side at the edge of the bed or examining table with back toward the physician; the thighs and legs are flexed as much as possible to increase the space between the spinous processes of the vertebrae, for easier entry into the subarachnoid space.

2. A small pillow may be placed under the patient's head to maintain the spine in a horizontal position; a pillow may be placed between the legs to prevent the upper leg from rolling forward.
3. The nurse assists the patient to maintain the position to avoid sudden movement, which can produce a traumatic (bloody) tap.
4. The patient is encouraged to relax and is instructed to breathe normally, because hyperventilation may lower an elevated pressure.
5. The nurse describes the procedure step by step to the patient as it proceeds.
6. The physician cleanses the puncture site with an antiseptic solution and drapes the site.
7. Local anesthetic is injected to numb the puncture site, and then a spinal needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space through the third and fourth or fourth and fifth lumbar interspace.
8. A specimen of CSF is removed and usually collected in three test tubes, labeled in order of collection. A pressure reading may be obtained. The needle is withdrawn.
9. A small dressing is applied to the puncture site.
10. The tubes of CSF are sent to the laboratory immediately.

\section*{Postprocedure}
1. Instruct the patient to lie prone for 2 to 3 hours to separate the alignment of the dural and arachnoid needle punctures in the meninges, to reduce leakage of CSF.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-344.jpg?height=674&width=637&top_left_y=1116&top_left_x=1225)
2. Monitor the patient for complications of lumbar puncture; notify physician if complications occur.
3. Encourage increased fluid intake to reduce the risk of postprocedure headache.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Contacting the patient and family after diagnostic testing enables the nurse to determine whether they have any questions about the procedure or whether the patient had any untoward results. During these phone calls, teaching is reinforced and the patient and family are reminded to make and keep follow-up appointments. Patients, family members, and health care providers are focused on the immediate needs, issues, or deficits that necessitated the diagnostic testing. This is also a good time to remind them of the need for and importance of continuing health promotion and screening practices and make referrals to appropriate health care providers.

\section*{(1) critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 68-year old patient with a long history of type 1 diabetes is admitted to the hospital to rule out an ischemic stroke and is scheduled for an MRI. Explain why the MRI is indicated for this patient and what, if any, precautions must be taken because this patient is diabetic. What nursing observations and assessments are indicated because of the occurrence of these two disorders? What safety precautions are essential in the MRI suite, and why?
2. Your clinic patient will be having an EEG. Describe the procedure, its duration, and preparation for this test, including medication/diet restrictions, if any. How would the presence of a seizure disorder alter your plan of care?
3. Your patient is scheduled to undergo digital subtraction angiography (DSA). He tells you that he recently had an angiogram. What explanation can you give to the patient and his wife regarding the difference between the two procedures? What additional information will help prepare the patient to undergo this procedure?

\section*{Management of Patients With Neurologic Dysfunction}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the special nursing needs of patients with varied neurologic dysfunction.
2. Describe the multiple needs of the patient with altered level of consciousness.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with altered level of consciousness.
4. Identify the early and late clinical manifestations of increased intracranial pressure.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with increased intracranial pressure.
6. Describe the needs of the patient undergoing intracranial or transsphenoidal surgery.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient undergoing intracranial/transsphenoidal surgery.
8. Identify the various types and causes of seizures.
9. Use the nursing process to develop a plan of care for the patient experiencing seizures.
10. Identify the needs of the patient experiencing headaches.

$T_{h}$his chapter discusses care of the patient with an altered level of consciousness, the patient with increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and the patient undergoing neurosurgical procedures, experiencing seizures, or experiencing headaches. Some of the topics in this chapter, such as headaches and seizures, may be symptoms of dysfunction in another body system. Conversely, headaches and seizures can be quite serious symptoms of a severe disruption of the neurologic system. These disorders can also be diagnosed at times as "idiopathic," or without an identifiable cause. The commonality in these disorders is not in the diagnosis or the medical treatment; it is in the behaviors and needs of the patient and the manner in which nurses can best support the patient through these episodes.

The central nervous system contains a vast network of neurons controlling the body's vital functions. Yet this system is vulnerable, and its optimal function depends on several key factors. First, the neurologic system relies on its own structural integrity for support and homeostasis. Examples of structural disruption include head injury, brain tumor, intracranial hemorrhage, infection, and stroke. As brain tissue expands in the inflexible cranium, ICP rises and cerebral perfusion is impaired. Further expansion places pressure on vital centers, which can cause permanent neurologic deficits or lead to brain death.

Second, the neurologic system also relies on the body's ability to maintain a homeostatic environment. It requires the body to deliver the essential elements of oxygen and glucose and to filter out substrates toxic to the neurons. Sepsis, hypovolemia, myocardial infarction, respiratory arrest, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, drug and/or alcohol overdose, encephalopathy, and ketoacidosis are all examples of circumstances in which the neurologic system is depressed due to a toxic metabolic effect or due to the body's mechanical inability to provide essential substrates.

Some conditions can be treated and neurologic impairments can be reversed; others result in permanent deficits.

Although neuroscience nursing is a specialty requiring an understanding of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurodiagnostic testing, critical care nursing, and rehabilitation nursing, nurses in all settings care for patients with neurologic disorders. Ongoing assessment of the patient's neurologic function and health needs, identification of problems, mutual goal setting, development and implementation of care plans (including teaching, counseling, and coordinating activities), and evaluation of the outcomes of care are nursing actions integral to the recovery of the patient. The nurse also collaborates with other members of the health care team to provide essential care, offer a variety of solutions to problems, help patients and families gain control of their lives, and explore the educational and supportive resources available in the community. The goals are to achieve as high a level of function as possible and to enhance the quality of life for the patient with neurologic impairment and his or her family.

\section*{Altered Level of Consciousness}

An altered level of consciousness (LOC) is apparent in the patient who is not oriented, does not follow commands, or needs persistent stimuli to achieve a state of alertness. LOC is gauged on a continuum with a normal state of alertness and full cognition (consciousness) on one end and coma on the other end. Coma is a clinical state of unconsciousness in which the patient is unaware of self or the environment for prolonged periods (days to months or even years). Akinetic mutism is a state of unresponsiveness to the environment in which the patient makes no movement or sound but sometimes opens the eyes. Persistent vegetative state is a condition in which the patient is described as wakeful but de-
akinetic mutism: unresponsiveness to the environment; the patient makes no movement or sound but sometimes opens the eyes
altered level of consciousness: condition of being less responsive to and aware of environmental stimuli
autoregulation: ability of cerebral blood vessels to dilate or constrict to maintain stable cerebral blood flow despite changes in systemic arterial blood pressure
brain death: irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem coma: prolonged state of unconsciousness craniotomy: a surgical procedure that involves entry into the cranial vault craniectomy: a surgical procedure that involves removing a portion of the skull
Cushing's response: brain's attempt to restore blood flow by increasing arterial pressure to overcome the increased intracranial pressure
Cushing's triad: three classic signsbradycardia, hypertension, and bradypnea - seen with pressure on the medulla as a result of brain stem herniation
decerebration: an abnormal body posture associated with a severe brain injury, char-
acterized by extreme extension of the upper and lower extremities
decortication: an abnormal posture associated with severe brain injury, characterized by abnormal flexion of the upper extremities and extension of the lower extremities
epidural monitor: a sensor placed between the skull and the dura to monitor intracranial pressure
epilepsy: a group of syndromes characterized by paroxysmal transient disturbances of brain function.
fiberoptic monitor: a system that uses light refraction to determine intracranial pressure
herniation: abnormal protrusion of tissue through a defect or natural opening
intracranial pressure: pressure exerted by the volume of the intracranial contents within the cranial vault
migraine headache: a severe, unrelenting headache often accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances
Monro-Kellie hypothesis: theory that states that due to limited space for expansion within the skull, an increase in any one of
the cranial contents-brain tissue, blood, or CSF-causes a change in the volume of the others
persistent vegetative state: condition in which the patient is wakeful but devoid of conscious content, without cognitive or affective mental function
primary headache: a headache for which no specific organic cause can be found
seizures: paroxysmal transient disturbance of the brain resulting from a discharge of abnormal electrical activity
status epilepticus: episode in which the patient experiences multiple seizure bursts with no recovery time in between
secondary headache: headache identified as a symptom of another organic disorder (eg, brain tumor, hypertension)
subarachnoid screw or bolt: device placed into the subarachnoid space to measure intracranial pressure
transsphenoidal: surgical approach to the pituitary via the sphenoid sinuses
ventriculostomy: a catheter placed in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain to measure intracranial pressure and allow for drainage of fluid
void of conscious content, without cognitive or affective mental function. The level of responsiveness and consciousness is the most important indicator of the patient's condition.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Altered LOC is not a disorder itself; rather, it is a function and symptom of multiple pathophysiologic phenomena. The cause may be neurologic (head injury, stroke), toxicologic (drug overdose, alcohol intoxication), or metabolic (hepatic or renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis).

The underlying causes of neurologic dysfunction are disruption in the cells of the nervous system, neurotransmitters, or brain anatomy (see Chap. 60).

A disruption in the basic functional units (neurons) or neurotransmitters results in faulty impulse transmission, impeding communication within the brain or from the brain to other parts of the body. These disruptions are caused by cellular edema and other mechanisms such as antibodies disrupting chemical transmission at receptor sites.

Intact anatomic structures of the brain are needed for proper function. The two hemispheres of the cerebrum must communicate, via an intact corpus callosum, and the lobes of the brain (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital) must communicate and coordinate their specific functions (see Chap. 60). Additional anatomic structures of importance are the cerebellum and the brain stem. The cerebellum has both excitatory and inhibitory actions and is largely responsible for coordination of movement. The brain stem contains areas that control the heart, respiration, and blood pressure. Disruptions in the anatomic structures are caused by trauma, edema, pressure from tumors as well as other mechanisms such as an increase or decrease in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Alterations in LOC occur along a continuum, and the clinical manifestations depend on where the patient is along this continuum. As the patient's state of alertness and consciousness decreases, there will be changes in the pupillary response, eye opening response, verbal response, and motor response. Initial changes may be reflected by subtle behavioral changes such as restlessness or increased anxiety. The pupils, normally round and quickly reactive to light, become sluggish (response is slower); as the patient becomes comatose, the pupils become fixed (no response to light). The patient in a coma does not open the eyes, respond verbally, or move the extremities in response to a request to do so.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient with an altered LOC is at risk for alterations in every body system. A complete assessment is performed, with particular attention to the neurologic system. The neurologic examination should be as complete as the LOC allows. It includes an evaluation of mental status, cranial nerve function, cerebellar function (balance and coordination), reflexes, and motor and sensory function. LOC, a sensitive indicator of neurologic function, is assessed based on the criteria in the Glasgow Coma Scale: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response (Bateman, 2001). The patient's responses are rated on a scale from 3 to 15 . A score of 3 indicates severe impairment of neurologic function; a score of 15 indicates that the patient is fully responsive (see Chap. 63 for more discussion about the Glasgow Coma Scale).

If the patient is comatose, with localized signs such as abnormal pupillary and motor responses, it is assumed that neurologic disease is present until proven otherwise. If the patient is comatose and pupillary light reflexes are preserved, a toxic or metabolic disorder is suspected.

Procedures used to identify the cause of unconsciousness include scanning, imaging, tomography (eg, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography), and electroencephalography. Laboratory tests include analysis of blood glucose, electrolytes, serum ammonia, and blood urea nitrogen levels, as well as serum osmolality, calcium level, and partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times. Other studies may be used to evaluate serum ketones and alcohol, drug levels, and arterial blood gas levels.

\section*{Complications}

Potential complications for the patient with altered LOC include respiratory failure, pneumonia, pressure ulcers, and aspiration. Respiratory failure may develop shortly after the patient becomes unconscious. If the patient cannot maintain effective respirations, supportive care is initiated to provide adequate ventilation. Pneumonia is common in patients receiving mechanical ventilation or in those who cannot maintain and clear the airway. The patient with altered LOC is subject to all the complications associated with immobility, such as pressure ulcers, venous stasis, musculoskeletal deterioration, and disturbed gastrointestinal functioning. Pressure ulcers may become infected and act as a source of sepsis. Aspiration of gastric contents or feedings may occur, precipitating the development of pneumonia or airway occlusion.

\section*{Medical Management}

The first priority of treatment for the patient with altered LOC is to obtain and maintain a patent airway. The patient may be orally or nasally intubated, or a tracheostomy may be performed. Until the patient's ability to breathe on his or her own is determined, a mechanical ventilator is used to maintain adequate oxygenation. The circulatory status (blood pressure, heart rate) is monitored to ensure adequate perfusion to the body and brain. An intravenous catheter is inserted to provide access for fluids and intravenous medications. Neurologic care focuses on the specific neurologic pathology, if any. Nutritional support, using either a feeding tube or a gastrostomy tube, is initiated as soon as possible. In addition to measures to determine and treat the underlying causes of altered LOC, other medical interventions are aimed at pharmacologic management of complications and strategies to prevent complications.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: \\ THE PATIENT WITH AN ALTERED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS}

\section*{Assessment}

Where to begin assessing the patient with an altered LOC depends somewhat on each patient's circumstances, but clinicians often start by assessing the verbal response. Determining the patient's orientation to time, person, and place assesses verbal response. The patient is asked to identify the day, date, or season of the year and to identify where he or she is or to identify the clinicians, family members, or visitors present. Other questions such as, "Who is the president?" or "What is the next holiday?"
are also helpful in determining the patient's processing of information in the environment. (Verbal response cannot be evaluated when the patient is intubated or has a tracheostomy, and this should be clearly documented.)

Alertness is measured by the patient's ability to open the eyes spontaneously or to a stimulus. Patients with severe neurologic dysfunction cannot do this. The nurse should assess for periorbital edema or trauma, which may prevent the patient from opening the eyes, and document if this interferes with eye opening.

Motor response includes spontaneous, purposeful movement (eg, the awake patient can move all four extremities with equal strength), movement only in response to noxious stimuli (eg, pressure/pain), or abnormal posturing (Bateman, 2001). If the patient is not responding to commands, the motor response is tested by applying a painful stimulus (firm but gentle pressure) to the nailbed or by squeezing a muscle. If the patient attempts to push away or withdraw, the response is recorded as purposeful or appropriate ("patient withdraws to painful stimuli"). This response is considered purposeful if the patient can cross from one side of the body to the other in response to noxious stimuli. An inappropriate or nonpurposeful response is random and aimless. Posturing may be decorticate or decerebrate (Fig. 61-1; see Chap. 60). The most severe neurologic impairment results in flaccidity. Occasionally, posturing cannot be elicited if the patient has been given pharmacologic paralyzing agents.

In addition to LOC, the nurse monitors parameters such as respiratory status, eye signs, and reflexes on an ongoing basis. Table 61-1 summarizes the assessment and the clinical significance of the findings. Body functions (circulation, respiration, elimination, fluid and electrolyte balance) are examined in a systematic and ongoing manner.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective airway clearance related to altered level of consciousness
- Risk of injury related to decreased level of consciousness
- Deficient fluid volume related to inability to take in fluids by mouth
- Impaired oral mucous membranes related to mouthbreathing, absence of pharyngeal reflex, and altered fluid intake
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility
- Impaired tissue integrity of cornea related to diminished or absent corneal reflex
- Ineffective thermoregulation related to damage to hypothalamic center
- Impaired urinary elimination (incontinence or retention) related to impairment in neurologic sensing and control
- Bowel incontinence related to impairment in neurologic sensing and control and also related to transitions in nutritional delivery methods
- Disturbed sensory perception related to neurologic impairment
- Interrupted family processes related to health crisis

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Respiratory distress or failure
- Pneumonia
- Aspiration
- Pressure ulcer
- Deep vein thrombosis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals of care for the patient with altered LOC include maintenance of a clear airway, protection from injury, attainment of fluid volume balance, achievement of intact oral mucous membranes, maintenance of normal skin integrity, absence of corneal irritation, attainment of effective thermoregulation, and effective urinary elimination. Additional goals include bowel continence, accurate perception of environmental stimuli, maintenance of intact family or support system, and absence of complications (Jacobson \& Winslow, 2000).

Because the unconscious patient's protective reflexes are impaired, the quality of nursing care provided literally may mean the difference between life and death. The nurse must assume responsibility for the patient until the basic reflexes (coughing, blinking, and swallowing) return and the patient becomes conscious and oriented. Thus, the major nursing goal is to compensate for the absence of these protective reflexes.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING THE AIRWAY}

The most important consideration in managing the patient with altered LOC is to establish an adequate airway and ensure ventilation. Obstruction of the airway is a risk because the epiglottis and tongue may relax, occluding the oropharynx, or the patient may aspirate vomitus or nasopharyngeal secretions.

The accumulation of secretions in the pharynx presents a serious problem. Because the patient cannot swallow and lacks pharyngeal reflexes, these secretions must be removed to eliminate the danger of aspiration. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees helps prevent aspiration. Positioning the patient in a lateral or semiprone position will also help as it permits the jaw and tongue to fall forward, thus promoting drainage of secretions.

Positioning alone is not always adequate, however. The patient may require suctioning and oral hygiene. Suctioning is performed to remove secretions from the posterior pharynx and upper trachea. With the suction off, a whistle-tip catheter is lubricated with a water-soluble lubricant and inserted to the level of the posterior pharynx and upper trachea. Continuous suction is applied as the catheter is withdrawn using a twisting motion of the thumb and forefinger. This twisting maneuver prevents the suctioning end of the catheter from causing irritation, which increases secretions and causes mucosal trauma and bleeding. Before and after suctioning, the patient is hyperoxygenated and hyperventilated to prevent hypoxia (Hickey, 2003). In addition to these interventions, chest physiotherapy and postural drainage may be initiated to promote pulmonary hygiene, unless contraindicated by the patient's underlying condition. Also, the chest should be auscultated at least every 8 hours to detect adventitious breath sounds or absence of breath sounds.

Despite these measures, or because of the severity of impairment, the patient with altered LOC often requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. Nursing actions for the mechanically ventilated patient include maintaining the patency of the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, providing frequent oral care, monitoring arterial blood gas measurements, and maintaining ventilator settings (see Chap. 25).

\section*{PROTECTING THE PATIENT}

For the protection of the patient, padded siderails are provided and raised at all times. Care should be taken to prevent injury from invasive lines and equipment, and other potential sources of injury should be identified (eg, restraints, tight dressings, environmental irritants, damp bedding or dressings, tubes and drains).

> NURSING ALERT If the patient begins to emerge from unconsciousness, every measure that is available and appropriate for calming and quieting him or her should be used. Any form of restraint is likely to be countered by the patient with resistance, leading to self-injury or to a dangerous increase in ICP. Therefore, physical restraints should be avoided if possible; a written prescription must be obtained if their use is essential for the patient's well-being.

Protection also encompasses the concept of protecting the patient's dignity during altered LOC. Simple measures such as providing privacy and speaking to the patient during nursing care activities preserve the patient's humanity. Not speaking negatively about the patient's condition or prognosis is also important, because patients in a light coma may be able to hear. The comatose patient has an increased need for advocacy, and it is the
nurse's responsibility to see that these advocacy needs are met (Elliott \& Wright, 1999; Villanueva, 1999).

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID BALANCE AND MANAGING NUTRITIONAL NEEDS}

Hydration status is assessed by examining tissue turgor and mucous membranes, assessing intake and output trends, and analyzing laboratory data. Fluid needs are met initially by giving the required fluids intravenously. However, intravenous solutions (and blood transfusions) for patients with intracranial conditions must be administered slowly. If given too rapidly, they may increase ICP. The quantity of fluids administered may be restricted to minimize the possibility of producing cerebral edema.

If the patient does not recover quickly and sufficiently enough to take adequate fluids and calories by mouth, a feeding tube will be inserted for the administration of fluids and enteral feedings (Day, Stotts, Frankfurt et al., 2001).

\section*{PROVIDING MOUTH CARE}

The mouth is inspected for dryness, inflammation, and crusting. The unconscious patient requires conscientious oral care because there is a risk of parotitis if the mouth is not kept scrupulously clean. The mouth is cleansed and rinsed carefully to remove secretions and crusts and to keep the mucous membranes moist. A thin coating of petrolatum on the lips prevents drying, cracking, and encrustations. If the patient has an endotracheal tube, the tube should be moved to the opposite side of the mouth daily to prevent ulceration of the mouth and lips.

\section*{MAINTAINING SKIN AND JOINT INTEGRITY}

Preventing skin breakdown requires continuing nursing assessment and intervention. Special attention is given to unconscious patients because they cannot respond to external stimuli. Assessment includes a regular schedule of turning to avoid pressure, which can cause breakdown and necrosis of the skin. Turning also provides kinesthetic (sensation of movement), proprioceptive (awareness of position), and vestibular (equilibrium) stimulation. After turning, the patient is carefully repositioned to prevent ischemic necrosis over pressure areas. Dragging the patient up in bed must be avoided, because this creates a shearing force and friction on the skin surface.

Maintaining correct body position is important; equally important is passive exercise of the extremities to prevent contractures. The use of splints or foam boots aids in the prevention of footdrop and eliminates the pressure of bedding on the toes. Trochanter rolls supporting the hip joints keep the legs in proper alignment. The arms should be in abduction, the fingers lightly flexed, and the hands in slight supination. The heels of the feet should be assessed for pressure areas. Specialty beds, such as fluidized or low-air-loss beds, may be used to decrease pressure on bony prominences.

\section*{PRESERVING CORNEAL INTEGRITY}

Some unconscious patients have their eyes open and have inadequate or absent corneal reflexes. The cornea is likely to become irritated or scratched, leading to keratitis and corneal ulcers. The eyes may be cleansed with cotton balls moistened with sterile normal saline to remove debris and discharge. If artificial tears are prescribed, they may be instilled every 2 hours. Periocular edema (swelling around the eyes) often occurs after cranial surgery. Cold compresses may be prescribed, and care must be exerted to avoid contact with the cornea. Eye patches should be used cautiously
because of the potential for corneal abrasion from the cornea coming in contact with the patch.

\section*{ACHIEVING THERMOREGULATION}

High fever in the unconscious patient may be caused by infection of the respiratory or urinary tract, drug reactions, or damage to the hypothalamic temperature-regulating center. A slight elevation of temperature may be caused by dehydration. The environment can be adjusted, depending on the patient's condition, to promote a normal body temperature. If body temperature is elevated, a minimum amount of bedding-a sheet or perhaps only a small drape-is used. The room may be cooled to $18.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $65^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ). However, if the patient is elderly and does not have an elevated temperature, a warmer environment is needed.

> NURSING ALERT The body temperature of an unconscious patient is never taken by mouth. Rectal or tympanic (if not contraindicated) temperature measurement is preferred to the less accurate axillary temperature.

Because of damage to the heat-regulating center in the brain or severe intracranial infection, unconscious patients often develop very high temperatures. Such temperature elevations must be controlled because the increased metabolic demands of the brain can overburden cerebral circulation and oxygenation, resulting in cerebral deterioration (Hickey, 2003). Persistent hyperthermia with no identified clinical source of infection indicates brain stem damage and a poor prognosis.

Strategies for reducing fever include:
- Removing all bedding over the patient (with the possible exception of a light sheet or small drape)
- Administering repeated doses of acetaminophen as prescribed
- Giving a cool sponge bath and allowing an electric fan to blow over the patient to increase surface cooling
- Using a hypothermia blanket

Frequent temperature monitoring is indicated to assess the response to the therapy and to prevent an excessive decrease in temperature and shivering.

\section*{PREVENTING URINARY RETENTION}

The patient with an altered LOC is often incontinent or has urinary retention. The bladder is palpated or scanned at intervals to determine whether urinary retention is present, because a full bladder may be an overlooked cause of overflow incontinence. A portable bladder ultrasound instrument is a useful tool in bladder management and retraining programs (O'Farrell, Vandervoort, Bisnaire et al., 2001).

If there are signs of urinary retention, initially an indwelling urinary catheter attached to a closed drainage system is inserted. A catheter may be inserted during the acute phase of illness to monitor urinary output. Because catheters are a major factor in causing urinary tract infection, the patient is observed for fever and cloudy urine. The area around the urethral orifice is inspected for drainage. The urinary catheter is usually removed when the patient has a stable cardiovascular system and if no diuresis, sepsis, or voiding dysfunction existed before the onset of coma. Although many unconscious patients urinate spontaneously after catheter removal, the bladder should be palpated or scanned with a portable ultrasound device periodically for urinary retention (O'Farrell et al., 2001). An intermittent catheterization
program may be initiated to ensure complete emptying of the bladder at intervals, if indicated.

An external catheter (condom catheter) for the male patient and absorbent pads for the female patient can be used for the unconscious patient who can urinate spontaneously although involuntarily. As soon as consciousness is regained, a bladder-training program is initiated. The incontinent patient is monitored frequently for skin irritation and skin breakdown. Appropriate skin care is implemented to prevent these complications.

\section*{PROMOTING BOWEL FUNCTION}

The abdomen is assessed for distention by listening for bowel sounds and measuring the girth of the abdomen with a tape measure. There is a risk of diarrhea from infection, antibiotics, and hyperosmolar fluids. Frequent loose stools may also occur with fecal impaction. Commercial fecal collection bags are available for patients with fecal incontinence.

Immobility and lack of dietary fiber may cause constipation. The nurse monitors the number and consistency of bowel movements and performs a rectal examination for signs of fecal impaction. Stool softeners may be prescribed and can be administered with tube feedings. To facilitate bowel emptying, a glycerine suppository may be indicated. The patient may require an enema every other day to empty the lower colon.

\section*{PROVIDING SENSORY STIMULATION}

Sensory stimulation is provided at the appropriate time to help overcome the profound sensory deprivation of the unconscious patient. Efforts are made to maintain the sense of daily rhythm by keeping the usual day and night patterns for activity and sleep. The nurse touches and talks to the patient and encourages family members and friends to do so. Communication is extremely important and includes touching the patient and spending enough time with him or her to become sensitive to his or her needs. It is also important to avoid making any negative comments about the patient's status or prognosis in the patient's presence.

The nurse orients the patient to time and place at least once every 8 hours. Sounds from the patient's home and workplace may be introduced using a tape recorder. Family members can read to the patient from a favorite book and may suggest radio and television programs that the patient previously enjoyed as a means of enriching the environment and providing familiar input (Hickey, 2003).

When arousing from coma, many patients experience a period of agitation, indicating that they are becoming more aware of their surroundings but still cannot react or communicate in an appropriate fashion. Although disturbing for many family members, this is actually a good clinical sign. At this time, it is necessary to minimize the stimulation to the patient by limiting background noises, having only one person speak to the patient at a time, giving the patient a longer period of time to respond, and allowing for frequent rest or quiet times.

When the patient has regained consciousness, videotaped family or social events may assist the patient in recognizing family and friends and allow him or her to experience missed events.

\section*{MEETING FAMILIES' NEEDS}

The family of the patient with altered LOC may be thrown into a sudden state of crisis and go through the process of severe anxiety, denial, anger, remorse, grief, and reconciliation. Depending on the disorder that caused the altered LOC and the extent of the patient's recovery, the family may be unprepared for the changes in the cognitive and physical status of their loved one. If the
patient has significant residual deficits, the family may require considerable time, assistance, and support to come to terms with these changes. To help family members mobilize their adaptive capacities, the nurse can reinforce and clarify information about the patient's condition, permit the family to be involved in care, and listen to and encourage ventilation of feelings and concerns while supporting them in their decision-making process about posthospitalization management and placement (Hauber \& Testani-Dufour, 2000). Families may benefit from participation in support groups offered through the hospital, rehabilitation facility, or community organizations.

In some circumstances, the family may need to face the death of their loved one. The neurologic patient is often pronounced brain dead before physiologic death occurs. The term brain death describes irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. The term may be misleading to the family because although brain function has ceased, the patient appears to be alive, with the heart rate and blood pressure sustained by vasoactive medications, and breathing continues by mechanical ventilation. When discussing a patient who is brain dead with family members, it is important to use the term "dead"; the term "brain dead" may confuse them (Shewmon, 1998). Chart 61-1 discusses ethical issues related to patients with severe neurologic damage. End-of-life care is discussed in Chapter 17.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Pneumonia, aspiration, and respiratory failure are potential complications in any patient who has a depressed LOC and who cannot protect the airway or turn, cough, and take deep breaths. The longer the period of unconsciousness, the greater the risk for pulmonary complications.

Vital signs and respiratory function are monitored closely to detect any signs of respiratory failure or distress. Total blood

\section*{Chart 61-1 - Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{What Ethical Principles Apply When Treatment Is Withdrawn From the Patient in a Persistent Vegetative State?}

\section*{Situation}

The family of a 55-year-old woman who has been diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state wants to withdraw tube feedings and let her die. The nursing staff express concern about removing the feeding tube, relating that the patient has wakeful periods and sometimes seems to move her eyes toward them when they care for her. The family's wishes, however, are honored and the medical team discontinues all tube feedings and intravenous lines and orders comfort measures only. The patient dies 7 days later.

\section*{Dilemma}

How do nurses reconcile their ethical obligations of respect for persons and sanctity of life in the face of a decision to withdraw treatment? Is the ethical principle of justice upheld?

\section*{Discussion}

Is the maintenance of medical treatment obligatory in patients in a persistent vegetative state to provide respect for the patient and the sanctity of life? What mechanisms can the nursing staff use to assist them in resolving these dilemmas?
count and arterial blood gas measurements are assessed to determine whether there are adequate red blood cells to carry oxygen and whether ventilation is effective. Chest physiotherapy and suctioning are initiated to prevent respiratory complications such as pneumonia. If pneumonia develops, cultures are obtained to identify the organism so that appropriate antibiotics can be administered.

The patient with altered LOC is monitored closely for evidence of impaired skin integrity, and strategies to prevent skin breakdown and pressure ulcers are continued through all phases of care, including hospital, rehabilitation, and home care. Factors that contribute to impaired skin integrity (eg, incontinence, inadequate dietary intake, pressure on bony prominences, edema) are addressed. If pressure ulcers develop, strategies to promote healing are undertaken. Care is taken to prevent bacterial contamination of pressure ulcers, which may lead to sepsis and septic shock. Assessment and management of pressure ulcers are discussed in Chapter 11.

The patient should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Patients who develop deep vein thrombosis are at risk for pulmonary embolism. Prophylaxis such as subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (Fragmin, Orgaran) should be prescribed (Karch, 2002). Thigh-high elastic compression stockings or pneumatic compression stockings should also be prescribed to reduce the risk for clot formation. Measures to assess for deep vein thrombosis, such as Homans' sign, may be clinically unreliable in this population, and the nurse should observe for redness and swelling in the lower extremities.

\section*{Increased Intracranial Pressure}

The rigid cranial vault contains brain tissue ( $1,400 \mathrm{~g}$ ), blood $(75 \mathrm{~mL})$, and CSF ( 75 mL ) (Hickey, 2003). The volume and pressure of these three components are usually in a state of equi-
librium and produce the ICP. ICP is usually measured in the lateral ventricles; normal ICP is 10 to 20 mm Hg (Hickey, 2003).

The Monro-Kellie hypothesis states that because of the limited space for expansion within the skull, an increase in any one of the components causes a change in the volume of the others. Because brain tissue has limited space to change, compensation typically is accomplished by displacing or shifting CSF, increasing the absorption of CSF, or decreasing cerebral blood volume. Without such changes, ICP will begin to rise. Under normal circumstances, minor changes in blood volume and CSF volume occur constantly due to alterations in intrathoracic pressure (coughing, sneezing, straining), posture, blood pressure, and systemic oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Increased ICP is a syndrome that affects many patients with acute neurologic conditions. This is because pathologic conditions alter the relationship between intracranial volume and pressure. Although an elevated ICP is most commonly associated with head injury, it also may be seen as a secondary effect in other conditions, such as brain tumors, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and toxic and viral encephalopathies. Increased ICP from any cause decreases cerebral perfusion, stimulates further swelling (edema), and shifts brain tissue through openings in the rigid dura, resulting in herniation, a dire, frequently fatal event.

\section*{DECREASED CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW}

Increased ICP may significantly reduce cerebral blood flow, resulting in ischemia and cell death. In the early stages of cerebral ischemia, the vasomotor centers are stimulated and the systemic pressure rises to maintain cerebral blood flow. Usually a slow bounding pulse and respiratory irregularities accompany this. These changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration are important clinically because they suggest increased ICP.

The concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood and in the brain tissue also has a role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow. A rise in carbon dioxide partial pressure ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ) causes cerebral vasodilatation, leading to increased cerebral blood flow and increased ICP; a fall in $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ has a vasoconstrictive effect (Young, Ropper \& Bolton, 1998). Decreased venous outflow may also increase cerebral blood volume, thus raising ICP.

\section*{CEREBRAL EDEMA}

Cerebral edema or swelling is defined as an abnormal accumulation of water or fluid in the intracellular space, extracellular space,
or both, associated with an increase in brain tissue volume. Edema can occur in the gray, white, or interstitial matter. As brain tissue swells within the rigid skull, several mechanisms attempt to compensate for the increasing ICP. These mechanisms include autoregulation and decreasing the production and flow of CSF. Autoregulation refers to the brain's ability to change the diameter of its blood vessels automatically to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow during alterations in systemic blood pressure.

\section*{CEREBRAL RESPONSE TO INCREASED ICP}

As ICP rises, compensatory mechanisms in the brain work to maintain blood flow and prevent tissue damage. The brain can maintain a steady perfusion pressure when the arterial systolic blood pressure is 50 to 150 mm Hg and ICP is less than 40 mm Hg. The cerebral perfusion pressure is calculated by subtracting the ICP from the mean arterial pressure. For example, if the mean arterial pressure is 100 and the ICP is 15, then the cerebral perfusion pressure is 85 mm Hg . The normal cerebral perfusion pressure is 70 to 100 mm Hg (Hickey, 2003; Young et al., 1998). As ICP rises, however, and the autoregulatory mechanism of the brain is overwhelmed, cerebral perfusion pressure can rise to greater than 100 mm Hg or fall to less than 50 mm Hg . Patients with a cerebral perfusion pressure less than 50 mm Hg experience irreversible neurologic damage. If ICP equals mean arterial pressure, cerebral circulation ceases (Porth, 2002).

A clinical phenomenon known as the Cushing's response (or Cushing's reflex) is seen when cerebral blood flow decreases significantly. When ischemic, the vasomotor center triggers a rise in arterial pressure in an effort to overcome the increased ICP. A sympathetically mediated response causes a rise in the systolic blood pressure with a widening of the pulse pressure and cardiac slowing. This response, which is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, is seen clinically as a rise in systolic blood pressure, widening of the pulse pressure, and reflex slowing of the heart rate. This is a sign requiring immediate intervention; however, perfusion may be recoverable if treated rapidly.

At a certain volume or pressure, the brain's ability to autoregulate becomes ineffective and decompensation (ischemia and infarction) begins (Young et al., 1998). When this occurs, the patient exhibits significant changes in mental status and vital signs. The bradycardia, hypertension, and bradypnea associated with this deterioration are known as Cushing's triad, a grave sign. At this point, herniation of the brain stem and occlusion of the cerebral blood flow occur if therapeutic intervention is not initiated. Herniation refers to the shifting of brain tissue from an area of high pressure to an area of lower pressure (Fig. 61-2). The herniated

\end{figure}
tissue exerts pressure on the brain area to which it has herniated or shifted, interfering with the blood supply in that area. Cessation of cerebral blood flow results in cerebral ischemia and infarction and brain death.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

When ICP increases to the point at which the brain's ability to adjust has reached its limits, neural function is impaired; this may be manifested by clinical changes first in LOC and later by abnormal respiratory and vasomotor responses.

NURSING ALERT The earliest sign of increasing ICP is a change in LOC. Slowing of speech and delay in response to verbal suggestions are other early indicators.

Any sudden change in the patient's condition, such as restlessness (without apparent cause), confusion, or increasing drowsiness, has neurologic significance. These signs may result from compression of the brain due to swelling from hemorrhage or edema, an expanding intracranial lesion (hematoma or tumor), or a combination of both.

As ICP increases, the patient becomes stuporous, reacting only to loud auditory or painful stimuli. At this stage, serious impairment of brain circulation is probably taking place, and immediate intervention is required. As neurologic function deteriorates further, the patient becomes comatose and exhibits abnormal motor responses in the form of decortication, decerebration, or flaccidity (see Fig. 61-1). When the coma is profound, with the pupils dilated and fixed and respirations impaired, death is usually inevitable.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnostic studies used to determine the underlying cause of increased ICP are discussed in detail in Chapter 60. The patient may undergo cerebral angiography, computed tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET). Transcranial Doppler studies provide information about cerebral blood flow. The patient with increased ICP may also undergo electrophysiologic monitoring to monitor cerebral blood flow indirectly. Evoked potential monitoring measures the electrical potentials produced by nerve tissue in response to external stimulation (auditory, visual, or sensory). Lumbar puncture is avoided in patients with increased ICP because the sudden release of pressure can cause the brain to herniate.

\section*{Complications}

Complications of increased ICP include brain stem herniation, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

Brain stem herniation results from an excessive increase in ICP, when the pressure builds in the cranial vault and the brain tissue presses down on the brain stem. This increasing pressure on the brain stem results in the cessation of blood flow to the brain, causing irreversible brain anoxia and brain death.

Diabetes insipidus is the result of decreased secretion of antidiuretic hormone. The patient has excessive urine output, and hyperosmolarity results (Young et al., 1998). Therapy consists of administration of fluid volume, electrolyte replacement, and vasopressin (desmopressin, DDAVP) therapy. Diabetes insipidus is discussed in Chapters 14 and 42.

SIADH is the result of increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone. The patient becomes volume-overloaded, urine output diminishes, and serum sodium concentration becomes dilute. Treatment of SIADH includes fluid restriction, which is usually sufficient to correct the hyponatremia; severe cases call for judicious administration of a 3\% hypertonic saline solution (Hickey, 2003). Patients with chronic SIADH may respond to lithium carbonate or demeclocycline, which reduces renal tubule responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Further discussion of SIADH is presented in Chapters 14 and 42.

\section*{Management}

Increased ICP is a true emergency and must be treated promptly. Invasive monitoring of ICP is an important component of management, but immediate management to relieve increased ICP involves decreasing cerebral edema, lowering the volume of CSF, or decreasing cerebral blood volume while maintaining cerebral perfusion (Cunning \& Houdek, 1999). These goals are accomplished by administering osmotic diuretics and corticosteroids, restricting fluids, draining CSF, controlling fever, maintaining systemic blood pressure and oxygenation, and reducing cellular metabolic demands. Judicious use of hyperventilation is recommended only if the ICP is refractory to other measures.

\section*{MONITORING ICP}

The purposes of ICP monitoring are to identify increased pressure early in its course (before cerebral damage occurs), to quantify the degree of elevation, to initiate appropriate treatment, to provide access to CSF for sampling and drainage, and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. An intraventricular catheter (ventriculostomy), a subarachnoid bolt, an epidural or subdural catheter, or a fiberoptic transducer-tipped catheter placed in the subdural space or the ventricle can be used to monitor ICP (Fig. 61-3).

When a ventriculostomy or ventricular catheter monitoring device is used for monitoring ICP, a fine-bore catheter is inserted into a lateral ventricle, usually in the nondominant hemisphere of the brain (Hickey, 2003). The catheter is connected by a fluidfilled system to a transducer, which records the pressure in the form of an electrical impulse. In addition to obtaining continuous ICP recordings, the ventricular catheter allows CSF to drain, particularly during acute rises in pressure. The ventriculostomy also can be used to drain the ventricle of blood. Also, continuous drainage of ventricular fluid under pressure control is an effective method of treating intracranial hypertension. Another advantage of an indwelling ventricular catheter is the access it provides for the intraventricular administration of medications and the instillation of air or a contrast agent for ventriculography. Complications include ventricular infection, meningitis, ventricular collapse, occlusion of the catheter by brain tissue or blood, and problems with the monitoring system.

The subarachnoid bolt (or screw) is a hollow device inserted through the skull and dura mater into the cranial subarachnoid space (Hickey, 2003). It has the advantage of not requiring a ventricular puncture. The subarachnoid screw is attached to a pressure transducer, and the output is recorded on an oscilloscope. The hollow screw technique has the advantage of avoiding complications from brain shift and small ventricle size. Complications include blockage of the screw by clot or brain tissue, which leads to a loss of pressure tracing and a decrease in accuracy at high ICP readings.

An epidural monitor uses a pneumatic flow sensor that functions on a nonelectrical basis. This pneumatic epidural ICP mon-

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
itoring system has a low incidence of infection and complications and appears to read pressures accurately. Calibration of the system is maintained automatically, and abnormal pressure waves trigger an alarm system. One disadvantage of the epidural catheter is the inability to withdraw CSF for analysis.

A fiberoptic monitor, or transducer-tipped catheter, is becoming a widely used alternative to standard intraventricular, subarachnoid, and subdural systems (Hickey, 2003). The miniature transducer reflects pressure changes, which are converted to electrical signals in an amplifier and displayed on a digital monitor. The catheter can be inserted into the ventricle, subarachnoid space, subdural space, or brain parenchyma or under a bone flap. If inserted into the ventricle, it can also be used in conjunction with a CSF drainage device.

Waves of high pressure and troughs of relatively normal pressure indicate changes in ICP. Waveforms are captured and recorded on an oscilloscope. These waves have been classified as A waves (plateau waves), B waves, and C waves (Fig. 61-4). The plateau waves (A waves) are transient, paroxysmal, recurring elevations of ICP that may last 5 to 20 minutes and range in amplitude from 50 to 100 mm Hg (Hickey, 2003). Plateau waves have clinical significance and indicate changes in vascular volume within the intracranial compartment that are beginning to compromise cerebral perfusion. A waves may increase in amplitude and frequency, reflecting cerebral ischemia and brain damage that can occur before overt signs and symptoms of raised ICP are seen clinically. B waves are shorter ( 30 seconds to 2 minutes), with smaller amplitude (up to 50 mm Hg ). They have less clinical significance, but if seen in runs in a patient with depressed consciousness, they may precede the appearance of A waves. B waves may be seen in patients with intracranial hypertension and decreased intracranial compliance. C waves are small, rhythmic oscillations with frequencies of approximately six per minute. They
appear to be related to rhythmic variations of the systemic arterial blood pressure and respirations.

\section*{DECREASING CEREBRAL EDEMA}

Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) may be given to dehydrate the brain tissue and reduce cerebral edema. They act by drawing water across intact membranes, thereby reducing the volume of brain and extracellular fluid. An indwelling urinary catheter is usually inserted to monitor urinary output and to manage the resulting diuresis. When a patient is receiving osmotic diuretics, serum osmolality should be determined to assess hydration status. Corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone) help reduce the edema

surrounding brain tumors when a brain tumor is the cause of increased ICP.

Another method for decreasing cerebral edema is fluid restriction (Hickey, 2003). Limiting overall fluid intake leads to dehydration and hemoconcentration, drawing fluid across the osmotic gradient and decreasing cerebral edema. Conversely, overhydration of the patient with increased ICP is avoided, as this will increase cerebral edema.

It has been hypothesized that lowering body temperature will decrease cerebral edema, reduce the oxygen and metabolic requirements of the brain, and protect the brain from continued ischemia. If body metabolism can be reduced by lowering body temperature, the collateral circulation in the brain may be able to provide an adequate blood supply to the brain. The effect of hypothermia on ICP requires more study (Slade, Kerr \& Marion, 1999), but as yet induced hypothermia has not been proven to be beneficial in the brain-injured patient (Clifton, Miller, Choi et al., 2001). Inducing and maintaining hypothermia is a major clinical procedure and requires knowledge and skilled nursing observation and management.

\section*{MAINTAINING CEREBRAL PERFUSION}

The cardiac output may be manipulated to provide adequate perfusion to the brain. Improvements in cardiac output are made using fluid volume and inotropic agents such as dobutamine hydrochloride. The effectiveness of the cardiac output is reflected in the cerebral perfusion pressure, which is maintained at greater than 70 mm Hg (Young et al., 1998). A lower cerebral perfusion pressure indicates that the cardiac output is insufficient to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion.

\section*{REDUCING CSF AND INTRACRANIAL BLOOD VOLUME}

CSF drainage is frequently performed because the removal of CSF with a ventriculostomy drain may dramatically reduce ICP and restore cerebral perfusion pressure. Caution should be used in draining CSF because excessive drainage may result in collapse of the ventricles.

Hyperventilation, which results in vasoconstriction, has been used for many years in patients with increased ICP. Recent research has demonstrated that hyperventilation may not be as beneficial as once thought (Hickey, 2003). The reduction in the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ may result in hypoxia, ischemia, and an increase in cerebral lactate levels. Maintaining the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ at 30 to 35 mm Hg may prove beneficial. Hyperventilation is indicated in patients whose ICP is unresponsive to conventional therapies, but it should be used judiciously.

\section*{CONTROLLING FEVER}

Preventing a temperature elevation is critical because fever increases cerebral metabolism and the rate at which cerebral edema forms. Strategies to reduce temperature include administration of antipyretic medications, as prescribed, and use of a cooling blanket. Additional strategies for reducing fever are included in the Nursing Process: The Patient With an Altered Level of Consciousness section of this chapter. The patient's temperature is monitored closely, and the patient is observed for shivering, which should be avoided because it increases ICP (Sund-Levander \& Wahren, 2000).

\section*{MAINTAINING OXYGENATION}

Arterial blood gases must be monitored to ensure that systemic oxygenation remains optimal. Hemoglobin saturation can also be optimized to provide oxygen more efficiently at the cellular level.

\section*{REDUCING METABOLIC DEMANDS}

Cellular metabolic demands may be reduced through the administration of high doses of barbiturates when the patient is unresponsive to conventional treatment. The mechanism by which barbiturates decrease ICP and protect the brain is uncertain, but the resultant comatose state is thought to reduce the metabolic requirements of the brain, thus providing some protection (Greenberg, 2001).

Another method of reducing cellular metabolic demand and improving oxygenation is the administration of pharmacologic paralyzing agents. The patient who receives these agents cannot move, decreasing the metabolic demands and resulting in a decrease in cerebral oxygen demand. Because the patient cannot respond or report pain, sedation and analgesia must be provided because the paralyzing agents do not provide either.

Patients receiving high doses of barbiturates or pharmacologic paralyzing agents require continuous cardiac monitoring, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, ICP monitoring, and arterial pressure monitoring. Pentobarbital (Nembutal), thiopental (Pentothal), and propofol (Diprivan) are the most common agents used for high-dose barbiturate therapy (Greenberg, 2001). Serum barbiturate levels must be monitored (Hickey, 2003).

The ability to perform serial neurologic assessments on the patient is lost with the use of barbiturates or paralyzing agents (Greenberg, 2001). Therefore, other monitoring tools are needed to assess the patient's status and response to therapy. Important parameters that must be assessed include ICP, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and response to ventilator therapy (eg, bucking the ventilator). The level of pharmacologic paralysis is adjusted based on serum levels and the assessed parameters. Potential complications include hypotension due to decreased sympathetic tone and myocardial depression (Greenberg, 2001).

\section*{TRENDS IN NEUROLOGIC MONITORING}

One controversial trend in cerebral monitoring is the ongoing measurement of venous oxygen saturation in the jugular bulb $\left(\mathrm{SjO}_{2}\right)$. Readings taken from a catheter residing in the jugular outflow tract theoretically allow for a comparison of arterial and venous oxygen saturation, and the balance of cerebral oxygen supply and demand is demonstrated. Venous jugular desaturations can reflect early cerebral ischemia, alerting the clinician prior to a rise in ICP. Minimizing elevations in ICP can potentially improve outcome (Clay, 2000). This type of monitoring appears beneficial in the management of patients at risk for cerebral ischemia; however, the invasive nature of this type of monitoring and current limitations in technology mandate caution in its use. More study is needed before $\mathrm{SjO}_{2}$ monitoring can be considered a valid and reliable tool for the management of cerebral ischemia (Clay, 2000).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH INCREASED ICP}

\section*{Assessment}

Initial assessment of the patient with increased ICP includes obtaining a history of events leading to the present illness and other subjective data; it may be necessary to obtain this information from family or friends. The neurologic examination should be as complete as the patient's condition allows. It includes an evaluation of mental status, LOC, cranial nerve function, cerebellar function (balance and coordination), reflexes, and motor and sensory function. Because the patient is critically ill, ongoing assessment will
be more focused, including pupil checks, assessment of selected cranial nerves, frequent measurements of vital signs and intracranial pressure, and use of the Glasgow Coma Scale. Assessment of the patient with altered LOC is summarized in Table 61-1.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses for patients with increased ICP include the following:
- Ineffective airway clearance related to diminished protective reflexes (cough, gag)
- Ineffective breathing patterns related to neurologic dysfunction (brain stem compression, structural displacement)
- Ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to the effects of increased ICP
- Deficient fluid volume related to fluid restriction
- Risk for infection related to ICP monitoring system (fiberoptic or intraventricular catheter)

Other relevant nursing diagnoses are included in the section on caring for patients with altered LOC.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications include:
- Brain stem herniation
- Diabetes insipidus
- SIADH

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient include maintenance of a patent airway, normalization of respiration, adequate cerebral tissue perfusion through reduction in ICP, restoration of fluid balance, absence of infection, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING A PATENT AIRWAY}

The patency of the airway is assessed. Secretions obstructing the airway must be suctioned with care, because transient elevations of ICP occur with suctioning (Hickey, 2003). The patient is hyperoxygenated before and after suctioning to maintain adequate oxygenation. Hypoxia caused by poor oxygenation leads to cerebral ischemia and edema. Coughing is discouraged because coughing and straining also increase ICP. The lung fields are auscultated at least every 8 hours to determine the presence of adventitious sounds or any areas of congestion. Elevating the head of the bed may aid in clearing secretions as well as improving venous drainage of the brain.

\section*{ACHIEVING AN ADEQUATE BREATHING PATTERN}

The patient must be monitored constantly for respiratory irregularities. Increased pressure on the frontal lobes or deep midline structures may result in Cheyne-Stokes respirations, whereas pressure in the midbrain may cause hyperventilation. When the lower portion of the brain stem (the pons and medulla) is involved, respirations become irregular and eventually cease.

If hyperventilation therapy is deemed appropriate to reduce ICP (by causing cerebral vasoconstriction and a decrease in cerebral blood volume), the nurse collaborates with the respiratory
therapist in monitoring $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, which is usually maintained at 35 to 45 mm Hg (Hickey, 2003).

A neurologic observation record (Fig. 61-5) is maintained, and all observations are made in relation to the patient's baseline condition. Repeated assessments of the patient are made (sometimes minute by minute) so that improvement or deterioration may be noted immediately. If the patient's condition deteriorates, preparations are made for surgical intervention.

\section*{OPTIMIZING CEREBRAL TISSUE PERFUSION}

In addition to ongoing nursing assessment, strategies are initiated to reduce factors contributing to the elevation of ICP (Table 61-2).

Proper positioning helps to reduce ICP. The head is kept in a neutral (midline) position, maintained with the use of a cervical collar if necessary, to promote venous drainage. Elevation of the head is maintained at 0 to 60 degrees to aid in venous drainage unless otherwise prescribed (Sullivan, 2000). Extreme rotation of the neck and flexion of the neck are avoided because compression or distortion of the jugular veins increases ICP. Extreme hip flexion is also avoided because this position causes an increase in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures, which can produce a rise in ICP. Relatively minor changes in position may significantly affect ICP (Sullivan, 2000). If monitoring parameters demonstrate that turning the patient raises ICP, rotating beds, turning sheets, and holding the patient's head during turning may minimize the stimuli that increase ICP.

The Valsalva maneuver, which can be produced by straining at defecation or even moving in bed, raises ICP and is to be avoided. Stool softeners may be prescribed. If the patient is alert and able to eat, a diet high in fiber may be indicated. Abdominal distention, which increases intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure and ICP, should be noted. Enemas and cathartics are avoided if possible. When moving or being turned in bed, the patient can be instructed to exhale (which opens the glottis) to avoid the Valsalva maneuver.

Mechanical ventilation presents unique problems for the patient with increased ICP. Before suctioning, the patient should be preoxygenated and hyperventilated using $100 \%$ oxygen on the ventilator (Hickey, 2003). Suctioning should not last longer than 15 seconds. High levels of positive end-expiratory pressure are avoided because they may decrease venous return to the heart and decrease venous drainage from the brain through increased intrathoracic pressure (Hickey, 2003).

Activities that raise ICP, as indicated by changes in waveforms, should be avoided if possible. Spacing nursing interventions may prevent transient increases in ICP. During nursing interventions, the ICP should not rise above 25 mm Hg and should return to baseline levels within 5 minutes. Patients with increased ICP should not demonstrate a significant increase in pressure or change in the ICP waveform. Patients with the potential for a significant increase in ICP should receive sedation or "paralyzation" before initiation of many nursing activities (Hickey, 2003; McConnell, 2001).

Emotional stress and frequent arousal from sleep are avoided. A calm atmosphere is maintained. Environmental stimuli (noise, conversation) should be minimal. Isometric muscle contractions are also contraindicated because they raise the systemic blood pressure and hence the ICP.

\section*{MAINTAINING NEGATIVE FLUID BALANCE}

The administration of various osmotic and loop diuretics is part of the treatment protocol to reduce ICP. Corticosteroids are used

to reduce cerebral edema, and fluids may be restricted. All of these treatment modalities promote dehydration.

Skin turgor, mucous membranes, and serum and urine osmolality are monitored to assess fluid status. If fluids are given intravenously, the nurse ensures they are administered at a slow to moderate rate with an intravenous infusion pump to prevent too-rapid administration and avoid overhydration. For the patient receiving mannitol, the nurse observes for the possible development of heart failure and pulmonary edema, because the intent of treatment is for fluid to shift from the intracellular compartment to the intravascular system, thus controlling cerebral edema.

For patients undergoing dehydrating procedures, vital signs, including blood pressure, must be monitored to assess fluid volume status. An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to permit assessment of renal function and fluid status. During the acute phase, urine output should be monitored every hour. An output greater than $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ for 2 consecutive hours may indicate the onset of diabetes insipidus (Cruz, 1998). These patients also need careful oral hygiene because mouth dryness is associated with dehydration. Frequently rinsing the mouth, lubricating the lips, and removing encrustations relieve dryness and promote comfort.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Risk for infection is greatest when ICP is monitored with an intraventricular catheter. Most health care facilities have written protocols for managing these systems and maintaining their sterility; strict adherence to them is essential.

The dressing over the ventricular catheter must be kept dry because a wet dressing is conducive to bacterial growth. Aseptic technique must be used when managing the system and changing the ventricular drainage bag. The drainage system is also checked
for loose connections because they cause leakage and contamination of the CSF as well as inaccurate readings of ICP. The nurse should observe the character of the CSF drainage and report observations of increasing cloudiness or blood. The patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of meningitis: fever, chills, nuchal (neck) rigidity, and increasing or persisting headache.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The primary complication of increased ICP is brain herniation resulting in death (see Fig. 61-2). Nursing management focuses on detecting early signs of increasing ICP because medical interventions are usually ineffective once later signs develop. Frequent neurologic assessment and documentation and analysis of trends will reveal the subtle changes that may herald rising ICP.

\section*{Detecting Early Indications of Increasing ICP}

The nurse assesses for and immediately reports any of the following early signs or symptoms of increasing ICP:
- Disorientation, restlessness, increased respiratory effort, purposeless movements, and mental confusion; these are early clinical indications of rising ICP because the brain cells responsible for cognition are extremely sensitive to decreased oxygenation
- Pupillary changes and impaired extraocular movements; these occur as the increasing pressure displaces the brain against the oculomotor and optic nerves (cranial nerves II, III, IV, and VI) arising from the midbrain and brain stem (see Chap. 60)
- Weakness in one extremity or on one side of the body; this occurs as increasing ICP compresses the pyramidal tracts
- Headache that is constant, increasing in intensity, and aggravated by movement or straining; this occurs as increasing ICP causes pressure and stretching of venous and arterial vessels in the base of the brain

\section*{Detecting Later Signs of Increased ICP}

As ICP rises, the patient's condition worsens, as manifested by the following later signs and symptoms:
- LOC continues to deteriorate until the patient is comatose.
- The pulse rate and respiratory rate decrease or become erratic, and the blood pressure and temperature rise. The pulse pressure (the difference between the systolic and the diastolic pressures) widens. The pulse fluctuates rapidly, varying from bradycardia to tachycardia.
- Altered respiratory patterns develop, including CheyneStokes breathing (rhythmic waxing and waning of rate and depth of respirations alternating with brief periods of apnea) and ataxic breathing (irregular breathing with a random sequence of deep and shallow breaths).
- Projectile vomiting may occur with increased pressure on the reflex center in the medulla.
- Hemiplegia or decorticate or decerebrate posturing may develop as pressure on the brain stem increases. Bilateral flaccidity occurs before death.
- Loss of brain stem reflexes, including pupillary, corneal, gag, and swallowing reflexes, is an ominous sign.

\section*{Monitoring ICP}

Because clinical assessment is not always a reliable guide in recognizing increased ICP, especially in comatose patients, ICP monitoring is an essential part of management (Hickey, 2003). ICP is monitored closely for continuous elevation or significant increase over baseline. The trend of ICP measurements over time is an important indication of the patient's underlying status. Vital signs are assessed when the increase in ICP is noted.

Strict aseptic technique is used when handling any part of the monitoring system. The insertion site is inspected for signs of infection. Temperature, pulse, and respirations are closely monitored for systemic signs of infection. All connections and stopcocks are checked for leaks, because even small leaks can distort pressure readings.

When ICP is monitored with a fluid system, the transducer is calibrated at a particular reference point, usually 2.5 cm ( 1 in ) above the ear with the patient in the supine position; this point corresponds to the level of the foramen of Monro (Fig. 61-6). (CSF pressure readings depend on the patient's position.) For subsequent pressure readings, the head should be in the same position relative to the transducer. Fiberoptic catheters are calibrated before insertion and do not require further referencing; they do not require the head of the bed to be at a specific position to obtain an accurate reading.

Whenever technology is associated with patient management, the nurse must be certain that the technology is functioning properly. The most important concern, however, must be the patient who is attached to the technology. The patient and family must be informed about the technology and the goals of its use. The patient's response is monitored and appropriate comfort measures are implemented to ensure that the patient's stress is minimized.

ICP measurement is only one parameter: repeated neurologic checks and clinical examinations remain important measures. As-

\end{figure}
tute observation, comparison of findings with previous observations, and interventions can assist in preventing life-threatening ICP elevations.

\section*{Monitoring for Secondary Complications}

The nurse also assesses for complications of increased ICP, including diabetes insipidus and SIADH (see Chaps. 14 and 42). Urine output should be monitored closely. Diabetes insipidus requires fluid and electrolyte replacement, along with the administration of vasopressin, to replace and slow the urine output. Serum electrolyte levels should be monitored for imbalances. SIADH requires fluid restriction and monitoring of serum electrolyte levels.

\section*{Evaluation}

6. Absence of complications

b. Demonstrates urine output and serum electrolyte levels within acceptable limits

\section*{Intracranial Surgery}

A craniotomy involves opening the skull surgically to gain access to intracranial structures. This procedure is performed to remove a tumor, relieve elevated ICP, evacuate a blood clot, and control hemorrhage. The surgeon cuts the skull to create a bony flap, which can be repositioned after surgery and held in place by periosteal or wire sutures. One of two approaches through the skull is used: (1) above the tentorium (supratentorial craniotomy) into the supratentorial compartment, or (2) below the tentorium into the infratentorial (posterior fossa) compartment. A transsphenoidal approach through the mouth and nasal sinuses is used to gain access to the pituitary gland. Table 61-3 compares the three different surgical approaches: supratentorial, infratentorial, and transsphenoidal.

Alternatively, intracranial structures may be approached through burr holes (Fig. 61-7), which are circular openings made in the skull by either a hand drill or an automatic craniotome
(which has a self-controlled system to stop the drill when the bone is penetrated). Burr holes are made for exploration or diagnosis. They may be used to determine the presence of cerebral swelling and injury and the size and position of the ventricles. They are also a means of evacuating an intracranial hematoma or abscess and for making a bone flap in the skull and allowing access to the ventricles for decompression, ventriculography, or shunting procedures. Other cranial procedures include craniectomy (excision of a portion of the skull) and cranioplasty (repair of a cranial defect using a plastic or metal plate).

\section*{Preoperative Management}

Preoperative diagnostic procedures may include CT scanning to demonstrate the lesion and show the degree of surrounding brain edema, the ventricular size, and the displacement. MRI provides information similar to that of the CT scan and examines the lesion in other planes (Tornqvist, 2001). Cerebral angiography may be used to study the tumor's blood supply or give information about vascular lesions. Transcranial Doppler flow studies are used to evaluate the blood flow of intracranial blood vessels.

Most patients are placed on an antiseizure medication such as phenytoin (Dilantin) or a phenytoin metabolite (Cerebyx) before surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative seizures (paroxysmal

transient disturbances of the brain resulting from a discharge of abnormal electrical activity) (Hickey, 2003; Karch, 2002). Before surgery, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron) may be administered to reduce cerebral edema. Fluids may be restricted. A hyperosmotic agent (mannitol) and a diuretic agent such as furosemide (Lasix) may be given intravenously immediately before and sometimes during surgery if the patient tends to retain fluid, as do many who have intracranial dysfunction. The patient may be given antibiotics if there is a chance of cerebral contamination; diazepam may be prescribed before surgery to allay anxiety.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Management}

The preoperative assessment serves as a baseline against which postoperative status and recovery are compared. This assessment includes evaluating LOC and responsiveness to stimuli and identifying any neurologic deficits, such as paralysis, visual dysfunction, alterations in personality or speech, and bladder and bowel disorders. Distal and proximal motor strength in both upper and lower extremities is recorded using the 5 -point scale. Testing of motor function is discussed in Chapter 60 (see Fig. 60-14).

The patient's and family's understanding of and reactions to the anticipated surgical procedure and its possible sequelae are assessed, as is the availability of support systems for the patient and family. Adequate preparation for surgery, with attention to the patient's physical and emotional status, can reduce the risk for anxiety, fear, and postoperative complications. The patient is assessed for neurologic deficits and their potential impact after surgery. If there are motor deficits or weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs, trochanter rolls are applied to the extremities and the feet are positioned against a footboard. A patient who can ambulate is encouraged to do so. If the patient is aphasic, writing materials or picture and word cards showing the bedpan, glass of
water, blanket, and other frequently used items may help improve communication.

Preparation of the patient and family includes providing information about what to expect during and after surgery. The surgical site is shaved immediately before surgery (usually in the operating room) so that any resultant superficial abrasions do not have time to become infected. An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted in the operating room to drain the bladder during the administration of diuretics and to permit urinary output to be monitored. The patient may have a central and arterial line placed for fluid administration and monitoring of pressures after surgery. The large head dressing applied after surgery may impair hearing temporarily. Vision may be limited if the eyes are swollen shut. If a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube is in place, the patient will be unable to speak until the tube is removed, so an alternative method of communication should be established.

An altered cognitive state may make the patient unaware of the impending surgery. Even so, encouragement and attention to the patient's needs are necessary. Whatever the state of awareness of the patient, the family needs reassurance and support because they recognize the seriousness of brain surgery.

\section*{Postoperative Management}

Postoperatively, an arterial line and a central venous pressure line may be in place to monitor and manage blood pressure and central venous pressure. The patient may be intubated and may receive supplemental oxygen therapy. Ongoing postoperative management is aimed at detecting and reducing cerebral edema, relieving pain and preventing seizures, and monitoring ICP.

\section*{REDUCING CEREBRAL EDEMA}

Medications to reduce cerebral edema include mannitol, which increases serum osmolality and draws free water from areas of the brain (with an intact blood-brain barrier). The fluid is then excreted by osmotic diuresis. Dexamethasone (Decadron) may be administered intravenously every 6 hours for 24 to 72 hours; the route is switched to oral as soon as possible and dosage is tapered over 5 to 7 days (Karch, 2002).

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND PREVENTING SEIZURES}

Acetaminophen is usually prescribed for temperature exceeding $99.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and for pain. Commonly, the patient has a headache after a craniotomy, usually as a result of the scalp nerves being stretched and irritated during surgery. Codeine, given parenterally, is often sufficient to relieve headache. Morphine sulfate may also be used in the management of postoperative pain in the craniotomy patient (Leith, 1998).

Antiseizure medication (phenytoin, diazepam) is prescribed for patients who have undergone supratentorial craniotomy because of the high risk of seizures after supratentorial neurosurgical procedures. Serum levels are monitored to keep the medications within the therapeutic range.

\section*{MONITORING ICP}

A ventricular catheter or other type of drain frequently is inserted in patients undergoing intracranial surgery. The catheter is connected to an external drainage system. The patency of the catheter is noted by the pulsations of the fluid in the tubing. The ICP can be assessed using a stopcock attached to the pressure tubing and transducer. The ICP is measured by turning the three-way stopcock to the appropriate position (Hickey, 2003). Care is required to ensure that the system is tight at all connections and that the
stopcock is in the proper position to avoid drainage of CSF; collapse of the ventricles and brain herniation may result if fluid is removed too rapidly (Hickey, 2003). The catheter is removed when the ventricular pressure is normal and stable. The neurosurgeon must be notified if the catheter appears to be obstructed.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING INTRACRANIAL SURGERY}

\section*{Assessment}

After surgery, the frequency of postoperative monitoring is based on the patient's clinical status. Assessing respiratory function is essential because even a small degree of hypoxia can increase cerebral ischemia. The respiratory rate and pattern are monitored, and arterial blood gas values are assessed frequently. Fluctuations in vital signs are carefully monitored and documented because they indicate increased ICP. The patient's temperature is measured at intervals to assess for hyperthermia secondary to damage to the hypothalamus. Neurologic checks are made frequently to detect increased ICP resulting from cerebral edema or bleeding. A change in LOC or response to stimuli may be the first sign of increasing ICP.

The surgical dressing is inspected for evidence of bleeding and CSF drainage. The nurse must be alert to the development of complications; all assessments are carried out with these problems in mind. Chart 61-2 provides an overview of the nursing management of the patient after intracranial surgery. Seizures are a potential complication, and any seizure activity is carefully recorded and reported. Restlessness may occur as the patient becomes more responsive or may be due to pain, confusion, hypoxia, or other stimuli.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses after intracranial surgery may include the following:
- Ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to cerebral edema
- Potential for ineffective thermoregulation related to damage to the hypothalamus, dehydration, and infection
- Potential for impaired gas exchange related to hypoventilation, aspiration, and immobility
- Disturbed sensory perception related to periorbital edema, head dressing, endotracheal tube, and effects of ICP
- Body image disturbance related to change in appearance or physical disabilities

Other nursing diagnoses may include impaired communication (aphasia) related to insult to brain tissue and high risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility, pressure, and incontinence. There may be impaired physical mobility related to a neurologic deficit secondary to the neurosurgical procedure or to the underlying disorder.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications include:
- Increased ICP
- Bleeding and hypovolemic shock
- Fluid and electrolyte disturbances
- Infection
- Seizures

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include neurologic homeostasis to improve cerebral tissue perfusion, adequate thermoregulation, normal ventilation and gas exchange, ability to cope with sensory deprivation, adaptation to changes in body image, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING CEREBRAL TISSUE PERFUSION}

Attention to the patient's respiratory status is essential because even slight decreases in the oxygen level (hypoxia) can cause cerebral ischemia and can affect the clinical course and outcome. The endotracheal tube is left in place until the patient shows signs of awakening and has adequate spontaneous ventilation, as evaluated clinically and by arterial blood gas analysis. Secondary brain damage can result from impaired cerebral oxygenation.

Some degree of cerebral edema occurs after brain surgery; it tends to peak 24 to 36 hours after surgery, producing decreased responsiveness on the second postoperative day. The control of cerebral edema is discussed in the earlier section of this chapter on management of increased ICP. Nursing strategies used to control factors that may raise ICP are found earlier in this chapter in Nursing Process: The Patient With Increased ICP. Intraventricular drainage is carefully monitored, using strict asepsis when any part of the system is handled.

Vital signs and neurologic status (LOC and responsiveness, pupillary and motor responses) are assessed every 15 minutes to every 1 hour. Extreme head rotation is avoided because this raises ICP. After supratentorial surgery, the patient is placed on his or her back or side (unoperated side if a large lesion was removed) with one pillow under the head. The head of the bed may be elevated 30 degrees, depending on the level of the ICP and the neurosurgeon's preference. After posterior fossa (infratentorial) surgery, the patient is kept flat on one side (off the back) with the head on a small, firm pillow. The patient may be turned on either side, keeping the neck in a neutral position. When the patient is being turned, the body should be turned as a unit to prevent placing strain on the incision and possibly tearing the sutures. The head of the bed may be elevated slowly as tolerated by the patient.

The patient's position is changed every 2 hours, and skin care is given frequently. During position changes, care is taken to prevent disrupting the ICP monitoring system. A turning sheet placed under the head to the midthigh makes it easier to move and turn the patient safely.

\section*{REGULATING TEMPERATURE}

Moderate temperature elevation can be expected after intracranial surgery because of the reaction to blood at the operative site or in the subarachnoid space. Injury to the hypothalamic centers that regulate body temperature can occur during surgery. High fever is treated vigorously to combat the effect of an elevated temperature on brain metabolism and function.

Nursing interventions include monitoring the patient's temperature and using the following measures to reduce body temperature: removing blankets, applying ice bags to axilla and groin areas, using a hypothermia blanket as prescribed, and administering prescribed medications to reduce fever.

\section*{Overview of Nursing Management for the Patient After Intracranial Surgery}

Postoperative Interventions
Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for ineffective breathing pattern related to postoperative cerebral edema
Goal: Achievement of adequate respiratory function
1. Establish proper respiratory exchange to eliminate systemic hypercapnia and hypoxia, which increase cerebral edema.
a. Unless contraindicated, place the patient in a lateral or a semiprone position to facilitate respiratory gas exchange until consciousness returns.
b. Suction trachea and pharynx cautiously to remove secretions; suctioning can raise ICP.
c. Maintain patient on controlled ventilation if prescribed to maintain normal ventilatory status; monitor arterial blood gas results to determine respiratory status.
d. Elevate the head of the bed 30.5 cm ( 12 in ) after patient is conscious to aid venous drainage of the brain.
e. Administer nothing by mouth until active coughing and swallowing reflexes are demonstrated, to prevent aspiration.
Nursing Diagnosis: Risk for imbalanced fluid volume related to intracranial pressure or diuretics
Goal: Attainment of fluid and electrolyte balance
1. Monitor for polyuria, especially during first postoperative week; diabetes insipidus may develop in patients with lesions around the pituitary or hypothalamus.
a. Measure urinary specific gravity at intervals.
b. Monitor serum and urinary electrolyte levels.
2. Evaluate patient's electrolyte status; patients may retain water and sodium.
a. Early postoperative weight gain indicates fluid retention; a greater-than-estimated weight loss indicates negative water balance.
b. Loss of sodium and chloride will produce weakness, lethargy, and coma.
c. Low potassium levels will cause confusion and decreased level of responsiveness.
3. Weigh patient daily; keep intake and output record.
4. Administer prescribed intravenous fluids cautiously—rate and composition depend on fluid deficit, urine output, and blood loss. Fluid intake and fluid losses should remain relatively equal.
Nursing Diagnosis: Disturbed sensory perception (visual/auditory) related to periorbital edema and head dressings
Goal: Compensate for sensory deprivation; prevention of injury
1. Perform supportive measures until the patient can care for self.
a. Change position as indicated; position changes can increase ICP.
b. Administer prescribed analgesics (codeine) that do not mask the level of responsiveness.
2. Use measures prescribed to relieve signs of periocular edema.
a. Lubricate eyelids and around eyes with petrolatum.
b. Apply light, cold compresses over eyes at specified intervals.
c. Observe for signs of keratitis if cornea has no sensation.
3. Put extremities through range-of-motion exercises.
4. Evaluate and support patient during episodes of restlessness.
a. Evaluate for airway obstruction, distended bladder, meningeal irritation from bloody CSF.
b. Pad patient's hands and bed rails to prevent injury.
5. Reinforce blood-stained dressings with sterile dressing; bloodsoaked dressings act as a culture medium for bacteria.
6. Orient patient frequently to time, place, and person.

Monitor and Manage Complications
1. Cerebral edema
a. Assess patient's level of responsiveness/consciousness; decreased level of consciousness may be the first sign of increased ICP.
(1) Eye opening (spontaneous, to sound, to pain); pupillary reactions to light
(2) Response to commands
(3) Assessment of spinal motor reflexes (pinch Achilles tendon, arm, or other body site)
(4) Observation of patient's spontaneous activity
b. Maintain a neurologic flow sheet to assess and document neurologic status, fluid administration, laboratory data, medications, and treatments.
c. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of increasing ICP, which can lead to ischemia and further impairment of brain function.
(1) Assess patient minute by minute, hour by hour, for:
- Diminished response to stimuli
- Fluctuations of vital signs
- Restlessness
- Weakness and paralysis of extremities
- Increasing headache
- Changes or disturbances of vision; pupillary changes
(2) Modify nursing management to prevent further increases in ICP.
d. Control postoperative cerebral edema as prescribed.
(1) Administer corticosteroids and osmotic diuretics as prescribed to reduce brain swelling.
(2) Monitor fluid intake; avoid overhydration.
(3) Maintain a normal temperature. Temperature control may be impaired in certain neurologic states, and fever increases the metabolic demands of the brain.
- Monitor rectal temperature at specified intervals. Assess temperature of extremities, which may be cold and dry due to impaired heat-losing mechanisms (vasodilation and sweating).
- Employ measures as prescribed to reduce fever: ice bags to axillae and groin; hypothermia blanket. Use ECG monitoring to detect dysrhythmias during hypothermia procedures.
(4) Employ hyperventilation when prescribed and indicated (results in respiratory alkalosis, which causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces intracranial pressure).
(5) Elevate head of bed to reduce ICP and facilitate respirations.
(6) Avoid excessive stimuli.
(7) Use ICP monitoring if patient is at risk for intracranial hypertension.
2. Intracranial hemorrhage
a. Postoperative bleeding may be intraventricular, intracerebellar, subdural, or extradural.
b. Observe for progressive impairment of state of consciousness and other signs of increasing ICP.
c. Prepare deteriorating patient for return to surgery for evacuation of hematoma.
3. Seizures (greater risk with supratentorial operations)
a. Administer prescribed antiseizure agents; monitor antiseizure medication blood levels.
b. Observe for status epilepticus, which may occur after any intracranial surgery.
4. Infections
a. Urinary tract infections
b. Pulmonary infections related to aspiration secondary to depressed level of responsiveness; may result in atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia
c. CNS infections (postoperative meningitis, CSF shunt infection)
d. Surgical site infections/septicemia

Conversely, hypothermia may be seen after lengthy neurosurgical procedures. Therefore, frequent measurements of rectal temperature are necessary. Rewarming should occur slowly to prevent shivering, which increases cellular oxygen demands.

\section*{IMPROVING GAS EXCHANGE}

The patient undergoing neurosurgery is at risk for impaired gas exchange and pulmonary infections because of immobility, immunosuppression, decreased LOC, and fluid restriction. Immobility compromises the respiratory system by causing pooling and stasis of secretions in dependent areas and the development of atelectasis. The patient whose fluid intake is restricted may be more vulnerable to atelectasis as a result of inability to expectorate thickened secretions. Pneumonia is frequently seen in neurosurgical patients, possibly related to aspiration and restricted mobility.

The nurse assesses the patient for signs of respiratory infection, which include temperature elevation, increased pulse rate, and changes in respirations, and auscultates the lungs for decreased breath sounds and adventitious sounds.

Repositioning the patient every 2 hours will help to mobilize pulmonary secretions and prevent stasis. When the patient regains consciousness, additional measures to expand collapsed alveoli can be instituted, such as yawning, sighing, deep breathing, incentive spirometry, and coughing (unless contraindicated). If necessary, the oropharynx and trachea are suctioned to remove secretions that cannot be raised by coughing; however, coughing and suctioning increase ICP. Therefore, suctioning should be used cautiously. Increasing the humidity in the oxygen delivery system may help to loosen secretions. The nurse and the respiratory therapist work together to monitor the effects of chest physical therapy.

\section*{MANAGING SENSORY DEPRIVATION}

Periorbital edema is a common consequence of intracranial surgery because fluid drains into the dependent periorbital areas when the patient has been positioned in a prone position during
surgery. A hematoma may form under the scalp and spread down to the orbit, producing an area of ecchymosis (black eye).

Before surgery, the patient and family should be informed that one or both eyes may be edematous temporarily after surgery. After surgery, placing the patient in a head-up position (if not contraindicated) and applying cold compresses over the eyes will help reduce the edema. If periorbital edema increases significantly, the surgeon is notified because it may indicate that a postoperative clot is developing or that there is increasing ICP and poor venous drainage. Health care personnel should announce their presence when entering the room to avoid startling the patient whose vision is impaired due to periorbital edema or neurologic deficits.

Additional factors that can affect sensation include a bulky head dressing, the presence of an endotracheal tube, and effects of increased ICP. The first postoperative dressing change is usually performed by the neurosurgeon. In the absence of bleeding or a CSF leak, every effort is made to minimize the size of the head dressing. If the patient requires an endotracheal tube for mechanical ventilation, every effort is made to extubate the patient as soon as clinical signs indicate it is possible. The patient is monitored closely for the effects of elevated ICP.

\section*{ENHANCING SELF-IMAGE}

The patient is encouraged to verbalize feelings and frustrations about any change in appearance. Nursing support is based on the patient's reactions and feelings. Factual information may need to be provided if the patient has misconceptions about puffiness about the face, periorbital bruising, and hair loss. Attention to grooming, the use of the patient's own clothing, and covering the head with a turban (and ultimately a wig until hair growth occurs) are encouraged. Social interaction with close friends, family, and hospital personnel may increase the patient's sense of self-worth.

As the patient assumes more responsibility for self-care and participates in more activities, a sense of control and personal competence will develop. The family and social support system can be of assistance while the patient recovers from surgery.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Complications that may develop within hours after surgery include increased ICP, bleeding and hypovolemic shock, altered fluid and electrolyte balance (including water intoxication), infection, and seizures. These complications require close collaboration between the nurse and the surgeon.

\section*{Monitoring for Increased ICP and Bleeding}

Increased ICP and bleeding are life-threatening to the patient who has undergone intracranial neurosurgery. The following must be kept in mind when caring for all patients who undergo such surgery:
- An increase in blood pressure and decrease in pulse with respiratory failure may indicate increased ICP.
- An accumulation of blood under the bone flap (extradural, subdural, intracerebral) may pose a threat to life. A clot must be suspected in any patient who does not awaken as expected or whose condition deteriorates. An intracranial hematoma is suspected if the patient has any new postoperative neurologic deficits (especially a dilated pupil on the operative side). In these events, the patient is returned to the operating room immediately for evacuation of the clot if indicated.
- Cerebral edema, infarction, metabolic disturbances, and hydrocephalus are conditions that may mimic the clinical manifestations of a clot.

The patient is monitored closely for indicators of complications, and early signs and trends in clinical status are reported to the surgeon. Treatments are initiated promptly, and the nurse assists in evaluating the response to treatment. The nurse also provides support to the patient and family.

Should signs and symptoms of increased ICP occur, efforts to decrease the ICP are initiated: alignment of the head in a neutral position without flexion to promote venous drainage, elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees, administration of mannitol (an osmotic diuretic), and possible administration of pharmacologic paralyzing agents.

\section*{Managing Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances}

Fluid and electrolyte imbalances may occur because of the patient's underlying condition and its management or as complications of surgery. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can contribute to the development of cerebral edema.

The postoperative fluid regimen depends on the type of neurosurgical procedure and is determined on an individual basis. The volume and composition of fluids are adjusted according to daily serum electrolyte values, along with fluid intake and output.

Sodium retention may occur in the immediate postoperative period. Serum and urine electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose, weight, and clinical status are monitored. Intake and output are measured in view of losses associated with fever, respiration, and CSF drainage. Fluids may have to be restricted in patients with cerebral edema.

Oral fluids are usually resumed after the first 24 hours (Hickey, 2003). The presence of gag and swallowing reflexes must be checked before initiation of oral fluids. Some patients with posterior fossa tumors may have impaired swallowing, so fluids may need to be administered by alternative routes. The patient should be observed for signs and symptoms of nausea and vomiting as the diet is progressed (Hickey, 2003).

Patients undergoing surgery for brain tumors often receive large doses of corticosteroids and thus tend to develop hyperglycemia. Therefore, serum glucose levels are measured every 4 hours. These patients are prone to gastric ulcers, and therefore histamine-2 receptor antagonists ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blockers) are prescribed to suppress the secretion of gastric acid. The patient is monitored for bleeding and assessed for gastric pain.

If the surgical site is near, or causes edema to, the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, the patient may develop symptoms of diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by excessive urinary output. The urine specific gravity is measured hourly, and fluid intake and output are monitored. Fluid replacement must compensate for urine output, and serum potassium levels must be monitored.

SIADH, which results in water retention with hyponatremia and serum hypo-osmolality, occurs in a wide variety of central nervous system disorders (brain tumor, head trauma) causing fluid disturbances. Nursing management includes careful intake and output measurements, specific gravity determinations of urine, and monitoring of serum and urine electrolyte studies, while following directives for fluid restriction. SIADH is usually selflimiting.

\section*{Preventing Infection}

The patient undergoing neurosurgery is at risk for infection related to the neurosurgical procedure (brain exposure, bone exposure, wound hematomas) and the presence of intravenous and arterial lines for fluid administration and monitoring. Risk for infection is increased in patients who undergo lengthy intracranial operations and those with external ventricular drains in place longer than 48 to 72 hours.

The incision site is monitored for redness, tenderness, bulging, separation, or foul odor. The dressing is often stained with blood in the immediate postoperative period. It is important to reinforce the dressing with sterile pads so that contamination and infection are avoided. (Blood is an excellent culture medium for bacteria.) If the dressing is heavily stained or displaced, this should be reported immediately. (A drain is sometimes placed in the craniotomy incision to facilitate drainage.)

After suboccipital surgical procedures, CSF may leak through the incision. This complication is dangerous because of the possibility of meningitis. Any sudden discharge of fluid from a cranial incision is reported at once because a massive leak requires direct surgical repair. Attention should be paid to the patient who complains of a salty taste, because this can be due to CSF trickling down the throat. The patient is advised to avoid coughing, sneezing, or nose blowing, which may cause CSF leakage by creating pressure on the operative site.

Aseptic technique is used when handling dressings, drainage systems, and intravenous and arterial lines. The patient is monitored carefully for signs and symptoms of infection, and cultures are obtained from the patient with suspected infection. Appropriate antibiotics are administered as prescribed.

Other causes of infection in the patient undergoing intracranial surgery are similar to those in other postoperative patients: pneumonia and urinary tract infections.

\section*{Monitoring for Seizure Activity}

Seizures and epilepsy may be complications after any intracranial neurosurgical procedure. Preventing seizures is essential to avoid further cerebral edema. Administering the prescribed antiseizure medication before and immediately after surgery may prevent the development of seizures in subsequent months and years. Status
epilepticus (prolonged seizures without recovery of consciousness in the intervals between seizures) may occur after craniotomy and also may be related to the development of complications (hematoma, ischemia). The management of status epilepticus is described later in this chapter.

\section*{Monitoring and Managing Later Complications}

Other complications may occur during the first 2 weeks or later and may threaten the patient's recovery. The most important of these are thromboembolic complications (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), pulmonary and urinary tract infection, and pressure ulcers (Warbel, Lewicki \& Lupica, 1999). Most of these complications may be avoided with frequent changes of position, adequate suctioning of secretions, assessment for pulmonary complications, observation for urinary complications, and skin care.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The recovery at home of a neurosurgical patient depends on the extent of the surgical procedure and its success. The patient's strengths as well as limitations are explained to the family, along with their part in promoting recovery. Because administration of antiseizure medication is a priority, the patient and family are encouraged to use a check-off system to ensure that the medication is taken as prescribed.

Usually no dietary restrictions are required unless another health problem requiring a special diet exists. Although taking a shower or tub bath is permitted, the scalp should be kept dry until all the sutures have been removed. A clean scarf or cap may be worn until a wig or hairpiece is purchased. If skull bone has been removed, the neurosurgeon may suggest a protective helmet. After a craniotomy, the patient may require rehabilitation, depending on the postoperative level of function. The patient may require physical therapy for residual weakness and mobility issues. Occupational therapy is consulted to assist with selfcare issues. If the patient is aphasic, speech therapy may be necessary.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Barring complications, patients are discharged from the hospital as soon as possible. Patients with severe motor deficits require extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation. Those with postoperative cognitive and speech impairments require psychological evaluation, speech therapy, and rehabilitation. The nurse works collaboratively with the physician and other health care professionals during hospitalization and home care to achieve as complete a rehabilitation as possible.

When tumor, injury, or disease makes the prognosis poor, care is directed toward making the patient as comfortable as possible. With return of the tumor or cerebral compression, the patient becomes less alert and aware. Other possible consequences include paralysis, blindness, and seizures. The home care nurse, hospice nurse, and social worker work with the family to plan for additional home health care or hospice services or placement of the patient in an extended-care facility. (See also the section on cerebral metastases in Chap. 65.) The patient and family are encouraged to discuss end-of-life preferences for care; the patient's end-of-life preferences must be respected (see Chap. 17).

The nurse involved in home and continuing care of patients following cranial surgery needs to remind patients and family

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 61-1}

\section*{Suitability of Printed Patient Education Materials}

Murphy, P. W., Chesson, A., Berman, S. A., Arnold, C., \& Gallowat, G. (2001). Neurology patient education materials: do our educational aids fit our patients' needs? Journal of Neuroscience Nursing, 33(2), 99-112.

\section*{Purpose}

Nurses often rely on printed patient education materials to supplement patient teaching. The purpose of the study was to assess the suitability of neurology patient education brochures and related information available on the Internet to determine their appropriateness for patients with low literacy skills.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, the reading levels of patients and patient education materials were assessed. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine tool was used to evaluate a convenience sample of 520 neurology patients. Forty-three patient education materials - 35 brochures produced by national organizations and 8 electronic documents from various Internet sourceswere assessed using the Fog Index and the Suitability Assessment of Materials Scale. The mean age of patients was 46 years; $40 \%$ were African American and 59\% Caucasian; $44 \%$ were female; the average educational level was 12th grade, with a mean reading level of 7th to 8th grade.

\section*{Findings}

Patient education materials were classified as not suitable, adequate, or superior for use. Organizations with materials at the suitable level include those of the Epilepsy Foundation of America, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the American Heart Association. The National Stroke Association, the American Academy of Neurology, the American Sleep Medicine, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association had brochures in the adequate range. Overall, only $14 \%$ of the materials were considered to have superior suitability, whereas $58 \%$ were adequate; $28 \%$ were determined not suitable. Of the materials available from the Internet, $88 \%$ were not suitable. The authors concluded that readily available neurology patient education aids are not matched to the patient population or to the average reading levels of patients.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses should keep in mind that the brochures evaluated in this study represent primarily those available at national meetings and a small sample of those available on the Internet. The study reinforces that there is a need to consider the reading level of the patient when distributing printed material. The last grade attended in school may not reflect reading ability. Nurses should consider modifying existing materials or developing new materials with attention to instructional graphics, simpler words, patient interaction, and cultural sensitivity.

\section*{TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY}

Tumors within the sella turcica and small adenomas of the pituitary can be removed through a transsphenoidal approach: an incision is made beneath the upper lip and entry is then gained successively into the nasal cavity, sphenoidal sinus, and sella turcica (see Table 61-3). Although an otorhinolaryngologist may make the initial opening, the neurosurgeon completes the opening into the sphenoidal sinus and exposes the floor of the sella. Microsurgical techniques provide improved illumination, magnification, and visualization so that nearby vital structures can be avoided.

The transsphenoidal approach offers direct access to the sella with minimal risk of trauma and hemorrhage (Greenberg, 2001). It avoids many of the risks of craniotomy, and the postoperative discomfort is similar to that of other transnasal surgical procedures. It may also be used for pituitary ablation (removal) in patients with disseminated breast or prostatic cancer.

\section*{Complications}

Manipulation of the posterior pituitary gland during surgery may produce transient diabetes insipidus of several days' duration (Greenberg, 2001). It is treated with vasopressin but occasionally persists. Other complications include CSF leakage, visual disturbances, postoperative meningitis, and SIADH.

\section*{Preoperative Evaluation}

The preoperative workup includes a series of endocrine tests, rhinologic evaluation (to assess the status of the sinuses and nasal cavity), and neuroradiologic studies. Funduscopic examination and visual field determinations are performed, because the most serious effect of pituitary tumor is localized pressure on the optic nerve or chiasm. In addition, the nasopharyngeal secretions are cultured because a sinus infection is a contraindication to an intracranial procedure through this approach. Corticosteroids may be administered before and after surgery (because the surgery involves removal of the pituitary, the source of adrenocorticotropic hormone $[\mathrm{ACTH}]$ is removed). Antibiotics may or may not be administered prophylactically (Greenberg, 2001).

Deep breathing is taught before surgery. The patient is instructed that following the surgery he or she will need to avoid vigorous coughing, blowing the nose, sucking through a straw, or sneezing, because these actions may cause a CSF leak (Greenberg, 2001; Hickey, 2003).

\section*{Postoperative Management}

Because the procedure disrupts the oral and nasal mucous membranes, management focuses on preventing infection and promoting healing. Medications include antimicrobial agents (which are continued until the nasal packing inserted at the time of surgery is removed), corticosteroids, analgesic agents for discomfort, and agents for the control of diabetes insipidus when necessary (Greenberg, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Vital signs are measured to monitor hemodynamic, cardiac, and ventilatory status (Eisenberg \& Redick, 1998). Because of the anatomic proximity of the pituitary gland to the optic chiasm, visual acuity is assessed at regular intervals. One method is to ask the patient to count the number of fingers held up by the nurse. Evidence of decreasing visual acuity suggests an expanding hematoma.

The head of the bed is raised to decrease pressure on the sella turcica and to promote normal drainage. The patient is cautioned against blowing the nose or engaging in any activity that raises ICP, such as bending over or straining during urination or defecation.

Intake and output are measured as a guide to fluid and electrolyte replacement. The urine specific gravity is measured after each voiding (Greenberg, 2001). Daily weight is monitored. Fluids are generally given when nausea ceases, and the patient then progresses to a regular diet.

The nasal packing inserted during surgery is checked frequently for blood or CSF drainage. The major discomfort is related to the nasal packing and to mouth dryness and thirst from mouth-breathing. Oral care is provided every 4 hours or more frequently. Usually, the teeth are not brushed until the incision above the teeth has healed. The use of warm saline mouth rinses and a cool mist vaporizer is helpful. Petrolatum is soothing when applied to the lips. A room humidifier assists in keeping the mucous membranes moist. The packing is removed in 3 to 4 days, and only then can the area around the nares be cleaned with the prescribed solution to remove crusted blood and moisten the mucous membranes (Hickey, 2003).

Home care considerations include advising the patient to use a room humidifier to keep the mucous membranes moist and to soothe irritation. The head of the bed is elevated for at least 2 weeks after surgery.

\section*{Seizure Disorders}

\section*{SEIZURES}

Seizures are episodes of abnormal motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic activity (or a combination of these) resulting from sudden excessive discharge from cerebral neurons (Greenberg, 2001; Hickey, 2003). A part or all of the brain may be involved. The international classification of seizures differentiates between two main types: partial seizures that begin in one part of the brain, and generalized seizures that involve electrical discharges in the whole brain (Chart 61-3). Most seizures are sudden and transient.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-371.jpg?height=1019&width=861&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=112)

The underlying cause is an electrical disturbance (dysrhythmia) in the nerve cells in one section of the brain, causing them to emit abnormal, recurring, uncontrolled electrical discharges. The characteristic seizure is a manifestation of this excessive neuronal discharge. There may be associated loss of consciousness, excess movement or loss of muscle tone or movement, and disturbances of behavior, mood, sensation, and perception.

The specific causes of seizures are varied and can be categorized as idiopathic (genetic, developmental defects) and acquired. Among the causes of acquired seizures are hypoxemia of any cause, including vascular insufficiency, fever (childhood), head injury, hypertension, central nervous system infections, metabolic and toxic conditions (eg, renal failure, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, pesticides), brain tumor, drug and alcohol withdrawal, and allergies (Schumacher, Pruitt \& Phillips, 2000). Cerebrovascular disease is the leading cause of seizures in the elderly (Berges, Moulin, Berger et al., 2000).

\section*{Nursing Management During a Seizure}

A major responsibility of the nurse is to observe and record the sequence of symptoms. The nature of the seizure usually indicates the type of treatment that is required (Wulf, 2000). Before and during a seizure, the following are assessed and documented:
- The circumstances before the seizure (visual, auditory, or olfactory stimuli, tactile stimuli, emotional or psychological disturbances, sleep, hyperventilation)
- The occurrence of an aura (visual, auditory, or olfactory)
- The first thing the patient does in a seizure-where the movements or the stiffness starts, conjugate gaze position, and the position of the head at the beginning of the seizure. This information gives clues to the location of the seizure origin in the brain. (In recording, it is important to state whether the beginning of the seizure was observed.)
- The type of movements in the part of the body involved
- The areas of the body involved (turn back bedding to expose patient)
- The size of both pupils. Are the eyes open? Did the eyes or head turn to one side?
- The presence or absence of automatisms (involuntary motor activity, such as lip smacking or repeated swallowing)
- Incontinence of urine or stool
- Duration of each phase of the seizure
- Unconsciousness, if present, and its duration
- Any obvious paralysis or weakness of arms or legs after the seizure
- Inability to speak after the seizure
- Movements at the end of the seizure
- Whether or not the patient sleeps afterward
- Cognitive status (confused or not confused) after the seizure

In addition to providing data about the seizure, nursing care is directed at preventing injury and supporting the patient. This includes supporting the patient not only physically but also psychologically. Consequences such as distress, embarrassment, fatigue, and depression can be devastating to the patient (Buelow, 2001 ). Steps to prevent or minimize injury to the patient are presented in Chart 61-4.

\section*{Nursing Management After a Seizure}

After a patient has a seizure, the nurse's role is to document the events leading to and occurring during the seizure and to prevent complications (eg, aspiration, injury). The patient is at risk for hypoxia, vomiting, and pulmonary aspiration. To prevent complications, the patient is placed in the side-lying position to facilitate drainage of oral secretions and is suctioned, if needed, to maintain a patent airway and prevent aspiration, as described in Chart 61-4. Seizure precautions are maintained, including having available fully functioning suction equipment with a suction catheter and oral airway. The bed is placed in a low position with side rails up and padded if necessary to prevent patient injury. The patient may be drowsy and may wish to sleep after the seizure; he or she may not remember events leading up to the seizure and for a short time thereafter.

\section*{THE EPILEPSIES}

Epilepsy is a group of syndromes characterized by recurring seizures. Epileptic syndromes are classified by specific patterns of clinical features, including age of onset, family history, and seizure type (Schachter, 2001). Types of epilepsies are differentiated by how the seizure activity manifests (see Chart 61-3), the most common syndromes being those with generalized seizures and those with partial-onset seizures. Epilepsy can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary, when the cause is known and the epilepsy is a symptom of another underlying condition such as a brain tumor (Schachter, 2001).

An estimated 2 to 4 million people in the United States have epilepsy ( 1 in 100 adults is affected), and onset occurs before the age of 20 years in greater than $75 \%$ of patients (Schacter, 2001). The improved treatment of cerebrovascular disorders, head injuries, brain tumors, meningitis, and encephalitis has increased the number of patients at risk for seizures following recovery from these conditions (Berges et al., 2000). Also, advances in EEG have aided in the diagnosis of epilepsy. The general public has

\section*{Nursing Care During a Seizure}
- Provide privacy and protect the patient from curious on-lookers. (The patient who has an aura [warning of an impending seizure] may have time to seek a safe, private place.)
- Ease the patient to the floor, if possible.
- Protect the head with a pad to prevent injury (from striking a hard surface).
- Loosen constrictive clothing.
- Push aside any furniture that may injure the patient during the seizure.
- If the patient is in bed, remove pillows and raise side rails.
- If an aura precedes the seizure, insert an oral airway to reduce the possibility of the tongue or cheek being bitten.
- Do not attempt to pry open jaws that are clenched in a spasm to insert anything. Broken teeth and injury to the lips and tongue may result from such an action.
- No attempt should be made to restrain the patient during the seizure because muscular contractions are strong and restraint can produce injury.
- If possible, place the patient on one side with head flexed forward, which allows the tongue to fall forward and facilitates drainage of saliva and mucus. If suction is available, use it if necessary to clear secretions.

\section*{Nursing Care After the Seizure}
- Keep the patient on one side to prevent aspiration. Make sure the airway is patent.
- There is usually a period of confusion after a grand mal seizure.
- A short apneic period may occur during or immediately after a generalized seizure.
- The patient, on awakening, should be reoriented to the environment.
- If the patient becomes agitated after a seizure (postictal), use calm persuasion and gentle restraint.

been educated about epilepsy, which has reduced the stigma associated with it; as a result, more people are willing to acknowledge the diagnosis.

Although there is evidence that susceptibility to some types of epilepsy may be inherited, the cause of seizures in many people is unknown. Epilepsy can follow birth trauma, asphyxia neonato-
rum, head injuries, some infectious diseases (bacterial, viral, parasitic), toxicity (carbon monoxide and lead poisoning), circulatory problems, fever, metabolic and nutritional disorders, and drug or alcohol intoxication (Schachter, 2001). It is also associated with brain tumors, abscesses, and congenital malformations. In most cases of epilepsy, the cause is unknown (idiopathic).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Messages from the body are carried by the neurons (nerve cells) of the brain by means of discharges of electrochemical energy that sweep along them. These impulses occur in bursts whenever a nerve cell has a task to perform. Sometimes, these cells or groups of cells continue firing after a task is finished. During the period of unwanted discharges, parts of the body controlled by the errant cells may perform erratically. Resultant dysfunction ranges from mild to incapacitating and often causes unconsciousness (Greenberg, 2001; Hickey, 2003). When these uncontrolled, abnormal discharges occur repeatedly, a person is said to have an epileptic syndrome (Schachter, 2001).

Epilepsy is not associated with intellectual level. People with epilepsy without other brain or nervous system disabilities fall within the same intelligence ranges as the overall population. Epilepsy is not synonymous with mental retardation or illness. Many who are developmentally disabled because of serious neurologic damage, however, have epilepsy as well.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Depending on the location of the discharging neurons, seizures may range from a simple staring episode to prolonged convulsive movements with loss of consciousness. Seizures have been classified according to the area of the brain involved and have been identified as partial, generalized, and unclassified (Greenberg, 2001; Hickey, 2003). Partial seizures are focal in origin and affect only part of the brain. Generalized seizures are nonspecific in origin and affect the entire brain simultaneously. Unclassified seizures are so termed because of incomplete data.

The initial pattern of the seizures indicates the region of the brain in which the seizure originates (see Chart 61-2). In simple partial seizures, only a finger or hand may shake, or the mouth may jerk uncontrollably. The person may talk unintelligibly, may be dizzy, and may experience unusual or unpleasant sights, sounds, odors, or tastes, but without loss of consciousness (Greenberg, 2001; Hickey, 2003).

In complex partial seizures, the person either remains motionless or moves automatically but inappropriately for time and place, or may experience excessive emotions of fear, anger, elation, or irritability. Whatever the manifestations, the person does not remember the episode when it is over.

Generalized seizures, previously referred to as grand mal seizures, involve both hemispheres of the brain, causing both sides of the body to react (Greenberg, 2001; Hickey, 2003). There may be intense rigidity of the entire body followed by alternating muscle relaxation and contraction (generalized tonic-clonic contraction). The simultaneous contractions of the diaphragm and chest muscles may produce a characteristic epileptic cry. The tongue is often chewed, and the patient is incontinent of urine and stool. After 1 or 2 minutes, the convulsive movements begin to subside; the patient relaxes and lies in deep coma, breathing noisily. The respirations at this point are chiefly abdominal. In the postictal state (after the seizure), the patient is often confused and hard to arouse and may sleep for hours. Many patients complain of headache, sore muscles, fatigue, and depression (Buelow, 2001).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnostic assessment is aimed at determining the type of seizures, their frequency and severity, and the factors that precipitate them (Schachter, 2001). A developmental history is
taken, including events of pregnancy and childbirth, to seek evidence of preexisting injury. The patient is also questioned about illnesses or head injuries that may have affected the brain. In addition to physical and neurologic evaluations, diagnostic examinations include biochemical, hematologic, and serologic studies. MRI is used to detect lesions in the brain, focal abnormalities, cerebrovascular abnormalities, and cerebral degenerative changes (Schachter, 2001).

The electroencephalogram (EEG) furnishes diagnostic evidence in a substantial proportion of patients with epilepsy and aids in classifying the type of seizure (Schachter, 2001). Abnormalities in the EEG usually continue between seizures or, if not apparent, may be elicited by hyperventilation or during sleep. Microelectrodes can be inserted deep in the brain to probe the action of single brain cells. Some people with seizures have normal EEGs, whereas others who have never had seizures have abnormal EEGs. Telemetry and computerized equipment are used to monitor electrical brain activity while patients pursue their normal activities and to store the readings on computer tapes for analysis. Video recording of seizures taken simultaneously with EEG telemetry is useful in determining the type of seizure as well as its duration and magnitude. This type of intensive monitoring is changing the treatment of severe epilepsy.

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an additional tool sometimes used in the diagnostic workup. It is useful for identifying the epileptogenic zone so that the area in the brain giving rise to seizures can be removed surgically (Huntington, 1999).

\section*{Women With Epilepsy}

More than 1 million American women have epilepsy, and they face particular needs associated with the syndrome (Schachter, Krishnamurthy \& Cantrell, 2000). Women with epilepsy often note an increase in seizure frequency during menses; this has been linked to the increase in sex hormones that alter the excitability of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Women of childbearing age require special care and guidance before, during, and after pregnancy. Many women note a change in the pattern of seizure activity during pregnancy. Fetal malformation has been linked to the use of multiple antiseizure medications (Karch, 2002). The effectiveness of contraceptives is decreased by antiseizure medications. Therefore, patients should be encouraged to discuss family planning with their primary health care provider and to obtain preconception counseling if they are considering childbearing (Liporace, 1997).

Because of bone loss associated with the long-term use of antiseizure medications, patients receiving antiseizure agents should be assessed for low bone mass and osteoporosis. They should be instructed about other strategies to reduce their risks for osteoporosis.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly people have a high incidence of new-onset epilepsy (Schachter, 2001). Increased incidence is associated with stroke, head injury, dementia, infection, alcoholism, and aging. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Because many elderly people have chronic health problems, they may be taking other medications that can interact with medications prescribed for seizure control. In addition, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of medications are altered in the elderly as a result of age-related changes in renal and liver function. There-
fore, the elderly must be monitored closely for adverse and toxic effects of antiseizure medications and for osteoporosis. The cost of antiseizure medications can lead to poor adherence to the prescribed regimen in elderly patients on fixed incomes.

\section*{Prevention}

Society-wide efforts are the key to the prevention of epilepsy. The risk for congenital fetal anomaly is two to three times higher in mothers with epilepsy. The effects of maternal seizures, antiseizure medications, and genetic predisposition are all mechanisms that contribute to possible malformation. Because the unborn infants of mothers who take certain antiseizure medications for epilepsy are at risk, these women need careful monitoring, including blood studies to detect the level of antiseizure medications taken throughout pregnancy (Karch, 2002). High-risk mothers (teenagers, women with histories of difficult deliveries, drug use, patients with diabetes or hypertension) should be identified and monitored closely during pregnancy because damage to the fetus during pregnancy and delivery may increase the risk for epilepsy. All of these issues need further study (Schachter, Krishnamurthy \& Cantrell, 2000).

Head injury is one of the main causes of epilepsy that can be prevented. Through highway safety programs and occupational safety precautions, lives can be saved and epilepsy due to head injury prevented; these programs are discussed in Chapter 63.

\section*{Medical Management}

The management of epilepsy is individualized to meet the needs of each patient and not just to manage and prevent seizures. Management differs from patient to patient because some forms of epilepsy arise from brain damage and others are due to altered brain chemistry.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Many medications are available to control seizures, although the mechanisms of their actions are still unknown (Karch, 2002). The objective is to achieve seizure control with minimal side effects. Medication therapy controls rather than cures seizures. Medications are selected on the basis of the type of seizure being treated and the effectiveness and safety of the medications (Shafer, 1999a, 1999b; Winkelman, 1999). If properly prescribed and taken, medications control seizures in 50\% to 60\% of patients with recurring seizures and provide partial control in another $15 \%$ to $35 \%$. The condition is not improved by any available medication in 20\% and 35\% of patients with generalized and partial epilepsy, respectively (Devinsky, 1999).

Treatment is usually started with a single medication. The starting dose and the rate at which the dosage is increased depend on the occurrence of side effects. The medication levels in the blood are monitored because the rate of drug absorption varies among patients. Changing to another medication may be necessary if seizure control is not achieved or if toxicity makes it impossible to increase the dosage. The medication may need to be adjusted because of concurrent illness, weight changes, or increases in stress. Sudden withdrawal of these medications can cause seizures to occur with greater frequency or can precipitate the development of status epilepticus (Greenberg, 2001).

Side effects of antiseizure agents may be divided into three groups: (1) idiosyncratic or allergic disorders, which present primarily as skin reactions; (2) acute toxicity, which may occur when
the medication is initially prescribed; or (3) chronic toxicity, which occurs late in the course of therapy.

The manifestations of drug toxicity are variable, and any organ system may be involved. Gingival hyperplasia (swollen and tender gums) can be associated with long-term use of phenytoin (Dilantin), for example (Karch, 2002). Periodic physical and dental examinations and laboratory tests are performed for patients receiving medications known to have hematopoietic, genitourinary, or hepatic effects. Table 61-4 lists the medications in current use.

> NURSING ALERT Nurses must take care when administering lamotrigine (Lamictal), an antiseizure medication. The drug packaging was recently changed in an attempt to reduce medication errors as this medication has been confused with terbinafine (Lamisil), labetalol hydrochloride (Trandate), lamivudine (Epivir), maprotiline (Ludiomil), as well as the combination diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil). Any patient given an incorrect medication may suffer adverse effects, and patients with epilepsy are at risk for status epilepticus from having their medication regimen interrupted (Vernarec, 2001).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgery is indicated for patients whose epilepsy results from intracranial tumors, abscess, cysts, or vascular anomalies. Some patients have intractable seizure disorders that do not respond to medication. There may be a focal atrophic process secondary to trauma, inflammation, stroke, or anoxia. If the seizures originate in a reasonably well-circumscribed area of the brain that can be excised without producing significant neurologic deficits, the removal of the area generating the seizures may produce long-term control and improvement (Wiebe, Blume, Girvin et al., 2001).

This type of neurosurgery has been aided by several advances, including microsurgical techniques, depth EEGs, improved illumination and hemostasis, and the introduction of neuroleptanalgesic agents (droperidol and fentanyl). These techniques, combined with use of local anesthetic agents, enable the neurosurgeon to perform surgery on an alert and cooperative patient. Using special testing devices, electrocortical mapping, and the patient's response to stimulation, the boundaries of the epileptogenic focus are determined (Huntington, 1999). Any abnormal epileptogenic focus (ie, abnormal area of the brain) is then removed (Wiebe et al., 2001).

As an adjunct to medication and surgery in adolescents and adults with partial seizures, a generator may be implanted under the clavicle. The device is connected to the vagus nerve in the cervical area, where it delivers electrical signals to the brain to control and reduce seizure activity (Kennedy \& Schallert, 2001). An external programming system is used by the physician to change stimulator settings. Patients can turn the stimulator on and off with a magnet.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH EPILEPSY}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse elicits information about the seizure history. The patient is asked about the factors or events that may precipitate the seizures. Alcohol intake is documented. The nurse determines if the patient has an aura (a premonitory or warning sensation) before an epileptic seizure, which may indicate the origin of the seizure (eg, seeing a flashing light may indicate the seizure originated in the occipital lobe). Observation and assessment during

and after a seizure assist in identifying the type of seizure and its management.

The effects of epilepsy on the patient's lifestyle are assessed (Buelow, 2001). What limitations are imposed by the seizure disorder? Does the patient have a recreational program? Social contacts? Is the patient working, and is it a positive or stressful experience? What coping mechanisms are used?

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Risk for injury related to seizure activity
- Fear related to the possibility of seizures
- Ineffective individual coping related to stresses imposed by epilepsy
- Deficient knowledge related to epilepsy and its control

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The major potential complication of patients with epilepsy is as follows:
- Status epilepticus

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include prevention of injury, control of seizures, achievement of a satisfactory psychosocial adjustment, acquisition of knowledge and understanding about the condition, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PREVENTING INJURY}

Injury prevention for the patient with seizures is a priority. If at risk for injury (depending on the seizure type), the patient should be placed on the floor and any obstructive items should be removed. The patient should never be forced into a position, nor should anyone attempt to insert anything into the patient's mouth once a seizure has begun. Patients on seizure precautions should have pads applied to side rails while in bed.

\section*{REDUCING FEAR OF SEIZURES}

Fear that a seizure may occur unexpectedly can be reduced by the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Cooperation of the patient and family and their trust in the prescribed regimen are essential for control of seizures (Schachter, 2001). It should be emphasized that the prescribed antiseizure medication must be taken on a continuing basis without fear of drug dependence or addiction. Periodic monitoring is necessary to ensure the adequacy of the treatment regimen and to prevent side effects.

In an effort to control seizures, factors that may precipitate them are identified: emotional disturbances, new environmental stressors, onset of menstruation in female patients, or fever (Greenberg, 2001). The patient is encouraged to follow a regular and moderate routine in lifestyle, diet (avoiding excessive stimulants), exercise, and rest (sleep deprivation may lower the seizure threshold). Moderate activity is therapeutic, but excessive exercise should be avoided.

Photic stimulation (bright flickering lights, television viewing) may precipitate seizures; wearing dark glasses or covering one eye may be preventive. Tension states (anxiety, frustration) induce

Wulf, J. A. (2000). Evaluation of seizure observation and documentation. Journal of Neuroscience Nursing, 32(1), 27-36.

\section*{Purpose}

The observation and documentation of seizure activity are challenging yet essential aspects of nursing assessment. Despite their importance, there is a wide variability in nursing observation and documentation skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how demographic characteristics and knowledge levels of staff affected seizure documentation skills.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This descriptive study included 58 participants: 38 RNs, 17 certified nursing assistants, and 3 licensed practical nurses or recreational therapists employed at a hospital with an epilepsy center. All participants had received mandatory seizure observation training within the 2 years preceding the study. Participants observed and documented the same six videotaped seizure events in a randomly ordered sequence over 4 to 6 weeks. Participants used an event record form with observational guidelines similar to those used in the clinical setting. Two raters evaluated and scored the seizure event records, rating each record for detail and quality.

\section*{Findings}

Seizure event ratings did not vary significantly according to observer characteristics of educational level, employment position, years of employment, or clinical experience with epilepsy. Certified nursing assistants with clinical experience with epilepsy had significantly higher mean seizure rating scores (indicating higher quality and detail) compared to nursing assistants without experience ( $p<0.01$ ). There were no differences in RNs with and without experience. A master score sheet was developed for each seizure event, and seizures with excess motor activity as an attribute had the highest scores, indicating that a greater number of details about the seizure were observed compared to the master score sheet. Participants missed some details of the seizure events and also documented details not present on the videotapes, such as seizure classification. Opportunities to review videotapes or actual seizures periodically improved observation and documentation skills.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings of this study suggest that use of a videotape of seizures and a scoring tool is useful for initial training and certification and may assist in periodic retraining of all personnel responsible for seizure observation to maintain quality of observation and documentation. Nurses involved in teaching these skills should keep in mind that observation instruction should emphasize not only predominate seizure features such as motor movements but also less frequently made observations such as responsiveness that may assist in seizure classification. Nurses observing and documenting seizure activity should be cautioned not to include items such as seizure classification that are not direct observations and may be incorrect.
seizures in some patients. Classes in stress management may be of value. Because seizures are known to occur with alcohol intake, alcoholic beverages should be avoided.

\section*{IMPROVING COPING MECHANISMS}

It has been noted that the social, psychological, and behavioral problems frequently accompanying epilepsy can be more of a handicap than the actual seizures. Epilepsy may be accompanied by feelings of stigmatization, alienation, depression, and uncer-
tainty. The patient must cope with the constant fear of a seizure and its consequences (Buelow, 2001). Children with epilepsy may be ostracized and excluded from school and peer activities. These problems are compounded during adolescence and add to the challenges of dating, not being able to drive, and feeling different. Adults face these problems in addition to the burden of finding employment, concerns about relationships and childbearing, insurance problems, and legal barriers. Alcohol abuse may complicate matters. Family reactions may vary from outright rejection of the person with epilepsy to overprotection. As a result, many people with epilepsy have psychological and behavioral problems.

Counseling assists the individual and family to understand the condition and the limitations imposed by it. Social and recreational opportunities are necessary for good mental health. Nurses can improve the quality of life for patients with epilepsy by educating them and their families about symptoms and their management (Rice, 2000).

\section*{PROVIDING PATIENT AND FAMILY EDUCATION}

Of all the care contributed by the nurse to the person with epilepsy, perhaps the most valuable facets are education and efforts to modify the attitudes of the patient and family toward the disorder. The person who experiences seizures may consider every seizure a potential source of humiliation and shame. This may result in anxiety, depression, hostility, and secrecy on the part of the patient and family. Ongoing education and encouragement should be given to patients to enable them to overcome these feelings. The patient with epilepsy should carry an emergency medical identification card or wear a medical information bracelet. The patient and family need to be educated about medications as well as care during a seizure.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Status epilepticus, the major complication, is described below. Another complication is the toxicity of medications. The patient and family are instructed about side effects and are given specific guidelines to assess and report signs and symptoms indicating medication overdose. Many antiseizure medications require careful monitoring for therapeutic levels. Patients should plan to have serum drug levels drawn at regular intervals. There are also many known drug interactions with antiseizure medications. A complete pharmacologic profile should be reviewed with the patient to avoid interactions either potentiating or inhibiting the effectiveness of the medications.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Thorough oral hygiene after each meal, gum massage, daily flossing, and regular dental care are essential to prevent or control gingival hyperplasia in patients receiving phenytoin (Dilantin). The patient is also instructed to inform all health care providers of the medication being taken because of the possibility of drug interactions. An individualized comprehensive teaching plan is needed to assist the patient and family to adjust to this chronic disorder (Shafer, 1999). Written patient education materials must be appropriate for the patient's reading level (Murphy, Chesson, Berman et al., 2001). See Chart 61-5 for home care instruction points.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Because epilepsy is a long-term disorder, the use of costly medications may create a significant financial burden. The Epilepsy Foundation of America offers a mail-order program to provide
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-377.jpg?height=987&width=1780&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=109)
medications at minimal cost and access to life insurance. This organization serves as a referral source for special services for people with epilepsy.

For many, overcoming employment problems is a challenge. State vocational rehabilitation agencies can provide information about job training. The Epilepsy Foundation of America has a training and placement service. If seizures are not well controlled, information about sheltered workshops or home employment programs may also be obtained. Federal and state agencies and federal legislation may be of assistance to people with epilepsy who experience job discrimination. As a result of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the number of employers who knowingly hire people with epilepsy may be increasing, but barriers to employment still exist (Buelow, 2001).

People who have uncontrollable seizures accompanied by psychological and social difficulties can be referred to comprehensive epilepsy centers where continuous audio-video and EEG monitoring, specialized treatment, and rehabilitation services are available (Schachter, 2001). Patients and their families need to be reminded of the importance of following the prescribed treatment regimen and keeping follow-up appointments. In addition, they are reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screenings to promote a healthy lifestyle. Genetic and preconception counseling is advised.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

\section*{Expected patient outcomes may include:}
1. Sustains no injury during seizure activity
a. Complies with treatment regimen and identifies the hazards of stopping the medication
b. Patient and family can identify appropriate care during seizure
2. Exhibits decreased fear
3. Displays effective individual coping
4. Exhibits knowledge and understanding of epilepsy
a. Identifies the side effects of medications
b. Avoids factors or situations that may precipitate seizures (flickering lights, hyperventilation, alcohol)
c. Follows a healthy lifestyle by getting adequate sleep and eating meals at regular times to avoid hypoglycemia
5. Absence of complications

\section*{STATUS EPILEPTICUS}

Status epilepticus (acute prolonged seizure activity) is a series of generalized seizures that occur without full recovery of consciousness between attacks (Greenberg, 2001). The term has been broadened to include continuous clinical or electrical seizures lasting at least 30 minutes, even without impairment of consciousness. It is considered a medical emergency. Status epilepticus produces cumulative effects. Vigorous muscular contractions impose a heavy metabolic demand and can interfere with respirations. There is some respiratory arrest at the height of each seizure that produces venous congestion and hypoxia of the brain. Repeated episodes of cerebral anoxia and edema may lead to irreversible and fatal brain damage. Factors that precipitate status epilepticus include withdrawal of antiseizure medication, fever, and concurrent infection.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of treatment are to stop the seizures as quickly as possible, to ensure adequate cerebral oxygenation, and to maintain the patient in a seizure-free state. An airway and adequate oxygenation are established. If the patient remains unconscious and unresponsive, a cuffed endotracheal tube is inserted. Intravenous diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), or fosphenytoin (Cere-
byx) is given slowly in an attempt to halt seizures immediately. Other medications (phenytoin, phenobarbital) are given later to maintain a seizure-free state.

An intravenous line is established, and blood samples are obtained to monitor serum electrolytes, glucose, and phenytoin levels (Greenberg, 2001). EEG monitoring may be useful in determining the nature of the seizure activity. Vital signs and neurologic signs are monitored on a continuing basis. An intravenous infusion of dextrose is given if the seizure is due to hypoglycemia. If initial treatment is unsuccessful, general anesthesia with a short-acting barbiturate may be used. The serum concentration of the antiseizure medication is measured because a low level suggests that the patient was not taking the medication or that the dosage was too low. Cardiac involvement or respiratory depression may be life-threatening. There is also the potential for postictal cerebral edema.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse initiates ongoing assessment and monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function because of the risk for delayed depression of respiration and blood pressure secondary to administration of antiseizure medications and sedatives to halt the seizures. Nursing assessment also includes monitoring and documenting the seizure activity and the patient's responsiveness.

The patient is turned to a side-lying position if possible to assist in draining pharyngeal secretions. Suction equipment must be available because of the risk for aspiration. The intravenous line is closely monitored because it may become dislodged during seizures.

A person who has received long-term antiseizure therapy has a significant risk for fractures resulting from bone disease (osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and hyperparathyroidism), a side effect of therapy. Thus, during seizures, the patient should be protected from injury using seizure precautions and monitored closely. No effort should be made to restrain movements. The patient having seizures can inadvertently injure nearby people, so nurses should protect themselves. Other nursing interventions for the person having seizures are presented in Chart 61-4.

\section*{Headache}

Headache, or cephalgia, is one of the most common of all human physical complaints. Headache is actually a symptom rather than a disease entity; it may indicate organic disease (neurologic or other disease), a stress response, vasodilation (migraine), skeletal muscle tension (tension headache), or a combination of factors. A primary headache is one for which no organic cause can be identified. These types of headache include migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches (Lin, 2001). Cranial arteritis is another common cause of headache. A classification of headaches was issued by the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society in 1988; an abbreviated list is shown in Chart 61-6.

Migraine is a symptom complex characterized by periodic and recurrent attacks of severe headache. The cause of migraine has not been clearly demonstrated, but it is primarily a vascular disturbance that occurs more commonly in women and has a strong familial tendency. The typical time of onset is puberty, and the incidence is highest in adults 20 to 35 years of age. There are seven subtypes of migraine, including migraine with and without aura. Most patients have migraine without an aura.

Tension headaches tend to be more chronic than severe and are probably the most common type of headache. Cluster headaches are a severe form of vascular headache. They are seen five times more frequently in men than women (Greenberg, 2001).

Inflammation of the cranial arteries is characterized by a severe headache localized in the region of the temporal arteries. The inflammation may be generalized (in which cranial arteritis is part of a vascular disease) or focal (in which only the cranial arteries are involved). Cranial arteritis is a cause of headache in the older population, reaching its greatest incidence in those older than 70 years of age.

A secondary headache is a symptom associated with an organic cause, such as a brain tumor or an aneurysm. Most headaches do not indicate serious disease, although persistent headaches require further investigation. Serious disorders related to headache include brain tumors, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, severe hypertension, meningitis, and head injuries.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation}

The diagnostic evaluation includes a detailed history, a physical assessment of the head and neck, and a complete neurologic examination. Headaches may manifest differently within an individual over the course of a lifetime, and the same type of headache may present differently from patient to patient. The health history focuses on assessing the headache itself, with emphasis on the factors that precipitate or provoke it. Patients are asked to describe headaches in their own words.

Because headache is often the presenting symptom of various physiologic and psychological disturbances, a general health history is an essential component of the patient database. Headache may be a symptom of endocrine, hematologic, gastrointestinal, infectious, renal, cardiovascular, or psychiatric disease. Therefore, questions addressed in the health history should cover major medical and surgical illness as well as a body systems review.

The medication history can provide insight into the patient's overall health status. Antihypertensive agents, diuretic medications, anti-inflammatory agents, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are a few of the categories of medications that can provoke headaches. Although sometimes exaggerated in importance, emotional factors can play a role in precipitating headaches. Stress is thought to be a major initiating factor in migraine headaches; therefore, sleep patterns, level of stress, recreational interests,
appetite, emotional problems, and family stressors are relevant (Cunningham, 2000). There is a strong familial tendency for headache disorders, and a positive family history may help in making a diagnosis.

A direct relationship may exist between exposure to toxic substances and headache. Careful questioning may uncover chemicals to which a worker has been exposed. Under the Right to Know law, employees have access to the material safety data sheets (commonly referred to as MSDSs) for all the substances with which they come in contact in the workplace. The occupational history also includes assessment of the workplace as a possible source of stress and a possible ergonomic basis for muscle strain and headache.

A complete description of the headache itself is crucial. The age at onset of headache; the headache's frequency, location, and duration; the type of pain; factors that relieve and precipitate the event; and associated symptoms are reviewed. The data obtained should include the patient's own words about the headache in response to the following questions:
-What is the location? Is it unilateral or bilateral? Does it radiate?
- What is the quality-dull, aching, steady, boring, burning, intermittent, continuous, paroxysmal?
- How many headaches occur during a given time?
- What are the precipitating factors, if any (environmental, such as sunlight and weather change; foods; exertion; other)?
- What makes the headache worse (coughing, straining)?
- What time (day or night) does it occur?
- Are there any associated symptoms, such as facial pain, lacrimation (excessive tearing), or scotomas (blind spots in the field of vision)?
- What usually relieves the headache (aspirin, NSAIDs, ergot preparation, food, heat, rest, neck massage)?
- Does nausea, vomiting, weakness, or numbness in the extremities accompany the headache?
- Does the headache interfere with daily activities?
- Do you have any allergies?
- Do you have insomnia, poor appetite, loss of energy?
- Is there a family history of headache?
- What is the relationship of the headache to lifestyle or physical or emotional stress?
-What medications are you taking?
Diagnostic testing is often not helpful in the investigation of headache as there are often few objective findings. In patients who demonstrate abnormalities on the neurologic examination, CT, cerebral angiography, or MRI may be used to detect underlying causes, such as tumor or aneurysm. Electromyography (EMG) may reveal a sustained contraction of the neck, scalp, or facial muscles. Laboratory tests may include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, and thyroid hormone levels.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The cerebral signs and symptoms of migraine result from dysfunction of the brain stem pathways that normally modulate sensory input (Goadsby, Lipton \& Ferrari, 2002). Abnormal metabolism of serotonin, a vasoactive neurotransmitter found in platelets and cells of the brain, plays a major role. The headache is preceded by a rise in plasma serotonin, which dilates the cerebral vessels, but migraines are more than just vascular headaches. The
exact mechanism of pain in migraine is not completely understood but is thought to be related to the cranial blood vessels, the innervation of the vessels, and the reflex connections in the brain stem.

Migraines can be triggered by menstrual cycles, bright lights, stress, depression, sleep deprivation, fatigue, overuse of certain medications, and certain foods containing tyramine, monosodium glutamate, nitrites, or milk products. Foods in these categories include aged cheese and many processed foods. Use of oral contraceptives may be associated with increased frequency and severity of attacks in some women.

Emotional or physical stress may cause contraction of the muscles in the neck and scalp, resulting in tension headache. The pathophysiology of cluster headache is not fully understood. One theory is that it is due to dilation of orbital and nearby extracranial arteries. Cranial arteritis is thought to represent an immune vasculitis in which immune complexes are deposited within the walls of affected blood vessels, producing vascular injury and inflammation. A biopsy may be performed on the involved artery to make the diagnosis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

\section*{MIGRAINE}

The migraine with aura can be divided into four phases: prodrome, aura, the headache, and recovery (headache termination and postdrome).

Prodrome. The prodrome phase is experienced by $60 \%$ of patients with symptoms that occur hours to days before a migraine headache. Symptoms include depression, irritability, feeling cold, food cravings, anorexia, change in activity level, increased urination, diarrhea, or constipation. Patients usually experience the same prodrome with each migraine headache.

Aura Phase. Aura occurs in up to $31 \%$ of patients who have migraines (Goadsby et al., 2002). The aura usually lasts less than an hour and may provide enough time for the patient to take the prescribed medication to avert a full-blown attack (described in a later section). This period is characterized by focal neurologic symptoms. Visual disturbances (ie, light flashes and bright spots) are common and may be hemianopic (affecting only half of the visual field). Other symptoms that may follow include numbness and tingling of the lips, face, or hands; mild confusion; slight weakness of an extremity; drowsiness; and dizziness.

This period of aura corresponds to the painless vasoconstriction that is the initial physiologic change characteristic of classic migraine. Cerebral blood flow studies performed during migraine headaches demonstrate that during all phases of the attack, cerebral blood flow is reduced throughout the brain, with subsequent loss of autoregulation and impaired $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ responsiveness.

Headache Phase. As vasodilation and a decline in serotonin levels occur, a throbbing headache (unilateral in $60 \%$ of patients) intensifies over several hours. This headache is severe and incapacitating and is often associated with photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Its duration varies, ranging from 4 to 72 hours (Goadsby et al., 2002).

Recovery Phase. In the recovery phase (termination and postdrome), the pain gradually subsides. Muscle contraction in the neck and scalp is common, with associated muscle ache and localized tenderness, exhaustion, and mood changes. Any physical exertion exacerbates the headache pain. During this postheadache phase, patients may sleep for extended periods.

\section*{OTHER HEADACHE TYPES}

The tension headache is characterized by a steady, constant feeling of pressure that usually begins in the forehead, temple, or back of the neck. It is often bandlike or may be described as "a weight on top of my head."

Cluster headaches are unilateral and come in clusters of one to eight daily, with excruciating pain localized to the eye and orbit and radiating to the facial and temporal regions. The pain is accompanied by watering of the eye and nasal congestion. Each attack lasts 30 to 90 minutes and may have a crescendo-decrescendo pattern (Greenberg, 2001). The headache is often described as penetrating and steady.

Cranial arteritis often begins with general manifestations, such as fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and fever. Clinical manifestations associated with inflammation (heat, redness, swelling, tenderness, or pain over the involved artery) usually are present. Sometimes a tender, swollen, or nodular temporal artery is visible. Visual problems are caused by ischemia of the involved structures.

\section*{Prevention}

Prevention begins by having the patient avoid specific triggers that are known to initiate the headache syndrome. Preventive medical management of migraine involves the daily use of one or more agents that are thought to block the physiologic events leading to an attack. Medication therapy should be considered for migraine if attacks occur 3 to 4 days per month (Goadsby et al., 2002). Treatment regimens vary greatly, as do patient responses; thus, close monitoring is indicated.

There are several proven or widely used medications for the prevention of migraine. Two beta-blocking agents, propranolol (Inderal) and metoprolol (Lopressor), inhibit the action of beta-receptors-cells in the heart and brain that control the dilation of blood vessels. This is thought to be a major reason for their antimigraine action. Other medications that are prescribed for migraine prevention include amitriptyline hydrochloride (Elavil), divalproex (Valproate), flunarizine, and several serotonin antagonists (Goadsby et al., 2002).

Calcium antagonists (verapamil HCl ) are widely used but may require several weeks at a therapeutic dosage before improvement is noted. Calcium-channel blockers are not as effective as betablockers for prevention but may be more appropriate for some patients, such as those with bradycardia, diabetes mellitus, or asthma (Goadsby et al., 2002).

Alcohol, nitrites, vasodilators, and histamines may precipitate cluster headaches. Eliminating these factors helps in preventing the headaches (Silberstein \& Rosenberg, 2000). Prophylactic medication therapy may include beta-blockers, ergotamine tartrate (occasionally), lithium, naproxen (Naprosyn), and methysergide (Sansert); such therapy is effective in 20\% to 40\% of cases (Greenberg, 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Therapy for migraine headache is divided into abortive (symptomatic) and preventive approaches. The abortive approach, best employed in patients who suffer less frequent attacks, is aimed at relieving or limiting a headache at the onset or while it is in progress. The preventive approach is used in patients who experience more frequent attacks at regular or predictable intervals and may have medical conditions that preclude the use of abortive therapies (Evans \& Lipton, 2001).

The triptans, serotonin receptor agonists, are the most specific antimigraine agents available. These agents cause vasoconstric-
tion, reduce inflammation, and may reduce pain transmission. The five triptans in routine clinical use include sumatriptan (Imitrex), naratriptan (Amerge), rizatriptan (Maxalt), zolmitriptan (Zomig), and almotriptan (Goadsby et al., 2002). Numerous serotonin receptor agonists are under study.

Ergotamine preparations (taken orally, sublingually, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, by rectum, or by inhalation) may be effective in aborting the headache if taken early in the migraine process. They are low in cost. Ergotamine tartrate acts on smooth muscle, causing prolonged constriction of the cranial blood vessels. Each patient's dosage is based on individual needs. Side effects include aching muscles, paresthesias (numbness and tingling), nausea, and vomiting. Cafergot, a combination of ergotamine and caffeine, can arrest or reduce the severity of the headache if taken at the first sign of an attack (Karch, 2002).

Perhaps the most widely used triptan is sumatriptan succinate (Imitrex); it is available in oral, intranasal, and subcutaneous preparations and is effective for the treatment of acute migraine and cluster headaches in adults (McAlhany, 2001). The subcutaneous form usually relieves symptoms within an hour and is available in an autoinjector for immediate patient use, although it is expensive in this form. Sumatriptan has been found to be effective in relieving moderate to severe migraines in a large number of adult patients. Sumatriptan may cause chest pain and is contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease (Goadsby et al., 2002). Careful administration and dosing instructions to patients are important to prevent adverse reactions such as increased blood pressure, drowsiness, muscle pain, sweating, and anxiety. There are possible interactions when taken in conjunction with St. John's wort (Karch, 2002).

Many of the triptan medications are available in a variety of formulations, such as nasal sprays, inhalers, suppositories, or injections; however, $80 \%$ of patients prefer the oral formulations (Goadsby et al., 2002). None of these medications should be taken concurrently with medications containing ergotamine due to the potential for a prolonged vasoactive reaction (Karch, 2002).

The medical management of an acute attack of cluster headaches may include $100 \%$ oxygen by face mask for 15 minutes, ergotamine tartrate, sumatriptan, steroids, or a percutaneous sphenopalatine ganglion blockade (Greenberg, 2001).

The medical management of cranial arteritis consists of early administration of a corticosteroid to prevent the possibility of loss of vision due to vascular occlusion or rupture of the involved artery (Greenberg, 2001). The patient is instructed not to stop the medication abruptly because this can lead to relapse. Analgesic agents are prescribed for comfort.

\section*{Nursing Management}

When migraine or the other types of headaches described above have been diagnosed, the goals of nursing management are to enhance pain relief. It is reasonable to try nonpharmacologic interventions first, but the use of pharmacologic agents should not be delayed. The goal is to treat the acute event of the headache and to prevent recurrent episodes. Prevention involves patient education regarding precipitating factors, possible lifestyle or habit changes that may be helpful, and pharmacologic measures.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Individualized treatment depends on the type of headache and differs for migraine, cluster headaches, cranial arteritis, and tension headache (Greenberg, 2001; Silberstein \& Rosenberg, 2000). Nursing care is directed toward treatment of the acute episode. A migraine or a cluster headache in the early phase requires
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-381.jpg?height=701&width=1783&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=109)
abortive medication therapy instituted as soon as possible. Some headaches may be prevented if the appropriate medications are taken before the onset of pain. Nursing care during a fully developed attack includes comfort measures such as a quiet, dark environment and elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees. In addition, symptomatic treatment such as antiemetics may be indicated (Goadsby et al., 2002).

Symptomatic pain relief for tension headache may be obtained by application of local heat or massage. Additional strategies may include the use of analgesic agents, antidepressant medications, and muscle relaxants.

\section*{HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Headaches, especially migraines, are more likely to occur when the patient is ill, overly tired, or stressed. Nonpharmacologic therapies are important and include patient education about the type of headache, its mechanism (if known), and appropriate changes in lifestyle to avoid triggers. Regular sleep, meals, exercise, avoidance of peaks and troughs of relaxation, and avoidance of dietary triggers may be helpful in avoiding headaches (Goadsby et al., 2002; Rice, 2000).

The patient with tension headaches needs teaching and reassurance that the headache is not due to a brain tumor. This is a common unspoken fear. Stress reduction techniques, such as biofeedback, exercise programs, and meditation, are examples of nonpharmacologic therapies that may prove helpful. Patients and their families need to be reminded of the importance of following the prescribed treatment regimen for headache and keeping follow-up appointments. In addition, they are reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screenings to promote a healthy lifestyle. See Chart 61-7 for a home care checklist for the patient with migraine headaches.

Continuing Care. The National Headache Foundation (see Resources at end of the chapter) provides a list of clinics in the United States and the names of physicians who specialize in headache and who are members of the American Association for the Study of Headache.

\section*{Management of Patients With Cerebrovascular Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the incidence and social impact of cerebrovascular disorders.
2. Identify the risk factors for cerebrovascular disorders and related measures for prevention.
3. Compare the various types of cerebrovascular disorders: their causes, clinical manifestations, and medical management.
4. Relate the principles of nursing management to the care of a patient in the acute stage of an ischemic stroke.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of a patient recovering from an ischemic stroke.
6. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of a patient with a cerebral aneurysm.
7. Identify essential elements for family teaching and preparation for home care of the stroke patient.

Cerebrovascular disorders" is an umbrella term that refers to any functional abnormality of the central nervous system (CNS) that occurs when the normal blood supply to the brain is disrupted. Stroke is the primary cerebrovascular disorder in the United States and in the world. Although preventive efforts have brought about a steady decline in incidence over the last several years, stroke is still the third leading cause of death. Approximately 500,000 people experience a new stroke, 100,000 experience a recurrent stroke, and approximately 160,000 die of a stroke each year. With over 4 million survivors ( 2.2 million men and 2.3 million women), stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States (American Heart Association, 2000).

Strokes can be divided into two major categories: ischemic ( $85 \%$ ), in which vascular occlusion and significant hypoperfusion occur, and hemorrhagic ( $15 \%$ ), in which there is extravasation of blood into the brain (American Heart Association, 2000). Although there are some similarities between the two broad types of stroke, overall the etiology, pathophysiology, medical management, surgical management, and nursing care differ. Table 62-1 reviews the major types of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.

\section*{Ischemic Stroke}

Approximately 400,000 people have an ischemic stroke in the United States each year (Hock, 1999). An ischemic stroke, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or what is now being termed "brain attack" is a sudden loss of function resulting from disruption of the blood supply to a part of the brain. This event is usually the result of long-standing cerebrovascular disease. The term "brain attack" is being used to suggest to health care practitioners and the public that a stroke is an urgent health care issue similar to a heart attack. This change in terms also reflects a similar management strategy in both diseases. Early treatment results in fewer symptoms and less loss of function. Only $8 \%$ of ischemic strokes result in death within 30 days (American Heart Association, 2000).

The net lifetime stroke-related costs in patients over the age of 65 with a first ischemic stroke are estimated at $\$ 62,000$ ( $\$ 45,000$ direct costs plus $\$ 17,000$ indirect costs). The cost for younger patients (those less than 65 years) is even greater, at $\$ 198,000$ per year ( $\$ 65,000$ direct costs plus $\$ 133,000$ indirect costs). The approximate annual cost in the United States for ischemic stroke care is over $\$ 71.8$ billion (Matchar \& Samsa, 2000).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 62-1 - Major Types of Stroke and Their Causes}
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
CLASSIFICATION & CAUSES \\
\hline Ischemic & Large artery thrombosis \\
& Small penetrating artery thrombosis \\
& Cardiogenic embolic \\
& Cryptogenic (no known cause) \\
Hemorrhagic & Other \\
& Intracerebral hemorrhage \\
& Subarachnoid hemorrhage \\
& Cerebral aneurysm \\
& Arteriovenous malformation
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Ischemic strokes are subdivided into five different types according to their cause: large artery thrombosis ( $20 \%$ ), small penetrating artery thrombosis ( $25 \%$ ), cardiogenic embolic stroke ( $20 \%$ ), cryptogenic ( $30 \%$ ) and other ( $5 \%$ ) (see Table 62-1).

Large artery thrombotic strokes are due to atherosclerotic plaques in the large blood vessels of the brain. Thrombus formation and occlusion at the site of the atherosclerosis result in ischemia and infarction.

Small penetrating artery thrombotic strokes affect one or more vessels and are the most common type of ischemic stroke. Small artery thrombotic strokes are also called lacunar strokes because of the cavity that is created once the infarcted brain tissue disintegrates.

Cardiogenic embolic strokes are associated with cardiac dysrhythmias, usually atrial fibrillation. Emboli originate from the heart and circulate to the cerebral vasculature, most commonly the left middle cerebral artery, resulting in a stroke. Embolic strokes may be prevented by the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.

The last two classifications of ischemic strokes are cryptogenic strokes, which have no known cause, and other strokes, from causes such as cocaine use, coagulopathies, migraine, and spontaneous dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries (Hock, 1999; Schievink, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In an ischemic brain attack, there is disruption of the cerebral blood flow due to obstruction of a blood vessel. This disruption in blood flow initiates a complex series of cellular metabolic events referred to as the ischemic cascade (Fig. 62-1).
agnosia: failure to recognize familiar objects perceived by the senses
aneurysm: a weakening or bulge in an arterial wall
aphasia: inability to express oneself or to understand language
apraxia: inability to perform previously learned purposeful motor acts on a voluntary basis
ataxia: impaired ability to coordinate movement, often seen as a staggering gait or postural imbalance
dysarthria: defects of articulation due to neurologic causes
expressive aphasia: inability to express oneself; often associated with damage to the left frontal lobe area
hemianopsia: blindness of half of the field of vision in one or both eyes
hemiplegia/hemiparesis: weakness/paralysis of one side of the body, or part or it, due to an injury to the motor areas of the brain infarction: a zone of tissue deprived of blood supply

Korsakoff's syndrome: personality disorder characterized by psychosis, disorientation, delirium, insomnia, and hallucinations
penumbra region: area of low cerebral blood flow
perseveration: continued and automatic repetition of an activity or word or phrase that is no longer appropriate
receptive aphasia: inability to understand
what someone else is saying; often associated with damage to the temporal lobe area

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

The ischemic cascade begins when cerebral blood flow falls to less than $25 \mathrm{~mL} / 100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{min}$. At this point, neurons can no longer maintain aerobic respiration. The mitochondria must then switch to anaerobic respiration, which generates large amounts of lactic acid, causing a change in the pH level. This switch to the less efficient anaerobic respiration also renders the neuron incapable of producing sufficient quantities of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fuel the depolarization processes. Thus, the membrane pumps that maintain electrolyte balances begin to fail and the cells cease to function.

Early in the cascade, an area of low cerebral blood flow, referred to as the penumbra region, exists around the area of infarction. The penumbra region is ischemic brain tissue that can be salvaged with timely intervention. The ischemic cascade threatens cells in the penumbra because membrane depolarization of the cell wall leads to an increase in intracellular calcium and the release of glutamate (Hock, 1999). The penumbra area can be revitalized by administration of tissue plasminogen activator ( $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$ ), and the influx of calcium can be limited with the use of calcium channel blockers. The influx of calcium and the release of glutamate, if continued, activate a number of damaging pathways that result in the destruction of the cell membrane, the release of more calcium and glutamate, vasoconstriction, and the generation of free radicals. These processes enlarge the area of infarction into the penumbra, extending the stroke.

Each step in the ischemic cascade represents an opportunity for intervention to limit the extent of secondary brain damage caused by a stroke. Medications that protect the brain from secondary injury are called neuroprotectants (Reed, 2000). A number of clinical trials are focusing on calcium channel antagonists that block the calcium influx, glutamate antagonists, antioxidants, and other neuroprotectant strategies that will help prevent secondary complications (NINDS, 1999; Reed, 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

An ischemic stroke can cause a wide variety of neurologic deficits, depending on the location of the lesion (which vessels are obstructed), the size of the area of inadequate perfusion, and the amount of collateral (secondary or accessory) blood flow. The patient may present with any of the following signs or symptoms:
- Numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
- Confusion or change in mental status
- Trouble speaking or understanding speech
- Visual disturbances
- Difficulty walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination
- Sudden severe headache

Motor, sensory, cranial nerve, cognitive, and other functions may be disrupted. Table 62-2 reviews the neurologic deficits frequently seen in patients with strokes. Table 62-3 compares the symptoms seen in right hemispheric stroke with those seen in left hemispheric stroke. Patients exhibit deficits in specific locations as well as different behavior.

\section*{MOTOR LOSS}

A stroke is a lesion of the upper motor neurons and results in loss of voluntary control over motor movements. Because the upper motor neurons decussate (cross), a disturbance of voluntary motor control on one side of the body may reflect damage to the upper motor neurons on the opposite side of the brain. The most common motor dysfunction is hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body) due to a lesion of the opposite side of the brain. Hemiparesis, or weakness of one side of the body, is another sign.

In the early stage of stroke, the initial clinical features may be flaccid paralysis and loss of or decrease in the deep tendon reflexes. When these deep reflexes reappear (usually by 48 hours), increased tone is observed along with spasticity (abnormal increase in muscle tone) of the extremities on the affected side.

\section*{COMMUNICATION LOSS}

Other brain functions affected by stroke are language and communication. In fact, stroke is the most common cause of aphasia. The following are dysfunctions of language and communication:
- Dysarthria (difficulty in speaking), caused by paralysis of the muscles responsible for producing speech
- Dysphasia or aphasia (defective speech or loss of speech), which can be expressive aphasia, receptive aphasia, or global (mixed) aphasia
- Apraxia (inability to perform a previously learned action), as may be seen when a patient picks up a fork and attempts to comb his hair with it

\section*{PERCEPTUAL DISTURBANCES}

Perception is the ability to interpret sensation. Stroke can result in visual-perceptual dysfunctions, disturbances in visual-spatial relations, and sensory loss.

Visual-perceptual dysfunctions are due to disturbances of the primary sensory pathways between the eye and visual cortex. Homonymous hemianopsia (loss of half of the visual field) may occur from stroke and may be temporary or permanent. The affected side of vision corresponds to the paralyzed side of the body.

Disturbances in visual-spatial relations (perceiving the relation of two or more objects in spatial areas) are frequently seen in patients with right hemispheric damage.

\section*{SENSORY LOSS}

The sensory losses from stroke may take the form of slight impairment of touch or may be more severe, with loss of proprioception (ability to perceive the position and motion of body parts) as well as difficulty in interpreting visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli.

\section*{COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS}

If damage has occurred to the frontal lobe, learning capacity, memory, or other higher cortical intellectual functions may be impaired. Such dysfunction may be reflected in a limited attention span, difficulties in comprehension, forgetfulness, and a lack of motivation, which cause these patients to become frustrated in their rehabilitation program. Depression is common and may be exaggerated by the patient's natural response to this catastrophic event. Other psychological problems are common and are manifested by emotional lability, hostility, frustration, resentment, and lack of cooperation.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Any patient with neurologic deficits needs a careful history and a complete physical and neurologic examination. Initial assessment will focus on airway patency, which may be compromised by loss of gag or cough reflexes and altered respiratory pattern; cardiovascular status (including blood pressure, cardiac rhythm and rate, carotid bruit), and gross neurologic losses.

Stroke patients may present to the acute care facility at any point along a continuum of neurologic involvement. A system that uses the time course to classify patients along this continuum may be used to guide treatment. Strokes using the time course are commonly classified in the following manner: (1) transient ischemic attack (TIA); (2) reversible ischemic neurologic deficit; (3) stroke in evolution; and (4) completed stroke (Hock, 1999) (Chart 62-1).

The initial diagnostic test for a stroke is a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan performed emergently to determine if the event is ischemic or hemorrhagic (which determines treatment). Further diagnostic workup for ischemic stroke involves attempting to identify the source of the thrombi or emboli. A 12-lead electrocardiogram and a carotid ultrasound are standard tests. Other studies may include cerebral angiography, transcranial Doppler flow studies, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and/or neck, xenon CT, and single photon emission CT (Bonnono et al., 2000; Petty et al., 2000).

In a patient with a TIA, a bruit (abnormal sound heard on auscultation resulting from interference with normal blood flow) may be heard over the carotid artery. There are diminished or ab-

\section*{The Stroke Continuum: Time Course Classification}

Strokes are commonly classified using the time course in the following manner: (1) transient ischemic attack (TIA), (2) reversible ischemic neurologic deficit, (3) stroke in evolution, and (4) completed stroke (Hock, 1999).

\section*{Transient Ischemic Attack}

Temporary episode of neurologic dysfunction manifested by a sudden loss of motor, sensory, or visual function. It may last a few seconds or minutes but not longer than 24 hours. Complete recovery usually occurs between attacks. The symptoms result from temporary impairment of blood flow to a specific region of the brain due to atherosclerosis, obstruction of cerebral microcirculation by a small embolus, a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), or cardiac dysrhythmias.

A TIA may serve as a warning of impending stroke, which has its greatest incidence in the first month after the first attack. Lack of evaluation and treatment of a patient who has experienced previous TIAs may result in a stroke and irreversible deficits.

\section*{Reversible Ischemic Neurologic Deficits}

Signs and symptoms are consistent with but more pronounced than a TIA and last more than 24 hours. Symptoms resolve in days with no permanent neurologic deficit.

\section*{Stroke in Evolution}

Worsening of neurologic signs and symptoms over several minutes or hours. This is a progressing stroke.

\section*{Completed Stroke}

sent carotid pulsations in the neck. Diagnostic tests for TIA may include carotid phonoangiography; this involves auscultation, direct visualization, and photographic recording of carotid bruits. Oculoplethysmography measures the pulsation of blood flow through the ophthalmic artery. Carotid angiography allows visualization of intracranial and cervical vessels. Digital subtraction angiography is used to define carotid artery obstruction and provides information on patterns of cerebral blood flow.

\section*{Prevention}

Primary prevention of ischemic stroke is the best approach. Stroke risk screenings are an ideal opportunity to lower stroke risk by identifying high-risk individuals or groups and educating the patients and the community about recognition and prevention of stroke (Lindsey, 2000; Manzella \& Galante, 2000).

Advanced age, gender, and race are well-known non-modifiable risk factors for stroke (American Heart Association, 2000). Specifically, high-risk groups include people over the age of 55, because the incidence of stroke more than doubles in each successive decade, and men, who have a higher rate of stroke than women (due to the higher prevalence of women in the elderly population, however, the absolute numbers of men and women with stroke are similar). Another high-risk group is African Americans: the incidence of first stroke in African Americans is almost twice that in Caucasians. African Americans also suffer more extensive physical impairments and are twice as likely to die from stroke than Caucasians. Hispanic, Native American Indian, Alaska native, and Asian/Pacific Islander ethnic groups also have a higher relative risk of stroke compared to Caucasians.

Modifiable risk factors for ischemic stroke include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, and diabetes (Chart 62-2). For people at high risk, interventions that alter modifiable factors, such as treating hypertension and hyperglycemia and stopping smoking, will reduce stroke risk. Many health promotion efforts involve encouraging a healthy lifestyle, including eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and increasing exercise. Recent evidence suggests that eating fish two or more times per week reduces the risk of thrombotic stroke for women (Iso et al., 2001).

Several methods of preventing recurrent stroke have been identified for patients with TIAs or mild ischemic stroke. Patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis are treated with carotid endarterectomy (Wolf et al., 1999). In patients with atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of emboli, administration of warfarin (Coumadin), an anticoagulant that inhibits clot formation, may prevent both thrombotic and embolic strokes.

NURSING ALERT Many people take herbal remedies and nutritional supplements but do not think of them as "medications" and do not always report their use to health care providers. Patients receiving anticoagulation following a stroke, TIA, or diagnosis of atrial fibrillation need to be cautioned that two herbs, ginkgo and garlic, have demonstrated effects on warfarin (Coumadin). Ginkgo has been associated with increased bleeding times and increased rates of spontaneous hemorrhage and subdural hematomas. Garlic and warfarin taken together can greatly increase the International Normalized Ratio (INR), increasing the risk for bleeding (Evans, 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

Patients who have experienced a TIA or mild stroke from atrial fibrillation or from suspected embolic or thrombotic causes are candidates for nonsurgical medical management. Those with

\section*{Modifiable Risk Factors for Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke}
- Hypertension (controlling hypertension, the major risk factor, is the key to preventing stroke)
- Cardiovascular disease (cerebral emboli may originate in the heart)
- Atrial fibrillation
- Coronary artery disease
- Heart failure
- Left ventricular hypertrophy
- Myocardial infarction (especially anterior)
- Rheumatic heart disease
- High cholesterol levels
- Obesity
- Elevated hematocrit (increases the risk of cerebral infarction)
- Diabetes mellitus (associated with accelerated atherogenesis)
- Oral contraceptive use (increases risk, especially with coexisting hypertension, smoking, and high estrogen levels)
- Smoking
- Drug abuse (especially cocaine)
- Excessive alcohol consumption

Hock, 1999; Summers et al., 2000.
atrial fibrillation are treated with dose-adjusted warfarin sodium (Coumadin) unless contraindicated. The INR target is 2.5. When warfarin is contraindicated, aspirin is used in doses between 50 and $325 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ (Wolf et al., 1999).

Platelet-inhibiting medications (aspirin, dipyridamole [Persantine], clopidogrel [Plavix], and ticlopidine [Ticlid]) decrease the incidence of cerebral infarction in patients who have experienced TIAs from suspected embolic or thrombotic causes. Currently the most cost-effective antiplatelet regimen is aspirin $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ and dipyridamole $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ (Sarasin et al., 2000).

\section*{THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY}

Thrombolytic agents are used to treat ischemic stroke by dissolving the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain. Recombinant $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$ is a genetically engineered form of $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$, a thrombolytic substance made naturally by the body. It works by binding to fibrin and converting plasminogen to plasmin, which stimulates fibrinolysis of the atherosclerotic lesion. Rapid diagnosis of stroke and initiation of thrombolytic therapy (within 3 hours) in patients with ischemic stroke leads to a decrease in the size of the stroke and an overall improvement in functional outcome after 3 months (NINDS t-PA Stroke Study Group, 1995). To realize the full potential of thrombolytic therapy, community education directed at recognizing the symptoms of stroke and obtaining appropriate emergency care is necessary to ensure rapid transport to a hospital and initiation of therapy within the 3-hour time frame (Manzella \& Galante, 2000). Delays make the patient ineligible for thrombolytic therapy because revascularization of necrotic tissue (which develops after 3 hours) increases the risk for cerebral edema and hemorrhage.

Enhancing Prompt Diagnosis. After being notified by emergency medical service personnel, the emergency department calls the appropriate staff (neurologist, neuroradiologist, radiology department, nursing staff, and electrocardiogram technician) and informs them of the patient's imminent arrival at the hospital. Many institutions have brain attack teams that respond rapidly, ensuring that treatment occurs within the allotted time frame (Alberts et al., 2000; Bonnono et al., 2000).

Initial management requires the definitive diagnosis of an ischemic stroke by CT scanning and determination of whether the patient meets all the criteria for t -PA therapy (Chart 62-3). Some of the contraindications for thrombolytic therapy include symptom onset greater than 3 hours prior to admission, a patient who is anticoagulated, a patient who has had a recent myocardial infarction, or a patient who has had any type of intracranial pathology (eg, stroke, head injury, trauma). Once it is determined that the patient is a candidate for t-PA therapy, no anticoagulants are to be administered in the next 24 hours.

Before receiving t-PA, the patient should be assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which contains 42 items evaluating neurologic deficits and is useful in differentiating between ischemic strokes and TIAs (Table 62-4). A patient with an NIHSS score of greater than 22 is not eligible to receive $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$.

Dosage and Administration. The patient is weighed to determine the dose of $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$. The minimum dose is $0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$; the maximum dose is 90 mg . The loading dose is $10 \%$ of the calculated dose and is administered over 1 minute. The remaining dose is administered over 1 hour via an infusion pump. After the infusion is completed, the line is flushed with 20 mL of normal saline solution to ensure that all the medication is administered.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

\hline & Age 18 years or older \\

\hline & No stroke or serious head injury within 3 months \\
\hline & No gastrointestinal or urinary bleeding within last 21 days \\
\hline & Not lactating or postpartum within last 30 days \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit, where continuous cardiac monitoring is implemented. Vital signs are obtained every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours, then every hour for 16 hours. Blood pressure should be maintained with the systolic pressure less than 180 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure less than 100 mm Hg . Airway management is instituted based on the patient's clinical condition and arterial blood gas values.

Side Effects. Bleeding is the most common side effect of $\mathrm{t}-$ PA administration, and the patient should be closely monitored for any bleeding (intracranial, intravenous [IV] insertion sites, urinary catheter site, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, urine, stool, emesis, other secretions) (Scroggins, 2000). Intracranial bleeding is a major complication that occurs in approximately $6.5 \%$ of patients (NINDS t-PA Stroke Study Group, 1995).

\section*{THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH ISCHEMIC STROKE NOT RECEIVING t-PA}

Not all patients are candidates for t -PA therapy. Other treatments include anticoagulant administration (IV heparin or low-molecularweight heparin) for ischemic strokes and careful maintenance of cerebral hemodynamics to maintain cerebral perfusion. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and its associated complications may occur following a large ischemic stroke. Interventions during this period include methods to reduce ICP, such as administering an osmotic diuretic (eg, mannitol), maintaining $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ within the range of 30 to 35 mm Hg , and positioning to avoid hypoxia. Other treatment measures include the following:
- Elevation of the head of the bed to promote venous drainage and to lower increased ICP
- Intubation with an endotracheal tube to establish a patent airway, if necessary
- Continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Systolic pressure should be maintained at less than 180 mm Hg , diastolic pressure at less than 100 mm Hg . Maintaining the blood pressure within this range reduces the potential for additional bleeding or further ischemic damage.
- Neurologic assessment to determine whether the stroke is evolving or whether other acute complications are developing, such as bleeding from anticoagulation or medicationinduced bradycardia, which can result in hypotension and subsequent decreases in cardiac output and cerebral perfusion pressure.

See the acute ischemic stroke clinical guidelines in Appendix A.

\section*{MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Adequate cerebral blood flow is essential for cerebral oxygenation. If cerebral blood flow is inadequate, the amount of oxygen supplied to the brain will decrease and tissue ischemia will result. Therefore, maintaining cardiac output within the normal range of 4 to $8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, or sometimes greater, can improve the cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery. Adequate oxygenation begins with pulmonary care, maintenance of a patent airway, and administration of supplemental oxygen as needed. The importance of adequate gas exchange cannot be overemphasized in these patients, many of whom are elderly and more prone to developing pneumonia, which can interfere with gas exchange.

\section*{ENDARTERECTOMY FOR PREVENTION OF ISCHEMIC STROKE}

The main surgical procedure for managing TIAs and small stroke is carotid endarterectomy, currently the most frequently performed peripheral vascular procedure in the United States (Krenzer, 1999). A carotid endarterectomy is the removal of an atherosclerotic plaque or thrombus from the carotid artery to prevent stroke in patients with occlusive disease of the extracranial cerebral arteries (Fig. 62-2). This surgery is indicated for patients with symptoms of TIA or mild stroke found to be due to severe ( $70 \%$ to $99 \%$ ) carotid artery stenosis or moderate ( $50 \%$ to $69 \%$ ) stenosis with other significant risk factors (Wolf et al., 1999).

Nursing Management. The primary complications of carotid endarterectomy are stroke, cranial nerve injuries, infection or hematoma at the incision, and carotid artery disruption. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure levels in the immediate postoperative period. Hypotension is avoided to prevent cerebral ischemia and thrombosis. Uncontrolled hypertension may precipitate cerebral hemorrhage, edema, hemorrhage at the surgical incision, or disruption of the arterial reconstruction. Sodium nitroprusside is commonly used to reduce the blood pressure to previous levels. Close cardiac monitoring is necessary because these patients have a high incidence of coronary artery disease.

A neurologic flow sheet is used to monitor and document all body systems, with particular attention to neurologic status, following carotid endarterectomy. The neurosurgeon is notified immediately if a neurologic deficit develops. Formation of a thrombus at the site of the endarterectomy is suspected if there is a sudden increase in neurologic deficits, such as weakness on one side of the body. The patient should be prepared for repeat endarterectomy.

Difficulty in swallowing, hoarseness, or other signs of cranial nerve dysfunction must be assessed. The nurse should focus on assessment of cranial nerves VI, X, XI, and XII (Krenzer, 1999). Some swelling in the neck after surgery is expected; if large enough, however, swelling and hematoma formation can obstruct the airway. Emergency airway supplies, including those needed for a tracheostomy, must be available. Table $62-5$ provides more information about potential complications of carotid surgery.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT RECOVERING FROM AN ISCHEMIC STROKE}

The acute phase of an ischemic stroke may last 1 to 3 days, but ongoing monitoring of all body systems is essential as long as the patient requires care. The patient who has had a stroke is at risk for multiple complications, including deconditioning and other musculoskeletal problems, swallowing difficulties, bowel and bladder dysfunction, inability to perform self-care, and skin breakdown. After the stroke is complete, management focuses on the prompt initiation of rehabilitation for any deficits.

\section*{Assessment}

During the acute phase, a neurologic flow sheet is maintained to provide data about the following important measures of the patient's clinical status:
- Change in the level of consciousness or responsiveness as evidenced by movement, resistance to changes of position, and response to stimulation; orientation to time, place, and person
- Presence or absence of voluntary or involuntary movements of the extremities; muscle tone; body posture; and position of the head
- Stiffness or flaccidity of the neck

\section*{Table 62-5 - Selected Complications of Carotid Endarterectomy and Nursing Interventions}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline COMPLICATION & CHARACTERISTICS & NURSING INTERVENTIONS \\
\hline Incision hematoma & Occurs in 5.5\% of patients. Large or rapidly expanding hematomas require emergency treatment. If the airway is obstructed by the hematoma, the incision may be opened at the bedside. & Monitor neck discomfort and wound expansion. Report swelling, subjective feelings of pressure in the neck, difficulty breathing. \\
\hline Hypertension & Poorly controlled hypertension increases the risk of postoperative complications, including hematoma and hyperperfusion syndrome. There is an increased incidence of neurologic impairment and death due to intracerebral hemorrhage. May be related to surgically induced abnormalities of carotid baroreceptor sensitivity. & Risk is highest in the first 48 hours after surgery. Check blood pressure frequently and report deviations from baseline. Observe for and report new onset of neurologic deficits. \\
\hline Postoperative hypotension & Occurs in approximately $5 \%$ of patients. Treated with fluids and low-dose phenylephrine infusion. Usually resolves in 24 to 48 hours. Patients with hypotension should have serial ECGs to rule out myocardial infarction. & Monitor blood pressure and observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension. \\
\hline Hyperperfusion syndrome & Occurs when cerebral vessel autoregulation fails. Arteries accustomed to diminished blood flow may be permanently dilated; increased blood flow after endarterectomy coupled with insufficient vasoconstriction leads to capillary bed damage, edema, and hemorrhage. & Observe for severe unilateral headache improved by sitting upright or standing. \\
\hline Intracerebral hemorrhage & Occurs infrequently, but is often fatal (60\%) or results in serious neurologic impairment. Can occur secondary to hyperperfusion syndrome. Increased risk with advanced age, hypertension, presence of high-grade stenosis, poor collateral flow, and slow flow in the region of the middle cerebral artery. & Monitor neurologic status and report any changes in mental status or neurologic functioning immediately. \\

\end{tabular}
- Eye opening, comparative size of pupils and pupillary reactions to light, and ocular position
- Color of the face and extremities; temperature and moisture of the skin
- Quality and rates of pulse and respiration; arterial blood gas values as indicated, body temperature, and arterial pressure
- Ability to speak
- Volume of fluids ingested or administered; volume of urine excreted each 24 hours
- Presence of bleeding
- Maintenance of blood pressure within the desired parameters

After the acute phase, the nurse assesses mental status (memory, attention span, perception, orientation, affect, speech/language), sensation/perception (usually the patient has decreased awareness of pain and temperature), motor control (upper and lower extremity movement), swallowing ability, nutritional and hydration status, skin integrity, activity tolerance, and bowel and bladder function. Ongoing nursing assessment continues to focus on any impairment of function in the patient's daily activities, because the quality of life after stroke is closely related to the patient's functional status.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses for a patient with a stroke may include:
- Impaired physical mobility related to hemiparesis, loss of balance and coordination, spasticity, and brain injury
- Acute pain (painful shoulder) related to hemiplegia and disuse
- Self-care deficits (hygiene, toileting, grooming, and feeding) related to stroke sequelae
- Disturbed sensory perception related to altered sensory reception, transmission, and/or integration
- Impaired swallowing
- Incontinence related to flaccid bladder, detrusor instability, confusion, or difficulty in communicating
- Disturbed thought processes related to brain damage, confusion, or inability to follow instructions
- Impaired verbal communication related to brain damage
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to hemiparesis/ hemiplegia, or decreased mobility
- Interrupted family processes related to catastrophic illness and caregiving burdens
- Sexual dysfunction related to neurologic deficits or fear of failure

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications include:
- Decreased cerebral blood flow due to increased ICP
- Inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain
- Pneumonia

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Although rehabilitation begins on the day the patient has the stroke, the process is intensified during convalescence and requires a coordinated team effort. It is helpful for the team to know what
the patient was like before the stroke: his or her illnesses, abilities, mental and emotional state, behavioral characteristics, and activities of daily living. It is also helpful for clinicians to be knowledgeable about the relative importance of predictors of stroke outcome (age, gender, NIHSS score at time of admission, to name a few) in order to provide stroke survivors and their families with realistic goals (Demchuk \& Buchan, 2000).

The major goals for the patient (and family) may include improved mobility, avoidance of shoulder pain, achievement of selfcare, relief of sensory and perceptual deprivation, prevention of aspiration, continence of bowel and bladder, improved thought processes, achieving a form of communication, maintaining skin integrity, restored family functioning, improved sexual function, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

Nursing care has a significant impact on the patient's recovery. Often many body systems are impaired as a result of the stroke, and conscientious care and timely interventions can prevent debilitating complications. During and after the acute phase, nursing interventions focus on the whole person. In addition to providing physical care, nurses can encourage and foster recovery by listening to patients and asking questions to elicit the meaning of the stroke experience (Eaves, 2000; Pilkington, 1999).

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY AND PREVENTING JOINT DEFORMITIES}

A hemiplegic patient has unilateral paralysis (paralysis on one side). When control of the voluntary muscles is lost, the strong flexor muscles exert control over the extensors. The arm tends to adduct (adductor muscles are stronger than abductors) and to rotate internally. The elbow and the wrist tend to flex, the affected leg tends to rotate externally at the hip joint and flex at the knee, and the foot at the ankle joint supinates and tends toward plantar flexion.

Correct positioning is important to prevent contractures; measures are used to relieve pressure, assist in maintaining good body alignment, and prevent compressive neuropathies, especially of the ulnar and peroneal nerves. Because flexor muscles are stronger than extensor muscles, a posterior splint applied at night to the affected extremity may prevent flexion and maintain correct positioning during sleep. (See Chap. 11 for additional information.)

\section*{Preventing Shoulder Adduction}

To prevent adduction of the affected shoulder while the patient is in bed, a pillow is placed in the axilla when there is limited external rotation; this keeps the arm away from the chest. A pillow is placed under the arm, and the arm is placed in a neutral (slightly flexed) position, with distal joints positioned higher than the more proximal joints. Thus, the elbow is positoned higher than the shoulder and the wrist higher than the elbow. This helps to prevent edema and the resultant joint fibrosis that will limit range of motion if the patient regains control of the arm (Fig. 62-3).

\section*{Positioning the Hand and Fingers}

The fingers are positioned so that they are barely flexed. The hand is placed in slight supination (palm faces upward), which is its most functional position. If the upper extremity is flaccid, a volar resting splint can be used to support the wrist and hand in a functional position. If the upper extremity is spastic, a hand roll is not used, because it stimulates the grasp reflex. In this instance a dor-

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 62-3 Correct positioning to prevent shoulder adduction.}
\end{figure}
sal wrist splint is useful in allowing the palm to be free of pressure. Every effort is made to prevent hand edema.

Spasticity, particularly in the hand, can be a disabling complication after stroke. Researchers have recently reported that intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin A decreased spasticity in the wrist and fingers and increased functional ability in dressing, washing, and other activities of daily living (Brashear et al., 2002).

\section*{Changing Positions}

The patient's position should be changed every 2 hours. To place a patient in a lateral (side-lying) position, a pillow is placed between the legs before the patient is turned. To promote venous return and prevent edema, the upper thigh should not be acutely flexed. The patient may be turned from side to side, but the amount of time spent on the affected side should be limited if sensation is impaired.

If possible, the patient is placed in a prone position for 15 to 30 minutes several times a day. A small pillow or a support is placed under the pelvis, extending from the level of the umbilicus to the upper third of the thigh (Fig. 62-4). This helps to promote hyperextension of the hip joints, which is essential for normal gait and helps prevent knee and hip flexion contractures. The prone position also helps to drain bronchial secretions and prevents contractural deformities of the shoulders and knees. During positioning, it is important to reduce pressure and change position frequently to prevent pressure ulcers.

\section*{Establishing an Exercise Program}

The affected extremities are exercised passively and put through a full range of motion four or five times a day to maintain joint

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-394.jpg?height=290&width=831&top_left_y=2227&top_left_x=219}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 62-4 Prone position with pillow support helps prevent hip flexion.}
\end{figure}
mobility, regain motor control, prevent contractures in the paralyzed extremity, prevent further deterioration of the neuromuscular system, and enhance circulation. Exercise is helpful in preventing venous stasis, which may predispose the patient to thrombosis and pulmonary embolus.

Repetition of an activity forms new pathways in the CNS and therefore encourages new patterns of motion. At first, the extremities are usually flaccid. If tightness occurs in any area, the range-of-motion exercises should be performed more frequently (see Chap. 11).

The patient is observed for signs and symptoms that may indicate pulmonary embolus or excessive cardiac workload during exercise; these include shortness of breath, chest pain, cyanosis, and increasing pulse rate with exercise. Frequent short periods of exercise always are preferable to longer periods at infrequent intervals. Regularity in exercise is most important. Improvement in muscle strength and maintenance of range of motion can be achieved only through daily exercise.

The patient is encouraged and reminded to exercise the unaffected side at intervals throughout the day. It is helpful to develop a written schedule to remind the patient of the exercise activities. The nurse supervises and supports the patient during these activities. The patient can be taught to put the unaffected leg under the affected one to move it when turning and exercising. Flexibility, strengthening, coordination, endurance, and balancing exercises prepare the patient for ambulation. Quadriceps muscle setting and gluteal setting exercises are started early to improve the muscle strength needed for walking; these are performed at least five times daily for 10 minutes at a time.

\section*{Preparing for Ambulation}

As soon as possible, the patient is assisted out of bed. Usually, when hemiplegia has resulted from a thrombosis, an active rehabilitation program is started as soon as the patient regains consciousness; a patient who has had a cerebral hemorrhage cannot participate actively until all evidence of bleeding is gone.

The patient is first taught to maintain balance while sitting and then to learn to balance while standing. If the patient has difficulty in achieving standing balance, a tilt table, which slowly brings the patient to an upright position, can be used. Tilt tables are especially helpful for patients who have been on bed rest for prolonged periods and are having orthostatic blood pressure changes.

If the patient needs a wheelchair, the folding type with hand brakes is the most practical because it allows the patient to manipulate the chair. The chair should be low enough to allow the patient to propel it with the uninvolved foot and narrow enough to permit it to be used in the home. When the patient is transferred from the wheelchair, the brakes must be applied and locked on both sides of the chair.

The patient is usually ready to walk as soon as standing balance is achieved. Parallel bars are useful in these first efforts. A chair or wheelchair should be readily available in case the patient suddenly becomes fatigued or feels dizzy.

The training periods for ambulation should be short and frequent. As the patient gains strength and confidence, an adjustable cane can be used for support. Generally, a three- or four-pronged cane provides a stable support in the early phases of rehabilitation.

\section*{PREVENTING SHOULDER PAIN}

Up to $70 \%$ of stroke patients suffer severe pain in the shoulder that prevents them from learning new skills, because shoulder func-
tion is essential in achieving balance and performing transfers and self-care activities. Three problems can occur: painful shoulder, subluxation of the shoulder, and shoulder-hand syndrome.

A flaccid shoulder joint may be overstretched by the use of excessive force in turning the patient or from overstrenuous arm and shoulder movement. To prevent shoulder pain, the nurse should never lift the patient by the flaccid shoulder or pull on the affected arm or shoulder. If the arm is paralyzed, subluxation (incomplete dislocation) at the shoulder can occur from overstretching the joint capsule and musculature by the force of gravity when the patient sits or stands in the early stages after a stroke. This results in severe pain. Shoulder-hand syndrome (painful shoulder and generalized swelling of the hand) can cause a frozen shoulder and ultimately atrophy of subcutaneous tissues. When a shoulder becomes stiff, it is usually painful.

Medications are helpful in the management of post-stroke pain. Amitriptyline hydrochloride (Elavil) has been used but it can cause cognitive problems, has a sedating effect, and is not effective in all patients. A recent study showed the efficacy of an antiseizure medication lamotrigine (Lamictal) in treating poststroke pain (Jensen et al., 2001).

Many shoulder problems can be prevented by proper patient movement and positioning. The flaccid arm is positioned on a table or with pillows while the patient is seated. Some clinicians advocate the use of a properly worn sling when the patient first becomes ambulatory to prevent the paralyzed upper extremity from dangling without support. Range-of-motion exercises are important in preventing painful shoulder. Overstrenuous arm movements are avoided. The patient is instructed to interlace the fingers, place the palms together, and push the clasped hands slowly forward to bring the scapulae forward; he or she then raises both hands above the head. This is repeated throughout the day. The patient is instructed to flex the affected wrist at intervals and move all the joints of the affected fingers. He or she is encouraged to touch, stroke, rub, and look at both hands. Pushing the heel of the hand firmly down on a surface is useful. Elevation of the arm and hand is also important in preventing dependent edema of the hand. Patients with continuing pain after movement and positioning have been attempted may require the addition of analgesia to their treatment program.

\section*{ENHANCING SELF-CARE}

As soon as the patient can sit up, personal hygiene activities are encouraged. The patient is helped to set realistic goals; if feasible, a new task is added daily. The first step is to carry out all self-care activities on the unaffected side. Such activities as combing the hair, brushing the teeth, shaving with an electric razor, bathing, and eating can be carried out with one hand and are suitable for self-care. Although the patient may feel awkward at first, the various motor skills can be learned by repetition, and the unaffected side will become stronger with use. The nurse must be sure that the patient does not neglect the affected side. Assistive devices will help make up for some of the patient's deficits (Chart 62-4). A small towel is easier to control while drying after bathing, and boxed paper tissues are easier to use than a roll of toilet tissue.

Return of functional ability is important to the patient recovering after a stroke. An early baseline assessment of functional ability with an instrument such as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is important in team planning and goal setting for the patient. The FIM is a widely used instrument in stroke rehabilitation and also provides valuable functional information during the acute phase of care (Hinkle, 2000, 2001).

\section*{Assistive Devices to Enhance Self-Care After Stroke}

The following list identifies products that may help neurologically impaired patients perform self-care more easily and safely after a stroke or other disorders.
Eating Devices
Nonskid mats to stabilize plates
Plate guards to prevent food from being pushed off plate
Wide-grip utensils to accommodate a weak grasp
Bathing and Grooming Devices
Long-handled bath sponge
Grab bars, nonskid mats, hand-held shower heads
Electric razors with head at 90 degrees to handle
Shower and tub seats, stationary or on wheels
Toileting Aids
Raised toilet seat
Grab bars next to toilet
Dressing Aids
Velcro closures
Elastic shoelaces
Long-handled shoe horn
Mobility Aids
Canes, walkers, wheelchairs
Transfer devices such as transfer boards and belts

The patient's morale will improve if ambulatory activities are carried out in street clothes. The family is instructed to bring in clothing that is preferably a size larger than that normally worn. Clothing fitted with front or side fasteners or Velcro closures is the most suitable. The patient has better balance if most of the dressing activities are done in a seated position.

Perceptual problems may make it difficult for the patient to dress without assistance because of an inability to match the clothing to the body parts. To assist the patient, the nurse can take steps to keep the environment organized and uncluttered, because the patient with a perceptual problem is easily distracted. The clothing is placed on the affected side in the order in which the garments are to be put on. Using a large mirror while dressing promotes the patient's awareness of what he or she is putting on the affected side. Each garment is put on the affected side first. The patient has to make many compensatory movements when dressing; these can produce fatigue and painful twisting of the intercostal muscles. Support and encouragement are provided to prevent the patient from becoming overly fatigued and discouraged. Even with intensive training, not all patients can achieve independence in dressing.

\section*{MANAGING SENSORY-PERCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES}

Patients with a decreased field of vision should be approached on the side where visual perception is intact. All visual stimuli (clock, calendar, and television) should be placed on this side. The patient can be taught to turn the head in the direction of the defective visual field to compensate for this loss. The nurse should make eye contact with the patient and draw his or her attention to the affected side by encouraging the patient to move the head. The nurse may also want to stand at a position that encourages the patient to move or turn to visualize who is in the room. Increasing the natural or artificial lighting in the room and providing eyeglasses are important in increasing vision.

The patient with homonymous hemianopsia (loss of half of the visual field) turns away from the affected side of the body and tends to neglect that side and the space on that side; this is called amorphosynthesis. In such instances, the patient cannot see food on half of the tray, and only half of the room is visible. It is important for the nurse to constantly remind the patient of the other side of the body, to maintain alignment of the extremities, and, if possible, to place the extremities where the patient can see them.

\section*{MANAGING DYSPHAGIA}

Stroke can result in swallowing problems (dysphagia) due to impaired function of the mouth, tongue, palate, larynx, pharynx, or upper esophagus. Patients must be observed for paroxysms of coughing, food dribbling out of or pooling in one side of the mouth, food retained for long periods in the mouth, or nasal regurgitation when swallowing liquids. Swallowing difficulties place the patient at risk for aspiration, pneumonia, dehydration, and malnutrition.

A speech therapist will evaluate the patient's gag reflexes and ability to swallow. Even if partially impaired, swallowing function may return in some patients over time, or the patient may be taught alternative swallowing techniques, advised to take smaller boluses of food, and taught about which foods are easier to swallow. The patient may initially be started on a thick liquid or puréed diet because these foods are easier to swallow than thin liquids. Having the patient sit upright, preferably out of bed in a chair, and instructing him or her to tuck the chin toward the chest as he or she swallows, will help prevent aspiration. The diet may be advanced as the patient becomes more proficient at swallowing. If the patient cannot resume oral intake, a gastrointestinal feeding tube will be placed for ongoing tube feedings.

\section*{Managing Tube Feedings}

Enteral tubes can be either nasogastric (placed in the stomach) or nasoenteral (placed in the duodenum) to reduce the risk of aspiration. Nursing responsibilities in feeding include elevating the head of the bed at least 30 degrees to prevent aspiration, checking the position of the tube before feeding, ensuring that the cuff of the tracheostomy tube (if in place) is inflated, and giving the tube feeding slowly. The feeding tube is aspirated periodically to ensure that the feedings are passing through the gastrointestinal tract. Retained or residual feedings increase the risk for aspiration. Patients with retained feedings may benefit from the placement of a gastrostomy tube or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. In a patient with a nasogastric tube, the feeding tube should be placed in the duodenum to reduce the risk of aspiration. For long-term feedings, a gastrostomy tube is preferred. Management of patients with tube feedings is discussed in Chapter 36.

\section*{ATTAINING BOWEL AND BLADDER CONTROL}

After a stroke, the patient may have transient urinary incontinence due to confusion, inability to communicate needs, and inability to use the urinal or bedpan because of impaired motor and postural control. Occasionally after a stroke, the bladder becomes atonic, with impaired sensation in response to bladder filling. Sometimes control of the external urinary sphincter is lost or diminished. During this period, intermittent catheterization with sterile technique is carried out. When muscle tone increases and deep tendon reflexes return, bladder tone increases and spasticity of the bladder may develop. Because the patient's sense of awareness is clouded, persistent urinary incontinence or urinary retention may be symptomatic of bilateral brain damage. The voiding
pattern is analyzed and the urinal or bedpan offered on this pattern or schedule. The upright posture and standing position are helpful for male patients during this aspect of rehabilitation.

Patients may also have problems with bowel control or constipation, with constipation being more common. Unless contraindicated, a high-fiber diet and adequate fluid intake (2 to 3 L per day) should be provided and a regular time established (usually after breakfast) for toileting. See Chapter 11 for bowel and bladder retraining programs.

\section*{IMPROVING THOUGHT PROCESSES}

After a stroke, the patient may have problems with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional deficits related to brain damage. In many instances, however, a considerable degree of function can be recovered because not all areas of the brain are equally damaged; some remain more intact and functional than others.

After assessment that delineates the patient's deficits, the neuropsychologist, in collaboration with the primary care physician, psychiatrist, nurse, and other professionals, structures a training program using cognitive-perceptual retraining, visual imagery, reality orientation, and cueing procedures to compensate for losses.

The role of the nurse is supportive. The nurse reviews the results of neuropsychological testing, observes the patient's performance and progress, gives positive feedback, and, most importantly, conveys an attitude of confidence and hope. Interventions capitalize on the patient's strengths and remaining abilities while attempting to improve performance of affected functions. Other interventions are similar to those for improving cognitive functioning after a head injury (see Chap. 63).

\section*{IMPROVING COMMUNICATION}

Aphasia, which impairs the patient's ability to understand what is being said and to express himself or herself, may become apparent in various ways. The cortical area responsible for integrating the myriad of pathways required for the comprehension and formulation of language is called Broca's area. It is located in a convolution adjoining the middle cerebral artery. This area is responsible for control of the combinations of muscular movements needed to speak each word. Broca's area is so close to the left motor area that a disturbance in the motor area often affects the speech area. This is why so many patients paralyzed on the right side (due to damage or injury to the left side of the brain) cannot speak, whereas those paralyzed on the left side are less likely to have speech disturbances.

The speech pathologist assesses the communication needs of the stroke patient, describes the precise deficit, and suggests the best overall method of communication. With many language intervention strategies for the aphasic adult, the program can be individually tailored. The patient is expected to take an active part in establishing goals.

A person with aphasia may become depressed because of the inability to talk. The inability to talk on the telephone, answer a question, or participate in conversation causes anger, frustration, fear of the future, and hopelessness. Nursing interventions include doing everything possible to make the atmosphere conducive to communication. This includes being sensitive to the patient's reactions and needs and responding to them in an appropriate manner, always treating the patient as an adult. The nurse provides strong moral support and understanding to allay anxiety.

A common pitfall is for the nurse or other health care team member to complete the thoughts or sentences of the patient.

This should be avoided because it may cause the patient to feel more frustrated at not being allowed to speak and may deter efforts to practice putting thoughts together and completing the sentence. A consistent schedule, routines, and repetitions help the patient to function despite significant deficits. A written copy of the daily schedule, a folder of personal information (birth date, address, names of relatives), checklists, and an audiotaped list help improve the patient's memory and concentration. The patient may also benefit from a communication board, which has pictures of common needs and phrases. The board may be translated into several languages.

When talking with the patient, it is important to have the patient's attention, speak slowly, and keep the language of instruction consistent. One instruction is given at a time, and time is allowed for the patient to process what has been said. The use of gestures may enhance comprehension. Speaking is thinking out loud, and the emphasis is on thinking. The patient must sort out incoming messages and formulate a response. Listening requires mental effort; the patient must struggle against mental inertia and needs time to organize an answer.

In working with the aphasic patient, the nurse must remember to talk to the patient during care activities. This provides social contact for the patient. Chart $62-5$ describes points to keep in mind when communicating with the aphasic patient.

\section*{MAINTAINING SKIN INTEGRITY}

The stroke patient may be at risk for skin and tissue breakdown because of altered sensation and inability to respond to pressure and discomfort by turning and moving. Therefore, preventing skin and tissue breakdown requires frequent assessment of the skin, with emphasis on bony areas and dependent parts of the body. During the acute phase, a specialty bed (eg, low-air-loss bed) may be used until the patient can move independently or assist in moving.

A regular turning and positioning schedule must be followed to minimize pressure and prevent skin breakdown. Pressurerelieving devices may be employed but do not replace regular turning and positioning. The turning schedule (at least every 2 hours) must be adhered to even if pressure-relieving devices are used to prevent tissue and skin breakdown. When the patient is positioned or turned, care must be used to minimize shear and friction forces, which cause damage to tissues and predispose the skin to breakdown.

\section*{Cheerts 62-5}

\section*{Communicating With the Aphasic Patient}
- Face the patient and establish eye contact.
- Speak in a normal manner and tone.
- Use short phrases and pause between phrases to allow the patient time to understand what is being said.
- Limit conversation to practical and concrete matters.
- Use gestures, pictures, and objects.
- As the patient uses and handles an object, say what the object is. It helps to match the words with the object or action.
- Be consistent in using the same words and gestures each time you give instructions or ask a question.
- Keep extraneous noises and sounds to a minimum. Too much background noise can distract the patient or make it difficult to sort out the message being spoken.

The patient's skin must be kept clean and dry; gentle massage of healthy (nonreddened) skin and adequate nutrition are other factors that help to maintain normal skin and tissue integrity (see Chap. 11).

\section*{IMPROVING FAMILY COPING}

Family members play an important role in the patient's recovery. Some type of counseling and support system should be available to them to prevent the care of the patient from taking a significant toll on their health and interfering too radically with their lives. Involving others in the patient's care and teaching stress management techniques and methods for maintaining personal health also facilitate family coping.

The family may have difficulty accepting the patient's disability and may be unrealistic in their expectations. They are given information about the expected outcomes and are counseled to avoid doing for the patient those things that he or she can do. They are assured that their love and interest are part of the patient's therapy.

The family needs to be informed that the rehabilitation of the hemiplegic patient requires many months; progress may be slow. The gains made by the patient in the hospital or rehabilitation unit must be maintained. All should approach the patient with a supportive and optimistic attitude, focusing on the abilities that remain. The rehabilitation team, the medical and nursing team, the patient, and the family all must be involved in developing attainable goals for the patient at home.

Most relatives of stroke patients handle the physical changes better than the emotional aspects of care. The family should be prepared to expect occasional episodes of emotional lability. The patient may laugh or cry easily and may be irritable and demanding or depressed and confused. The nurse can explain to the family that the patient's laughter does not necessarily connote happiness, nor does crying reflect sadness, and that emotional lability usually improves with time.

\section*{HELPING THE PATIENT COPE}

\section*{WITH SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION}

Sexual functioning can be profoundly altered by stroke. Often stroke is such a catastrophic illness that the patient experiences loss of self-esteem and value as a sexual being. Although research in this area of stroke management is limited, it appears that stroke patients consider sexual function to be important, but most have sexual dysfunction. The combined effects of age and stroke cause a marked decline in many aspects of sexuality (Lipski \& Alexander, 1997). In-depth assessments to determine sexual history before and after the stroke should be followed by appropriate interventions. Interventions for the patient and partner focus on providing relevant information, education, reassurance, adjustment of medications, counseling regarding coping skills, suggestions for alternative positions, and a means of sexual expression and satisfaction (Lipski \& Alexander, 1997).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patient and family education is a fundamental component of rehabilitation, and ample opportunity for learning about stroke, its causes and prevention, and the rehabilitation process should be provided (Mumma, 2001). In both acute care and rehabilitation facilities, the focus is on teaching patients to resume as much selfcare as possible. This may entail using assistive devices or modi-
fying the home environment to help the patient live with a disability.

An occupational therapist may be helpful in assessing the home environment and recommending modifications to help the patient become more independent. For example, a shower is more convenient than a tub for the hemiplegic patient because most patients do not gain sufficient strength to get up and down from a tub. Sitting on a stool of medium height with rubber suction tips permits the patient to wash with greater ease. A longhandled bath brush with a soap container is helpful to the patient who has only one functional hand. If a shower is not available, a stool may be placed in the tub and a portable shower hose attached to the faucet. Handrails may be attached beside the bathtub and the toilet. Other assistive devices include special utensils for eating, grooming, and dressing (see Chart 62-3).

\section*{Continuing Care}

The recovery and rehabilitation process after stroke may be prolonged, requiring patience and perseverance on the part of the patient and family. Depending on the specific neurologic deficits resulting from the stroke, the patient at home may require the services of a number of health care professionals. The nurse often coordinates the care of the patient at home. The family (often the spouse) will require assistance in planning and providing care. The caregiver often requires reminders to attend to his or her health problems and well-being.

The family is advised that the patient may tire easily, become irritable and upset by small events, and is likely to show less interest in things. Because a stroke frequently occurs in the later stages of life, there is the possibility of intellectual decline related to dementia.

Emotional problems associated with stroke are often related to speech dysfunction and frustrations about being unable to communicate. A speech therapist who visits the home allows the family to be involved and gives the family practical instructions to help the patient between therapy sessions.

Depression is a common and serious problem in the stroke patient. Antidepressant therapy may help if depression dominates the patient's life. As progress is made in the rehabilitation program, some problems will diminish. The family can help by continuing to support the patient and by giving positive reinforcement for the progress that is being made.

Community-based stroke support groups allow the patient and family to learn from others with similar problems and to share their experiences (Olson, 2001). The patient is encouraged to continue with hobbies, recreational and leisure interests, and contact with friends to prevent social isolation. All nurses coming in contact with the patient should encourage the patient to keep active, adhere to the exercise program, and remain as selfsufficient as possible.

The nurse should recognize the potential effects of caregiving on the family (Teel et al., 2001). Not all families have the adaptive coping skills and psychological functioning necessary for the long-term care of another. The patient's spouse may be elderly, with his or her own health problems; in some instances the stroke patient may have been the provider of care to the spouse. Even healthy caregivers may find it difficult to maintain a schedule that includes being available around the clock. Some effects of sustained caregiving include increased risk for depression and substance abuse, and increased use of health care services by the caregiver (King et al., 2001). Depressed caregivers are more likely to resort to physical or emotional abuse of the patient and are more likely to place the patient in a nursing home. Respite care
(planned short-term care to relieve the family from having to provide continuous 24 -hour care) may be available from an adult day care center. Some hospitals also offer weekend respite care that can provide caregivers with needed time to themselves. Nurses should encourage families to arrange for such services and should provide information to assist them.

The nurse involved in home and continuing care also needs to remind patients and family members of the need for continuing health promotion and screening practices. Patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past are educated about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers, if indicated.

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 62-1 \\ Cavegiving Experience}

Teel, C. S., Duncan, P., \& Lai, S. M., (2001). Caregiving experiences after stroke. Nursing Research, 50(1), 53-60.

\section*{Purpose}

Family caregiving is often a source of stress for family members. However, despite the high prevalence of stroke, little is known about the experience of family caregiving after stroke. The primary purpose of this study was to examine relationships between patient characteristics, characteristics of the caregiver, and caregiver coping resources with caregiver physical and mental health outcomes at 3 and 6 months following a stroke.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This longitudinal, correlational study was conducted in collaboration with a study of patient outcomes after stroke. The presence of stroke was confirmed by clinical assessment, CT, or MRI; stroke severity was assessed using the Orpington Prognostic Scale. Multiple instruments were used to assess the characteristics of family caregivers as well as their fatigue, vigor, mood disturbances, stress, spirituality, reactions to caregiving situation, coping resources, and physical and mental health status. These instruments were completed at 1,3 , and 6 months after a stroke. The sample for this study consisted of 83 caregivers, the majority of whom were female, Caucasian, and married and had at least a high school education. Their mean age was 57 years.

\section*{Findings}

The caregivers reported stable perceptions of fatigue, vigor, recurrent sorrow, perceived stress, finances, family support, physical health, and depressive symptoms at 1,3 , and 6 months. Caregivers with more fatigue, sorrow, stress, depression, difficulty with scheduling and finances, and difficulty with family support had more physical health problems. Also less vigor, less importance of spirituality, and less perceived self-esteem (a reaction to caregiving) correlated with more physical health issues at 3 and 6 months.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses working with stroke patients and families should note that comprehensive assessments of caregivers of stroke survivors should include physical and mental health components. Early identification of caregivers with more fatigue, sorrow, stress, depression, problems with scheduling and finances, and difficulty with family support may help identify persons at greater risk for physical health issues in the continuing care role. This would permit nurses to provide assistance, support, and referral to social services to family caregivers at greatest risk for physical and mental health issues.

\section*{Hemorrhagic Stroke}

Hemorrhagic strokes account for 15\% of cerebrovascular disorders and are primarily caused by an intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Each year in the United States there are approximately 50,000 intracerebral hemorrhages and 25,000 cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial aneurysm (Pfohman \& Criddle, 2001; Qureshi et al., 2001).

Patients generally have more severe deficits and a longer recovery time compared to those with ischemic stroke (AHCPR, 1995). The mean cost per discharge for subarachnoid hemorrhage was estimated at $\$ 39,994$, compared to $\$ 21,535$ for intracranial hemorrhage. The mean length of stay was 22 days for subarachnoid hemorrhage and 19 for intracranial hemorrhage (Matchar \& Samsa, 2000).

Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeding into the brain tissue, the ventricles, or the subarachnoid space. Primary intracerebral hemorrhage from a spontaneous rupture of small vessels accounts for approximately $80 \%$ of hemorrhagic strokes and is primarily caused by uncontrolled hypertension (Qureshi et al., 2001). Secondary intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), intracranial aneurysms, or certain medications (eg, anticoagulants and amphetamines) (Qureshi et al., 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke depends on the cause and type of cerebrovascular disorder. Symptoms are produced when an aneurysm or AVM enlarges and presses on nearby cranial nerves or brain tissue or, more dramatically, when an
aneurysm or AVM ruptures, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (hemorrhage into the cranial subarachnoid space). Normal brain metabolism is disrupted by the brain being exposed to blood; by an increase in ICP resulting from the sudden entry of blood into the subarachnoid space, which compresses and injures brain tissue; or by secondary ischemia of the brain resulting from the reduced perfusion pressure and vasospasm that frequently accompany subarachnoid hemorrhage.

\section*{INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE}

An intracerebral hemorrhage, or bleeding into the brain substance, is most common in patients with hypertension and cerebral atherosclerosis because degenerative changes from these diseases cause rupture of the vessel. They also may be due to certain types of arterial pathology, brain tumor, and the use of medications (oral anticoagulants, amphetamines, and illicit drugs such as crack and cocaine).

The bleeding is usually arterial and occurs most commonly in the cerebral lobes, basal ganglia, thalamus, brain stem (mostly the pons), and cerebellum (Qureshi et al., 2001). Occasionally, the bleeding ruptures the wall of the lateral ventricle and causes intraventricular hemorrhage, which is frequently fatal.

\section*{INTRACRANIAL (CEREBRAL) ANEURYSM}

An intracranial (cerebral) aneurysm is a dilation of the walls of a cerebral artery that develops as a result of weakness in the arterial wall. The cause of aneurysms is unknown, although research is ongoing. An aneurysm may be due to atherosclerosis, resulting in a defect in the vessel wall with subsequent weakness of the wall; a congenital defect of the vessel wall; hypertensive vascular disease; head trauma; or advancing age.

Any artery within the brain can be the site of cerebral aneurysms, but they usually occur at the bifurcations of the large arteries at the circle of Willis (Fig. 62-5). The cerebral arteries most commonly affected by an aneurysm are the internal carotid artery (ICA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), anterior communicating artery (ACoA), posterior communicating artery (PCoA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), and middle cerebral artery (MCA). Multiple cerebral aneurysms are not uncommon.

\section*{ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS}

An AVM is due to an abnormality in embryonal development that leads to a tangle of arteries and veins in the brain without a

\end{figure}
capillary bed. The absence of a capillary bed leads to dilation of the arteries and veins and eventual rupture. They are commonly a cause of hemorrhage in young people.

\section*{SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE}

A subarachnoid hemorrhage (hemorrhage into the subarachnoid space) may occur as a result of an AVM, intracranial aneurysm, trauma, or hypertension. The most common cause is a leaking aneurysm in the area of the circle of Willis or a congenital AVM of the brain.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient with a hemorrhagic stroke can present with a wide variety of neurologic deficits, similar to the patient with ischemic stroke. A comprehensive assessment will reveal the extent of the neurologic deficits. Many of the same motor, sensory, cranial nerve, cognitive, and other functions that are disrupted following ischemic stroke are altered following a hemorrhagic stroke. Table 62-2 reviews the neurologic deficits frequently seen in stroke patients. Table 62-3 compares the symptoms seen in right hemispheric stroke with those seen in left hemispheric stroke.

In addition to the neurologic deficits that are similar to ischemic stroke, the patient with an intracranial aneurysm or AVM can have some unique clinical manifestations. Rupture of an aneurysm or AVM usually produces a sudden, unusually severe headache and often loss of consciousness for a variable period. There may be pain and rigidity of the back of the neck (nuchal rigidity) and spine due to meningeal irritation. Visual disturbances (visual loss, diplopia, ptosis) occur when the aneurysm is adjacent to the oculomotor nerve. Tinnitus, dizziness, and hemiparesis may also occur.

At times, an aneurysm or AVM leaks blood, leading to the formation of a clot that seals the site of rupture. In this instance, the patient may show little neurologic deficit. In other cases, severe bleeding occurs, resulting in cerebral damage followed rapidly by coma and death.

Prognosis depends on the neurologic condition of the patient, age, associated diseases, and the extent and location of an intracranial aneurysm. Subarachnoid hemorrhage from an aneurysm is a catastrophic event with significant morbidity and mortality (Pfohman \& Criddle, 2001). Chart 62-6 discusses ethical issues related to the patient with a severe hemorrhagic stroke.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Any patient suspected of having a hemorrhagic stroke should undergo CT scanning to determine the size and location of the hematoma as well as the presence or absence of ventricular blood and hydrocephalus (Qureshi et al., 2001). CT scan and cerebral angiography confirm the diagnosis of an intracranial aneurysm or AVM. These tests show the location and size of the lesion and provide information about the affected arteries, veins, adjoining vessels, and vascular branches. Lumbar puncture is performed if there is no evidence of increased ICP, the CT scan results are negative, and subarachnoid hemorrhage must be confirmed. Lumbar puncture in the presence of increased ICP could result in brain stem herniation or rebleeding. In diagnosing a hemorrhagic stroke in a patient younger than 40 , some clinicians obtain a toxicology screen for illicit drug use.

The Hunt-Hess classification system guides the physician in diagnosing the severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage after an aneurysmal bleed (Table 62-6). Classifying the patient by severity of neurologic deficit provides a baseline for future comparison.

\section*{Chart 62-6 - Ethics and Related Issues DNR Orders in Severe Stroke}

\section*{Situation}

An 85-year-old patient is admitted with a large intracerebral hemorrhage, severe neurologic deficits, and a past medical history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and gout. The attending physician suggests a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order to the family.

\section*{Dilemma}

Does the principle of autonomy include death with dignity, or is beneficence keeping the patient alive at all costs? Does the family have the right to refuse? If the patient goes into cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is not provided, have the health care workers "killed" the patient?
Discussion
What arguments would you pose in favor of the DNR order? What arguments would you pose against the DNR order? Is a DNR order an example of "patient abandonment" by health care workers, or an attempt to limit treatment and avoid CPR in a patient with an anticipated poor outcome?

\section*{Prevention}

Primary prevention of hemorrhagic stroke is the best approach and includes managing hypertension and ameliorating other significant risk factors (Pfohman \& Criddle, 2001). Control of hypertension, especially in individuals over 55 years of age, clearly reduces the risk for hemorrhagic stroke (Qureshi et al., 2001). Additional factors are similar to the risks for ischemic stroke and include smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and high cholesterol (see Chart 62-2). Stroke risk screenings provide an ideal opportunity to lower hemorrhagic stroke risk by identifying high-risk individuals or groups and educating the patients and the community about recognition and prevention (Pfohman \& Criddle, 2001).

A prevention effort unique to hemorrhagic stroke is to increase the public's awareness about the association between phenylpropanolamine (an ingredient found in appetite suppressants as well as cold and cough agents) and hemorrhagic stroke. Recent research has found that phenylpropanolamine is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke, especially in women (Kernan et al., 2000). Many products have been removed voluntarily from the market, but consumers should continue to look for this ingredient on labels.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of medical treatment of hemorrhagic stroke are to allow the brain to recover from the initial insult (bleeding), to prevent or minimize the risk for rebleeding, and to prevent or treat complications. Management consists of bed rest with sedation to prevent agitation and stress, management of vasospasm, and surgical or medical treatment to prevent rebleeding. Analgesics (codeine, acetaminophen) may be prescribed for head and neck pain. The patient is fitted with elastic compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis, a threat to any patient on bed rest.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications include rebleeding; cerebral vasospasm resulting in cerebral ischemia; acute hydrocephalus, which results when free blood obstructs the reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the arachnoid villi; and seizures.

Cerebral Hypoxia and Decreased Blood Flow. Immediate complications of a hemorrhagic stroke include cerebral hypoxia, decreased cerebral blood flow, and extension of the area of injury. Providing adequate oxygenation of blood to the brain minimizes cerebral hypoxia. Brain function is dependent on available oxygen being delivered to the tissues. Administering supplemental oxygen and maintaining the hemoglobin and hematocrit at acceptable levels will assist in maintaining tissue oxygenation.

Cerebral blood flow is dependent on the blood pressure, cardiac output, and integrity of cerebral blood vessels. Adequate hydration (IV fluids) must be ensured to reduce blood viscosity and improve cerebral blood flow. Extremes of hypertension or hypotension need to be avoided to prevent changes in cerebral blood flow and the potential for extending the area of injury.

A seizure can also compromise cerebral blood flow. Seizures occur in approximately $5 \%$ of stroke patients (Berges et al., 2000). Observation for and appropriate treatment of seizure activity is an important component of care following a hemorrhagic stroke (Qureshi et al., 2001).

Vasospasm. The development of cerebral vasospasm (narrowing of the lumen of the involved cranial blood vessel) is a serious complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage and accounts for $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the morbidity and mortality of those who survive the initial intracranial bleed. The mechanism responsible for the spasm is not clear, but vasospasm is associated with increasing amounts of blood in the subarachnoid cisterns and cerebral fissures, as visualized by CT scan.

Vasospasm leads to increased vascular resistance, which impedes cerebral blood flow and causes brain ischemia and infarction. The signs and symptoms reflect the areas of the brain involved. Vasospasm is often heralded by a worsening headache, a decrease in level of consciousness (confusion, lethargy, and dis-
orientation), or a new focal neurologic deficit (aphasia, hemiparesis [partial paralysis affecting one side of the body]).

Vasospasm frequently occurs 4 to 14 days after initial hemorrhage when the clot undergoes lysis (dissolution), increasing the chances of rebleeding.

It is believed that early surgery to clip the aneurysm prevents rebleeding and that removal of blood from the basal cisterns around the major cerebral arteries may prevent vasospasm. The IV administration of the calcium-channel blocker nimodipine during the critical time in which vasospasm may occur may prevent delayed ischemic deterioration. Advances in technology have led to the introduction of interventional neuroradiology for the treatment of aneurysms. Endovascular techniques may be used in selected patients to occlude the artery supplying the aneurysm with a balloon or to occlude the aneurysm itself. As more studies on these techniques are completed, their use will increase.

Management of vasospasm remains difficult and controversial. Based on one theory that vasospasm is caused by an increased influx of calcium into the cell, medication therapy may be used to block or antagonize this action and prevent or reverse the action of vasospasm already present. Calcium-channel blockers may include nimodipine (Nimotop), verapamil (Isoptin), and nifedipine (Procardia). Other therapy for vasospasm is aimed at minimizing the deleterious effects of the associated cerebral ischemia and includes fluid volume expanders and induced arterial hypertension, normotension, or hemodilution.

Increased ICP. An increase in ICP can follow either an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke but almost always follows a subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually because of disturbed circulation of CSF caused by blood in the basal cisterns. If the patient shows evidence of deterioration from increased ICP (due to cerebral edema, herniation, hydrocephalus, or vasospasm), CSF drainage may be instituted by cautious lumbar puncture or ventricular catheter drainage, and mannitol is given to reduce ICP. When mannitol is used as a long-term measure to control ICP, dehydration and disturbances in electrolyte balance (hyponatremia or hypernatremia; hypokalemia or hyperkalemia) may occur. Mannitol acts by pulling water out of the brain tissue by osmosis as well as by reducing total-body water through diuresis. The patient is monitored for signs of dehydration and for rebound elevation of ICP.

Systemic Hypertension. Preventing sudden systemic hypertension is critical in hemorrhagic stroke management. The goal of therapy is to maintain the systolic blood pressure at about 150 mm Hg . If blood pressure is elevated, antihypertensive therapy (labetalol [Normodyne], nicardipine [Cardene], nitroprusside [Nitropress]) may be prescribed. Hemodynamic monitoring by arterial line during the administration of antihypertensives is important to detect and avoid a precipitous drop in blood pressure, which can produce brain ischemia. Because seizures cause blood pressure elevation, antiseizure agents are administered prophylactically. Stool softeners are used to prevent straining, which can also elevate the blood pressure.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Many patients with a primary intracerebral hemorrhage are not treated surgically. However, surgical evacuation is strongly recommended for the patient with a cerebellar hemorrhage if the diameter exceeds 3 cm and the Glasgow Coma Scale score is below

14 (Qureshi et al., 2001). Surgical evacuation is most frequently accomplished via a craniotomy (see Chap. 61).

The patient with an intracranial aneurysm is prepared for surgical intervention as soon as the condition is considered stable. The Hunt-Hess classification system guides the physician in diagnosing the severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage after an aneurysm bleeds and in timing the surgery (see Table 62-6). Morbidity and mortality from surgery are high if the patient is stuporous or comatose (grade IV or V). Surgical treatment of the patient with an unruptured aneurysm is an option (Pfohman \& Criddle, 2001).

The goal of surgery is to prevent bleeding in an unruptured aneurysm and further bleeding in an already ruptured aneurysm. This objective is accomplished by isolating the aneurysm from its circulation or by strengthening the arterial wall. An aneurysm may be excluded from the cerebral circulation by means of a ligature or a clip across its neck. If this is not anatomically possible, the aneurysm can be reinforced by wrapping it with muslin or some other substance to provide support and induce scarring.

An extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass may be performed to establish collateral blood supply to allow surgery on the aneurysm. Alternatively, an extracranial method may be used, whereby the carotid artery is gradually occluded in the neck to reduce pressure within the blood vessel. After ligation of the carotid artery, there is some risk for cerebral ischemia and sudden hemiplegia because during the surgical procedure, there is a temporary occlusion of the blood supply to the brain (unless a temporary bypass shunt is used). In anticipation of these complications, cerebral blood flow and internal carotid pressure may be measured to identify patients at risk for postoperative ischemic episodes.

Several less invasive endovascular treatments are now being used for aneurysms. These procedures are performed by neurosurgeons in neurointerventional radiology suites. Two procedures are endovascular treatment (occlusion of the parent artery) and aneurysm coiling (obstruction of the aneurysm site with a coil). While associated with lower risks than intracranial surgery in general, secondary stroke and rupture of the aneurysm are still potential complications (Pfohman \& Criddle, 2001).

Postoperative complications include psychological symptoms (disorientation, amnesia, Korsakoff's syndrome, personality changes), intraoperative embolization, postoperative internal artery occlusion, fluid and electrolyte disturbances (from dysfunction of the neurohypophyseal system), and gastrointestinal bleeding.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A HEMORRHAGIC STROKE}

\section*{Assessment}

A complete neurologic assessment is performed initially and should include evaluation for the following:
- Altered level of consciousness
- Sluggish pupillary reaction
- Motor and sensory dysfunction
- Cranial nerve deficits (extraocular eye movements, facial droop, presence of ptosis)
- Speech difficulties and visual disturbance
- Headache and nuchal rigidity or other neurologic deficits

All patients should be monitored in the intensive care unit following an intracerebral hemorrhage (Qureshi et al., 2001). Neurologic assessment findings are documented and reported as indicated. The frequency of these assessments varies depending on the patient's condition. Any changes in the patient's condition require reassessment and thorough documentation; changes should be reported immediately.

Alteration in level of consciousness often is the earliest sign of deterioration in a patient with a hemorrhagic stroke. Because nurses have the most frequent contact with patients, they are in the best position to detect what may be subtle changes. Mild drowsiness and slight slurring of speech may be early signs that the level of consciousness is deteriorating. Frequent nursing assessment is crucial in the patient with known or suspected cerebral aneurysm.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to bleeding
- Disturbed sensory perception related to medically imposed restrictions (aneurysm precautions)
- Anxiety related to illness and/or medically imposed restrictions (aneurysm precautions)

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ \\ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Vasospasm
- Seizures
- Hydrocephalus
- Rebleeding

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include improved cerebral tissue perfusion, relief of sensory and perceptual deprivation, relief of anxiety, and the absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{OPTIMIZING CEREBRAL TISSUE PERFUSION}

The patient is closely monitored for neurologic deterioration occurring from recurrent bleeding, increasing ICP, or vasospasm. A neurologic flow record is maintained. The blood pressure, pulse, level of responsiveness (an indicator of cerebral perfusion), pupillary responses, and motor function are checked hourly. Respiratory status is monitored because a reduction in oxygen in areas of the brain with impaired autoregulation increases the chances of a cerebral infarction. Any changes are reported immediately.

\section*{Implementing Aneurysm Precautions}

Cerebral aneurysm precautions are implemented for the patient with a diagnosis of aneurysm to provide a nonstimulating environment, prevent increases in ICP pressure, and prevent further bleeding. The patient is placed on immediate and absolute bed
rest in a quiet, nonstressful environment because activity, pain, and anxiety elevate the blood pressure, which increases the risk for bleeding. Visitors, except for family, are restricted.

The head of the bed is elevated 15 to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage and decrease ICP. Some neurologists, however, prefer that the patient remain flat to increase cerebral perfusion.

Any activity that suddenly increases the blood pressure or obstructs venous return is avoided. This includes the Valsalva maneuver, straining, forceful sneezing, pushing up in bed, acute flexion or rotation of the head and neck (which compromises the jugular veins), and cigarette smoking. Any activity requiring exertion is contraindicated. The patient is instructed to exhale through the mouth during voiding or defection to decrease strain. No enemas are permitted, but stool softeners and mild laxatives are prescribed. Both prevent constipation, which would cause an increase in ICP, as would enemas. Dim lighting is helpful because photophobia (visual intolerance of light) is common. Coffee and tea, unless decaffeinated, are usually eliminated.

Thigh-high elastic compression stockings or sequential compression boots may be prescribed to decrease the incidence of deep vein thrombosis resulting from immobility. The legs are observed for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (tenderness, swelling, warmth, discoloration, positive Homans' sign), and abnormal findings are reported.

The nurse administers all personal care. The patient is fed and bathed to prevent any exertion that might raise the blood pressure. External stimuli are kept to a minimum, including no television, no radio, and no reading. Visitors are restricted in an effort to keep the patient as quiet as possible. This precaution must be individualized based on the patient's condition and response to visitors. A sign indicating this restriction should be placed on the door of the room, and the restrictions should be discussed with both patient and family. The purpose of aneurysm precautions should be thoroughly explained to both the patient (if possible) and family.

\section*{RELIEVING SENSORY DEPRIVATION AND ANXIETY}

Sensory stimulation is kept to a minimum for patients on aneurysm precautions. For patients who are awake, alert, and oriented, an explanation of the restrictions helps reduce the patient's sense of isolation. Reality orientation is provided to help maintain orientation.

Keeping the patient well informed of the plan of care provides reassurance and helps minimize anxiety. Appropriate reassurance also helps relieve the patient's fears and anxiety. The family also requires information and support.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Vasospasm}

The patient is assessed for signs of possible vasospasm: intensified headaches, a decrease in level of responsiveness (confusion, disorientation, lethargy), or evidence of aphasia or partial paralysis. These signs may develop several days after surgery or on the initiation of treatment and must be reported immediately. If vasospasm is diagnosed, calcium-channel blockers or fluid volume expanders may be prescribed.

\section*{Seizures}

Seizure precautions are maintained for every patient who may be at risk for seizure activity. Should a seizure occur, maintaining the airway and preventing injury are the primary goals. Medication
therapy is initiated at this time if not already prescribed. The medication of choice is phenytoin (Dilantin) because this agent usually provides adequate antiseizure action while causing no drowsiness at therapeutic levels.

\section*{Hydrocephalus}

Blood in the subarachnoid space impedes the circulation of CSF, resulting in hydrocephalus. A CT scan that indicates dilated ventricles confirms the diagnosis. Hydrocephalus can occur within the first 24 hours (acute) after subarachnoid hemorrhage or days (subacute) to several weeks (delayed) later. Symptoms vary according to the time of onset and may be nonspecific. Acute hydrocephalus is characterized by sudden onset of stupor or coma and is managed with a ventriculostomy drain to decrease ICP. Symptoms of subacute and delayed hydrocephalus include gradual onset of drowsiness, behavioral changes, and ataxic gait. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is surgically placed to treat chronic hydrocephalus. Changes in patient responsiveness are reported immediately.

\section*{Rebleeding}

The rate of recurrent hemorrhage is approximately $2 \%$ following a primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Hypertension is the most serious risk factor, suggesting the importance of appropriate antihypertensive treatment (Qureshi et al., 2001).

Aneurysm rebleeding occurs most frequently in the first 2 weeks after the initial hemorrhage and is considered a major complication. Symptoms of rebleeding include sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, and neurologic deficit. A CT scan is performed to confirm rebleeding. Blood pressure is carefully maintained with medications. Antifibrinolytic medications (epsilon-aminocaproic acid) may be administered to delay the lysis of the clot surrounding the rupture. The most effective preventive treatment is early clipping of the aneurysm if the patient is a candidate for surgery.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient and family are provided with information that will enable them to cooperate with the care and restrictions required during the acute phase of hemorrhagic stroke and to prepare them to return home. Patient and family teaching includes information about the causes of hemorrhagic stroke and its possible consequences. In addition, the patient and family are informed about the medical treatments that are implemented, including surgical intervention if warranted, and the importance of interventions taken to prevent and detect complications (ie, aneurysm precautions, close monitoring of the patient). Depending on the presence and severity of neurologic impairment and other complications resulting from the stroke, the patient may be transferred to a rehabilitation unit or center, where additional patient and family teaching will focus on strategies to regain ability to manage selfcare. Teaching may also address the use of assistive devices or modification of the home environment to help the patient live with a disability. Modifications of the home may be required to provide a safe environment (Olson, 2001). (See Nursing Research Profile 62-2.)

\section*{Continuing Care}

During the acute and rehabilitation phase of care for the patient with a hemorrhagic stroke, the focus is on obvious needs, issues, and deficits. The patient and family are reminded of the impor-

\section*{The Experience of Stroke for Eight African-American Elders}

Eaves, Y. (2000). "What happened to me": Rural African American elders' experiences of stroke. Journal of Neuroscience Nursing, 32(1), 37-48.

\section*{Purpose}

The rate of stroke is higher in African Americans compared to Caucasians, yet little is known about the subjective experiences of stroke in this group and their families. The purpose of this study was to examine the experience of stroke from the perspective of rural AfricanAmerican elders and their family members.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This descriptive, qualitative study was part of a larger study on caregiving. A purposive sample of eight African-American stroke survivors and their families participated. The survivors had each experienced a stroke in the preceding 4 months, were 55 years or older, and recently had been discharged from a rehabilitation center. The qualitative method of descriptive narrative analysis was used to explain the stroke experience. Interactive audiotaped interviews and focused observations with written field notes took place in the home of each participant over several sessions. The qualitative text analysis software MARTIN was used for data analysis of the transcribed audiotaped interviews and written field notes.

\section*{Findings}

The eight stroke survivors ranged in age from 56 to 79 years; primary caregivers ranged in age from 21 to 70 years and secondary caregivers
ranged from 8 to 60 years. Five main themes were revealed in this study: (1) discovering stroke, (2) delaying treatment, (3) living with uncertainty, (4) discovering the impact of stroke, and (5) reconstructing life. Each of the five themes revealed at least two patterns; discovering stroke, for example, included stroke signs and explaining stroke. The findings revealed that several of the participants hid their stroke symptoms from family members and delayed seeking treatment for a prolonged time.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses in acute care, home care, rehabilitation, and community settings involved with stroke patients and their families can use this information to better understand how African-American elders live through and respond to the experience of stroke. The identified themes of how, when, and why rural African-American elders seek treatment for stroke symptoms can assist nurses in educating this group about signs and symptoms of stroke, stroke prevention, and the emergent nature of stroke. This would permit the development of appropriate strategies to target this high-risk group.

Referral for home care may be warranted to assess the home environment and the ability of the patient and to ensure that the patient and family are able to manage at home. The physical and psychological status of the patient and ability of the family to cope with any alterations in the patient's status are monitored during home visits. In addition, the nurse involved in home and continuing care needs to remind patients and family members of the need for continuing health promotion and screening practices. Patients who have not been involved in these practices
in the past are educated about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers, if indicated. Chart 62-7 lists teaching points for the patient recovering from a stroke.

\section*{Management of Patients With Neurologic Trauma}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Differentiate among patients with head injuries according to mechanism of injury, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic testing, and treatment options.
2. Describe the nursing management of head-injured patients.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with brain injury.
4. Identify the population at risk for spinal cord injury.
5. Describe three clinical features of the patient with neurogenic shock.
6. Discuss the pathophysiology of autonomic dysreflexia and describe the appropriate nursing interventions.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with spinal cord injury.

Trauma involving the central nervous system can be lifethreatening. Even if not life-threatening, brain and spinal cord injury may result in major physical and psychological dysfunction and can alter the patient's life completely. Neurologic trauma affects the patient, the family, the health care system, and society as a whole because of its major sequelae and the costs of acute and long-term care of patients with trauma to the brain and spinal cord.

\section*{Head Injuries}

Head injury is a broad classification that includes injury to the scalp, skull, or brain. It is the most common cause of death from trauma in the United States. Approximately 1 million people receive treatment for head injuries every year. Of these, 230,000 are hospitalized, 80,000 have permanent disabilities, and 50,000 people die (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2001). Traumatic brain injury is the most serious form of head injury. The most common causes of traumatic brain injury are motor vehicle crashes, violence, and falls. Groups at highest risk for traumatic brain injury are persons age 15 to 24 years and males, who suffer traumatic brain injury at a rate almost twice that of females. The very young (under 5) and the very old (over 75) are also at increased risk. It is estimated that 5.3 million Americans today are living with a disability as a result of a traumatic brain injury (CDC, 2001). The best approach to head injury is prevention (Chart 63-1).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Research suggests that not all brain damage occurs at the moment of impact. Damage to the brain from traumatic injury takes two forms: primary injury and secondary injury. Primary injury is the initial damage to the brain that results from the traumatic event. This may include contusions, lacerations, and torn blood vessels from impact, acceleration/deceleration, or foreign object penetration (Blank-Reid \& Reid, 2000; Porth, 2002). Secondary injury evolves over the ensuing hours and days after the initial injury and is due primarily to brain swelling or ongoing bleeding.

An injured brain is different from other injured body areas due to its unique characteristics. It resides within the skull, which is a

Cheurt 63-1 Head and Spinal Cord Injury Prevention

The most effective treatment for brain and spinal cord injury is prevention. To decrease the incidence of these devastating and catastrophic injuries, the following steps should be taken:
- Drivers should obey traffic laws, particularly not speeding or driving when under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
- All drivers and passengers should wear seat belts and shoulder harnesses. Children under 12 should be restrained in an age/size-appropriate system in the back seat.
- Passengers should not ride in the back of pick-up trucks.
- Motorcyclists, scooters, bicyclists, skateboarders, and roller skaters should wear helmets.
- Educational programs should be directed toward violence and suicide prevention in the community.
- Water safety instruction should be provided.
- Steps should be taken to prevent falls, particularly in the elderly.
- Athletes should use protective devices; coaches should be educated in proper coaching techniques.
- Owners of firearms should keep them locked in a secure area where children cannot access them.
rigid closed compartment (Bader \& Palmer, 2000). Unlike an injured ankle, in which the covering skin expands with swelling, the confines of the skull do not allow for the expansion of cranial contents. Thus, any bleeding or swelling within the skull increases the volume of contents within a container of fixed size and so can cause increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (see Chap. 61). If the increased pressure is high enough, it can cause a downward or lateral displacement of the brain through or against the rigid structures of the skull. This causes restriction of blood flow to the brain, decreasing oxygen delivery and waste removal. Cells within the brain become anoxic and cannot metabolize properly, producing ischemia, infarction, irreversible brain damage, and eventually brain death (Fig. 63-1).

\section*{SCALP INJURY}

Isolated scalp trauma is generally classified as a minor head injury. Because its many blood vessels constrict poorly, the scalp bleeds
autonomic dysreflexia: a life-threatening emergency in spinal cord injury patients that causes a hypertensive emergency; also called autonomic hyperreflexia
brain injury: an injury to the skull or brain that is severe enough to interfere with normal functioning
brain injury, closed (blunt): occurs when the head accelerates and then rapidly decelerates or collides with another object and brain tissue is damaged, but there is no opening through the skull and dura
brain injury, open: occurs when an object penetrates the skull, enters the brain, and damages the soft brain tissue in its path (penetrating injury), or when blunt trauma to the head is so severe that it opens the scalp, skull, and dura to expose the brain
concussion: a temporary loss of neurologic function with no apparent structural damage to the brain
contusion: bruising of the brain surface complete spinal cord lesion: a condition that involves total loss of sensation and voluntary muscle control below the lesion
halo vest: a lightweight vest with an attached halo that stabilizes the cervical spine
incomplete spinal cord lesion: a condition where there is preservation of the sensory or motor fibers, or both, below the lesion neurogenic bladder: bladder dysfunction that results from a disorder or dysfunction of the nervous system; may result in either urinary retention or bladder overactivity
paraplegia: paralysis of the lower extremities with dysfunction of the bowel and bladder from a lesion in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions of the spinal cord
quadriplegia (tetraplegia): paralysis of both arms and legs, with dysfunction of bowel and bladder from a lesion of the cervical segments of the spinal cord
secondary injury: an insult to the brain subsequent to the original traumatic event
spinal cord injury (SCI): an injury to the spinal cord, vertebral column, supporting soft tissue, or intervertebral disks caused by trauma
transection: severing of the spinal cord itself; transection can be complete (all the way through the cord) or incomplete (partially through)

profusely when injured. Trauma may result in an abrasion (brush wound), contusion, laceration, or hematoma beneath the layers of tissue of the scalp (subgaleal hematoma). Large avulsions of the scalp may be potentially life-threatening and are true emergencies. Diagnosis of any scalp injury is based on physical examination, inspection, and palpation. Scalp wounds are potential portals of entry of organisms that cause intracranial infections. Therefore, the area is irrigated before the laceration is sutured to remove foreign material and to reduce the risk for infection. Subgaleal hematomas (hematomas below the outer covering of the skull) usually absorb on their own and do not require any specific treatment.

\section*{SKULL FRACTURES}

A skull fracture is a break in the continuity of the skull caused by forceful trauma. It may occur with or without damage to the brain. Skull fractures are classified as linear, comminuted, depressed, or basilar. A fracture may be open, indicating a scalp laceration or tear in the dura (eg, from a bullet or an ice pick), or closed, in which the dura is intact (Fig. 63-2).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms, apart from those of the local injury, depend on the severity and the distribution of brain injury. Persistent, localized pain usually suggests that a fracture is present. Fractures of the cranial vault may or may not produce swelling in the region of the fracture; therefore, an x-ray is needed for diagnosis.

Fractures of the base of the skull tend to traverse the paranasal sinus of the frontal bone or the middle ear located in the temporal bone (see Fig. 63-2). Thus, they frequently produce hemorrhage from the nose, pharynx, or ears, and blood may appear under the conjunctiva. An area of ecchymosis (bruising) may be

\end{figure}
seen over the mastoid (Battle's sign). Basal skull fractures are suspected when cerebrospinal fluid escapes from the ears (CSF otorrhea) and the nose (CSF rhinorrhea). A halo sign (a blood stain surrounded by a yellowish stain) may be seen on bed linens or the head dressing and is highly suggestive of a CSF leak. Drainage of CSF is a serious problem because meningeal infection can occur if organisms gain access to the cranial contents through the nose, ear, or sinus through a tear in the dura. Bloody CSF suggests a brain laceration or contusion.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Although a rapid physical examination and evaluation of neurologic status detect the more obvious brain injuries, a computed tomography (CT) scan can detect less apparent abnormalities by the degree to which the soft tissue absorbs the x-rays. It is a fast, accurate, and safe diagnostic study that shows the presence, nature, location, and extent of acute lesions. It is also helpful in the ongoing management of patients with head injury as it can disclose cerebral edema, contusion, intracerebral or extracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, and late changes (infarction, hydrocephalus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate patients with head injury when a more accurate picture of the anatomic nature of the injury is warranted and when the patient is stable enough to undergo this longer diagnostic study.

Cerebral angiography may also be used; it identifies supratentorial, extracerebral, and intracerebral hematomas and cerebral contusions. Lateral and anteroposterior views of the skull are obtained.

\section*{Medical Management}

Nondepressed skull fractures generally do not require surgical treatment; however, close observation of the patient is essential. Nursing personnel may observe the patient in the hospital, but if no underlying brain injury is present, the patient may be allowed to return home. If the patient is discharged home, specific instructions (see the section on concussions below) must be given to the family. Many depressed skull fractures are managed conservatively; only contaminated or deforming fractures require surgery.

If surgery is necessary, the scalp is shaved and cleansed with copious amounts of saline to remove debris. The fracture is then exposed. After the skull fragments are elevated, the area is débrided. Large defects can be repaired immediately with bone or artificial grafts; if significant cerebral edema is present, repair of the defect can be delayed for 3 to 6 months. Penetrating wounds require surgical débridement to remove foreign bodies and devitalized brain tissue and to control hemorrhage (Blank-Reid \& Reid, 2000). Antibiotic treatment is instituted immediately, and blood component therapy is administered if indicated.

As stated previously, fractures of the base of the skull are serious because they are usually open (involving the paranasal sinuses or middle or external ear) and result in CSF leakage. The nasopharynx and the external ear should be kept clean. Usually a piece of sterile cotton is placed loosely in the ear, or a sterile cotton pad may be taped loosely under the nose or against the ear to collect the draining fluid. The patient who is conscious is cautioned against sneezing or blowing the nose. The head is elevated 30 degrees to reduce ICP and promote spontaneous closure of the leak (Sullivan, 2000), although some neurosurgeons prefer that the bed be kept flat. Persistent CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea usually requires surgical intervention.

\section*{Brain Injury}

The most important consideration in any head injury is whether or not the brain is injured. Even seemingly minor injury can cause significant brain damage secondary to obstructed blood flow and decreased tissue perfusion. The brain cannot store oxygen and glucose to any significant degree. Because the cerebral cells need an uninterrupted blood supply to obtain these nutrients, irreversible brain damage and cell death occur when the blood supply is interrupted for even a few minutes. Clinical manifestations of brain injury are listed in Chart 63-2. Closed (blunt) brain injury occurs when the head accelerates and then rapidly decelerates or collides with another object (eg, a wall or dashboard of a car) and brain tissue is damaged, but there is no opening through the skull and dura. Open brain injury occurs when an object penetrates the skull, enters the brain, and damages the soft brain tissue in its path (penetrating injury), or when blunt trauma to the head is so severe that it opens the scalp, skull, and dura to expose the brain.

\section*{Concussion}

A cerebral concussion after head injury is a temporary loss of neurologic function with no apparent structural damage. A concussion generally involves a period of unconsciousness lasting

\section*{Clinical Manifestations of Brain Injury}
- Altered level of consciousness
- Confusion
- Pupillary abnormalities (changes in shape, size, and response to light)
- Altered or absent gag reflex
- Absent corneal reflex
- Sudden onset of neurologic deficits
- Changes in vital signs (altered respiratory pattern, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypothermia or hyperthermia)
- Vision and hearing impairment
- Sensory dysfunction
- Spasticity
- Headache
- Vertigo
- Movement disorders
- Seizures
from a few seconds to a few minutes. The jarring of the brain may be so slight as to cause only dizziness and spots before the eyes ("seeing stars"), or it may be severe enough to cause complete loss of consciousness for a time. If the brain tissue in the frontal lobe is affected, the patient may exhibit bizarre irrational behavior, whereas involvement of the temporal lobe can produce temporary amnesia or disorientation.

The patient may be hospitalized overnight for observation or discharged from the hospital in a relatively short time after a concussion. Treatment involves observing the patient for headache, dizziness, lethargy, irritability, and anxiety. The occurrence of these symptoms after injury is referred to as postconcussion syndrome. Giving the patient information, explanations, and encouragement may reduce some of the problems of postconcussion syndrome. The patient is advised to resume normal activities slowly, and the family is instructed to observe for the following signs and symptoms and to notify the physician or clinic (or bring the patient to the emergency department) if they occur:
- Difficulty in awakening
- Difficulty in speaking
- Confusion
- Severe headache
- Vomiting
- Weakness of one side of the body

A concussion was once thought of as a minor head injury without significant sequelae. However, studies have demonstrated that there are often disturbing and sometimes residual effects, including headache, lethargy, personality and behavior changes, attention deficits, difficulty with memory, and disruption in work habits (Ponsford et al., 1999).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly patients must be assessed very carefully. Even given similar mechanisms of injury, an elderly person will often suffer more severe injury than a young person and will often recover more slowly and with more complications (Perdue et al., 1998). The elderly patient with confusion or behavioral disturbances should be assessed for head injury, because unrecognized "minor" head trauma may account for behavioral and confusional episodes in some elderly people (Walshaw, 2000). A misdiagnosed or untreated episode of confusion in an elderly patient may result in
long-term disability that might have been avoided if the injury had been detected and treated promptly.

\section*{Contusion}

Cerebral contusion is a more severe injury in which the brain is bruised, with possible surface hemorrhage. The patient is unconscious for more than a few seconds or minutes. Clinical signs and symptoms depend on the size of the contusion and the amount of associated cerebral edema. The patient may lie motionless, with a faint pulse, shallow respirations, and cool, pale skin. Often there is involuntary evacuation of the bowels and the bladder. The patient may be aroused with effort but soon slips back into unconsciousness. The blood pressure and the temperature are subnormal, and the picture is somewhat similar to that of shock.

In general, patients with severe brain injury who have abnormal motor function, abnormal eye movements, and elevated ICP have poor outcomes-that is, brain damage, disability, or death. Conversely, the patient may recover consciousness but pass into a stage of cerebral irritability. In this stage, the patient is conscious and easily disturbed by any form of stimulation such as noises, light, and voices; he or she may become hyperactive at times. Gradually, the pulse, respirations, temperature, and other body functions return to normal, but full recovery can be delayed for months. Residual headache and vertigo are common, and impaired mental function or seizures may occur as a result of irreparable cerebral damage.

\section*{Diffuse Axonal Injury}

Diffuse axonal injury involves widespread damage to axons in the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, and brain stem. It can be seen in mild, moderate, or severe head trauma and results in axonal swelling and disconnection (Porth, 2002). Clinically, with severe injury, the patient has no lucid intervals and experiences immediate coma, decorticate and decerebrate posturing (see Fig. 61-1 in Chap. 61 and discussion in Chap. 60), and global cerebral edema. Diagnosis is made by clinical signs in conjunction with a CT scan or MRI. Recovery depends on the severity of the axonal injury.

\section*{Intracranial Hemorrhage}

Hematomas (collections of blood) that develop within the cranial vault are the most serious brain injuries (Porth, 2002). A hematoma may be epidural (above the dura), subdural (below the dura), or intracerebral (within the brain) (Fig. 63-3). Major symptoms are frequently delayed until the hematoma is large enough to cause distortion of the brain and increased ICP. The signs and symptoms of cerebral ischemia resulting from the com-
pression by a hematoma are variable and depend on the speed with which vital areas are affected and the area that is injured. In general, a rapidly developing hematoma, even if small, may be fatal, whereas a larger but slowly developing collection of blood may allow compensation for increases in ICP.

\section*{EPIDURAL HEMATOMA (EXTRADURAL HEMATOMA OR HEMORRHAGE)}

After a head injury, blood may collect in the epidural (extradural) space between the skull and the dura. This can result from a skull fracture that causes a rupture or laceration of the middle meningeal artery, the artery that runs between the dura and the skull inferior to a thin portion of temporal bone. Hemorrhage from this artery causes rapid pressure on the brain.

Symptoms are caused by the expanding hematoma. Usually, there is a momentary loss of consciousness at the time of injury, followed by an interval of apparent recovery (lucid interval). Although the lucid interval is considered a classic characteristic of an epidural hematoma, no lucid interval has been reported in many patients with this lesion (Servadei, 1997), and thus it should not be considered a critical defining criterion. During the lucid interval, compensation for the expanding hematoma takes place by rapid absorption of CSF and decreased intravascular volume, both of which help maintain a normal ICP. When these mechanisms can no longer compensate, even a small increase in the volume of the blood clot produces a marked elevation in ICP. Then, often suddenly, signs of compression appear (usually deterioration of consciousness and signs of focal neurologic deficits such as dilation and fixation of a pupil or paralysis of an extremity), and the patient deteriorates rapidly.

An epidural hematoma is considered an extreme emergency; marked neurologic deficit or even respiratory arrest can occur within minutes. Treatment consists of making openings through the skull (burr holes) to decrease ICP emergently, remove the clot, and control the bleeding. A craniotomy may be required to remove the clot and control the bleeding. A drain is usually inserted after creation of burr holes or a craniotomy to prevent reaccumulation of blood.

\section*{SUBDURAL HEMATOMA}

A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura and the brain, a space normally occupied by a thin cushion of fluid. The most common cause of subdural hematoma is trauma, but it may also occur from coagulopathies or rupture of an aneurysm. A subdural hemorrhage is more frequently venous in origin and is due to the rupture of small vessels that bridge the subdural space. A subdural hematoma may be acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on the size of the involved vessel and the amount of bleeding present.

\end{figure}

Acute and Subacute Subdural Hematoma. Acute subdural hematomas are associated with major head injury involving contusion or laceration. Clinical symptoms develop over 24 to 48 hours. Signs and symptoms include changes in the level of consciousness (LOC), pupillary signs, and hemiparesis. There may be minor or even no symptoms with small collections of blood. Coma, increasing blood pressure, decreasing heart rate, and slowing respiratory rate are all signs of a rapidly expanding mass requiring immediate intervention.

Subacute subdural hematomas are the result of less severe contusions and head trauma. Clinical manifestations usually appear between 48 hours and 2 weeks after the injury. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of an acute subdural hematoma.

If the patient can be transported rapidly to the hospital, an immediate craniotomy is performed to open the dura, allowing the subdural clot to be evacuated. Successful outcome also depends on the control of ICP and careful monitoring of respiratory function (see "The Patient Undergoing Intracranial Surgery" in Chap. 61). The mortality rate for patients with acute and subacute subdural hematomas is high because of associated brain damage.

Chronic Subdural Hematoma. Chronic subdural hematomas can develop from seemingly minor head injuries and are seen most frequently in the elderly. The elderly are prone to this type of head injury secondary to brain atrophy, which is an expected consequence of the aging process. Seemingly minor head trauma may produce enough impact to shift the brain contents abnormally. The time between injury and onset of symptoms may be lengthy (eg, 3 weeks to months), so the actual insult may be forgotten.

A chronic subdural hematoma resembles other conditions and may be mistaken for a stroke. The bleeding is less profuse and there is compression of the intracranial contents. The blood within the brain changes in character in 2 to 4 days, becoming thicker and darker. In a few weeks, the clot breaks down and has the color and consistency of motor oil. Eventually, calcification or ossification of the clot takes place. The brain adapts to this foreign body invasion, and the clinical signs and symptoms fluctuate. There may be severe headache, which tends to come and go; alternating focal neurologic signs; personality changes; mental deterioration; and focal seizures. Unfortunately, the patient may be labeled neurotic or psychotic if the cause of the symptoms is overlooked.

The treatment of a chronic subdural hematoma consists of surgical evacuation of the clot. The procedure may be carried out through multiple burr holes, or a craniotomy may be performed for a sizable subdural mass that cannot be suctioned or drained through burr holes.

\section*{INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE AND HEMATOMA}

Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding into the substance of the brain. It is commonly seen in head injuries when force is exerted to the head over a small area (missile injuries or bullet wounds; stab injury). These hemorrhages within the brain may also result from systemic hypertension, which causes degeneration and rupture of a vessel; rupture of a saccular aneurysm; vascular anomalies; intracranial tumors; systemic causes, including bleeding disorders such as leukemia, hemophilia, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia; and complications of anticoagulant therapy. Nontraumatic causes of intracerebral hemorrhage are discussed in Chapter 62.

The onset may be insidious, beginning with the development of neurologic deficits followed by headache. Management in-
cludes supportive care, control of ICP, and careful administration of fluids, electrolytes, and antihypertensive medications. Surgical intervention by craniotomy or craniectomy permits removal of the blood clot and control of hemorrhage but may not be possible because of the inaccessible location of the bleeding or the lack of a clearly circumscribed area of blood that can be removed.

\section*{Management of Brain Injuries}

Assessment and diagnosis of the extent of injury are accomplished by the initial physical and neurologic examinations. CT and MRI are the primary neuroimaging diagnostic tools and are useful in evaluating soft tissue injuries. Positron emission tomography (PET scan) is available in some trauma centers; this method of scanning examines brain function rather than structure. A flowchart developed by the Brain Trauma Foundation for the initial management of brain-injured patients is presented in Figure 63-4 (Brain Trauma Foundation, 2000).

Any individual with a head injury is presumed to have a cervical spine injury until proven otherwise. From the scene of the injury, the patient is transported on a board with the head and neck maintained in alignment with the axis of the body. A cervical collar should be applied and maintained until cervical spine x-rays have been obtained and the absence of cervical spinal cord injury documented.

All therapy is directed toward preserving brain homeostasis and preventing secondary brain injury. "Secondary injury" is a term used to describe injury to the brain subsequent to the original traumatic event (Bader \& Palmer, 2000). Common causes of secondary injury are cerebral edema, hypotension, and respiratory depression that may lead to hypoxemia and electrolyte imbalance. Treatments to prevent this include stabilization of cardiovascular and respiratory function to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion, control of hemorrhage and hypovolemia, and maintenance of optimal blood gas values (Wong, 2000).

\section*{TREATMENT OF INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE}

As the damaged brain swells with edema or as blood collects within the brain, a rise in ICP occurs; this requires aggressive treatment. See Chapter 61 for a discussion of the relationship of ICP to cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). If the ICP remains elevated, it can decrease the CPP. Initial management is based on the principle of preventing secondary injury and maintaining adequate cerebral oxygenation (see Fig. 63-4).

Surgery is required for evacuation of blood clots, débridement and elevation of depressed fractures of the skull, and suture of severe scalp lacerations. ICP is monitored closely; if increased, it is managed by maintaining adequate oxygenation, elevating the head of the bed, and maintaining normal blood volume. Devices to monitor ICP or drain CSF can be inserted during surgery or at the bedside using aseptic technique. The patient is cared for in the intensive care unit, where expert nursing care and medical treatment are readily available.

\section*{SUPPORTIVE MEASURES}

Treatment also includes ventilatory support, seizure prevention, fluid and electrolyte maintenance, nutritional support, and pain and anxiety management. Comatose patients are intubated and mechanically ventilated to ensure adequate oxygenation and protect the airway.

Because seizures are common after head injury and can cause secondary brain damage from hypoxia, antiseizure agents may be administered. If the patient is very agitated, benzodiazepines may

be prescribed to calm him or her without decreasing LOC. These medications do not affect ICP or CPP, making them good choices for the head-injured patient.

A nasogastric tube may be inserted because reduced gastric motility and reverse peristalsis are associated with head injury, making regurgitation and aspiration common in the first few hours.

\section*{BRAIN DEATH}

When a patient has sustained a severe head injury incompatible with life, the nurse may assist in the clinical examination for
determination of brain death and in the process of organ procurement. Since 1981, all 50 states have recognized the Uniform Determination of Brain Death Act (Lovasik, 2000). This act states that death will be determined with accepted medical standards and that death will indicate irreversible loss of all brain function. The patient has no neurologic activity upon clinical examination; adjunctive tests such as EEG and cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies are often used to confirm brain death (Lovasik, 2000). Many of these patients are potential organ donors, and the nurse may provide information to the family
and assist them with this decision-making process about organ donation.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A BRAIN INJURY}

\section*{Assessment}

Depending on the patient's neurologic status, the nurse may elicit information from the patient, family, or witnesses or from emergency rescue personnel (Munro, 2000). Although it may not be possible to obtain all usual baseline data initially, the immediate health history should include the following questions:
- When did the injury occur?
- What caused the injury? A high-velocity missile? An object striking the head? A fall?
- What was the direction and force of the blow?

Since a history of unconsciousness or amnesia after a head injury indicates a significant degree of brain damage, and since changes that occur minutes to hours after the initial injury can reflect recovery or indicate the development of secondary brain damage, the nurse should try to determine if there was a loss of consciousness, what the duration of the unconscious period was, and if the patient could be aroused.

In addition to questions that establish the nature of the injury and the patient's condition immediately after the injury, the nurse should examine the patient thoroughly. This assessment should include determining the patient's LOC, ability to respond to verbal commands (if conscious), response to tactile stimuli (if unconscious), pupillary response to light, status of corneal and gag reflexes, motor function, and Glasgow Coma Scale score (Chart 63-4).

Additional detailed neurologic and systems assessments are made initially and at frequent intervals throughout the acute phase of care (Dibsie, 1998). The baseline and ongoing assessments are critical nursing interventions for the brain-injured pa-

\section*{What If a Family Does Not Want Life \\ Support Stopped?}

\section*{Situation}

A 16-year-old involved in a motor vehicle crash suffered a severe closed head injury. Extensive medical tests have determined conclusively that he is brain dead. He remains in the ICU on a mechanical ventilator with multiple medications to keep his heart beating. The patient's medical condition and ultimate physical death cannot be prevented by any medical interventions, yet the family refuses to discontinue any of the medical treatments, hoping for a "miracle."

\section*{Dilemma}

The family's wish to continue care for their son conflicts with the medical reality of the patient's condition.

\section*{Discussion}

What arguments could you make in favor of the family's position to continue life support? What arguments could you make in favor of withdrawal of life support?

\section*{Glasgow Coma Scale}

The Glasgow Coma Scale is a tool for assessing a patient's response to stimuli. Scores range from 3 (deep coma) to 15 (normal).

tient, whose condition can worsen dramatically and irrevocably if subtle signs are overlooked. More information on assessment is provided below and in Figure 63-5 and Table 63-1.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective airway clearance and impaired gas exchange related to brain injury
- Ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to increased ICP and decreased CPP
- Deficient fluid volume related to decreased LOC and hormonal dysfunction
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to metabolic changes, fluid restriction, and inadequate intake
- Risk for injury (self-directed and directed at others) related to seizures, disorientation, restlessness, or brain damage
- Risk for imbalanced (increased) body temperature related to damaged temperature-regulating mechanism
- Potential for impaired skin integrity related to bed rest, hemiparesis, hemiplegia, and immobility
- Disturbed thought processes (deficits in intellectual function, communication, memory, information processing) related to brain injury
- Potential for disturbed sleep pattern related to brain injury and frequent neurologic checks
- Potential for compromised family coping related to unresponsiveness of patient, unpredictability of outcome, prolonged recovery period, and the patient's residual physical and emotional deficit
- Deficient knowledge about recovery and the rehabilitation process
The nursing diagnoses for the unconscious patient and the patient with increased ICP also apply (see Chap. 61).

\end{figure}

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on all the assessment data, the major complications include the following:
- Decreased cerebral perfusion
- Cerebral edema and herniation
- Impaired oxygenation and ventilation
- Impaired fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional balance
- Risk of post-traumatic seizures

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include maintenance of a patent airway, adequate CPP, fluid and electrolyte balance, adequate nutritional status, prevention of secondary injury, maintenance of normal body temperature, maintenance of skin integrity, improvement of cognitive function, prevention of sleep deprivation, effective family coping, increased knowledge about the rehabilitation process, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The nursing interventions for the patient with a head injury are extensive and diverse; they include making nursing assessments, setting priorities for nursing interventions, anticipating needs and complications, and initiating rehabilitation.

\section*{MONITORING FOR DECLINING NEUROLOGIC FUNCTION}

The importance of ongoing assessment and monitoring of the brain-injured patient cannot be overstated. The following parameters are assessed initially and as frequently as the patient's condition requires. As soon as the initial assessment is made, the use of a neurologic flow chart is started and maintained.

\section*{Level of Consciousness}

The LOC is regularly assessed because changes in it precede all other changes in vital and neurologic signs. The Glasgow Coma Scale, which is used to assess LOC, is based on the three criteria of eye opening, verbal responses, and motor responses to verbal commands or painful stimuli. It is particularly useful for monitoring changes during the acute phase, the first few days after a head injury. It does not take the place of an indepth neurologic assessment; rather, it is used to monitor the patient's motor, verbal, and eye-opening responses. The patient's best responses to predetermined stimuli are recorded (see Chart 63-4). Each response is scored (the greater the number the better the functioning), and the sum of these scores gives an indication of the severity of coma and a prediction of possible outcome. The lowest score is 3 (least responsive); the highest is 15 (most responsive). A score of 8 or less is generally accepted as indicating a severe head injury (Teasdale \& Jennett, 1974).

\section*{Vital Signs}

Although a change in LOC is the most sensitive neurologic indication of deterioration of the patient's condition, vital signs are monitored at frequent intervals also to assess the intracranial status. Table 63-1 depicts the general assessment parameters for the patient with a head injury.

Signs of increasing ICP include slowing of the heart rate (bradycardia), increasing systolic blood pressure, and widening pulse pressure. As brain compression increases, respirations become rapid, the blood pressure may decrease, and the pulse slows further. This is an ominous development, as is a rapid fluctuation of vital signs (March, 2000). A rapid rise in body temperature is regarded as unfavorable because hyperthermia increases the metabolic demands of the brain and may indicate brain stem damage, a poor prognostic sign. The temperature is maintained at less than $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(100.4^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. Tachycardia and arterial hypotension may indicate that bleeding is occurring elsewhere in the body.

\section*{Motor Function}

Motor function is assessed frequently by observing spontaneous movements, asking the patient to raise and lower the extremities, and comparing the strength and equality of the hand grasp and pedal push at periodic intervals. To assess the hand grasp, the nurse instructs the patient to squeeze the examiner's fingers tightly. The nurse assesses lower extremity motor strength (pedal push) by placing the hands on the soles of the patient's feet and asking the patient to push down against the examiner's hands. Motor assessment is discussed in Chapter 60 in more detail. The presence or absence of spontaneous movement of each extremity is also noted, and speech and eye signs are assessed.

If the patient does not demonstrate spontaneous movement, responses to painful stimuli are assessed. Motor response to pain is assessed by applying a central stimulus, such as pinching the pectoralis major muscle, to determine the patient's best response. Peripheral stimulation may provide inaccurate assessment data because it may result in a reflex movement rather than a voluntary motor response. Abnormal responses (lack of motor response; extension responses) are associated with a poorer prognosis.

\section*{Other Neurologic Signs}

In addition to the patient's spontaneous eye opening evaluated with the Glasgow Coma Scale, the size and equality of the pupils and their reaction to light are assessed. A unilaterally dilated and poorly responding pupil may indicate a developing hematoma, with subsequent pressure on the third cranial nerve due to shifting of the brain. If both pupils become fixed and dilated, this indicates overwhelming injury and intrinsic damage to the upper brain stem and is a poor prognostic sign.

The patient with a head injury may develop focal nerve palsies such as anosmia (lack of sense of smell) or eye movement abnormalities and focal neurologic deficits such as aphasia, memory deficits, and post-traumatic seizures or epilepsy. Patients may be left with residual organic psychological deficits (impulsiveness, emotional lability, or uninhibited, aggressive behaviors) and, as a consequence of the impairment, lack insight into their emotional responses (Davis, 2000).

\section*{MAINTAINING THE AIRWAY}

One of the most important nursing goals in the management of the patient with a head injury is to establish and maintain an adequate airway. The brain is extremely sensitive to hypoxia, and a
neurologic deficit can worsen if the patient is hypoxic. Therapy is directed toward maintaining optimal oxygenation to preserve cerebral function. An obstructed airway causes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention and hypoventilation, which can produce cerebral vessel dilation and increased ICP.

Interventions to ensure an adequate exchange of air are discussed in Chapter 61 and include the following:
- Keep the unconscious patient in a position that facilitates drainage of oral secretions, with the head of the bed elevated about 30 degrees to decrease intracranial venous pressure (Bader \& Palmer, 2000).
- Establish effective suctioning procedures (pulmonary secretions produce coughing and straining, which increase ICP).
- Guard against aspiration and respiratory insufficiency.
- Closely monitor arterial blood gas values to assess the adequacy of ventilation. The goal is to keep blood gas values within the normal range to ensure adequate cerebral blood flow.
- Monitor the patient who is receiving mechanical ventilation.
- Monitor for pulmonary complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia (Munro, 2000).

\section*{MONITORING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}

Brain damage can produce metabolic and hormonal dysfunctions. The monitoring of serum electrolyte levels is important, especially in patients receiving osmotic diuretics, those with inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and those with post-traumatic diabetes insipidus.

Serial studies of blood and urine electrolytes and osmolality are carried out because head injuries may be accompanied by disorders of sodium regulation. Hyponatremia is common following head injury due to shifts in extracellular fluid, electrolytes, and volume. Hyperglycemia, for example, may cause an increase in extracellular fluid that lowers sodium (Hickey, 2003). Hypernatremia may also occur due to sodium retention that may last several days, followed by sodium diuresis. Increasing lethargy, confusion, and seizures may be due to electrolyte imbalance.

Endocrine function is evaluated by monitoring serum electrolytes, blood glucose values, and intake and output. Urine is tested regularly for acetone. A record of daily weights is maintained, especially if the patient has hypothalamic involvement and is at risk for the development of diabetes insipidus.

\section*{PROMOTING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Head injury results in metabolic changes that increase calorie consumption and nitrogen excretion (Donaldson et al., 2000). There is an increased demand for protein. As soon as possible, nutrition should be provided. Early initiation of nutritional therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in head-injured patients (Bader \& Palmer, 2000). Parenteral nutrition via a central line or enteral feedings administered via a nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding tube may be used. If there is discharge of CSF from the nose (CSF rhinorrhea), an oral feeding tube should be inserted in place of a nasal tube.

Laboratory values should be monitored closely in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Elevating the head of the bed and aspirating the enteral tube for evidence of residual feeding before administering additional feedings can help prevent distention, regurgitation, and aspiration. A continuous-drip infusion or pump
may be used to regulate the feeding. The principles and technique of enteral feedings are discussed in Chapter 36. Enteral or parenteral feedings are usually continued until the swallowing reflex returns and the patient can meet caloric requirements orally.

\section*{PREVENTING INJURY}

As the patient emerges from coma, there is often a period of lethargy and stupor followed by a period of agitation. Each phase is variable and depends on the individual, the location of the injury, the depth and duration of coma, and the patient's age. The patient emerging from a coma may become increasingly agitated toward the end of the day. Restlessness may be due to hypoxia, fever, pain, or a full bladder. It may indicate injury to the brain but may also be a sign that the patient is regaining consciousness. (Some restlessness may be beneficial because the lungs and extremities are exercised.) Agitation may also be due to discomfort from catheters, intravenous lines, restraints, and repeated neurologic checks. Alternatives to restraints must be used whenever possible.

Strategies to prevent injury include the following:
- Assess the patient to ensure that oxygenation is adequate and the bladder is not distended. Check dressings and casts for constriction.
- To protect the patient from self-injury and dislodging of tubes, use padded side rails or wrap the patient's hands in mitts (Fig. 63-6). Restraints are avoided because straining against them can increase ICP or cause other injury. Enclosed or floor-level specialty beds may be indicated.
- Avoid using opioids as a means of controlling restlessness because these medications depress respiration, constrict the pupils, and alter responsiveness.
- Minimize environmental stimuli by keeping the room quiet, limiting visitors, speaking calmly, and providing frequent orientation information (eg, explaining where the patient is and what is being done).
- Provide adequate lighting to prevent visual hallucinations.
- Minimize disruption of the patient's sleep/wake cycles.
- Lubricate the skin with oil or emollient lotion to prevent irritation due to rubbing against the sheet.

\end{figure}
- If incontinence occurs, consider use of an external sheath catheter on a male patient. Because prolonged use of an indwelling catheter inevitably produces infection, the patient may be placed on an intermittent catheterization schedule.

\section*{MAINTAINING BODY TEMPERATURE}

An increase in body temperature in the head-injured patient can be the result of damage to the hypothalamus, cerebral irritation from hemorrhage, or infection. The nurse monitors the patient's temperature every 4 hours. If the temperature rises, efforts are undertaken to identify the cause and to control it using acetaminophen and cooling blankets as prescribed (Bader \& Palmer, 2000). Cooling blankets should be used with caution so as not to induce shivering, which increases ICP. If infection is suspected, potential sites of infection are cultured and antibiotics are prescribed and administered.

\section*{MAINTAINING SKIN INTEGRITY}

Patients with traumatic head injury often require assistance in turning and positioning because of immobility or unconsciousness. Prolonged pressure on the tissues will decrease circulation and lead to tissue necrosis. Potential areas of breakdown need to be identified early to avoid the development of pressure ulcers. Specific nursing measures include the following:
- Assess all body surfaces and document skin integrity at least every 8 hours.
- Turn and reposition the patient every 2 hours.
- Provide skin care every 4 hours.
- Assist patient to get out of bed to a chair three times a day if physically able.

\section*{IMPROVING COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING}

Although many patients with head injury survive because of resuscitative and supportive technology, they frequently have significant cognitive sequelae that may not be detected during the acute phase of injury. Cognitive impairment includes memory deficits, decreased ability to focus and sustain attention to a task (distractibility), reduced ability to process information, and slowness in thinking, perceiving, communicating, reading, and writing. Psychiatric or emotional problems develop in as many as $44 \%$ of patients with head injury (van Reekum et al., 2000). Resulting psychosocial, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive impairments are devastating to the family as well as to the patient (Davis, 2000; Perlesz, Kinsella, \& Crowe, 1999).

These problems require collaboration among many disciplines (Bader \& Palmer, 2000). A neuropsychologist (specialist in evaluating and treating cognitive problems) plans a program and initiates therapy or counseling to help the patient reach maximal potential. Cognitive rehabilitation activities help the patient to devise new problem-solving strategies. The retraining is carried out over an extended period and may include the use of sensory stimulation and reinforcement, behavior modification, reality orientation, computer-training programs, and video games. Assistance from many disciplines is necessary during this phase of recovery. Even if intellectual ability does not improve, social and behavioral abilities may.

The patient recovering from a brain injury may experience fluctuations in the level of cognitive function, with orientation, attention, and memory frequently affected. When pushed to a level greater than the impaired cortical functioning allows, the patient
may show symptoms of fatigue, anger, and stress (headache, dizziness). The Rancho Los Amigos Level of Cognitive Function is a scale frequently used to assess cognitive function and evaluate ongoing recovery from head injury. Nursing management and a description of each level are included in Table 63-2.

\section*{PREVENTING SLEEP PATTERN DISTURBANCE}

Patients who require frequent monitoring of neurologic status may experience sleep deprivation. They are awakened hourly to assess LOC and as a result are deprived of long periods of sleep and rest. In an effort to allow the patient longer times of uninterrupted sleep and rest, the nurse can group nursing care activities so that the patient is disturbed less frequently. Environmental noise is decreased and the room lights are dimmed. Back rubs and other activities to increase comfort can assist in promoting sleep and rest.

\section*{SUPPORTING FAMILY COPING}

Having a loved one sustain a serious head injury can produce a great deal of prolonged stress in the family. This stress can result from the patient's physical and emotional deficits, the unpredictable outcome, and altered family relationships. Families report difficulties in coping with changes in the patient's temperament, behavior, and personality. Such changes are associated with disruption in family cohesion, loss of leisure pursuits, and loss of work capacity, as well as social isolation of the caretaker. The family may experience anger, grief, guilt, and denial in recurring cycles (Perlesz et al., 1999).

To promote effective coping, the nurse can ask the family how the patient is different at this time: What has been lost? What is most difficult about coping with this situation? Helpful interventions include providing family members with accurate and honest information and encouraging them to continue to set well-defined, mutual, short-term goals. Family counseling helps address the family members' overwhelming feelings of loss and helplessness and gives them guidance for the management of inappropriate behaviors. Support groups help the family members share problems, develop insight, gain information, network, and gain assistance in maintaining realistic expectations and hope.

The National Head Injury Foundation serves as a clearinghouse for information and resources for patients with head injuries and their families, including specific information on coma, rehabilitation, behavioral consequences of head injury, and family issues. This organization can provide names of facilities and professionals who work with patients with head injuries and can assist families in organizing local support groups. See the end of this chapter for more information on resources.

Many patients with severe head injury die of their injuries, and many of those who survive experience long-term problems that prevent them from resuming their previous roles and functions. During the most acute phase of injury, family members need support and facts from the health care team.

Many individuals with severe head injuries that result in brain death are young and otherwise healthy and are therefore considered for organ donation. Family members of patients with such injuries need support during this extremely stressful time and assistance in making decisions to end life support and permit donation of organs. They need to know that the brain-dead patient whose respiratory and cardiovascular systems are maintained through life support is not going to survive and that the severe head injury, not the removal of the patient's organs or the removal of life support, is the cause of patient's death. Bereavement counselors and members of the organ procurement team are
often very helpful to family members in making decisions about organ donation and in helping them cope with stress.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Decreased Cerebral Perfusion}

Maintenance of adequate CPP is important to prevent serious complications of head injury due to decreased cerebral perfusion (Bader \& Palmer, 2000; March, 2000). Adequate CPP is greater than 70 mm Hg . Any decrease in this pressure can impair cerebral perfusion and cause brain hypoxia and ischemia, leading to permanent damage. Therapy (eg, elevation of the head of the bed and increased intravenous fluids) is directed toward decreasing cerebral edema and increasing venous outflow from the brain. Systemic hypotension, which causes vasoconstriction and a significant decrease in CPP, is treated with increased intravenous fluids.

\section*{Cerebral Edema and Herniation}

The patient with a head injury is at risk for additional complications such as increased ICP and brain stem herniation. Cerebral edema is the most common cause of increased ICP in the patient with a head injury, with the swelling peaking approximately 48 to 72 hours after injury. Bleeding also may increase the volume of contents within the rigid closed compartment of the skull, causing increased ICP and herniation of the brain stem and resulting in irreversible brain anoxia and brain death. Measures to control ICP are listed in Chart 63-5 (Zafonte et al., 1999) and discussed in Chapter 61.

\section*{Impaired Oxygenation and Ventilation}

Impaired oxygen and ventilation may necessitate mechanical ventilatory support. The patient must be monitored for a patent airway, altered breathing patterns, and hypoxemia and pneumonia. Interventions may include endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and positive end-expiratory pressure. These topics are discussed in further detail in Chapters 25 and 61.

\section*{Impaired Fluid, Electrolyte, and Nutritional Balance}

Fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional imbalances are common in the patient with a head injury. Common imbalances may include hyponatremia, which is often associated with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (see Chaps. 14 and 42), hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia (Hickey, 2003). Modifications in fluid intake with tube feedings or intravenous fluids may be necessary to treat these imbalances. Insulin administration may be prescribed to treat hyperglycemia.

Undernutrition is also a common problem in response to the increased metabolic needs associated with severe head injury. If the patient cannot eat, enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition may be initiated within 24 hours of injury to provide adequate calories and nutrients.

\section*{Post-traumatic Seizures}

Patients with head injury are at an increased risk for posttraumatic seizures. Post-traumatic seizures are classified as immediate (within 24 hours of injury), early (within 1 to 7 days of injury), or late (more than 7 days following injury) (Kado \& Patel, 1999). Seizure prophylaxis refers to the practice of administering antiseizure medications to patients following head injury to prevent seizures. It is important to prevent post-traumatic seizures,

especially in the immediate and early phase of recovery, as seizures may increase ICP and decrease oxygenation. Many antiseizure medications impair cognitive performance, prolonging the duration of rehabilitation. Therefore, it is important to weigh the overall benefit of these medications against their side effects. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence that long-term anti-
seizure prophylaxis improves outcomes in patients with head injury. Research evidence supports the use of prophylactic antiseizure agents to prevent immediate and early seizure after head injury, but not for prevention of late seizures (Brain Trauma Foundation, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, Joint Section on Neurotrauma and Critical Care, 2000).

Gelling, L. (1999). The experience of hope for the relatives of head-injured patients admitted to a neuroscience critical care unit: A phenomenological study. Nursing in Critical Care, 4(5), 214-221.

\section*{Background}

Helping the family members of patients with their emotional needs is a crucial aspect of ICU care. Previous research has demonstrated that meeting needs can be beneficial to both families and patients. One of the most important needs families have identified is to maintain hope. The purpose of this study was to develop a better understanding of what hope means to family members in order to help nurses better meet their needs.

\section*{Study Methods and Design}

Participants were selected by approaching family members of consecutive patients admitted to a neuroscience ICU. Family members were approached after the patient had been in the ICU at least 48 hours. A total of seven patients had family members who agreed to participate. In this phenomenologic study family members were interviewed about their experiences using a semi-structured format. The interviews were transcribed and returned to the informants for verification of content. Data were analyzed for emergent themes. A summary of the findings was returned to the participants for verification.

\section*{Results}

Seven themes emerged from analysis of the interview data. The themes that relatives felt most influenced their experience of hope when they had a loved one admitted to the ICU were: 1) Relation-ships-The positive relationships between the family members and
nurses helped the family members to feel comfortable and safe with the care their loved ones were receiving; 2) Information-Inadequate or poorly delivered information led to uncertainty and difficulty in maintaining hope; 3) The Past-Lack of knowledge and initial negative experiences in the hospital made hope more difficult; 4) The Present-Unfamiliar terminology, devices, and situations needed to be assimilated by the family before they could become hopeful; 5) The future-Goal setting helped the family members have hope for a future for the patient; 6) Loss of control-Relatives felt that though they were asked by the nurses to participate in decisions, they often felt ill equipped to do so, leading to feelings of hopelessness; 7) EmotionsFamily members were often so fearful for the patient that it was difficult to have hope.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Meeting the needs of families is a key part of nursing care of the patients in a neuroscience unit and furthermore an important component of a holistic nursing approach. Nurses need to be acutely aware of the pivotal role they play in helping the family members to cope and maintain hope in a difficult situation. Nurses should encourage supportive relationships with the families, and maintain an open and honest dialogue. Families need accurate, current information on a level they can understand and assimilate. Nurses need to be cognizant that their care is crucial not just for the patient, but for the entire family.

\section*{Controlling ICP in Severely Brain-Injured Patients}
- Elevate the head of bed 30 degrees.
- Maintain the patient's head and neck in neutral alignment (no twisting).
- Initiate measures to prevent the Valsalva maneuver (eg, stool softeners).
- Maintain normal body temperature.
- Administer $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to maintain $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}>90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.
- Maintain fluid balance with normal saline solution.
- Avoid noxious stimuli (eg, excessive suctioning, painful procedures).
- Administer sedation to reduce agitation.
- Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure $>70 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

Nurses must assess patients carefully for the development of post-traumatic seizures. Risk factors that increase the likelihood of seizures are brain contusion with subdural hematoma, skull fracture, loss of consciousness or amnesia of 1 day or more, and age over 65 years (Annegers \& Coan, 2000). The nursing management of seizures is addressed in Chapter 61.

Other complications after traumatic head injury include systemic infections (pneumonia, urinary tract infection [UTI], septicemia), neurosurgical infections (wound infection, osteomyelitis, meningitis, ventriculitis, brain abscess), and heterotrophic ossification (painful bone overgrowth in weight-bearing joints).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Teaching early in the course of head injury often focuses on reinforcing information given to the family about the patient's condition and prognosis. As the patient's status and expected outcome change over time, family teaching may focus on interpretation and explanation of changes in the patient's physical and psychological responses.

If the patient's physical status allows him or her to be discharged home, the patient and family are instructed about limitations that can be expected and complications that may occur. Monitoring for complications that merit contacting the neurosurgeon is explained to the patient and family verbally and in
writing. Depending on the patient's prognosis and physical and cognitive status, the patient may be included in teaching about self-care management strategies.

Because of the risk for post-traumatic seizures, antiseizure medications may be prescribed for 1 to 2 years after injury. The patient and family require instruction about the side effects of these medications and about the importance of continuing to take them as prescribed.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Rehabilitation of the patient with a head injury begins at the time of injury and extends into the home and community. Depending on the degree of brain damage, the patient may be referred to a rehabilitation setting that specializes in cognitive restructuring of the brain-injured patient. The patient is encouraged to continue the rehabilitation program after discharge because improvement in status may continue 3 or more years after injury. Changes in the head-injured patient and the effects of long-term rehabilitation on the family and their coping abilities need frequent assessment. Teaching and continued support of the patient and family are essential as their needs and the patient's status change. Teaching points to address with the family of the head-injured patient who is about to return home are described in Chart 63-6.

Depending on his or her status, the patient is encouraged to return to normal activities gradually. Referral to support groups and the National Head Injury Foundation may be warranted.

During the acute and rehabilitation phase of care, the focus of teaching is on obvious needs, issues, and deficits. The nurse needs to remind patients and family members of the need for continuing health promotion and screening practices following these initial phases. Patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past are educated about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers.

\section*{Spinal Cord Injury}

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major health problem. Nearly 200,000 people in the United States live each day with a disability from SCI, with an estimated 11,000 new injuries occurring each year. SCI occurs almost four times more often in males than females. Young people aged 16 to 30 suffer more than half of the new SCIs each year. African Americans are at a higher risk than Caucasians, with the incidence rising in recent years. The most common cause of SCI is motor vehicle crashes, which account for 35\% of the injuries. Violence-related injures account for nearly as many SCIs ( $30 \%$ ), with falls causing $19 \%$ and sports-related injuries causing $8 \%$ (CDC, 2001). There is a high frequency of associated injuries and medical complications.

The predominant risk factors for SCI include age, gender, and alcohol and drug use. The frequency with which these risk factors are associated with SCI serves to emphasize the importance of primary prevention. The same interventions suggested earlier in this chapter for head injury prevention will serve to decrease the incidence of SCI as well (see Chart 63-1) (CDC, 2001; Elovic \& Kirschblum, 1999).

The vertebrae most frequently involved in SCI are the 5th, 6 th, and 7th cervical (neck), the 12th thoracic, and the 1st lumbar vertebrae. These vertebrae are the most susceptible because
there is a greater range of mobility in the vertebral column in these areas (Dibsie, 1998).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Damage to the spinal cord ranges from transient concussion (from which the patient fully recovers) to contusion, laceration, and compression of the cord substance (either alone or in combination), to complete transection of the cord (which renders the patient paralyzed below the level of the injury).

SCIs can be separated into two categories: primary injuries and secondary injuries (Porth, 2002). Primary injuries are the result of the initial insult or trauma and are usually permanent. Secondary injuries are usually the result of a contusion or tear injury, in which the nerve fibers begin to swell and disintegrate. A secondary chain of events produces ischemia, hypoxia, edema, and hemorrhagic lesions, which in turn result in destruction of myelin and axons (Hickey, 2003). These secondary reactions, believed to be the principal causes of spinal cord degeneration at the level of injury, are now thought to be reversible 4 to 6 hours after injury. Therefore, if the cord has not suffered irreparable damage, some method of early treatment is needed to prevent partial damage from developing into total and permanent damage (see the section on management) (Zafonte et al., 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Manifestations depend on the type and level of injury (Chart 63-7). The type of injury refers to the extent of injury to the spinal cord itself. Incomplete spinal cord lesions are classified according to the area of spinal cord damage: central, lateral, anterior, or peripheral. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) provides another standard classification of SCI according to the degree of sensory and motor function present after injury (Chart 63-8). "Neurologic level" refers to the lowest level at which sensory and motor functions are normal. Below the neurologic level, there is total sensory and motor paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control (usually with urinary retention and bladder distention), loss of sweating and vasomotor tone, and marked reduction of blood pressure from loss of peripheral vascular resistance. A complete spinal cord lesion can result in paraplegia (paralysis of the lower body) or quadriplegia (paralysis of all four extremities).

If conscious, the patient usually complains of acute pain in the back or neck, which may radiate along the involved nerve. Absence of pain, however, does not rule out spinal injury, and a careful assessment of the spine should be done in the face of any significant mechanism of injury. Often the patient speaks of fear that the neck or back is broken.

Respiratory dysfunction is related to the level of injury. The muscles contributing to respiration are the abdominals and intercostals (T1 to T11) and the diaphragm. In high cervical cord injury, acute respiratory failure is the leading cause of death.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A detailed neurologic examination is performed. Diagnostic x-rays (lateral cervical spine x-rays) and CT scanning are usually performed initially. An MRI scan may be ordered as a further workup if a ligamentous injury is suspected, since significant spinal cord damage may exist even in the absence of bony injury. A search is made for other injuries, because spinal trauma often is accompanied by concomitant injuries, commonly to the head

\section*{Effects of Spinal Cord Injuries}

Central Cord Syndrome
- Characteristics: Motor deficits (in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities; sensory loss varies but is more pronounced in the upper extremities); bowel/bladder dysfunction is variable, or function may be completely preserved.
- Cause: Injury or edema of the central cord, usually of the cervical area.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-424.jpg?height=1486&width=776&top_left_y=219&top_left_x=1145)

\section*{Anterior Cord Syndrome}
- Characteristics: Loss of pain, temperature, and motor function is noted below the level of the lesion; light touch, position, and vibration sensation remain intact.
- Cause: The syndrome may be caused by acute disk herniation or hyperflexion injuries associated with fracture-dislocation of vertebra. It also may occur as a result of injury to the anterior spinal artery, which supplies the anterior two thirds of the spinal cord.

\section*{Brown-Sequard Syndrome (Lateral Cord Syndrome)}
- Characteristics: Ipsilateral paralysis or paresis is noted, together with ipsilateral loss of touch, pressure, and vibration and contralateral loss of pain and temperature.
- Cause: The lesion is caused by a transverse hemisection of the cord (half of the cord is transected from north to south), usually as a result of a knife or missile injury, fracturedislocation of a unilateral articular process, or possibly an acute ruptured disk.

and chest. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring may be indicated if a cord injury is suspected since bradycardia (slow heart rate) and asystole (cardiac standstill) are common in acute spinal injuries.

\section*{Emergency Management}

The immediate management of the patient at the scene of the injury is critical, because improper handling can cause further damage and loss of neurologic function. Any patient involved in a motor vehicle or diving injury, a contact sports injury, a fall, or any direct trauma to the head and neck must be considered to have SCI until such an injury is ruled out. Initial care must include a rapid assessment, immobilization, extrication, stabilization or control of life-threatening injuries, and transportation to the most appropriate medical facility.

At the scene of the injury, the patient must be immobilized on a spinal (back) board, with head and neck in a neutral position, to prevent an incomplete injury from becoming complete. One member of the team must assume control of the patient's head to prevent flexion, rotation, or extension; this is done by placing the hands on both sides of the patient's head at about the ear to limit movement and maintain alignment while a spinal board or cervical immobilizing device is applied. If possible, at least four people should slide the victim carefully onto a board for transfer to the hospital. Any twisting movement may irreversibly damage the spinal cord by causing a bony fragment of the vertebra to cut into, crush, or sever the cord completely.

The patient must be referred to a regional spinal injury or trauma center because of the multidisciplinary personnel and support services required to counteract the destructive changes that occur in the first few hours after injury. During treatment in the emergency and x-ray departments, the patient is kept on the transfer board. The patient must always be maintained in an extended position. No part of the body should be twisted or turned, nor should the patient be allowed to sit up. Once the extent of the injury has been determined, the patient may be placed on a rotating bed (Fig. 63-7) or in a cervical collar (Fig. 63-8). Later, if SCI and bone instability have been ruled out, the patient can be moved to a conventional bed or the collar removed without harm. If a rotating bed is needed but not available, the patient should be placed in a cervical collar and on a firm mattress with a bedboard under it.

\section*{Management of Spinal Cord Injuries (Acute Phase)}

The goals of management are to prevent further SCI and to observe for symptoms of progressive neurologic deficits. The patient is resuscitated as necessary, and oxygenation and cardiovascular stability are maintained. Many changes in the treatment of SCI have occurred during the past 20 years. Treatments such as hypothermia, corticosteroids, and naloxone were investigated and used during the 1980s; of these, high-dose corticosteroids have shown the most promise, but their use remains controversial (Short et al., 2000). Currently, regeneration therapy is being investigated; this involves transplanting fetal tissue into the injured spinal cord in hopes of regenerating the damaged tissue (Vacanti et al., 2001). SCI continues to be a devastating event, and new treatment methods are continually being investigated.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

In some studies, the administration of high-dose corticosteroids, specifically methylprednisolone, has been found to improve motor and sensory outcomes at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year if given within 8 hours of injury (Hickey, 2003). In other studies, little improvement was found (Short et al., 2000). Use of highdose methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is accepted as standard therapy in many countries and remains an established clinical practice in most institutions in the United States (Bracken, 2000; Hickey, 2003).

\section*{RESPIRATORY THERAPY}

Oxygen is administered to maintain a high arterial $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ because hypoxemia can create or worsen a neurologic deficit of the spinal cord. If endotracheal intubation is necessary, extreme care is taken to avoid flexing or extending the patient's neck, which can result in an extension of a cervical injury.

In high cervical spine injuries, spinal cord innervation to the phrenic nerve, which stimulates the diaphragm, is lost. Di-

aphragmatic pacing (electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve) attempts to stimulate the diaphragm to help the patient breathe. Diaphragmatic pacing may be considered for the patient with a high cervical lesion but is usually carried out after the acute phase.

\section*{SKELETAL FRACTURE REDUCTION AND TRACTION}

Management of SCI requires immobilization and reduction of dislocations (restoration of normal position) and stabilization of the vertebral column.

Cervical fractures are reduced and the cervical spine is aligned with some form of skeletal traction, such as skeletal tongs or calipers, or with use of the halo device. Early surgical stabilization has reduced the need for cervical traction in many patients with cervical spine injuries (Gaebler et al., 1999). A variety of skeletal tongs are available, all of which involve fixation in the skull in some manner (Fig. 63-9). The Gardner-Wells tongs require no predrilled holes in the skull. Crutchfield and Vinke tongs are inserted through holes made in the skull with a special drill under local anesthesia.

Traction is applied to the tongs by weights, the amount depending on the size of the patient and the degree of fracture dis-

FIGURE 63-9 Traction for cervical fractures may be applied with tongs.
placement. The traction force is exerted along the longitudinal axis of the vertebral bodies, with the patient's neck in a neutral position. The traction is then gradually increased by adding more weights. As the amount of traction is increased, the spaces between the intervertebral disks widen and the vertebrae may slip back into position. Reduction usually takes place after correct alignment has been restored. Once reduction is achieved, as verified by cervical spine x-rays and neurologic examination, the weights are gradually removed until the amount of weight needed to maintain the alignment is identified. The weights should hang freely so as not to interfere with the traction. Traction is sometimes supplemented with manual manipulation of the neck by a surgeon to help achieve realignment of the vertebral bodies.

A halo device may be used initially with traction or may be applied after removal of the tongs. It consists of a stainless-steel halo ring that is fixed to the skull by four pins. The ring is attached to a removable halo vest, which suspends the weight of the unit circumferentially around the chest. A metal frame connects the ring to the chest. Halo devices provide immobilization of the cervical spine while allowing early ambulation (Fig. 63-10).

Thoracic and lumbar injuries are usually treated with surgical intervention followed by immobilization with a fitted brace. Traction is not indicated either before or after surgery.

\section*{Surgical Management}

Surgery is indicated in any of the following instances:
- Compression of the cord is evident.
- The injury results in a fragmented or unstable vertebral body.
- The injury involves a wound that penetrates the cord.
- There are bony fragments in the spinal canal.
- The patient's neurologic status is deteriorating.

Surgery is performed to reduce the spinal fracture or dislocation or to decompress the cord. A laminectomy (excision of the posterior arches and spinous processes of a vertebra) may be indicated in the presence of progressive neurologic deficit, suspected epidural hematoma, bony fragments, or penetrating injuries that require surgical débridement, or to permit direct visualization and exploration of the cord. Vertebral bodies may also be surgically fused to create a stable spinal column.

\section*{Management of Complications of Spinal Cord Injury}

\section*{SPINAL AND NEUROGENIC SHOCK}

The spinal shock associated with SCI represents a sudden depression of reflex activity in the spinal cord (areflexia) below the level of injury. The muscles innervated by the part of the spinal cord segment below the level of the lesion are without sensation, paralyzed, and flaccid, and the reflexes are absent. In particular, the reflexes that initiate bladder and bowel function are affected. Bowel distention and paralytic ileus can be caused by depression of the reflexes and are treated with intestinal decompression by insertion of a nasogastric tube (Hickey, 2003).

Neurogenic shock develops due to the loss of autonomic nervous system function below the level of the lesion (Hickey, 2003). The vital organs are affected, causing the blood pressure and heart rate to fall. This loss of sympathetic innervation causes a variety

of other clinical manifestations, including a decrease in cardiac output, venous pooling in the extremities, and peripheral vasodilation. In addition, the patient does not perspire on the paralyzed portions of the body because sympathetic activity is blocked; therefore, close observation is required for early detection of an abrupt onset of fever. (A discussion of neurogenic shock can be found in Chap. 15.)

NURSING ALERT The patient's vital organ functions and body defenses must be supported and maintained until spinal and neurogenic shock abates and the neurologic system has recovered from the traumatic insult; that can take up to 4 months (Hickey, 2003).

With injuries to the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord, innervation to the major accessory muscles of respiration is lost and respiratory problems develop. These include decreased vital capacity, retention of secretions, increased $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ levels and decreased oxygen levels, respiratory failure, and pulmonary edema.

NURSING ALERT Special attention also must be directed to the respiratory system. The patient may be unable to generate sufficient intrathoracic pressure to cough effectively. Chest physical therapy and suctioning may assist in clearance of pulmonary secretions.

\section*{DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS}

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a potential complication of immobility and is common in patients with SCI. Patients who develop DVT are at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), a lifethreatening complication. One estimate from a meta-analysis of recent studies of the incidence of DVT and PE in SCI patients put the rate at $6.3 \%$ for PE and $17.4 \%$ for DVT (Velmahos et al., 2000). Manifestations of PE include pleuritic chest pain, anxiety, shortness of breath, and abnormal blood gas values (increased $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and decreased $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ). Thigh and calf measurements are made daily. The patient is evaluated for the presence of DVT if there is a significant increase in the circumference of one extremity. Low-dose anticoagulation therapy usually is initiated to prevent DVT and PE, along with thigh-high elastic compression stockings or pneumatic compression devices. In some cases, permanent indwelling filters (see Chap. 31) may be placed in the vena cava to prevent dislodged clots (emboli) from migrating to the lungs and causing pulmonary emboli (Velmahos et al., 2000).

\section*{OTHER COMPLICATIONS}

In addition to respiratory complications (respiratory failure, pneumonia) and autonomic dysreflexia (characterized by pounding headache, profuse sweating, nasal congestion, piloerection ["goose bumps"], bradycardia, and hypertension), other complications that may occur include pressure ulcers and infection (urinary, respiratory, and local infection at the skeletal traction pin sites) (Sullivan, 1999).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE SPINAL CORD INJURY}

\section*{Assessment}

The breathing pattern is observed, the strength of the cough is assessed, and the lungs are auscultated, because paralysis of abdominal and respiratory muscles diminishes coughing and makes it difficult to clear bronchial and pharyngeal secretions. Reduced excursion of the chest also results.

The patient is monitored closely for any changes in motor or sensory function and for symptoms of progressive neurologic damage. It may be impossible in the early stages of SCI to determine whether the cord has been severed, because signs and symptoms of cord edema are indistinguishable from those of cord transection. Edema of the spinal cord may occur with any severe cord injury and may further compromise spinal cord function.

Motor and sensory functions are assessed through careful neurologic examination. These findings are recorded most often on a flow sheet so that changes in the baseline neurologic status can be closely monitored accurately. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification is commonly used to describe level of function for SCI patients. Chart 63-7 also gives an example of nursing assessment of spinal cord function.
- Motor ability is tested by asking the patient to spread the fingers, squeeze the examiner's hand, and move the toes or turn the feet.
- Sensation is evaluated by gently pinching the skin or touching it lightly with a small object such as a tongue blade, starting at shoulder level and working down both sides of the extremities. The patient should have both eyes closed so that the examination reveals true findings, not what the patient hopes to feel. The patient is asked where the sensation is felt.
- Any decrease in neurologic function is reported immediately.

The patient is also assessed for spinal shock, a complete loss of all reflex, motor, sensory, and autonomic activity below the level of the lesion that causes bladder paralysis and distention. The lower abdomen is palpated for signs of urinary retention and overdistention of the bladder. Further assessment is made for gastric dilation and ileus due to an atonic bowel, a result of autonomic disruption.

Temperature is monitored because the patient may have periods of hyperthermia as a result of alteration in temperature control due to autonomic disruption.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective breathing patterns related to weakness or paralysis of abdominal and intercostal muscles and inability to clear secretions
- Ineffective airway clearance related to weakness of intercostal muscles
- Impaired physical mobility related to motor and sensory impairment
- Disturbed sensory perception related to motor and sensory impairment
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility and sensory loss
- Urinary retention related to inability to void spontaneously
- Constipation related to presence of atonic bowel as a result of autonomic disruption
- Acute pain and discomfort related to treatment and prolonged immobility

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include:
- DVT
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Autonomic dysreflexia

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include improved breathing pattern and airway clearance, improved mobility, improved sensory and perceptual awareness, maintenance of skin integrity, relief of urinary retention, improved bowel function, promotion of comfort, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING ADEQUATE BREATHING AND AIRWAY CLEARANCE}

Possible impending respiratory failure is detected by observing the patient, measuring vital capacity, monitoring oxygen saturation through pulse oximetry, and monitoring arterial blood gas values. Early and vigorous attention to clearing bronchial and pharyngeal secretions can prevent retention of secretions and atelectasis. Suctioning may be indicated, but caution must be used during suctioning because this procedure can stimulate the vagus nerve, producing bradycardia, which can result in cardiac arrest.

If the patient cannot cough effectively because of decreased inspiratory volume and inability to generate sufficient expiratory pressure, chest physical therapy and assisted coughing may be indicated. Specific breathing exercises are supervised by the nurse to increase the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles, particularly the diaphragm. Assisted coughing promotes clearing of secretions from the upper respiratory tract and is similar to using abdominal thrusts to clear an airway (see Chap. 25). It is important to ensure proper humidification and hydration to prevent secretions from becoming thick and difficult to remove even with coughing. The patient is assessed for signs of respiratory infection (cough, fever, dyspnea). Smoking is discouraged because it increases bronchial and pulmonary secretions and impairs ciliary action.

Ascending edema of the spinal cord in the acute phase may cause respiratory difficulty that requires immediate intervention. Therefore, the patient's respiratory status must be monitored frequently.

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

Proper body alignment is maintained at all times. The patient is repositioned frequently and is assisted out of bed as soon as the spinal column is stabilized. The feet are prone to footdrop; therefore, various types of splints are used to prevent footdrop. When used, the splints are removed and reapplied every 2 hours. Trochanter rolls, applied from the crest of the ilium to the midthigh of both legs, help prevent external rotation of the hip joints.

Patients with lesions above the midthoracic level have loss of sympathetic control of peripheral vasoconstrictor activity, leading to hypotension. These patients may tolerate changes in position poorly and require monitoring of blood pressure when positions are changed. Usually the patient is turned every 2 hours. If not on a rotating bed, the patient should not be turned unless the spine is stable and the physician has indicated that it is safe to do so.

Contractures develop rapidly with immobility and muscle paralysis. A joint that is immobilized too long becomes fixed as a result of contractures of the tendon and joint capsule. Atrophy of the extremities results from disuse. Contractures and other complications may be prevented by range-of-motion exercises that help preserve joint motion and stimulate circulation. Passive range-ofmotion exercises should be implemented as soon as possible after injury. Toes, metatarsals, ankles, knees, and hips should be put through a full range of motion at least four, and ideally five, times daily.

For most patients with a cervical fracture without neurologic deficit, reduction in traction followed by rigid immobilization for about 6 to 8 weeks restores skeletal integrity. These patients are allowed to move gradually to an erect position. A four-poster neck brace or molded collar is applied when the patient is mobilized after traction is removed (see Fig. 63-8).

\section*{PROMOTING ADAPTATION TO SENSORY AND PERCEPTUAL ALTERATIONS}

The nurse assists the patient to compensate for sensory and perceptual alterations that occur with SCI. The intact senses above the level of the injury are stimulated through touch, aromas, flavorful food and beverages, conversation, and music. Additional strategies include the following:
- Providing prism glasses to enable the patient to see from the supine position
- Encouraging use of hearing aids, if indicated, to enable the patient to hear conversations and environmental sounds
- Providing emotional support to the patient
- Teaching the patient strategies to compensate for or cope with these deficits

\section*{MAINTAINING SKIN INTEGRITY}

Because the patient with SCI is immobilized and has loss of sensation below the level of the lesion, there is an ever-present, lifethreatening risk of pressure ulcers. In areas of local tissue ischemia, where there is continuous pressure and where the peripheral circulation is inadequate as a result of the spinal shock and recumbent position, pressure ulcers have developed within 6 hours. Prolonged immobilization of the patient on a transfer board increases the risk of pressure ulcers. The most common sites are over the ischial tuberosity, the greater trochanter, and the sacrum. In addition, patients who wear cervical collars for prolonged periods may develop breakdown from the pressure of the collar under the chin, on the shoulders, and at the occiput.

The patient's position is changed at least every 2 hours. Turning not only assists in the prevention of pressure ulcers but also prevents the pooling of blood and tissue fluid in the dependent areas.

Careful inspection of the skin is made each time the patient is turned. The skin over the pressure points is assessed for redness or breaks; the perineum is checked for soilage and the catheter is observed for adequate drainage. The patient's general body alignment and comfort are assessed. Special attention should be given to pressure areas in contact with the transfer board.

The patient's skin should be kept clean by washing with a mild soap, rinsed well, and blotted dry. Pressure-sensitive areas should be kept well lubricated and soft with bland cream or lotion. The patient is informed about the danger of pressure ulcers to encourage understanding of the reason for preventive measures. See Chapter 11 for other aspects of the prevention of pressure ulcers.

NURSING ALERT Never massage the calves or thighs due to the danger of dislodging an undetected DVT.

\section*{MAINTAINING URINARY ELIMINATION}

Immediately after SCI, the urinary bladder becomes atonic and cannot contract by reflex activity. Urinary retention is the immediate result. Because the patient has no sensation of bladder distention, overstretching of the bladder and detrusor muscle may occur, delaying the return of bladder function.

Intermittent catheterization is carried out to avoid overdistention of the bladder and UTI. If this is not feasible, an indwelling catheter is inserted temporarily. At an early stage, family members are shown how to carry out intermittent catheterization and are encouraged to participate in this facet of care, because they will be involved in long-term follow-up and must be able to recognize complications so that treatment can be instituted.

The patient is taught to record fluid intake, voiding pattern, amounts of residual urine after catheterization, characteristics of urine, and any unusual sensations that may occur. The management of a neurogenic bladder is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.

\section*{IMPROVING BOWEL FUNCTION}

Immediately after SCI, a paralytic ileus usually develops due to neurogenic paralysis of the bowel; therefore, a nasogastric tube is often required to relieve distention and prevent aspiration.

Bowel activity usually returns within the first week. As soon as bowel sounds are heard on auscultation, the patient is given a high-calorie, high-protein, high-fiber diet, with the amount of food gradually increased. The nurse administers prescribed stool softeners to counteract the effects of immobility and pain medications. A bowel program is instituted as early as possible.

\section*{PROVIDING COMFORT MEASURES}

After cervical injury, if pins, tongs, or calipers are in place, the skull is assessed for signs of infection, including drainage. The back of the head is checked periodically for signs of pressure, with care taken not to move the neck. The hair around the tongs usually is shaved to facilitate inspection. Probing under encrusted areas is avoided.

\section*{The Patient in Halo Traction}

Patients who have been placed in a halo device after cervical stabilization may have a slight headache or discomfort around the skull pins for several days after the pins are inserted. The patient initially may be bothered by the rather startling appearance of this apparatus but usually readily adapts to it because the device provides comfort for the unstable neck. The patient may complain of being caged in and of noise created by any object coming in contact with the steel frame, but he or she can be reassured that adaptation to such annoyances will occur.

The areas around the pin sites are cleansed daily and observed for redness, drainage, and pain. The pins are observed for loosening, which may contribute to infection. If one of the pins becomes detached, the head is stabilized in a neutral position by one
person while another notifies the neurosurgeon. A torque screwdriver should be readily available should the screws on the frame need tightening.

The skin under the halo vest is inspected for excessive perspiration, redness, and skin blistering, especially on the bony prominences. The vest is opened at the sides to allow the torso to be washed. The liner of the vest should not become wet, because dampness causes skin excoriation. Powder is not used inside the vest, because it may contribute to the development of pressure ulcers. The liner should be changed periodically to promote hygiene and good skin care. If the patient is to be discharged with the vest, detailed instructions must be given to the family and time allowed for them to return demonstrate the necessary skills (Chart 63-9).

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Thrombophlebitis}

Thrombophlebitis is a relatively common complication in patients after SCI. DVT occurs in a high percentage of SCI patients; thus, they are at risk for PE. The patient must be assessed for symptoms of thrombophlebitis and PE: chest pain, shortness of breath, and changes in arterial blood gas values must be reported promptly to the physician. The circumferences of the thighs and calves are measured and recorded daily; further diagnostic studies will be performed if a significant increase is noted. Patients remain at high risk for thrombophlebitis for several months after the initial injury. Patients with paraplegia or quadriplegia are at increased risk for the rest of their lives. Immobilization and the associated venous stasis, as well as varying degrees of autonomic disruption, contribute to the high risk and susceptibility for DVT (Zafonte et al., 1999).

Anticoagulation is initiated once head and other systemic injuries have been ruled out. Low-dose fractionated or unfractionated heparin may be followed by long-term oral anticoagulation (ie, warfarin) or subcutaneous fractionated heparin injections. Additional measures such as range-of-motion exercises, thighhigh elastic compression stockings, and adequate hydration are important preventive measures. Pneumatic compression devices may also be used to reduce venous pooling and promote venous return. It is also important to avoid external pressure on the lower extremities that may result from flexion of the knees while the patient is in bed.

\section*{Orthostatic Hypotension}

For the first 2 weeks after SCI, the blood pressure tends to be unstable and quite low. There is a gradual return to preinjury levels, but periodic episodes of severe orthostatic hypotension frequently interfere with efforts to mobilize the patient. Interruption in the reflex arcs that normally produce vasoconstriction in the upright position, coupled with vasodilation and pooling in abdominal and lower extremity vessels, can result in blood pressure readings of 40 mm Hg systolic and 0 mm Hg diastolic. Orthostatic hypotension is a particularly common problem for patients with lesions above T7. In some quadriplegic patients, even slight elevations of the head can result in dramatic changes in blood pressure.

A number of techniques can be used to reduce the frequency of hypotensive episodes. Close monitoring of vital signs before and during position changes is essential. Vasopressor medication can be used to treat the profound vasodilation. Thigh-high elastic compression stockings should be applied to improve venous return from the lower extremities. Abdominal binders may also be used to encourage venous return and provide diaphragmatic support when upright. Activity should be planned in advance and adequate time given for a slow progression of position changes from recumbent to sitting and upright. Tilt tables frequently are helpful in assisting patients to make this transition.

\section*{Autonomic Dysreflexia}

Autonomic dysreflexia (autonomic hyperreflexia) is an acute emergency that occurs as a result of exaggerated autonomic responses to stimuli that are harmless in normal people. It occurs only after spinal shock has resolved. This syndrome is characterized by a severe, pounding headache with paroxysmal hypertension, profuse diaphoresis (most often of the forehead), nausea, nasal congestion, and bradycardia. It occurs among patients with cord lesions above T6 (the sympathetic visceral outflow level) after spinal shock has subsided. The sudden rise in blood pressure may cause a rupture of one or more cerebral blood vessels or lead to increased ICP. A number of stimuli may trigger this reflex: distended bladder (the most common cause); distention or contraction of the visceral organs, especially the bowel (from constipation, impaction); or stimulation of the skin (tactile, pain, thermal stimuli, pressure ulcer). Because this is an emergency situation, the objective is to remove the triggering stimulus and to avoid the possibly serious complications.

The following measures are carried out:
- The patient is placed immediately in a sitting position to lower blood pressure.
- Rapid assessment to identify and alleviate the cause is imperative.
- The bladder is emptied immediately via a urinary catheter. If an indwelling catheter is not patent, it is irrigated or replaced with another catheter.
- The rectum is examined for a fecal mass. If one is present, a topical anesthetic is inserted 10 to 15 minutes before the mass is removed, because visceral distention or contraction can cause autonomic dysreflexia.
- The skin is examined for any areas of pressure, irritation, or broken skin.
- Any other stimulus that can be the triggering event, such as an object on the skin or a draft of cold air, must be removed.
- If these measures do not relieve the hypertension and excruciating headache, a ganglionic blocking agent (hydralazine hydrochloride [Apresoline]) is prescribed and given slowly intravenously.
- The medical record or chart should be labeled with a clearly visible note about the risk for autonomic dysreflexia.
- The patient is instructed about prevention and management measures.
- Any patient with a lesion above the T6 segment is informed that such an episode is possible and may even occur many years after the initial injury.

The rehabilitation of the patient with a SCI (ie, the quadriplegic or paraplegic patient) is discussed below.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

In most cases, SCI patients need long-term rehabilitation. The process begins during hospitalization as acute symptoms begin to subside or come under better control and the overall deficits and long-term effects of the injury become clear. The goals begin to shift from merely surviving the injury to learning strategies necessary to cope with the alterations that injury imposes on activities of daily living. The emphasis shifts from ensuring that the patient is stable and free of complications to specific assessment and planning designed to meet the patient's rehabilitation needs. Patient teaching may initially focus on the injury and its effects on mobility, dressing, and bowel, bladder, and sexual function. As the patient and family acknowledge the consequences of the injury, the focus of teaching may broaden to address issues necessary to carry out the tasks of daily living. Teaching begins in the acute phase and continues throughout rehabilitation and throughout the patient's life as changes occur, the patient ages, and problems arise.

Caring for the SCI patient at home may at first seem a daunting task to the family. They will require dedicated nursing support to gradually assume full care of the patient (Craig et al., 1999).

Although maintaining function and preventing complications will remain important, goals regarding self-care and preparation for discharge will assist in a smooth transition to rehabilitation and eventually to the community.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The ultimate goal of the rehabilitation process is independence. The nurse becomes a support to both the patient and the family,
assisting them to assume responsibility for increasing aspects of patient care and management. Care for the SCI patient involves members of all the health care disciplines; these may include nursing, medicine, rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, physical and occupational therapy, case management, social services, and so forth. The nurse often serves as coordinator of the management team and as a liaison with rehabilitation centers and home care agencies. The patient and family often require assistance in dealing with the psychological impact of the injury and its consequences; referral to a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist or other mental health care professional often is helpful.

The nurse should reassure female SCI patients that pregnancy is not contraindicated, but pregnant women with acute or chronic SCI pose unique management challenges. The normal physiologic changes of pregnancy may predispose women with SCI to many potentially life-threatening complications, including autonomic dysreflexia, pyelonephritis, respiratory insufficiency, thrombophlebitis, PE, and unattended delivery (Atterbury \& Groome, 1998).

As more patients survive acute SCI, they will face the changes associated with aging with a disability. Thus, teaching in the home and community focuses on health promotion and addresses the need to minimize risk factors (eg, smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, obesity). Home care nurses and others who have contact with patients with SCI are in a position to teach patients about healthy lifestyles, remind them of the need for health screenings, and make referrals as appropriate. Assisting patients to identify accessible health care providers and imaging centers may increase the likelihood that they will participate in health screening (eg, gynecologic examinations, mammograms, etc.).

\section*{Management of the Quadriplegic or Paraplegic Patient}

Quadriplegia refers to the loss of movement and sensation in all four extremities and the trunk, associated with injury to the cervical spinal cord. Paraplegia refers to loss of motion and sensation in the lower extremities and all or part of the trunk as a result of damage to the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord or to the sacral root. Both conditions most frequently follow trauma such as falls, injuries, and gunshot wounds, but they may also be the result of spinal cord lesions (intervertebral disk, tumor, vascular lesions), multiple sclerosis, infections and abscesses of the spinal cord, and congenital disorders.

The patient faces a lifetime of great disability, requiring ongoing follow-up and care and the expertise of a number of health professionals, including physicians (specifically a physiatrist), rehabilitation nurses, occupational therapist, physical therapist, psychologist, social worker, rehabilitation engineer, and vocational counselor at different times as the need arises.

As the years go by, these patients also have the same medical problems as others in the aging population. In addition, they face the threat of complications associated with their disability. Usually the patient is encouraged to attend a spinal clinic when complications and other issues arise. Lifetime care includes assessment of the urinary tract at prescribed intervals, because there is the likelihood of continuing alteration in detrusor and sphincter function and the patient is prone to UTI.

Long-term problems and complications of SCI include disuse syndrome, autonomic dysreflexia (discussed earlier), bladder and kidney infections, spasticity, and depression. Pressure ulcers with potential complications of sepsis, osteomyelitis, and fistulas occur in about $10 \%$ of patients. Flexor muscle spasms may be particularly disabling and occur in up to $25 \%$ of patients (Sullivan, 1999). Heterotopic ossification (overgrowth of bone) in the hips, knees, shoulders, and elbows occurs in up to $30 \%$ of SCI patients. This complication is painful and can produce a loss of range of motion (Mitcho \& Yanko, 1999; Subbarao \& Garrison, 1999). Management includes observing for and addressing any alteration in physiologic status and psychological outlook, and the prevention and treatment of long-term complications. The nursing role involves emphasizing the need for vigilance in selfassessment and care.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH QUADRIPLEGIA OR PARAPLEGIA}

\section*{Assessment}

Assessment focuses on the patient's general condition, complications, and how the patient is managing at that particular point in time. A head-to-toe assessment and review of systems should be part of the database, with emphasis on the areas prone to problems in this population. A thorough inspection of all areas of the skin for redness or breakdown is critical. It is also important to review with the patient the established bowel and bladder program, because the program must continue uninterrupted. Patients with quadriplegia or paraplegia have varying degrees of loss of motor power, deep and superficial sensation, vasomotor control, bladder and bowel control, and sexual function. They are faced with potential complications related to immobility, skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, recurring UTI, contractures, and psychosocial disruptions. Knowledge about these particular issues can further guide the assessment in any setting. Nurses in all settings, including home care, must be aware of these potential complications in the lifetime management of these patients.

An understanding of the emotional and psychological responses to quadriplegia or paraplegia is achieved by observing the responses and behaviors of the patient and family and by listening to their concerns (see Chart 63-10 for a discussion of ethical issues). Documenting these assessments and reviewing the plan with the entire team on a regular basis provide insight into how both the patient and the family are coping with the changes in lifestyle and body functioning. Additional information frequently can be gathered from the social worker or psychiatric/mental health worker.

\section*{Chart 63-10 - Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{When the Patient Wants to Die . . .}

\section*{Situation}

A 70-year-old man has been in neurologic intensive care since he suffered a complete C1-C2 cervical fracture 2 weeks ago, which left him quadriplegic and ventilator-dependent. Since his admission, he has asked to be allowed to die. He has a living will and his wife is his designated durable power of attorney for health care. Before his injury, his health was exceptional. He played golf daily and was very active. He is awake, alert, and oriented and can communicate by letter board. He states that he does not want to spend his life unable to do the things he enjoys. He continues to request extubation so that he can die. His family and friends are with him, and he has asked his attorneys to tend to his affairs. With the loving support of his family, the decision to remove the ventilator has been made. Sedatives will be administered to help him deal with hypoxia and anoxia.

\section*{Dilemma}

What is the nurse's role in caring for this patient at this time?

\section*{Discussion}

Is the removal of the ventilator an act of assisted suicide? Is it active or passive euthanasia? What is the nurse's role in caring for the patient if this action conflicts with his/her personal beliefs? If no other nurse is available to provide care? If the physician writes the order for the nurse to remove the ventilator?

It takes time for the patient and family to comprehend the magnitude of the disability. They may go through stages of grief, including shock, disbelief, denial, anger, depression, and acceptance. During the acute phase of the injury, denial can be a protective mechanism to shield patients from the overwhelming reality of what has happened. As they realize the permanent nature of paraplegia or quadriplegia, the grieving process may be prolonged and all-encompassing because of the recognition that long-held plans and expectations may be interrupted or permanently altered. A period of depression often follows as the patient experiences a loss of self-esteem in areas of self-identity, sexual functioning, and social and emotional roles. Exploration and assessment of these issues can assist in developing a meaningful plan of care.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses of the patient with quadriplegia or paraplegia may include the following:
- Impaired physical mobility related to loss of motor function
- Risk for disuse syndrome
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to permanent sensory loss and immobility
- Urinary retention related to level of injury
- Constipation related to effects of spinal cord disruption
- Sexual dysfunction related to neurologic dysfunction
- Ineffective coping related to impact of dysfunction on daily living
- Deficient knowledge about requirements for long-term management

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on all the assessment data, potential complications of quadriplegia or paraplegia that may develop include:
- Spasticity
- Infection and sepsis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include attainment of some form of mobility, maintenance of healthy, intact skin, achievement of bladder management without infection, achievement of bowel control, achievement of sexual expression, strengthening of coping mechanisms, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The patient requires extensive rehabilitation, which is less difficult if appropriate nursing management has been carried out during the acute phase of the injury or illness. Nursing care is one of the key factors determining the success of the rehabilitation program. The main objective is for the patient to live as independently as possible in the home and community.

\section*{INCREASING MOBILITY}

\section*{Exercise Programs}

The unaffected parts of the body are built up to optimal strength to promote maximal self-care. The muscles of the hands, arms,
shoulders, chest, spine, abdomen, and neck must be strengthened in the paraplegic patient because he or she must bear full weight on these muscles to ambulate. The triceps and the latissimus dorsi are important muscles used in crutch walking. The muscles of the abdomen and the back also are necessary for balance and for maintaining the upright position.

To strengthen these muscles, the patient can do push-ups when in a prone position and sit-ups when in a sitting position. Extending the arms while holding weights (traction weights can be used) also develops muscle strength. Squeezing rubber balls or crumbling newspaper promotes hand strength.

With encouragement from all members of the rehabilitation team, the paraplegic patient can develop the increased exercise tolerance needed for gait training and ambulation activities. The importance of maintaining cardiovascular fitness is stressed to the patient. Alternative exercises to increase the heart rate to target levels must be designed within the patient's abilities.

\section*{Mobilization}

When the spine is stable enough to allow the patient to assume an upright posture, mobilization activities are initiated. A brace or vest may be used, depending on the level of the lesion. A patient whose paralysis is due to complete transection of the cord can begin weight-bearing early because no further damage can be incurred. The sooner muscles are used, the less chance there is of disuse atrophy. The earlier the patient is brought to a standing position, the less opportunity for osteoporotic changes to take place in the long bones. Weight-bearing also reduces the possibility of renal calculi and enhances many other metabolic processes.

Braces and crutches enable some paraplegic patients to ambulate for short distances. Ambulation using crutches requires a high expenditure of energy. Motorized wheelchairs and specially equipped vans can provide greater independence and mobility for patients with high-level SCI or other lesions. Every effort should be made to encourage the patient to be as mobile and active as possible.

\section*{PREVENTING DISUSE SYNDROME}

Patients are at high risk for developing contractures as a result of disuse syndrome due to the musculoskeletal system changes (atrophy) brought about by the loss of motor and sensory functions below the level of injury. Range-of-motion exercises must be provided at least four times a day, and care is taken to stretch the Achilles tendon with exercises (Hickey, 2003). The patient is repositioned frequently and maintained in proper body alignment whether in bed or in a wheelchair (Hickey, 2003).

\section*{PROMOTING SKIN INTEGRITY}

Because these patients spend a great portion of their lives in wheelchairs, pressure ulcers are an ever-present threat. Contributing factors are permanent sensory loss over pressure areas; immobility, which makes relief of pressure difficult; trauma from bumps (against the wheelchair, toilet, furniture, and so forth) that cause unperceived abrasions and wounds; loss of protective function of the skin from excoriation and maceration due to excessive perspiration and possible urinary and fecal incontinence; and poor general health (anemia, edema, malnutrition), leading to poor tissue perfusion. The prevention and management of pressure ulcers are discussed in detail in Chapter 11.

The person with quadriplegia or paraplegia must take responsibility for monitoring (or directing) his or her skin status. This
involves relieving pressure and not remaining in any position for longer than 2 hours, in addition to ensuring that the skin receives meticulous attention and cleansing. The patient is taught that ulcers develop over bony prominences exposed to unrelieved pressure in the lying and sitting positions. The most vulnerable areas are identified. The paraplegic patient is instructed to use mirrors, if possible, to inspect these areas morning and night, observing for redness, slight edema, or any abrasions. While in bed, the patient should turn at 2-hour intervals and then inspect the skin again for redness that does not fade on pressure. The bottom sheet should be checked for wetness and for creases. The quadriplegic or paraplegic patient who cannot perform these activities is encouraged to direct others to check these areas and prevent ulcers from developing.

The patient is taught to relieve pressure while in the wheelchair by doing push-ups, leaning from side to side to relieve ischial pressure, and tilting forward while leaning on a table. The caregiver for the quadriplegic patient will need to perform these activities if the patient cannot do so independently. A wheelchair cushion is prescribed to meet individual needs, which may change in time with changes in posture, weight, and skin tolerance. A referral can be made to a rehabilitation engineer, who can measure pressure levels while the patient is sitting and then tailor the cushion and other necessary aids and assistive devices to the patient's needs.

The diet for the patient with quadriplegia or paraplegia should be high in protein, vitamins, and calories to ensure minimal wasting of muscle and the maintenance of healthy skin, and high in fluids to maintain well-functioning kidneys. Excessive weight gain and obesity should be avoided because they limit mobility.

\section*{IMPROVING BLADDER MANAGEMENT}

The effect of the spinal cord lesion on the bladder depends on the level of injury, the degree of cord damage, and the length of time after injury. A patient with quadriplegia or paraplegia usually has either a reflex or a nonreflex bladder (see Chaps. 11 and 44). Both bladder types increase the risk of UTI.

The nurse emphasizes the importance of maintaining an adequate flow of urine by encouraging a fluid intake of about 2.5 L daily. The patient should empty the bladder frequently so there is minimal residual urine and should pay attention to personal hygiene, because infection of the bladder and kidneys almost always occurs by the ascending route. The perineum must be kept clean and dry and attention given to the perianal skin after defecation. Underwear should be cotton (more absorbent) and changed at least once a day.

If an external catheter (condom catheter) is used, the sheath is removed nightly; the penis is cleansed to remove urine and is dried carefully, because warm urine on the periurethral skin promotes the growth of bacteria. Attention also is given to the collection bag. The nurse emphasizes the importance of monitoring for indications of UTI: cloudy, foul-smelling urine or hematuria (blood in the urine), fever, or chills.

The female patient who cannot achieve reflex bladder control or self-catheterization may need to wear pads or waterproof undergarments. Surgical intervention may be indicated in some patients to create a urinary diversion.

\section*{ESTABLISHING BOWEL CONTROL}

The objective of a bowel training program is to establish bowel evacuation through reflex conditioning. This technique is described in Chapter 38. If a cord injury occurs above the sacral segments or nerve roots and there is reflex activity, the anal sphincter may be massaged (digital stimulation) to stimulate defecation. If
the cord lesion involves the sacral segment or nerve roots, anal massage is not performed because the anus may be relaxed and lack tone. Massage is also contraindicated if there is spasticity of the anal sphincter. The anal sphincter is massaged by inserting a gloved finger (which has been adequately lubricated) 2.5 to 3.7 cm (1 to 1.5 in) into the rectum and moving it in a circular motion or from side to side. It soon becomes apparent which area triggers the defectation response. This procedure should be performed at the same time (usually every 48 hours), after a meal, and at a time that will be convenient for the patient at home. The patient also is taught the symptoms of impaction (frequent loose stools; constipation) and cautioned to watch for hemorrhoids. A diet with sufficient fluids and fiber is essential to a successful bowel training program, avoiding constipation, and decreasing the risk of autonomic dysreflexia.

\section*{COUNSELING ON SEXUAL EXPRESSION}

Many paraplegic and quadriplegic patients can have some form of meaningful sexual relationship, although some modifications will be necessary. The patient and partner benefit from counseling about the range of sexual expression possible, special techniques and positions, exploration of body sensations offering sensual feelings, and urinary and bowel hygiene as related to sexual activity. For men with erectile failure, penile prostheses enable them to have and sustain an erection. Sildenafil (Viagra) is an oral smooth muscle relaxant that causes blood to flow into the penis, resulting in an erection (see Chap. 49).

Sexual education and counseling services are included in the rehabilitation services at spinal centers. Small-group meetings in which the patients can share their feelings, receive information, and discuss sexual concerns and practical aspects are helpful in producing effective attitudes and adjustments (Sipski \& Alexander, 1997).

\section*{ENHANCING COPING MECHANISMS}

The impact of the disability and loss becomes marked when patients return home. Each time something new enters their lives (eg, a new relationship, going to work), they are reminded anew of their limitations. Grief reactions and depression are common.

To work through this depression, patients must have some hope for relief in the future. Thus, the nurse can encourage them to feel confident in their ability to achieve self-care and relative independence. The role of the nurse ranges from caretaker during the acute phase to teacher, counselor, and facilitator as patients gain mobility and independence.

The patient's disability affects not only the patient, but also the entire family. In many cases, family therapy is helpful to help work through issues as they arise.

Adjustment to the disability leads to the development of realistic goals for the future, making the best of the abilities that are left intact and reinvesting in other activities and relationships. Rejection of the disability causes self-destructive neglect and noncompliance with the therapeutic program, which leads to more frustration and depression. Crises for which interventions may be sought include social, psychological, marital, sexual, and psychiatric problems. The family usually requires counseling, social services, and other support systems to help them cope with the changes in their lifestyle and socioeconomic status.

A major goal of nursing management is to help patients overcome their sense of futility and to encourage them in the emotional adjustment that must be made before they are willing to venture into the outside world. However, an excessively sympathetic attitude on the part of the nurse may cause patients to
develop an overdependence that defeats the purpose of the entire rehabilitation program. Patients are taught and assisted when necessary, but the nurse should avoid performing activities that patients can do for themselves with a little effort. This approach to care more than repays itself in the satisfaction of seeing a completely demoralized and helpless patient become independent and find meaning in a newly emerging lifestyle.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Spasticity}

Muscle spasticity is one of the most problematic complications of quadriplegia and paraplegia. These incapacitating flexor or extensor spasms, which occur below the level of the spinal cord lesion, interfere with both the rehabilitation process and activities of daily living. Spasticity results from an imbalance between the facilitatory and inhibitory effects on neurons that exist normally. The area of the cord distal to the site of injury or lesion becomes disconnected from the higher inhibitory centers located in the brain. Facilitatory impulses, which originate from muscles, skin, and ligaments, thus predominate.

Spasticity is defined as a condition of increased muscle tone in a muscle that is weak. Initial resistance to stretching is quickly followed by sudden relaxation. The stimulus that precipitates spasm can be either obvious, such as movement or a position change, or subtle, such as a slight jarring of the wheelchair. Most patients with quadriplegia or paraplegia have some degree of spasticity. With SCI, the onset of spasticity usually occurs from a few weeks to 6 months after the injury. The same muscles that are flaccid during the period of spinal shock will develop spasticity during recovery. The intensity of spasticity tends to peak around 2 years after the injury, after which the spasms tend to regress.

Management of spasticity is based on the severity of symptoms and the degree of incapacitation. Antispasmodic medications such as diazepam (Valium), baclofen (Lioresal), and dantrolene (Dantrium) are frequently effective in controlling spasm but cause drowsiness, weakness, and vertigo in some patients. Passive range-of-motion exercises and frequent turning and repositioning are helpful because stiffness tends to increase spasticity. These activities also are essential in the prevention of contractures, pressure ulcers, and bowel and bladder dysfunction.

Contractures can complicate day-to-day care, increasing the difficulty with positioning and decreasing mobility. A number of surgical procedures have been tried with varying degrees of success. These techniques are used if more conservative approaches fail. The best treatment is prevention.

\section*{Infection and Sepsis}

Patients with quadriplegia and paraplegia are at increased risk for infection and sepsis from a variety of sources: urinary tract, respiratory tract, and pressure ulcers. Sepsis remains a major cause of death and complications in these patients. Prevention of infection and sepsis is essential through maintenance of skin integrity, complete emptying of the bladder at regular intervals, and prevention of urinary and fecal incontinence. The risk of respiratory infection can be decreased by avoiding contact with people with symptoms of respiratory infection, performing coughing and deep-breathing exercises to prevent pooling of respiratory secretions, receiving yearly influenza vaccines, and giving up smoking. A high-protein diet is important in maintaining an adequate immune system, as is avoiding factors that may reduce immune
system function (eg, excessive stress, drug abuse, excessive alcohol intake).

If infection occurs, the patient requires thorough assessment and prompt treatment. Antibiotic therapy and adequate hydration, in addition to local measures (depending on the site of infection), are initiated immediately.

UTIs are minimized or prevented by:
- Aseptic technique in catheter management
- Adequate hydration
- Bladder training program
- Prevention of overdistention of the bladder and stasis

Skin breakdown and infection are prevented by:
- Maintenance of a turning schedule
- Frequent back care
- Regular assessment of all skin areas
- Regular cleansing and lubrication of the skin
- Passive range-of-motion exercise to prevent contractures
- Pressure relief, particularly over broken skin areas, bony prominences, and heels
- Wrinkle-free bed linen

Pulmonary infections are managed and prevented by:
- Frequent coughing, turning, and deep-breathing exercises and chest physiotherapy
- Aggressive respiratory care and suctioning of the airway if a tracheostomy is present
- Assisted coughing
- Adequate hydration

Infections of any kind can be life-threatening. Therefore, aggressive nursing interventions are key to their prevention and management.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients with quadriplegia or paraplegia are at risk for complications for the rest of their lives. Thus, a major aspect of nursing care is teaching patients and their families about these complications and about strategies to minimize this risk. UTIs, contractures, infected pressure ulcers, and sepsis may necessitate hospitalization. Other late complications that may occur include lower extremity edema, joint contractures, respiratory dysfunction, and pain. To avoid these and other complications, the patient and a family member are taught skin care, catheter care, range-of-motion exercises, breathing exercises, and other care techniques. Teaching is initiated as soon as possible and extends into the rehabilitation or long-term care facility and home.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care is often appropriate for assessment of the home setting, patient teaching, and evaluation of the patient's physical and emotional status. During visits by the home care nurse, teaching about strategies to prevent or minimize potential complications is reinforced. The home environment is assessed for adequacy for care and for safety. Environmental modifications are made and specialized equipment is obtained, ideally before the patient goes home.

The home care nurse also assesses the patient's and the family's adherence to recommendations and their use of coping strategies. The use of inappropriate coping strategies such as drug and alcohol use is assessed and referrals to counseling are made for the
patient and family. Appropriate and effective coping strategies are reinforced. The nurse reviews previous teaching and determines the need for further physical or psychological assistance. The patient's self-esteem and body image may be very poor at this time. Because people with high levels of social support often report feelings of well-being despite major physical disability, it is beneficial for the nurse to assess and promote further development of the support system and effective coping strategies of each patient.

The patient requires continuing, life-long follow-up by the physician, physical therapist, and other rehabilitation team members because the neurologic deficit is usually permanent and new deficits and complications can develop. These require prompt attention before they take their toll in additional physical impairment, time, morale, and financial costs. The local counselor for the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation works with the patient with respect to job placement or additional educational or vocational training.

The nurse is in a good position to remind patients and family members of the need for continuing health promotion and screening practices. Referral to accessible health care providers and imaging centers is important in health promotion.

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A patient has been brought to the emergency department after he was hit in the head with a bat during a company baseball game. His coworkers report that he was unconscious for about 3 minutes. He now seems alert and oriented. What type of injury has he most likely sustained? What discharge instructions are warranted for this patient's family? How would you modify your discharge instructions if the patient lives alone?
2. A 25-year-old man with paraplegia secondary to SCI is scheduled to return home after an 8 -month stay in a rehabilitation facility. What health promotion strategies are relevant to teach the patient prior to discharge? What modifications in patient teaching would be indicated if the patient were a 50-year-old woman?
3. A patient with a T4 SCI has just returned to the nursing unit from physical therapy. He reports a severe, pounding headache and nausea. His blood pressure is very elevated and his pulse is slow. What are the possible causes of these signs and symptoms? What immediate actions should you take? What treatments can you anticipate? What teaching is warranted, and why?

\title{
Management of Patients With Neurologic Infections, Autoimmune Disorders, and Neuropathies
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Differentiate among the infectious disorders of the nervous system according to causes, manifestations, medical care, and nursing management.
2. Describe the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and medical and nursing management of multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
4. Describe disorders of the cranial nerves, their manifestations, and indicated nursing interventions.
5. Develop a plan of nursing care for the patient with a cranial nerve disorder.

$T_{h}$he diverse group of neurologic disorders that make up infectious and autoimmune disorders, and cranial and peripheral neuropathies present unique challenges for nursing care. Infectious processes of the nervous system sometimes cause death or permanent dysfunction. Autoimmune disorders usually have a slow, progressive course, requiring the nurse to manage symptoms and facilitate patients' and families' understanding of the disease process. Cranial and peripheral nerve disorders may affect the patient's comfort, functional independence, and self-esteem.

The nurse who cares for patients with these disorders must have a clear understanding of the pathologic processes and the clinical outcomes. Some of the issues nurses must help patients and families confront include adaptation to the effects of the disease, potential changes in family dynamics, and, possibly, end-oflife issues.

\section*{Infectious Neurologic Disorders}

The infectious disorders of the nervous system include meningitis, brain abscesses, various types of encephalitis, and CreutzfeldtJakob and new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnostic findings as well as the medical and nursing management are related to the specific infectious process.

\section*{MENINGITIS}

Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis is classified as aseptic or septic. In aseptic meningitis, bacteria are not the cause of the inflammation; the cause is viral or secondary to lymphoma, leukemia, or brain abscess. Septic meningitis refers to meningitis caused by bacteria, most commonly Neisseria meningitidis, although Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are also causative agents.

Outbreaks of N. meningitidis infection are most likely to occur in dense community groups, such as college campuses and military installations. Though infections occur year round, the peak incidence is in the winter and early spring. Factors that increase the risk for developing bacterial meningitis include tobacco use and viral upper respiratory infection because they increase the amount of droplet production. Otitis media and mastoiditis increase the risk of bacterial meningitis because the bacteria can cross the epithelium membrane and enter the subarachnoid space. Persons with immune system deficiencies are also at greater risk for developing bacterial meningitis. Between 1992 and 1996 there was a $28 \%$ increase in the number of new cases reported in the 12 -to29 -year-old age group (Rosenstein, Perkins, Stephens et al.,
2001). This increase focused attention on the need to develop a vaccine for high-risk populations.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Meningeal infections generally originate in one of two ways: through the bloodstream as a consequence of other infections, or by direct extension, such as might occur after a traumatic injury to the facial bones, or secondary to invasive procedures.
N. meningitidis concentrates in the nasopharynx and is transmitted by secretion or aerosol contamination. Bacterial or meningococcal meningitis also occurs as an opportunistic infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and as a complication of Lyme disease (Chart 64-1). S. pneumoniae is the most frequent causative agent of bacterial meningitis associated with AIDS (Rosenstein, Perkins, Stephens et al., 2001).

Once the causative organism enters the bloodstream, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and causes an inflammatory reaction in the meninges. Independent of the causative agent, inflammation of the subarachnoid space and pia mater occurs. Since there is little room for expansion within the cranial vault, the inflammation may cause increased intracranial pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows in the subarachnoid space, where inflammatory cellular material from the affected meningeal tissue enters and accumulates in the subarachnoid space, thereby increasing the CSF cell count (Coyle, 1999).

The prognosis for bacterial meningitis depends on the causative organism, the severity of the infection and illness, and the timeliness of treatment. In acute fulminant presentations there may be adrenal damage, circulatory collapse, and widespread hemorrhages (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome). This syndrome is the result of endothelial damage and vascular necrosis caused by the bacteria. Complications include visual impairment, deafness, seizures, paralysis, hydrocephalus, and septic shock.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Headache and fever are frequently the initial symptoms. Fever tends to remain high throughout the course of the illness. The headache is usually severe as a result of meningeal irritation. Meningeal irritation results in a number of other well-recognized signs common to all types of meningitis:
- Nuchal rigidity (stiff neck) is an early sign. Any attempts at flexion of the head are difficult because of spasms in the muscles of the neck. Forceful flexion causes severe pain.
- Positive Kernig's sign: When the patient is lying with the thigh flexed on the abdomen, the leg cannot be completely extended (Fig. 64-1).
ataxia: impaired coordination of movements
bulbar paralysis: immobility of muscles innervated by cranial nerves with their cell bodies in the lower portion of the brain stem
diplopia: double vision, or the awareness of two images of the same object occurring in one or both eyes
dyskinesia: impaired ability to execute voluntary movements
dysphagia: difficulty swallowing, causing the patient to be at risk for aspiration
dysphonia: voice impairment or altered voice production
myoclonus: spasms of a single muscle or group of muscles
neuropathy: general term indicating a disorder of the nervous system
paresthesia: a sensation of numbness or tingling or a "pins and needles" sensation
prion: a particle smaller than a virus that is resistant to standard sterilization procedures
spasticity: muscular hypertonicity with increased resistance to stretch often associated with weakness, increased deep tendon reflexes, and diminished superficial reflexes
spongiform: having the appearance or quality of a sponge

\section*{Chelpt \\ 64-1 Meningitis in Specific Populations}

Meningitis can occur as a complication of other diseases and is an opportunistic infection seen with greater frequency in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

\section*{Meningitis in AIDS Patients}
- Aseptic, cryptococcal, and tuberculous forms of meningitis have been reported in patients with AIDS.
- Acute and chronic forms of aseptic meningitis may occur with AIDS; both are accompanied by headache, but signs of meningeal irritation generally occur with the acute form.
- Aseptic meningitis may be accompanied by cranial nerve palsies. The meningitis is thought to be related to direct infection of the central nervous system by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because it can be isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
- Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common fungal infection of the central nervous system in patients with AIDS and has a $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ relapse rate. Patients may experience headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, confusion, and lethargy. Treatment consists of IV administration of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Maintenance therapy with fluconazole may be necessary to prevent relapse.
- Some immunosuppressed patients develop few if any symptoms because of blunted inflammatory responses; others develop atypical features.

\section*{Meningitis in Lyme Disease}
- Lyme disease is a multisystem inflammatory process caused by the tick-transmitted spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.
- Neurologic abnormalities are seen in later stages (stages 2 or 3 ). Stage 2 occurs either with the characteristic rash or from 1 to 6 months after it has disappeared.
- Neurologic abnormalities include aseptic meningitis, chronic lymphocytic meningitis, and encephalitis.
- Cranial nerve inflammation, including Bell's palsy and other peripheral neuropathies, is common.
- Stage 3 (the chronic form of the disease) begins years after the initial tick infection and is characterized by arthritis, skin lesions, and neurologic abnormalities.
- Most patients with stage 2 and 3 Lyme disease are treated with intravenous antibiotics, usually ceftriaxone or penicillin G.
- Meningeal and systemic symptoms begin to improve within days, although other symptoms, such as headache, may persist for weeks.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Kernig's Sign}
\end{figure}
- Positive Brudzinski's sign: When the patient's neck is flexed, flexion of the knees and hips is produced; when passive flexion of the lower extremity of one side is made, a similar movement is seen in the opposite extremity (see Fig. 64-1).
- Photophobia: extreme sensitivity to light; this finding is common, although the cause is unclear.
A rash can be a striking feature of N. meningitidis infection, occurring in about half of patients with this type of meningitis. Skin lesions develop, ranging from a petechial rash with purpuric lesions to large areas of ecchymosis.

Disorientation and memory impairment are common early in the course of the illness. The changes depend on the severity of the infection as well as the individual response to the physiologic processes. Behavioral manifestations are also common. As the illness progresses, lethargy, unresponsiveness, and coma may develop.

Seizures and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) are also associated with meningitis. Seizures occur secondary to focal areas of cortical irritability. Intracranial pressure increases secondary to accumulation of purulent exudate. The initial signs of increased ICP include decreased level of consciousness and focal motor deficits. If ICP is not controlled, the uncus of the temporal lobe may herniate through the tentorium into the brain stem. Brain stem herniation is a life-threatening event causing cranial nerve dysfunction and depressing the centers of vital functions, such as the medulla (Rowland, 2000). (See Chap. 61 for discussion of the patient with a change in level of consciousness or increased ICP.)

A fulminating infection occurs in about $10 \%$ of patients with meningococcal meningitis, with signs of overwhelming septicemia: an abrupt onset of high fever, extensive purpuric lesions (over the face and extremities), shock, and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Death may occur within a few hours of onset of the infection.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

When the clinical presentation points to meningitis, diagnostic testing to identify the causative organism is conducted. Bacterial culture and Gram staining of CSF and blood are key diagnostic tests (Fischbach, 2002). The presence of polysaccharide antigen in CSF further supports the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (Rosenstein et al., 2001).

\end{figure}

\section*{Prevention}

In 1971, the military began vaccinating all new recruits against meningococcal meningitis, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the incidence. Researchers suggested vaccination of college freshman as surveillance studies indicated that freshmen living in dormitories were at highest risk for developing meningococcal meningitis. At this time vaccination is not required for college freshmen; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics provides information to college freshmen and their parents about the risk of disease and the availability of vaccination (Bruce et al., 2001; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2000).

People in close contact with patients with meningococcal meningitis should be treated with antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis using rifampin (Rifadin), ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Cipro), or ceftriaxone sodium (Rocephin) (CDC, 2000). Therapy should be started as soon as possible after contact; a delay in the initiation of therapy will limit the effectiveness of the prophylaxis (Rosenstein et al., 2001). Vaccination should also be considered as an adjunct to antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for anyone living with a person who develops meningococcal infection. Vaccination for children and at-risk adults should be encouraged to avoid meningitis caused by H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae.

\section*{Medical Management}

Successful outcomes depend on the early administration of an antibiotic that crosses the blood-brain barrier into the subarachnoid space in sufficient concentration to halt the multiplication of bacteria. Penicillin antibiotics (eg, ampicillin, piperacillin) or one of the cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone sodium, cefotaxime sodium) may be used. Vancomycin hydrochloride alone or in combination with rifampin may be used if resistant strains of bacteria are identified. High doses of the appropriate antibiotic are administered intravenously.

Dexamethasone has been shown to be beneficial as adjunct therapy in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis and in pneumococcal meningitis if given 15 to 20 minutes before the first dose of antibiotic and every 6 hours for the next 4 days. Studies indicate that dexamethasone improves the outcome in adults and does not increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (de Gans \& van de Beek, 2002).

Dehydration and shock are treated with fluid volume expanders. Seizures, which may occur in the early course of the disease, are controlled with phenytoin (Dilantin). Increased ICP is treated as necessary (see Chap. 61).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient may be critically ill; therefore, so many of the nursing interventions are collaborative with those of the physician, respiratory therapist, and other members of the health care team. The patient's prognosis may depend on the supportive care provided.

Neurologic status and vital signs are continually assessed. Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas values are used to quickly identify the need for respiratory support as the increasing ICP compromises the brain stem. Insertion of a cuffed endotracheal tube (or tracheotomy) and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation.

Arterial blood pressures are monitored to assess for incipient shock, which precedes cardiac or respiratory failure. Rapid intravenous (IV) fluid replacement may be prescribed, but care is taken
to prevent fluid overload. Fever also will increase the workload of the heart and cerebral metabolism. ICP will increase in response to increased cerebral metabolic demands. Therefore, measures are taken to reduce body temperature as quickly as possible.

Other important components of nursing care include:
- Monitoring body weight, serum electrolytes, and urine volume, specific gravity, and osmolality, especially if the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion is suspected
- Protecting the patient from injury secondary to seizure activity or altered level of consciousness
- Preventing complications associated with immobility, such as pressure ulcers and pneumonia
- Instituting droplet precautions until 24 hours after the initiation of antibiotic therapy (oral and nasal discharge is considered infectious)

Any sudden, critical illness can be devastating to the family. Because the patient's condition is often critical and the prognosis guarded, the family needs to be informed about the patient's condition and permitted to see the patient at intervals, even though the priority is to address the patient's need for immediate and intensive treatment. An important aspect of the nurse's role is to support the patient and to assist the family in identifying others who can be supportive to them during the crisis.

\section*{BRAIN ABSCESS}

Although brain abscess is relatively rare, it is a complication encountered increasingly in patients whose immune systems have been suppressed either through therapy or disease.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A brain abscess is a collection of infectious material within the tissue of the brain. It may occur by direct invasion of the brain from intracranial trauma or surgery; by spread of infection from nearby sites, such as the sinuses, ears, and teeth (paranasal sinus infections, otitis media, dental sepsis); or by spread of infection from other organs (lung abscess, infective endocarditis) (Hickey, 2003). To prevent brain abscess, otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, dental infections, and systemic infections should be treated promptly.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical manifestations of a brain abscess result from alterations in intracranial dynamics (edema, brain shift), infection, or the location of the abscess (Chart 64-2). Headache, usually worse in the morning, is the most prevailing symptom. Vomiting is also common. Focal neurologic signs (weakness of an extremity, decreasing vision, seizures) may occur, depending on the site of the abscess. There may be a change in mental status, as reflected in lethargic, confused, irritable, or disoriented behavior. Fever may or may not be present.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Repeated neurologic examinations and continuing assessment of the patient are necessary to determine the location of the abscess. A computed tomography (CT) scan is invaluable in locating the site of the abscess, after the evolution and resolution of suppurative lesions, and in determining the optimal time for surgical inter-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-443.jpg?height=789&width=861&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=112)
vention. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is useful to obtain images of the brain stem and posterior fossa if an abscess is suspected in these areas.

\section*{Medical Management}

Brain abscess is treated with antimicrobial therapy and surgical incision or aspiration. If the abscess is encapsulated, CT-guided stereotactic needle aspiration under local anesthesia may be performed. Antimicrobial treatment is prescribed to eliminate the causative organism or reduce its virulence.

Penicillin G ( 20 million U) and chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) ( 4 to 6 g /day given intravenously in divided doses) are usually prescribed because anaerobic streptococci and Bacterioides are the most common causative organisms (Hickey, 2003). Large IV doses are usually prescribed preoperatively to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach the abscess. The therapy is continued postoperatively. Corticosteroids may be prescribed to help reduce the inflammatory cerebral edema if the patient shows evidence of an increasing neurologic deficit. Antiseizure medications (phenytoin, phenobarbital) may be prescribed to prevent seizures. Multiple abscesses may be treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy alone, with close monitoring by CT scans.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care focuses on ongoing assessment of the neurologic status, administering medications, assessing the response to treatment, and providing supportive care.

Ongoing neurologic assessment alerts the nurse to changes in ICP, which may indicate a need for more aggressive intervention. The nurse also assesses and documents the responses to medications. Blood laboratory test results, specifically blood glucose and serum potassium levels, need to be closely monitored when corticosteroids are prescribed. Medical intervention may be required to return these values to normal or acceptable levels.

Patient safety is also a key nursing responsibility. Injury may result from decreased level of consciousness and falls related to motor weakness or seizures.

The patient with a brain abscess is extremely ill, and neurologic deficits may remain after treatment, such as hemiparesis, seizures, visual deficits, and cranial nerve palsies. Focal seizures are the most common sequelae, occurring in about $30 \%$ of patients (Hickey, 2003). The nurse must assess the family's ability to express their distress at the patient's condition, cope with the patient's illness and deficits, and obtain support.

\section*{HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS ENCEPHALITIS}

Encephalitis is an acute inflammatory process of the brain tissue. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of acute encephalitis in the United States (Levitz, 1998). There are two herpes simplex viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 typically affects children and adults.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

There are two possible modes of HSV-1 infection. In most cases, primary HSV-1 infection of the buccal mucosa occurs, followed by retrograde spread along the trigeminal nerve to the brain. It is also believed that latent virus in brain tissue may reactivate and result in encephalitis (Roos, 1999). HSV-2 most commonly affects neonates and is discussed in pediatric textbooks (Gutierrez \& Prober, 1998).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

HSV-1 encephalitis causes inflammation and necrosis in the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and limbic system. The initial symptoms include fever, headache, confusion, and behavioral abnormalities (Roos, 1999). Focal neurologic symptoms reflect the areas of cerebral inflammation and necrosis and include behavioral change, focal seizures, dysphasia, hemiparesis, and altered level of consciousness. Focal symptoms are present within 7 days of infection and progress for 14 to 21 days.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Neuroimaging studies, electroencephalography (EEG), and CSF examination are used to diagnose HSV encephalitis. MRI is the neuroimaging study of choice in the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis as it can help identify lesions in the temporal lobe.

The EEG demonstrates a specific wave pattern in $66 \%$ of cases of biopsy-proven HSV encephalitis. CSF reveals a high opening pressure and low glucose and high protein levels. Viral cultures are almost always negative. Since 1996, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has been used to diagnose HSV encephalitis (Roos, 1999). PCR will identify the DNA bands of the HSV specifically. The validity of PCR is very high between the third and tenth day of symptom onset.

\section*{Medical Management}

Acyclovir (Zovirax), an antiviral agent, is the medication of choice in HSV treatment (Karch, 2002). The mode of action is the inhibition of viral DNA replication. It is usually well tolerated by the patient. To prevent relapse, treatment should continue for up to 3 weeks. Slow administration over 1 hour will prevent crystallization of the medication in the urine. The usual dose of acyclovir is decreased if the patient has a history of renal insufficiency (Karch, 2002). In the rare case of acyclovir resistance, foscarnet sodium (Foscavir) is prescribed (Roos, 1999).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Assessment of neurologic function is key to monitoring the progression of disease. Comfort measures to reduce headache include dimming the lights, limiting noise, and administering analgesic agents. Opioid analgesic medications may mask neurologic symptoms; therefore, they are used cautiously. Focal seizures and altered level of consciousness require care directed at injury prevention and safety. Nursing care addressing patient and family anxiety is ongoing throughout the illness. Monitoring of blood chemistry test results and urinary output will alert the nurse to the presence of renal complications related to acyclovir therapy.

\section*{ARTHROPOD-BORNE VIRUS ENCEPHALITIS}

Arthropod vectors transmit several types of viruses that cause encephalitis. The primary vector in North America is the mosquito. Arbovirus infection occurs in specific geographic areas during the summer and fall. The four types of arboviral encephalitis that occur in North America are LaCrosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, and Eastern equine encephalitis (Roos, 1999).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Viral replication occurs at the site of the mosquito bite. If adequate virus is inoculated, a viremia ensues. The virus gains access to the central nervous system (CNS) via the cerebral capillaries. It spreads from neuron to neuron, predominantly affecting the cortical gray matter, the brain stem, and the thalamus. Meningeal exudates compound the clinical presentation by irritating the meninges and increasing ICP (Roos, 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

All arboviral encephalitis begins with a flu-like prodrome, but specific neurologic manifestations depend on the viral type. LaCrosse encephalitis, for example, may present with focal neurologic symptoms and seizures. Mortality is low but residual seizures may occur. A unique clinical feature of St. Louis encephalitis is SIADH with hyponatremia. The mortality rate is $10 \%$ to $20 \%$. The clinical manifestations of Eastern equine encephalitis are acute and carry a high mortality rate of $50 \%$ to $75 \%$ (Roos, 1999). Although the clinical manifestations of Western equine encephalitis are nonspecific, the morbidity rate is high.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Neuroimaging is not useful in diagnosing many types of encephalitis. In Eastern equine encephalitis, however, CT scan and MRI may reveal lesions in the basal ganglia and thalamus (Roos, 1999). The CSF analysis shows a normal glucose level, elevated protein level, and polymorphonuclear leukocytic pleocytosis. St. Louis, Eastern equine, and Western equine encephalitis viruses are rarely isolated in the CSF (Roos, 1999).

The age of the patient is important information in making a specific viral diagnosis. La Crosse virus encephalitis is the most common pediatric arboviral encephalitis. St. Louis encephalitis affects adults over 50 years of age; Eastern equine encephalitis is not age-specific (Roos, 1999). Western equine encephalitis can present as pediatric encephalitis but is less prevalent.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is no specific medication for arboviral encephalitis. Medical management is aimed at controlling seizures and increased ICP (Roos, 1999)

\section*{Nursing Management}

If the patient is very ill, hospitalization may be required. The nurse carefully assesses neurologic status and identifies improvement or deterioration in the patient's condition. Injury prevention is key in light of the potential for falls or seizures. Arboviral encephalitis may result in death or life-long residual health issues. The family will need support and teaching to cope with these outcomes.

Public education addressing the prevention of arboviral encephalitis is a key nursing role. Clothing that provides coverage and insect repellents should be used in high-risk areas. Community mosquito control is advocated.

\section*{FUNGAL ENCEPHALITIS}

Fungal infections of the CNS occur rarely in healthy people. The presentation of fungal encephalitis is related to geographic area and a compromised immune system (Leedom \& Underman, 2000). The common fungi found around the world that can infect the CNS include Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Aspergillus, and Candida albicans (Davis, 1999). Other fungi are found only in certain regions: Coccidioides immitis, for example, is found in soil in central California, the southwest United States, northern Mexico, and areas of Argentina (Davis, 1999).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The fungal spores enter the body via inhalation. They initially infect the lungs, causing vague respiratory symptoms. In some cases, the fungi may enter the bloodstream, causing a fungemia. If the fungemia overcomes the person's immune system, the fungus may spread to the CNS. The initial presentation is meningitis followed by encephalitis and brain abscesses. In addition to infecting the brain, the fungi may infect the spinal cord, producing an abscess. The abscess will produce symptoms of spinal cord compression (Davis, 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The common symptoms of fungal encephalitis include fever, malaise, headache, nuchal rigidity, lethargy, and mental status changes (Davis, 1999). C. neoformans is the most common fungus to infect the CNS. Symptoms of increased ICP related to hydrocephalus often occur (Go et al., 2000). Vascular changes are associated with C. immitis and Aspergillus (Leedom \& Underman, 2000). Manifestations of vascular change may include arteritis or cerebral infarction.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

CNS fungal infections present a diagnostic challenge because their presentations mimic other causes of encephalitis. The symptoms develop over a 2-week period. Fungal infection may also be present in organs such as the lungs or kidney (Davis, 1999). The presence of a compromised immune system and a history of living
in or recently having traveled to a geographic area where specific fungi are found in the soil may suggest fungal encephalitis (Davis, 1999; Leedom \& Underman, 2000). Laboratory evaluation of blood shows an elevated white cell count and anemia. In some cases, serologic tests may show fungal antibodies in serum (Davis, 1999). The CSF shows an elevated white cell count and protein levels. C. neoformans is readily identified in the CSF fungal culture. The CSF culture is positive for other fungi in 50\% of cases (Davis, 1999).

Neuroimaging is used to identify CNS changes related to fungal infection and will demonstrate fungal foci in organs initially invaded by the fungus. Although both MRI and CT scan are used in the workup for fungal encephalitis, MRI is more sensitive. The MRI may indicate lesions in the basal ganglia or thalamus, as well as hemorrhage, vascular complications, ischemia, aneurysm formation, or hydrocephalus (Go et al., 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical management is directed at the causative fungus and the neurologic consequences of the infection. Seizures are controlled by standard antiseizure medications. Increased ICP is controlled by repeated lumbar punctures or shunting of CSF. In contrast to patients with cryptococcal meningitis, the use of repeated (once or twice daily) lumbar punctures in patients with fungal infections has been an effective strategy to control increased ICP and has been associated with improved survival with fewer neurologic sequelae (Davis, 1999).

Antifungal agents are given for a specific period of time to cure the infection in patients with competent immune systems. Patients with compromised immune systems will receive antifungal therapy until the infection is controlled, after which they will receive a maintenance dose of the medication for an indefinite period of time.

Although the dose and duration of treatment depend on the causative fungi, amphotericin B (Abelcet, AmBisome, Amphocin, Amphotec, Fungizone, and Fungizone IV) is the standard antifungal agent used in treatment (Karch, 2002). Dosing must be high enough to penetrate the blood-brain barrier without causing renal toxicity.

Fluconazole (Diflucan) or flucytosine (5-FC, 5-fluorocytosine, Ancobon) may be administered in conjunction with amphotericin B. Both can be given orally and may be used as maintenance therapy. Potential side effects of fluconazole include nausea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, rash, reversible alopecia, and a transient increase in liver enzymes. When flucytosine is prescribed in conjunction with amphotericin B , bone marrow suppression may occur. Therefore, patients receiving these medications in combination should have leukocyte and platelet counts monitored twice a week (Davis, 1999).

\section*{Nursing Management}

If hydrocephalus develops and inflammation progresses, ICP will rise. Nursing assessment aimed at early identification of increased ICP is necessary to ensure early control and management. (See Chap. 61 for management of the patient with increased ICP.) Patient comfort may be optimized by administering nonopioid analgesics, limiting environmental stimuli, and positioning. Administration of amphotericin B may cause fever, chills, and body aches. Giving diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) approximately 30 minutes before giving amphotericin B may prevent these side effects. Renal toxicity due to
amphotericin B is dose-limiting. Monitoring the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels may alert the nurse to the development of renal insufficiency and the need to address the patient's renal status.

Providing support will assist the patient and family to cope with the illness. Work-up of the patient for immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS may put additional stress on the family. The nurse may need to mobilize community support systems for the patient and family.

\section*{CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB AND NEW-VARIANT CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE}

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob (nvCJD) disease belong to a group of degenerative, infectious neurologic disorders called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Although CJD and nvCJD have distinct clinical and histologic differences, they have many features in common. Both are rare and have incubation periods ranging from months to decades. In both, the symptoms are progressive, there is no definitive treatment, and the outcome is fatal.

CJD occurs primarily in adults ages 50 to 70 . The incidence of disease is 1 per million worldwide (Weihl \& Roos, 1999). nvCJD occurs in younger patients and has a prolonged duration of illness compared to CJD. The risk of nvCJD in the United States is thought to be low as cattle are fed primarily with soyderived feed (see Pathophysiology, below). Only a few rare cases of TSE have occurred in the United States to date (Weihl \& Roos, 1999).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Although still debated, the causative agent appears to be a prion, a proteinaceous, infectious particle smaller than a virus (Davis \& Kennedy, 2000). The prion converts a normal cellular protein to an abnormal form, thus destroying neurons and glial cells. The gray matter takes on a spongy appearance (spongiform changes). Lesions, or plaques, also appear in various locations in the CNS (Weihl \& Roos, 1999).

In CJD, the method of transmission is frequently unknown; however, direct transmission (by contact with infected animals) of the prion to humans may initiate the degenerative neurologic process. The disease is also heritable, and familial groups account for approximately $15 \%$ of cases, clustering in certain parts of the world. Iatrogenic transmission accounts for approximately 5\% of cases and is due to contaminated neurosurgical devices and blood transfusions and the use of cadaver-derived growth hormone (growth hormone is now created synthetically) (World Health Organization, 2001).

Based primarily on an outbreak of cases in England in the late 1980s and through the 1990s, it was discovered that in nvCJD, the primary mode of transmission appeared to be the ingestion of CNS tissue of infected cattle. However, in 1998, additional concerns were raised about the safety of the English blood supply. The prion exists in lymphoid tissue and blood in all of the TSEs, but the incidence is higher in nvCJD. In light of the rising incidence of nvCJD, concern arose about the risk of infection through transfusion of blood products. There is no method available to screen blood for infectivity. All blood must be leukocytedepleted prior to transfusion. In 1998, the use of plasma derived from citizens of the United Kingdom for use in manufacturing blood-derived products was banned in the U.S. (Weihl \& Roos, 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many patients with CJD have vague prodromal symptoms prior to specific neurologic changes. Symptoms usually include behavioral changes, dementia, mutism, visual changes, cerebellar, pyramidal, and extrapyramidal signs, and myoclonic jerks. The myoclonic jerks may be spontaneous or precipitated by auditory or tactile stimuli. The myoclonus (spasms) may involve a single muscle group, a limb, or the entire body. The symptoms progress until the patient is completely unaware of the environment and immobilized.

Although the same type of agent, a prion, causes nvCJD, there are distinct differences in the clinical manifestations of nvCJD and CJD. In nvCJD, there are more prion-reactive plaques, referred to as florid plaques, surrounding spongiform tissue throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. The characteristic EEG changes present in CJD are absent in nvCJD. Anxiety, depression, and behavioral changes are the initial symptoms of nvCJD. Cerebellar symptoms occur, with gait changes and ataxia. Myoclonus is present in most patients diagnosed with nvCJD. Memory and cognitive impairments occur late in the course of nvCJD. Mutism occurs in both nvCJD and CJD (Almond, 1998).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Historically, sharp waves and spikes on the EEG were the only features available to support the diagnosis of CJD. Recent detection of a polyclonal antibody (protein 14-3-3) in CSF has enabled the diagnosis of CJD (Poser, Mollenhauder, Krab et al., 1999). In addition to the presence of a polyclonal antibody in CSF, a protein increase is demonstrated along with the presence of enzymes indicative of neuronal loss. CT scan is used to rule out disorders that may mimic the symptoms of CJD. MRI scans are useful, identifying lesions in the basal ganglia in most cases of CJD. Definitive diagnosis is made by brain biopsy or at autopsy.

\section*{Medical Management}

After the onset of specific neurologic symptoms, progression of disease occurs quickly. There is no effective treatment for CJD or ${ }_{\mathrm{nvCJD}}$. The care of the patient is supportive and palliative. Goals of care include prevention of injury related to immobility and dementia, promotion of patient comfort, and provision of support and education for the family. The duration of disease is 4 to 5 months in CJD and 16 months in nvCJD, with death occurring as a result of respiratory failure or sepsis (Weihl \& Roos, 1999).

\section*{Nursing Management}

As with medical management, the nursing care of patients is primarily supportive and palliative. Psychological and emotional support of patients and families throughout the course of the illness is needed This care extends to providing for a dignified death and supporting the family through the processes of grief and loss. Hospice care should be used either at home or at an inpatient facility. (See Chap. 17 for an in-depth discussion of end-of-life issues.)

Prevention of disease transmission is an important part of nursing care. Although patient isolation is not necessary, use of standard precautions is important. Institutional protocols are followed for blood and body fluid exposure and decontamination of equipment. Conventional methods of sterilization do not destroy the prion. The CDC guidelines (based on WHO guidelines) out-
line the stringent sterilization methods that must be used to destroy the prion on surfaces.

\section*{Autoimmune Processes}

Autoimmune nervous system disorders include multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

\section*{MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS}

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated progressive demyelinating disease of the CNS. Demyelination refers to the destruction of myelin, the fatty and protein material that surrounds certain nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord; it results in impaired transmission of nerve impulses (Fig. 64-2). MS typically presents in young adults ages 20 to 40 , and it affects women more frequently than men (Boyden, 2000).

The cause of MS is an area of ongoing research. Autoimmune activity results in demyelination, but the sensitized antigen has not been identified. Multiple factors play a role in the initiation of the immune process. Geographic prevalence is highest in northern Europe, southern Australia, the northern United States, and southern Canada (Noseworthy, Lucchinetti, Rodriguez et al., 2000). It is believed that an environmental exposure at a young age may play a role in the development of MS later in life.

Genetic predisposition is indicated by the presence of a specific cluster (haplotype) of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on the cell wall. The presence of this haplotype may promote susceptibility to factors, such as viruses, that trigger the autoimmune response activated in MS. A specific virus capable of initiating the

\caption{EIGURE 64-2 The process of demyelination. $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ depict a normal nerve cell and axon with myelin. $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ show the slow disintegration of myelin, resulting in a disruption in axon function.}
\end{figure}
autoimmune response has not been identified. It is believed that DNA on the virus mimics the amino acid sequence of myelin, resulting in an immune system cross-reaction in the presence of a defective immune system (Boyden, 2000).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Sensitized T cells typically cross the blood-brain barrier; their function is to check the CNS for antigens and then leave. In MS, the sensitized T cells remain in the CNS and promote the infiltration of other agents that damage the immune system. The immune system attack leads to inflammation that destroys myelin (which normally insulates the axon and speeds the conduction of impulses along the axon) and oligodendroglial cells that produce myelin in the CNS.

Plaques of sclerotic tissue appear on demyelinated axons, further interrupting the transmission of impulses. Demyelination interrupts the flow of nerve impulses and results in a variety of manifestations, depending on which nerves are affected. Demyelinated axons are scattered irregularly throughout the CNS (Fig. 64-3). The areas most frequently affected are the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts; the cerebrum; the brain stem and cerebellum; and the spinal cord. Eventually the axons themselves begin to degenerate, resulting in permanent and irreversible damage (Bashir \& Whitaker, 2002; Halper, 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The course of MS may assume many different patterns (Fig. 64-4). In some patients, the disease follows a benign course, with a normal life span and symptoms so mild that patients do not seek
health care and treatment. Eighty percent to $85 \%$ of cases of MS begin with a relapsing-remitting course, with complete recovery between clearly defined symptomatic exacerbations (Noseworthy et al., 2000). This form of the disease does not progress between relapses, although the majority of cases with this initial type of course change to a secondary-progressive course after some years (Halper, 2001). Secondary-progressive MS begins as relapsingremitting disease but changes to a course in which there is not full recovery but rather continued progression between defined relapses. Ten percent to $20 \%$ percent of patients have a primary progressive course (Noseworthy et al., 2000; Halper, 2001), in which symptoms progress throughout the disease, with increasing disability. Primary progressive MS is characterized by continuous decline, with the potential development of quadriparesis, cognitive dysfunction, visual loss, and brain stem syndromes.

The signs and symptoms of MS are varied and multiple, reflecting the location of the lesion (plaque) or combination of lesions. The primary symptoms most commonly reported are fatigue, depression, weakness, numbness, difficulty in coordination, loss of balance, and pain. Visual disturbances due to lesions in the optic nerves or their connections may include blurring of vision, diplopia, patchy blindness (scotoma), and total blindness.

Fatigue impairs optimal function throughout the course of the disease. Fatigue is exacerbated when febrile illness, environmental temperature, hot showers, and normal circadian rhythms during the afternoon elevate body temperature. Depression may relate to the pathophysiology or may occur as a reaction to the diagnosis. Suicide as the cause of death occurs 7.5 times more frequently among persons diagnosed with MS than among the agematched general population. If suicide occurs, it is likely to occur within the first 5 years of diagnosis (Walther \& Hohlfeld, 1999).

\end{figure}

Pain occurs in $66 \%$ of patients with MS. Pain may be due to demyelination of pain fibers, mechanical stress on muscles, bones, and joints due to disability, or treatment measures (Maloni, 2000).

Spasticity (muscle hypertonicity) of the extremities and loss of the abdominal reflexes are due to involvement of the main motor pathways (pyramidal tracts) of the spinal cord. Disruption of the sensory axons may produce sensory dysfunction (paresthesias, pain). Cognitive and psychosocial problems may reflect frontal or parietal lobe involvement; some degree of cognitive change (eg, memory loss, decreased concentration) occurs in about half of patients, but severe cognitive changes with dementia (progressive organic mental disorder) are rare. Involvement of the cerebellum or basal ganglia can produce ataxia (impaired coordination of movements) and tremor. Loss of the control connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia may occur and cause emotional lability and euphoria. Bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunctions are common.

Secondary complications of MS include urinary tract infections, constipation, pressure ulcers, contracture deformities, dependent pedal edema, pneumonia, reactive depression, and decreased bone mass. Emotional, social, marital, economic, and vocational problems may also be a consequence of the disease.

Exacerbations and remissions are characteristic of MS. During exacerbations, new symptoms appear and existing ones worsen; during remissions, symptoms decrease or disappear. Relapses may be associated with periods of emotional and physical stress. MRI studies demonstrate that many plaques do not produce serious symptoms; however, the disease may be very active, as demonstrated by MRI. There also is evidence that remyelination actually occurs in some patients.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

MRI is the primary diagnostic tool for visualizing plaques, documenting disease activity, and evaluating the effect of treatment. Electrophoresis of CSF identifies the presence of oligoclonal banding (several bands of immunoglobulin G bonded together,
indicating an immune system abnormality). Evoked potential studies can help define the extent of the disease process and monitor changes. Underlying bladder dysfunction is diagnosed by urodynamic studies. Neuropsychological testing may be indicated to assess cognitive impairment. A sexual history helps to identify changes in sexual function.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Due to improved treatment and an increase in the average life span for patients with MS, more individuals are living to become elderly. These patients may have chronic health problems for which they may be taking additional medications that could interact with medications prescribed for MS. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of medications are altered in the elderly as a result of age-related changes in renal and liver functions. Therefore, the elderly must be monitored closely for adverse and toxic effects of MS medications and for osteoporosis (particularly with frequent corticosteroid use, which may be required for exacerbations). The cost of medications could lead to poor adherence to the prescribed regimen in elderly patients on fixed incomes.

Elderly MS patients have specific physical and psychosocial challenges. Physical challenges include impaired mobility, spasticity, pain and bladder dysfunction, impaired sleep, and an increased need for assistance with self-care (Klewer et al., 2001). Psychosocial issues include depression and suicidal thoughts (Klewer et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

No cure exists for MS. An individualized, organized, and rational treatment program is indicated to relieve the patient's symptoms and provide continuing support, particularly for individuals with cognitive changes ( $50 \%$ ), who may need more structure and support. The goals of treatment are to delay the progression of the disease, manage chronic symptoms, and treat acute exacerbations. Many patients with MS have stable disease and require
only intermittent treatment, whereas others experience steady progression of their disease. Symptoms requiring intervention include spasticity, fatigue, bladder dysfunction, and ataxia. Management strategies target the various motor and sensory symptoms and effects of immobility that can occur.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Three medications, referred to as the "ABC (and R) drugs," are currently the main pharmacologic therapy for MS. The interferons beta-1a (Avonex) and beta-1b (Betaseron) reduce the frequency of relapse by $30 \%$ and decrease the appearance of new lesions on MRI by $80 \%$ (Tselis \& Lisak, 1999). Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) also reduces the number of lesions on MRI and the relapse rate. In March 2002, the FDA approved a fourth agent, Rebif, for the treatment of relapsing MS (PRISMS Study Group, 2001).

All of these medications have multiple immune activities. The interferons reduce T -cell proliferation; glatiramer acetate inhibits antigen-specific T-cell activation (Noseworthy et al., 2000). All of the disease-modifying medications, the "ABC (and R) drugs," require injections. Interferon beta-1b (Betaseron) is administered subcutaneously every other day, interferon beta-la (Avonex) is given by intramuscular injection once a week, and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is administered by subcutaneous injection every day. Rebif is administered subcutaneously three times a week. Seventy-five percent of patients taking one of the interferons experience flu-like symptoms; these symptoms can be controlled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and usually resolve after a few months of therapy (Walther \& Hohlfeld, 1999). Patients receiving these injectable medications and their families must be instructed in injection technique and must become knowledgeable about site reactions and other possible side effects (Ross, 2001).

Mitoxantrone (Novantrone), which received FDA approval in 2000 (Rolak, 2001), is an antineoplastic agent used primarily to treat leukemia and lymphoma. It received approval to treat secondary progressive MS due to its immunosuppressive qualities (Rolak, 2001). Patients need to have laboratory tests (complete blood count) performed, and the results must be closely monitored due to the potential for leukopenia and cardiac toxicity. A few patients ( $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ ) will develop signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy and heart failure due to cardiac toxicity (Rolak, 2001).

Corticosteroids modulate the immune response and are used to limit the severity and duration of exacerbations. These agents suppress the immune response and decrease inflammatory change. Nerve conduction is restored with variable degrees of symptomatic recovery. Typically the patient receives high-dose IV methylprednisolone followed by an oral prednisone taper. The nurse must carefully monitor the patient for side effects related to corticosteroids such as mood changes and fluid and electrolyte alterations and teach the patient and family about side effects.

Researchers continue to investigate other possible treatments for MS. Many agents that have been investigated have proven to be too toxic for clinical use. Researchers are studying strategies that facilitate the proliferation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. T-cell vaccination and agents that inhibit oxygen radicals and proteases are under study (Noseworthy et al., 2000).

Medications are also prescribed for management of specific symptoms. Baclofen (Lioresal), a GABA agonist, is the medication of choice in treating spasms. It can be administered orally or by intrathecal injection. Benzodiazepines (Valium), tizanidine (Zanaflex), and dantrolene (Dantrium) may also be used to treat spasms. Patients with disabling spasms and contractures may re-
quire nerve blocks or surgical intervention. Fatigue that interferes with activities of daily living may be treated with amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), or fluoxetine (Prozac). Ataxia is a chronic problem most resistant to treatment. Medications used to treat ataxia include beta-adrenergic blockers (Inderal), antiseizure agents (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines (Klonopin).

Various strategies for pain management can be implemented, based on the type of pain that exists. Acute pain may be treated with antidepressants, opiates, or antiseizure medications. Surgical procedures may be required to interrupt the pain pathway. Subacute pain as well as chronic back pain can be effectively treated with NSAIDs. Physical therapy may also benefit the patient by improving posture and strength.

Pain may also be due to osteoporosis (Maloni, 2000). Perimenopausal women with MS are more likely to develop osteoporosis than those without MS. Immobility, corticosteroid therapy, and estrogen loss play a role in the development of osteoporosis in women with MS. Bone mineral density testing is recommended for this high-risk group (Smeltzer, Zimmerman, Capriotti \& Fernandes, 2002). Diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis are discussed at length in Chapter 68.

Management of bladder and bowel control is often among the patient's most difficult problems and a variety of medications (anticholinergics, alpha-adrenergic blockers, or antispasmodic agents) may be prescribed. Nonpharmacologic strategies also assist in establishing effective bowel and bladder elimination (see Nursing Process section).

Urinary tract infection is often superimposed on the underlying neurologic dysfunction. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may be prescribed to acidify the urine, making bacterial growth less likely. Antibiotics are prescribed when appropriate.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS}

\section*{Assessment}

Nursing assessment addresses actual and potential problems associated with the disease, including neurologic problems, secondary complications, and the impact of the disease on the patient and family. The patient's movements and walking are observed to determine if there is danger of falling. Assessment of function is carried out both when the patient is well rested and when fatigued. The patient is assessed for weakness, spasticity, visual impairment, incontinence, and disorders of swallowing and speech. Additional areas of assessment include the following: How has MS affected the patient's lifestyle? How well is the patient coping? What would the patient like to do better?

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Impaired physical mobility related to weakness, muscle paresis, spasticity
- Risk for injury related to sensory and visual impairment
- Impaired urinary and bowel elimination (urgency, frequency, incontinence, constipation) related to nervous system dysfunction
- Impaired speech and swallowing related to cranial nerve involvement
- Disturbed thought processes (loss of memory, dementia, euphoria) related to cerebral dysfunction
- Ineffective individual coping related to uncertainty of course of MS
- Impaired home maintenance management related to physical, psychological, and social limits imposed by MS
- Potential for sexual dysfunction related to spinal cord involvement or psychological reactions to condition

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include promotion of physical mobility, avoidance of injury, achievement of bladder and bowel continence, promotion of speech and swallowing mechanisms, improvement of cognitive function, development of coping strengths, improved home maintenance management, and adaptation to sexual dysfunction.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

An individualized program of physical therapy, rehabilitation, and education is combined with emotional support. The nursing interventions include face-to-face and telephone interactions that address patient education to enable the person with MS to deal with the physiologic, social, and psychological problems that accompany chronic disease (Madonna \& Keating, 1999).

\section*{PROMOTING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Relaxation and coordination exercises promote muscle efficiency. Progressive resistive exercises are used to strengthen weak muscles because diminishing muscle strength is often significant in MS.

\section*{Exercises}

Walking improves the gait, particularly when there is loss of position sense of the legs and feet. If certain muscle groups are irreversibly affected, other muscles can be trained to take over their actions. Instruction in the use of assistive devices may be needed to ensure their correct and safe use.

\section*{Minimizing Spasticity and Contractures}

Muscle spasticity is common and, in its later stages, is characterized by severe adductor spasm of the hips with flexor spasm of the hips and knees. If this is not relieved, fibrous contractures of these joints with resultant pressure ulcers over the sacrum and hips (due to diminished sensation and the inability to position the patient properly) occur. Warm packs may be beneficial, but hot baths should be avoided because of risk for burn injury secondary to sensory loss and increasing symptoms that may occur with an elevation of the body temperature.

Daily exercises for muscle stretching are prescribed to minimize joint contractures. Special attention is given to the hamstrings, gastrocnemius muscles, hip adductors, biceps, and wrist and finger flexors. Muscle spasticity is common and interferes with normal function. A stretch-hold-relax routine is helpful for relaxing and treating muscle spasticity. Swimming and stationary bicycling are useful, and progressive weight-bearing can relieve spasticity in the legs. The patient should not be hurried in any of these activities because this often increases spasticity.

\section*{Activity And Rest}

The patient is encouraged to work to a point just short of fatigue. Very strenuous physical exercise is not advisable because it raises the body temperature and may aggravate symptoms. The patient
is advised to take frequent short rest periods, preferably lying down. Extreme fatigue may contribute to the exacerbation of symptoms.

\section*{Minimizing Effects of Immobility}

Because of the decrease in physical activity that often occurs with MS, complications associated with immobility, including pressure ulcers, expiratory muscle weakness, and accumulation of bronchial secretions, need to be considered and steps taken to prevent them. Measures to prevent such complications include assessment and maintenance of skin integrity and coughing and deep-breathing exercises.

\section*{PREVENTING INJURY}

If motor dysfunction causes problems of incoordination and clumsiness, or if ataxia is apparent, the patient is at risk for falling. To overcome this disability, the patient is taught to walk with feet wide apart to widen the base of support and to increase walking stability. If there is loss of position sense, the patient is taught to watch the feet while walking. Gait training may require assistive devices (walker, cane, braces, crutches, parallel bars) and instruction about their use by a physical therapist. If the gait remains inefficient, a wheelchair or motorized scooter may be the solution. The occupational therapist is a valuable resource person in suggesting and securing aids to promote independence. If incoordination is a problem and tremor of the upper extremities occurs when voluntary movement is attempted (intention tremor), weighted bracelets or wrist cuffs are helpful. The patient is trained in transfer and activities of daily living.

Because sensory loss may occur in addition to motor loss, pressure ulcers are a continuing threat to skin integrity. Confinement to a wheelchair increases the risk. See Chapter 11 for a discussion of the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.

\section*{ENHANCING BLADDER AND BOWEL CONTROL}

Generally, bladder symptoms fall into the following categories: (1) inability to store urine (hyperreflexic, uninhibited); (2) inability to empty the bladder (hyporeflexic, hypotonic); and (3) a mixture of both types. The patient with urinary frequency, urgency, or incontinence requires special support. The sensation of the need to void must be heeded immediately, so the bedpan or urinal should be readily available. A voiding time schedule is set up (every 1.5 to 2 hours initially, with gradual lengthening of the interval). The patient is instructed to drink a measured amount of fluid every 2 hours and then attempt to void 30 minutes after drinking. Using a timer or wristwatch with an alarm may be helpful for the patient who does not have enough sensation to signal the need to empty the bladder. The nurse encourages the patient to take the prescribed medications to treat bladder spasticity because this allows greater independence. Intermittent self-catheterization has been successful in maintaining bladder control in patients with MS. (See Chap. 11 for a discussion of intermittent selfcatheterization.) If the female patient has permanent urinary incontinence, urinary diversion procedures may be considered. The male patient may wear a condom appliance for urine collection.

Bowel problems include constipation, fecal impaction, and incontinence. Adequate fluids, dietary fiber, and a bowel-training program are frequently effective in solving these problems. (See Chap. 11 for a discussion of promoting bowel continence.)

\section*{MANAGING SPEECH AND SWALLOWING DIFFICULTIES}

When the cranial nerves controlling the mechanisms of speech and swallowing are involved, dysarthrias (defects of articulation) marked by slurring, low volume of speech, and difficulties in
phonation may occur. Swallowing disturbances (dysphagia) may also occur. A speech therapist evaluates speech and swallowing and instructs the patient, family, and health team members about strategies to compensate for speech and swallowing problems. The nurse reinforces this instruction and encourages the patient and family to adhere to the plan. Impaired swallowing increases the patient's risk for aspiration; therefore, strategies (eg, having suction apparatus available, careful feeding, proper positioning for eating) are needed to reduce that risk (Galvan, 2001).

\section*{IMPROVING SENSORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION}

Measures may be taken if visual defects (the cranial nerves affecting vision may be affected by MS) or changes in cognitive status occur.

\section*{Vision}

An eye patch or a covered eyeglass lens may be used to block visual impulses of one eye when the patient has diplopia (double vision). Prism glasses may be helpful for the bedridden patient who is having difficulty reading in the supine position. People unable to read regular-print materials are eligible for the free talking book services of the Library of Congress or may obtain largetype books from local libraries.

\section*{Cognition and Emotional Responses}

Cognitive impairment and emotional lability may occur early in MS in some patients and may impose numerous stresses on the patient and family. Some patients with MS are forgetful and easily distracted and may exhibit emotional lability.

Patients adapt to illness in a variety of ways, which may include denial, depression, withdrawal, and hostility. Emotional support assists patients and their families to adapt to the changes and uncertainties associated with MS and to cope with the disruption in their lives. The patient is assisted to set meaningful and realistic goals to achieve a sense of purpose, to remain as active as possible, and to keep up social interests and activities. Hobbies may help the patient's morale and provide satisfying interests if the disease progresses to the stage in which formerly enjoyed activities can no longer be pursued.

The family should be made aware of the nature and degree of cognitive impairment. The environment is kept structured, and lists and other memory aids are used to help the patient with cognitive changes to maintain a daily routine. The occupational therapist can be helpful in formulating a structured daily routine.

\section*{Strengthening Coping Mechanisms}

The diagnosis of MS is always distressing to the patient and family. They need to know that no two patients with MS have identical symptoms or courses of illness. Although some patients do experience significant disability early, others have a near-normal life span with minimal disability. Some families, however, face overwhelming frustrations and problems. MS affects people who are often in a productive stage of life and concerned about career and family responsibilities. Family conflict, disintegration, separation, and divorce are not uncommon. Often, very young family members assume the responsibility of caring for a parent with MS. Nursing interventions in this area include alleviating stress and making appropriate referrals for counseling and support to minimize the adverse effects of dealing with chronic illness.

The nurse, mindful of these complex problems, initiates home care and coordinates a network of services, including social services, speech therapy, physical therapy, and homemaker services. To strengthen the patient's coping skills, as much information as possible is provided. People who live with chronic illness need an
updated list of the assistive devices, services, and resources that are available.

Coping through problem solving involves helping the patient define the problem and develop alternatives for its management. Careful planning and maintaining flexibility and a hopeful attitude are useful for psychological and physical adaptation.

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-CARE ABILITIES}

MS can affect every facet of daily living. After certain abilities are lost, they are often impossible to regain. Physical function may vary from day to day. Modifications that allow independence in self-care should be implemented (eg, assistive eating devices, raised toilet seat, bathing aids, telephone modifications, longhandled comb, tongs, modified clothing). Physical and emotional stresses should be avoided as much as possible because these may worsen symptoms and impair performance. Exposure to heat increases fatigue and muscle weakness, so air conditioning in at least one room is recommended. Exposure to extreme cold may increase spasticity.

\section*{PROMOTING SEXUAL FUNCTIONING}

Patients with MS and their partners face problems that interfere with sexual activity, arising not only as a direct consequence of nerve damage but also from psychological reactions to the disease. Easy fatigability, conflicts arising from dependency and depression, emotional lability, loss of self-esteem, and feelings of low self-worth compound the problem. Erectile and ejaculatory disorders in men and orgasmic dysfunction and adductor spasms of the thigh muscles in women can make sexual intercourse difficult or impossible. Bladder and bowel incontinence and urinary tract infections add to the difficulties.

An experienced sexual counselor helps bring into focus the patient's or partner's sexual resources and suggests relevant information and supportive therapy (Sipski \& Alexander, 1997). Sharing and communicating feelings, planning for sexual activity (to minimize the effects of fatigue), and exploring alternative methods of sexual expression may open up a wide range of sexual enjoyment and experiences.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

As the disease progresses, the patient and family need to learn new strategies to maintain optimal independence. Teaching of new self-care techniques may be initiated in the hospital or clinic setting and reinforced in the home. Teaching about self-care may address the use of assistive devices, self-catheterization, and administration of medications that affect the course of the disease or treat complications. Although the disease-modifying medications (the "ABC and R medications") may slow the progression of disease and disability in many persons with MS, they are not effective in all patients. Patients who receive these medications will require teaching and support, while those unable to take them or for whom the medications have not been effective need continued support and assistance in coping with this reality. Exercises that enable the patient to continue some form of activity or that maintain or improve swallowing, speech, or respiratory function may be taught to the patient and family (Chart 64-3).

\section*{Continuing Care}

After discharge, the home care nurse often provides teaching and reinforcement of these new techniques in the patient's home. Nurses in the home setting assess for changes in the patient's

This was the second phase of a project designed to investigate the issues surrounding the healthpromotion needs of individuals with chronic disabling conditions and the outcomes associated with the performance of health-promoting behaviors.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This was a one-time cross-sectional design using mailed questionnaires. Participants were recruited for the study using targeted mailings to individuals with MS on the mailing lists of national MS Society chapters. The study sample included 786 persons with MS ( 630 women and 156 men) who returned surveys. Instruments used included the Incapacity Status Scale (ISS), Barriers to Health Promoting Activities for Disabled Persons Scale, Personal Resource Questionnaire, Acceptance of Illness Scale, Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices scale, Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II (HPLP-II), and the Quality of Life Index (QLI).

\section*{Findings}

The analysis revealed that the original model was generally well specified, with an adequate fit to the data. The model supported the hypothesis that quality of life is the outcome of a complex interplay between contextual factors (severity of illness), antecedent variables, and healthpromoting behaviors. The revised model, with the addition of two paths between personal resources and barriers, had an improved fit of the data compared to the original model. The original and revised models are depicted in the article. Resources, barriers, self-efficacy, and acceptance accounted for $58 \%$ of the variance in the frequency of healthpromoting behaviors and $66 \%$ of the variance in perceived quality of life.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Further testing of the model was recommended, especially in samples of differing ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Nurses working with MS patients should be aware that quality of life is the outcome of the interaction of many variables. The authors suggest that nurses can improve health-promoting behaviors and quality of life using interventions that enhance social support, decrease barriers, and increase specific self-efficacy for health behaviors.

\section*{MYASTHENIA GRAVIS}

Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder affecting the myoneural junction, is characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the voluntary muscles. Women tend to develop the disease at an earlier age ( 20 to 40 years of age) compared to men ( 60 to 70 years of age), and women are affected more frequently (Heitmiller, 1999).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Normally, a chemical impulse precipitates the release of acetylcholine from vesicles on the nerve terminal at the myoneural junction. The acetylcholine attaches to receptor sites on the motor end plate, stimulating muscle contraction. Continuous binding of acetylcholine to the receptor site is required for muscular contraction to be sustained.

In myasthenia gravis, autoantibodies directed at the acetylcholine receptor sites impair transmission of impulses across the
myoneural junction. Therefore, fewer receptors are available for stimulation, resulting in voluntary muscle weakness that escalates with continued activity (Fig. 64-5). These antibodies are found in $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of the people with myasthenia gravis. Eighty percent of persons with myasthenia gravis have either thymic hyperplasia or a thymic tumor (Roos, 1999), and the thymus gland is believed to be the site of antibody production. In patients who are antibody negative, it is believed that the offending antibody is directed at a portion of the receptor site rather than the whole complex.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The initial manifestation of myasthenia gravis usually involves the ocular muscles. Diplopia (double vision) and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids) are common. However, the majority of patients also experience weakness of the muscles of the face and throat (bulbar symptoms) and generalized weakness. Weakness of the facial muscles will result in a bland facial expression. Laryngeal involvement produces dysphonia (voice impairment) and increases the patient's risk for choking and aspiration. Generalized weakness affects all the extremities and the intercostal muscles, resulting in decreasing vital capacity and respiratory failure. Myasthenia gravis is purely a motor disorder with no effect on sensation or coordination.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

An anticholinesterase test is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Anticholinesterase agents stop the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby increasing acetylcholine availability. Edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) is injected intravenously, 2 mg at a time to a total of 10 mg . Thirty seconds after injection, facial muscle weakness and ptosis should resolve for about 5 minutes. This immediate improvement in muscle strength after administration of this agent represents a positive test and usually confirms the diagnosis. Atropine 0.4 mg should be available to control the side effects of edrophonium, which include bradycardia, sweating, and cramping (Roos, 1999).

The acetylcholine receptor antibody titers are elevated as indicated previously. Repetitive nerve stimulation tests record the electrical activity in targeted muscles after nerve stimulation. A $15 \%$ decrease in successive action potentials is observed in patients with myasthenia gravis (Heitmiller, 1999). The thymus gland, which is a site of acetylcholine receptor antibody production, is enlarged in myasthenia gravis. MRI demonstrates this enlargement in $90 \%$ of cases (Wilkins \& Bulkley, 1999).

\end{figure}

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of myasthenia gravis is directed at improving function and reducing and removing circulating antibodies. Therapeutic modalities include administration of anticholinesterase agents and immunosuppressive therapy, plasmapheresis, and thymectomy.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Anticholinesterase agents such as pyridostigmine bromide (Mestinon) and neostigmine bromide (Prostigmin) provide symptomatic relief by increasing the relative concentration of available acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Dosage is increased gradually until maximal benefits (improved strength, less fatigue) are obtained. Adverse effects of anticholinesterase therapy include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and increased oropharyngeal secretions. Pyridostigmine tends to have fewer side effects (Chart 64-4). Improvement with anticholinesterase therapy is not complete or long-lasting (Heitmiller, 1999).

NURSING ALERT Maintenance of stable blood levels of anticholinergic medication is imperative to stabilize muscle strength. Therefore, the anticholinesterase medications must be given on time. Any delay in administration of medications may exacerbate muscle weakness and make it impossible for the patient to take medications orally.

The goal of immunosuppressive therapy is to reduce the production of the antibody. Corticosteroids suppress the patient's immune response, thus decreasing the amount of antibody production. As the corticosteroid dosage is gradually increased, the anticholinesterase dosage is lowered. The patient's ability to maintain effective respirations and to swallow is monitored throughout. Prednisone, taken on alternate days to lower the incidence of side effects, appears to be successful in suppressing the disease. The patient sometimes shows a marked decrease in muscle strength right after therapy is started, but this is usually only temporary.

\end{table}

Cytotoxic medications have also been used, although the precise mechanism of action in myasthenia is not fully understood. Medications such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and cyclosporine reduce the circulating antiacetylcholine receptor antibody titers. Side effects are significant; therefore, these agents are reserved for patients who do not respond to other forms of therapy.

A number of medications are contraindicated for patients with myasthenia gravis because they worsen myasthenic symptoms. Risks and benefits should be weighed by the physician and the patient before taking any new medications, including antibiotics, cardiovascular medications, antiseizure and psychotropic medications, morphine, quinine and related agents, beta-blockers, and nonprescription medications. Procaine (Novocain) should be avoided, and the patient's dentist is so advised.

\section*{PLASMAPHERESIS}

Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) is a technique used to treat exacerbations. The patient's plasma and plasma components are removed through a centrally placed large-bore double-lumen catheter. The blood cells and antibody-containing plasma are separated; then the cells and a plasma substitute are reinfused. Plasma exchange produces a temporary reduction in the titer of circulating antibodies. Plasma exchange improves the symptoms in $75 \%$ of patients, although improvement lasts only a few weeks unless plasmapheresis is continued or other forms of treatment such as immunosuppression with corticosteroids are initiated (Bedlack \& Sanders, 2000). IV immune globulin (IVIG) has recently been shown to be nearly as effective as plasmapheresis in controlling symptom exacerbation (Qureshi, Choudhry, Akbar et al., 1999). However, neither therapy is a cure as it does not stop the production of the acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Thymectomy (surgical removal of the thymus gland) can produce antigen-specific immunosuppression and result in clinical improvement. It can decrease or eliminate the need for medication. In one study $92 \%$ of post-thymectomy patients had symptomatic improvement, with $50 \%$ of them no longer requiring pharmacologic therapy (Wilkins \& Bulkley, 1999). The entire gland must be removed for optimal clinical outcomes; therefore, surgeons prefer the transsternal surgical approach. After surgery, the patient is monitored in an intensive care unit, with special attention to respiratory function. After the thymus gland is removed, it may take up to 1 year for the patient to benefit from the procedure due to the long life of circulating T cells (Wilkins \& Bulkley, 1999).

\section*{Complications: Myasthenic Crisis Versus Cholinergic Crisis}

A myasthenic crisis is an exacerbation of the disease process characterized by severe generalized muscle weakness and respiratory and bulbar weakness that may result in respiratory failure. Crisis may result from disease exacerbation or a specific precipitating event. The most common precipitator is infection; others include medication change, surgery, pregnancy, and high environmental temperature (Bella \& Chad, 1998).

Symptoms of anticholinergic overmedication (cholinergic crisis) may mimic the symptoms of exacerbation. Differentiation can be achieved with the edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test. The patient with myasthenic crisis improves immediately following administration of edrophonium, while the patient with
cholinergic crisis may experience no improvement or deteriorate. If myasthenic crisis is diagnosed, neostigmine methylsulfate (PMS-Neostigmine, Prostigmin) is administered intramuscularly or intravenously until the patient is able to swallow oral anticholinesterase medications. Plasmapheresis and IVIG, which reduce the antibody load, also may be used to treat myasthenic crisis. If cholinergic crisis is identified, all anticholinesterase medications are stopped. The patient receives atropine (Atropine sulfate), the antidote for the anticholinesterase medications.

Neuromuscular respiratory failure is the critical complication of crisis. Respiratory muscle and bulbar weakness combine to cause respiratory compromise. Weak respiratory muscles will not support inhalation. An inadequate cough and an impaired gag reflex caused by bulbar weakness result in poor airway clearance. Values on two respiratory function tests, the negative inspiratory force and vital capacity, will be the first clinical signs to deteriorate. Careful monitoring of these values enables the nurse to monitor for impending respiratory failure. Respiratory support and airway protection are key interventions for the nurse caring for the patient in crisis. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed (see Chap. 25). Nutritional support may be needed if the patient is intubated for a long period.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Because myasthenia gravis is a chronic disease and most patients are seen on an outpatient basis, much of the nursing care focuses on patient and family teaching. Educational topics for outpatient self-care include medication management, energy conservation, strategies to help with ocular manifestations, and prevention and management of complications.

Medication management is a crucial component of ongoing care. Understanding the action of the medications and taking them on schedule is emphasized, as are the consequences of delaying medication and the signs and symptoms of myasthenic and cholinergic crisis. The patient can determine the best times for daily dosing by keeping a diary to determine fluctuation of symptoms and to learn when the medication is wearing off. The medication schedule can then be manipulated to maximize strength throughout the day.

The patient is also taught srategies to conserve energy. To do this, the nurse helps the patient identify the best times for rest periods throughout the day. If the patient lives in a two-story home, the nurse can suggest that frequently used items such as hygiene products, cleaning products, and snacks be kept on each floor to minimize travel between floors. The patient is encouraged to apply for a handicapped license plate to minimize walking from parking spaces and to schedule activities to coincide with peak energy and strength levels.

To minimize the risk of aspiration, mealtimes should coincide with the peak effects of anticholinesterase medication. In addition, rest before meals is encouraged to reduce muscle fatigue. The patient is advised to sit upright during meals with the neck slightly flexed to facilitate swallowing. Soft foods in gravy or sauces can be swallowed more easily; if choking occurs frequently, the nurse can suggest pureéing food to a pudding consistency. Suction should be available at home and the patient and family instructed in its use. Gastrostomy feedings may be necessary in some patients to ensure adequate nutrition.

Impaired vision results from ptosis of one or both eyelids, decreased eye movement, or double vision. To prevent corneal damage when the eyelids do not close completely, the patient is instructed to tape the eyes closed for short intervals and regularly
instill artificial tears. Patients who wear eyeglasses can have "crutches" attached to help lift the eyelids. Patching one eye can help with double vision.

The patient is reminded of the importance of maintaining health promotion practices and of following health care screening recommendations. Factors that will exacerbate symptoms and potentially cause crisis should be noted and avoided: emotional stress, infections (particularly respiratory infections), vigorous physical activity, some medications, and high environmental temperature. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America provides support groups, services, and educational materials for patients, families, and health care providers.

\section*{MANAGING MYASTHENIC AND CHOLINERGIC CRISES}

Respiratory distress and varying degrees of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking), eyelid ptosis, diplopia, and prominent muscle weakness are symptoms of myasthenic and cholinergic crisis. The patient is placed in an intensive care unit for constant monitoring because of associated intense and sudden fluctuations in clinical condition.

IV edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) is used to differentiate the type of crisis. It improves the condition of the patient in myasthenic crisis and temporarily worsens that of the patient in cholinergic crisis. If the patient is in true myasthenic crisis, neostigmine methylsulfate is administered intramuscularly or intravenously. If the edrophonium test is inconclusive or there is increasing respiratory weakness, all anticholinesterase medications are stopped, and atropine sulfate is given to reduce excessive secretions.

Providing ventilatory assistance takes precedence in the immediate management of the patient with myasthenic crisis. Ongoing assessment for respiratory failure is essential. The nurse assesses the respiratory rate, depth, and breath sounds and monitors pulmonary function parameters (vital capacity and negative inspiratory force) to detect pulmonary problems before respiratory dysfunction progresses. Blood is drawn for arterial blood gas analysis. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed (see Chap. 25).

When there is severe weakness of the abdominal, intercostal, and pharyngeal muscles, the patient cannot cough, take deep breaths, or clear secretions. Chest physical therapy, including postural drainage to mobilize secretions, and suctioning to remove secretions may have to be performed frequently. (Postural drainage should not be performed for 30 minutes after feeding.)

Assessment strategies and supportive measures include the following:
- Arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, input and output, and daily weight are monitored.
- If the patient cannot swallow, nasogastric tube feedings may be prescribed.
- Sedatives and tranquilizers are avoided because they aggravate hypoxia and hypercapnia and can cause respiratory and cardiac depression.

\section*{GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME}

Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune attack of the peripheral nerve myelin. The result is acute, rapid segmental demyelination of peripheral nerves and some cranial nerves, producing ascending weakness with dyskinesia (inability to execute voluntary movements), hyporeflexia, and paresthesias (numbness). In $66 \%$ of cases, there is a predisposing event, most often a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, although vaccination, pregnancy,
and surgery have also been identified as antecedent events (Bella \& Chad, 1998). Infection with Campylobacter jejuni (a relatively common gastrointestinal bacterial pathogen) precedes GuillainBarreé syndrome in a few cases (Ho \& Griffin, 1999; Lindenbaum, Kissel \& Mendel, 2001).

The antecedent event usually occurs 2 weeks before symptoms begin. Weakness usually begins in the legs and progresses upward for about 1 month. Maximum weakness varies but usually includes neuromuscular respiratory failure and bulbar weakness. The duration of the symptoms is variable: complete functional recovery may take up to 2 years (Hickey, 2003). Any residual symptoms are permanent and reflect axonal damage from demyelination.

The annual incidence of Guillain-Barré is 0.6 to 1.9 cases per 100,000. Eighty-five percent of patients recover with minimal residual symptoms. Severe residual deficits occur in up to $10 \%$ of patients. Residual deficits are most likely in patients with rapid disease progression, those who require mechanical ventilation, or those 60 years of age or older. Death occurs in 3\% to 8\% of cases, resulting from respiratory failure, autonomic dysfunction, sepsis, or pulmonary emboli (Bella \& Chad, 1998).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Myelin is a complex substance that covers nerves, providing insulation and speeding the conduction of impulses from the cell body to the dendrites. The cell that produces myelin in the peripheral nervous system is the Schwann cell. In Guillain-Barré the Schwann cell is spared, allowing for remyelination in the recovery phase of the disease.

Guillain-Barré is the result of a cell-mediated immune attack on peripheral nerve myelin proteins (Ho \& Griffin, 1999). The best-accepted theory is that an infectious organism contains an amino acid that mimics the peripheral nerve myelin protein. The immune system cannot distinguish between the two proteins and attacks and destroys peripheral nerve myelin. Studies indicate that an exact location within the peripheral nervous system, the ganglioside GM1b, is the most likely target of the immune attack (Yuki, Ang, Koga et al., 2000). With the autoimmune attack there is an influx of macrophages and other immune-mediated agents that attack myelin, cause inflammation and destruction, and leave the axon unable to support nerve conduction.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Classic Guillain-Barré begins with muscle weakness and diminished reflexes of the lower extremities. Hyporeflexia and weakness progress and may result in quadriplegia. Demyelination of the nerves that innervate the diaphragm and intercostal muscles results in neuromuscular respiratory failure. Twenty-five percent of patients will require mechanical ventilation within 18 days of symptom onset (Bella \& Chad, 1998). Sensory symptoms include paresthesias of the hands and feet and pain related to the demyelination of sensory fibers.

Cranial nerve demyelination can result in a variety of clinical manifestations. Optic nerve demyelination may result in blindness. Bulbar muscle weakness related to demyelination of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves results in an inability to swallow or clear secretions. Vagus nerve demyelination results in autonomic dysfunction, manifested by instability of the cardiovascular system. The presentation is variable and may include tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, or orthostatic hypotension. The symptoms of autonomic dysfunction occur and resolve
rapidly. Guillain-Barré does not affect cognitive function or level of consciousness.

While the classic clinical features include areflexia and ascending weakness, variation in presentation occurs. There may be a sensory presentation, with progressive sensory symptoms, an atypical axonal destruction, and the Miller-Fisher variant, which includes paralysis of the ocular muscles, ataxia, and areflexia (Ho \& Griffin, 1999).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient presents with symmetric weakness, diminished reflexes, and upward progression of motor weakness. A history of a viral illness in the previous few weeks suggests the diagnosis. Changes in vital capacity and negative inspiratory force are assessed to identify impending neuromuscular respiratory failure. Serum laboratory tests are not useful in the diagnosis. However, elevated protein levels are detected in CSF evaluation, without an increase in other cells. Evoked potential studies demonstrate a progressive loss of nerve conduction velocity (Bella \& Chad, 1999).

\section*{Medical Management}

Because of the possibility of rapid progression and neuromuscular respiratory failure, Guillain-Barré is a medical emergency, requiring intensive care unit management. Careful assessment of changes in motor weakness and respiratory function alert the clinician to the physical and respiratory needs of the patient. Respiratory therapy or mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support pulmonary function and adequate oxygenation. Mechanical ventilation may be required for an extended period. The patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation when the respiratory muscles can again support spontaneous respiration and maintain adequate tissue oxygenation.

Other interventions are aimed at preventing the complications of immobility. These may include the use of anticoagulant agents and thigh-high elastic compression stockings or sequential compression boots to prevent thrombosis and pulmonary emboli.

Plasmapheresis and IVIG are used to directly affect the peripheral nerve myelin antibody level. Both therapies decrease circulating antibody levels and reduce the amount of time the patient is immobilized and dependent on mechanical ventilation. Studies indicate that IVIG and plasmapheresis are equally effective in treating Guillain-Barré (Bella \& Chad, 1999; Winer, 2002).

The cardiovascular risks posed by autonomic dysfunction require continuous ECG monitoring. Tachycardia and hypertension are treated with short-acting medications such as alpha-adrenergic blocking agents. Hypotension is managed by increasing the amount of IV fluid administered. The use of short-acting agents is important because autonomic dysfunction is very labile.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME}

\section*{Assessment}

Ongoing assessment for disease progression is critical. The patient is monitored for life-threatening complications (respiratory failure, cardiac dysrhythmias, DVTs) so that appropriate interventions can be initiated. Because of the threat to the patient in this sudden, potentially life-threatening disease, the nurse must assess the patient's and family's ability to cope and their use of appropriate coping strategies.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Ineffective breathing pattern and impaired gas exchange related to rapidly progressive weakness and impending respiratory failure
- Impaired physical mobility related to paralysis
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inability to swallow
- Impaired verbal communication related to cranial nerve dysfunction
- Fear and anxiety related to loss of control and paralysis

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Respiratory failure
- Autonomic dysfunction

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include improved respiratory function, increased mobility, improved nutritional status, effective communication, decreased fear and anxiety, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING RESPIRATORY FUNCTION}

Respiratory function can be maximized with incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy. Monitoring for changes in vital capacity and negative inspiratory force are key to early intervention for neuromuscular respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation is required if the vital capacity falls, making spontaneous breathing impossible and tissue oxygenation inadequate.

Parameters for determining the appropriate time to begin mechanical ventilation include a vital capacity of 12 to $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$, downward vital capacity trend over 4 to 6 hours, and an inability to clear secretions (Bella \& Chad, 1999). The potential need for mechanical ventilation should be discussed with the patient and family on admission to provide time for psychological preparation and decision-making. Intubation and mechanical ventilation will result in less anxiety if it is initiated on a nonemergent basis to a well-informed patient. The patient may require mechanical ventilation for a long period. Nursing management of the patient requiring mechanical ventilation is discussed in Chapter 25.

Bulbar weakness that impairs the ability to swallow and clear secretions is another factor in the development of respiratory failure in the patient with Guillain-Barré. Suctioning may be needed to maintain a clear airway.

The nurse assesses the blood pressure and heart rate frequently to identify autonomic dysfunction so that interventions can be initiated quickly if needed. Medications are administered or a temporary pacemaker is placed for clinically significant bradycardia (Winer, 2002).

\section*{ENHANCING PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Nursing interventions to enhance physical mobility and prevent the complications of immobility are key to the function and survival of these patients. The paralyzed extremities are supported in
functional positions, and passive range-of-motion exercises are performed at least twice daily.

DVT and pulmonary embolism are threats to the paralyzed patient. Nursing interventions are aimed at preventing DVT. Range-of-motion exercises, altering positioning, anticoagulation, thigh-high elastic compression stockings or sequential compression boots, and adequate hydration will decrease the risk for DVT.

Padding may be placed over bony prominences such as the elbows and heels to reduce the risk for pressure ulcers. The need for consistent position changes every 2 hours cannot be overemphasized. The nurse evaluates laboratory test results that may indicate malnutrition or dehydration, both of which increase the risk for pressure ulcers. Collaboration with the physician and dietitian will result in a plan to meet the patient's nutritional and hydration needs.

\section*{PROVIDING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Paralytic ileus may result from insufficient parasympathetic activity. In this event, the nurse administers IV fluids and parenteral nutrition as prescribed and monitors for the return of bowel sounds. If the patient cannot swallow due to bulbar paralysis (immobility of muscles), a gastrostomy tube may be placed to administer nutrients. The nurse carefully assesses the return of the gag reflex and bowel sounds before resuming oral nutrition.

\section*{IMPROVING COMMUNICATION}

Because of paralysis and ventilator management, the patient cannot talk, laugh, or cry and thus has no method for communicating needs or expressing emotion. Establishing some form of communication with picture cards or an eye blink system will provide a means of communication. Collaboration with the speech therapist may be helpful in developing a communication mechanism that is most effective for a specific patient.

\section*{DECREASING FEAR AND ANXIETY}

The patient and family are faced with a sudden, potentially lifethreatening disease, and anxiety and fear are constant themes for them. The impact of disease on the family will depend on the patient's age and role within the family. Referral to a support group may provide information and support to the patient and family.

The family may feel helpless in caring for the patient. Mechanical ventilation and monitoring devices may frighten and intimidate them. Family members often want to participate in physical care; with instruction and support by the nurse, they should be allowed to do so.

In addition to fear, the patient may experience isolation, loneliness, and lack of control. Nursing interventions that increase the patient's sense of control include providing information about the condition, emphasizing a positive appraisal of coping resources, and teaching relaxation exercises and distraction techniques. The positive attitude and atmosphere of the multidisciplinary team are important to promote a sense of well-being.

Diversional activities are encouraged to decrease loneliness and isolation. Encouraging visitors, engaging visitors or volunteers to read to the patient, listening to music or books on tape, and watching television are ways to alleviate the patient's sense of isolation.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Thorough assessment of respiratory function at regular intervals is essential because respiratory insufficiency and subsequent fail-
ure due to weakness or paralysis of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm may develop quickly. Respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality, which is reported to be as high as $10 \%$ to $20 \%$. Vital capacity is monitored frequently and at regular intervals in addition to respiratory rate and the quality of respirations, so that respiratory insufficiency can be anticipated. Decreasing vital capacity associated with weakness of the muscles used in swallowing, which causes difficulty in both coughing and swallowing, indicates impending respiratory failure. Signs and symptoms include breathlessness while speaking, shallow and irregular breathing, use of accessory muscles, tachycardia, and changes in respiratory pattern.

Parameters for determining the onset of respiratory failure are established on admission, allowing intubation and the initiation of mechanical ventilation on a nonemergent basis. This also allows the patient to be prepared for the procedure in a controlled manner, which reduces anxiety and complications.

Other complications include cardiac dysrhythmias, which necessitate ECG monitoring, transient hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, DVT, pulmonary embolism, urinary retention, and other threats to any immobilized and paralyzed patient. These require monitoring and attention to prevent them and prompt treatment if indicated.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and their families are usually frightened by the sudden onset of life-threatening symptoms and their severity. Therefore, teaching the patient and family about the disorder and its generally favorable prognosis is important (Chart 64-5). During the acute phase of the illness, the patient and family are instructed about strategies they can implement to minimize the effects of immobility and other complications. As function begins to return, family members and other home care providers are instructed about care of the patient and their role in the rehabilitation process. Preparation for discharge is an interdisciplinary effort requiring family or caregiver education by all team members, including the nurse, physician, occupational and physical therapists, speech therapist, and respiratory therapist.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Most patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome experience complete recovery. Patients who have experienced total or prolonged paralysis require intensive rehabilitation; the extent depends on the patient's needs. Approaches include a comprehensive inpatient program if deficits are significant, an outpatient program if the patient can travel by car, or a home program of physical and occupational therapy. The recovery phase may be long and will require patience as well as involvement on the part of the patient and family.

During acute care the focus is on obvious needs, issues, and deficits. The nurse needs to remind or instruct patients and family members of the need for continuing health promotion and screening practices following this initial phase of care.

\section*{Cranial Nerve Disorders}

Because the brain stem and cranial nerves involve vital motor, sensory, or autonomic functions of the body, these nerves may be affected by conditions arising primarily within these structures or in secondary extension from adjacent disease processes. The cranial nerves (Fig. 64-6) are examined separately and in sequence (see Chap. 60). Some cranial nerve deficits can be detected by observing the patient's face, eye movements, speech, and swallowing. Electromyography (EMG) is used to investigate motor and sensory dysfunction. MRI is used to obtain images of the cranial nerves and brain stem. An overview of disorders that may affect each of the cranial nerves, including clinical manifestations and nursing interventions, is presented in Table 64-1. The following discussion centers on trigeminal neuralgia, a condition affecting the fifth cranial nerve, and Bell's palsy, caused by involvement of the seventh cranial nerve. These are the most common disorders of the cranial nerves.

\section*{TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA (TIC DOULOUREUX)}

Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition of the fifth cranial nerve characterized by paroxysms of pain in the area innervated by any of the three branches, but it most commonly occurs in the second and third branches of the trigeminal nerve (Maloni, 2000) (Fig. 64-7). The pain ends as abruptly as it starts and is described as a unilateral shooting and stabbing sensation. The unilateral nature of the pain is an important diagnostic characteristic (Preul, 2001). Associated involuntary contraction of the facial muscles can cause sudden closing of the eye or a twitch of the mouth, hence the name tic douloureux (painful twitch). The cause is not certain, but chronic compression or irritation of the trigeminal nerve or de-
generative changes in the gasserian ganglion are suggested causes. Vascular pressure from structural abnormalities (loop of an artery) encroaching on the trigeminal nerve, gasserian ganglion, or root entry zone has also been suggested as a cause.

Trigeminal neuralgia is 400 times more common in patients with MS than in the general population. The pain is more often cyclic and affects men with MS at a higher rate than women with MS (Maloni, 2000).

Early attacks, appearing most often in the fifth decade of life, are usually mild and brief. Pain-free intervals may be measured in terms of minutes, hours, days, or longer. With advancing years, the painful episodes tend to become more frequent and agonizing. The patient lives in constant fear of attacks.

Paroxysms can occur with any stimulation of the terminals of the affected nerve branches, such as washing the face, shaving, brushing the teeth, eating, and drinking. A draft of cold air and direct pressure against the nerve trunk may also cause pain. Certain areas are called trigger points because the slightest touch immediately starts a paroxysm or episode. To avoid stimulating these areas, patients with trigeminal neuralgia try not to touch or wash their faces, shave, chew, or do anything else that might cause an attack. These behaviors are a clue to diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Antiseizure agents, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), relieve pain in most patients with trigeminal neuralgia by reducing the transmission of impulses at certain nerve terminals. Carbamazepine is taken with meals. Serum levels must be monitored to avoid toxicity in patients who require high doses to control the pain. Side effects include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, and aplastic anemia. The patient is monitored for bone marrow depression during longterm therapy. Gabapentin (Neurontin) and baclofen (Lioresal)

are also used for pain control. If pain control is still not achieved, phenytoin (Dilantin) may be used as adjunctive therapy (Rowland, 2000).

Alcohol or phenol injection of the gasserian ganglion and peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve relieves pain for several months. However, the pain returns with nerve regeneration.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

When these methods fail to relieve pain, a number of surgical options are available. The choice of procedure depends on the patient's preference and health status.

Microvascular Decompression of the Trigeminal Nerve. An intracranial approach can be used to decompress the trigeminal nerve. The pain may be caused by vascular compression of the entry zone of the trigeminal root by an arterial loop and occa-
sionally by a vein. With the aid of an operating microscope, the artery loop is lifted from the nerve to relieve the pressure, and a small prosthetic device is inserted to prevent recurrence of impingement on the nerve. This procedure relieves facial pain while preserving normal sensation, but it is a major procedure, involving a craniotomy. The postoperative management is the same as for other intracranial surgeries (see Chap. 61).

Percutaneous Radiofrequency Trigeminal Gangliolysis. Percutaneous radiofrequency interruption of the gasserian ganglion, in which the small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated fibers that conduct pain are thermally destroyed, is the surgical procedure of choice for trigeminal neuralgia (Tronnier, Rasche, Hamer et al., 2001). Use of stereotactic MRI for identification of the trigeminal nerve followed by gamma knife radiosurgery is being used at some centers with good results (Maesawa et al., 2001).

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 64-7 Distribution of trigeminal nerve branches.}
\end{figure}

Under local anesthesia, the needle is introduced through the cheek on the affected side. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the needle electrode is guided through the foramen magnum into the gasserian ganglion. The divisions of the gasserian ganglion (mandibular, maxillary, and ophthalmic) are encountered sequentially. The nerve is stimulated with a small current while the patient is awake. The patient reports when a tingling sensation is felt. When the electrode needle is in the desired position, the patient is anesthetized briefly and a radiofrequency current (heating current to destroy the nerve) is passed in a controlled manner to injure the trigeminal ganglion and rootlets thermally. The patient is then awakened from the anesthesia and examined for sensory deficits. This is repeated until the desired effect is achieved. The procedure takes less than 1 hour and provides permanent pain relief in most patients. Touch and proprioceptive functions are left intact.

In the patient with trigeminal neuralgia and MS who is refractory to medical pain management, the surgical treatment of choice is trigeminal rhizotomy (Maloni, 2000). See Chapter 13 for care of the patient following a rhizotomy.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PREVENTING PAIN}

Preoperative management of a patient with trigeminal neuralgia occurs mostly on an outpatient basis and includes recognizing factors that may aggravate excruciating facial pain, such as food that is too hot or too cold or jarring the patient's bed or chair. Even washing the face, combing the hair, or brushing the teeth may produce acute pain. The nurse can assist the patient in preventing or reducing this pain by providing instructions about preventive strategies. Providing cotton pads and room-temperature water for washing the face, instructing the patient to rinse with mouthwash after eating when tooth-brushing causes pain, and performing personal hygiene during pain-free intervals are all effective strategies. The patient is instructed to take food and fluids at room temperature, to chew on the unaffected side, and to ingest soft foods. The nurse recognizes that anxiety, depression, and insomnia often accompany chronic painful conditions and uses appropriate interventions and referrals. (See Chap. 13 for management of patients with chronic pain.)

\section*{PROVIDING POSTOPERATIVE CARE}

Postoperative neurologic assessments are conducted to evaluate the patient for facial motor and sensory deficits in each of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. If the surgery results in sensory deficits to the affected side of the face, the patient is instructed not to rub the eye, because pain will not be felt if there is injury. The eye is assessed for irritation or redness. Artificial tears may be prescribed to prevent dryness in the affected eye. The patient is cautioned not to chew on the affected side until numbness has diminished. The patient is observed carefully for any difficulty in eating and swallowing foods of different consistency.

\section*{BELL'S PALSY}

Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) is due to unilateral inflammation of the seventh cranial nerve, which results in weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles on the affected side (Fig. 64-8). The cause is unknown, although possible causes may include vascular ischemia, viral disease (herpes simplex, herpes zoster), autoimmune disease, or a combination of all of these factors. The incidence is 13 to

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-462.jpg?height=1238&width=803&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=1153}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 64-8 Distribution of facial nerve.}
\end{figure}

34 cases per 100,000; it increases with age and among pregnant women in the third trimester (Campbell \& Brundage, 2002; Shmorgun, Chan \& Ray, 2002).

Bell's palsy is considered by some to represent a type of pressure paralysis. The inflamed, edematous nerve becomes compressed to the point of damage, or its nutrient vessel is occluded, producing ischemic necrosis of the nerve. There is distortion of the face from paralysis of the facial muscles; increased lacrimation (tearing); and painful sensations in the face, behind the ear, and in the eye. The patient may experience speech difficulties and may be unable to eat on the affected side because of weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles.

\section*{Management}

The objectives of treatment are to maintain the muscle tone of the face and to prevent or minimize denervation. The patient should be reassured that no stroke has occurred and that spontaneous recovery occurs within 3 to 5 weeks in most patients.

Corticosteroid therapy (prednisone) may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and edema; this reduces vascular compression and permits restoration of blood circulation to the nerve. Early administration of corticosteroid therapy appears to diminish the severity of the disease, relieve the pain, and prevent or minimize denervation.

Facial pain is controlled with analgesic agents. Heat may be applied to the involved side of the face to promote comfort and blood flow through the muscles.

Electrical stimulation may be applied to the face to prevent muscle atrophy. Although most patients recover with conservative treatment, surgical exploration of the facial nerve may be indicated in patients who are suspected of having a tumor or for surgical decompression of the facial nerve and for surgical treatment of a paralyzed face.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. While the paralysis lasts, the involved eye must be protected. Frequently, the eye does not close completely and the blink reflex is diminished, so the eye is vulnerable to dust and foreign particles. Corneal irritation and ulceration may occur if the eye is unprotected. Distortion of the lower lid alters the proper drainage of tears. To prevent injury, the eye should be covered with a protective shield at night. The eye patch may abrade the cornea, however, because there is some difficulty in keeping the partially paralyzed eyelids closed. The application of eye ointment at bedtime causes the eyelids to adhere to one another and remain closed during sleep. The patient can be taught to close the paralyzed eyelid manually before going to sleep. Wrap-around sunglasses or goggles may be worn to decrease normal evaporation from the eye.

Continuing Care. When the sensitivity of the nerve to touch decreases and the patient can tolerate touching the face, the nurse can suggest massaging the face several times daily, using a gentle upward motion, to maintain muscle tone. Facial exercises, such as wrinkling the forehead, blowing out the cheeks, and whistling, may be performed with the aid of a mirror in an effort to prevent muscle atrophy. Exposure of the face to cold and drafts is avoided.

\section*{Disorders of the Peripheral Nervous System}

\section*{PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES}

A peripheral neuropathy (disorder of the nervous system) is a disorder affecting the peripheral motor, sensory, or autonomic nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the spinal cord and brain to all other organs. They transmit motor impulses from the brain and relay sensory impulses to the brain. A mononeuropathy affects a single peripheral nerve; multiple mononeuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex indicates the involvement of multiple single peripheral nerves or their branches. Polyneuropathies are characterized by bilateral and symmetric disturbance of function, usually beginning in the feet and hands. (Most nutritional, metabolic, and toxic neuropathies take this form.)

The most common causes of peripheral neuropathy are diabetes, alcoholism, and occlusive vascular disease. These disorders result in hypoxia or atrophy of the peripheral nerve. Many bacterial and metabolic toxins and exogenous poisons also cause peripheral neuropathy. Because of the growing use of chemicals in industry, agriculture, and medicine, the number of substances causing peripheral neuropathies and the incidence of peripheral neuropathies have increased. In developing countries, leprosy is a major cause of severe nerve disease because Mycobacterium leprae invade the peripheral nervous system.

The major symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders are loss of sensation, muscle atrophy, weakness, diminished reflexes, pain, and paresthesia (numbness, tingling) of the extremities. The pa-
tient frequently describes some part of the extremity as numb. Autonomic features include decreased or absent sweating, orthostatic hypotension, nocturnal diarrhea, tachycardia, impotence, and atrophic skin and nail changes.

Peripheral nerve disorders are diagnosed by history, physical examination, EMG, and somatosensory evoked potentials.

\section*{MONONEUROPATHY}

Mononeuropathy is limited to a single peripheral nerve and its branches. It arises when the trunk of the nerve is compressed or entrapped (as in carpal tunnel syndrome); traumatized, as when bruised by a blow, or overstretched, as in joint dislocation; punctured by a needle used to inject a drug or damaged by the drugs thus injected; or inflamed because an adjacent infectious process extends to the nerve trunk. Mononeuropathy frequently is seen in patients with diabetes.

Pain is seldom a major symptom of mononeuropathy when the condition is due to trauma, but in patients with complicating inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, pain is prominent. Pain is increased by all body movements that tend to stretch, strain, or cause pressure on the injured nerve and by sudden jarring of the body (eg, coughing and sneezing). The skin in the areas supplied by nerves that are injured or diseased may become reddened and glossy; the subcutaneous tissue may become edematous, and the nails and hair in this area become defective. Chemical injuries to a nerve trunk, such as those caused by drugs injected into or near it, are often permanent.

The objective of treatment of mononeuropathy is to remove the cause, if possible, such as by freeing the compressed nerve. Local corticosteroid injections may reduce inflammation and the pressure on the nerve. Aspirin or codeine may be used to relieve pain.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 19-year-old college student is suspected of having meningococcal meningitis. Identify two neurologic changes that may reflect increased ICP. What interventions would be included in your plan of care to protect the patient from injury? The patient's family has many questions about the disease and their risk of contracting meningitis. Develop a teaching plan that would describe meningococcal meningitis and prophylactic therapy for the patient's family and close contacts.
2. Your patient has been receiving one of the injectable interferon medications for the treatment of MS for about 6 months. She reports that she is becoming very discouraged because the medication does not seem to improve her symptoms. In addition, she reports that she has developed skin lesions at the injection sites. Identify the areas of assessment that are of priority at this time. Describe nursing interventions, including teaching and referral, that you would consider at this time. Provide the rationale for your interventions.
3. Your patient has been admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of possible Guillain-Barré. Identify the priorities of assessment for this patient and the nursing and medical interventions that you would anticipate.
4. Your patient has myasthenia gravis. Although she reports that her condition has been stable and that she has been able
to manage without assistance, she reports increasing weakness and fatigue. What nursing assessments and interventions are warranted for her? What discharge plans are indicated if she is to return home to the care of her family? How would your discharge planning change if she lives alone in an apartment on the second floor of a building without an elevator?
5. A 52-year-old man has just been diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia. Tegretol has been prescribed for pain management. Develop a teaching plan that explains the nature of trigeminal neuralgia, the side effects of Tegretol, and measures he can take to avoid triggering a painful episode. How would you evaluate the outcome of your teaching plan?

\section*{Management of Patients With Oncologic or Degenerative Neurologic Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Identify the pathophysiologic processes responsible for oncologic disorders.
2. Describe brain and spinal cord tumors: their classification, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and medical and nursing management.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with cerebral metastases or inoperable brain tumors.
4. Identify the pathophysiologic processes responsible for various degenerative neurologic disorders.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with degenerative neurologic disorders.
6. Identify resources for patients and families with oncologic and degenerative neurologic disorders.

Disease processes that are oncologic or degenerative produce a unique set of problems when they occur in the neurologic system. Oncologic processes include brain and spinal cord tumors. Degenerative neurologic disorders include Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, and degenerative disc disease. A relatively new phenomenon, post-polio syndrome, may be degenerative in nature and is therefore included in this chapter.

\section*{Oncologic Disorders of the Brain and Spinal Cord}

Oncologic disorders in the brain and spinal cord include several types of neoplasms, each with its own biology, prognosis, and treatment options. Because of the unique anatomy and physiology of the central nervous system (CNS), this collection of neoplasms is challenging to diagnose and treat. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, assessment findings, and medical and nursing management of brain tumors and spinal cord tumors are discussed in the following sections.

\section*{PRIMARY BRAIN TUMORS}

A brain tumor is a localized intracranial lesion that occupies space within the skull. Tumors usually grow as a spherical mass, but they can grow diffusely and infiltrate tissue. The effects of neoplasms occur from the compression and infiltration of tissue. A variety of physiologic changes result, causing any or all of the following pathophysiologic events:
- Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral edema
- Seizure activity and focal neurologic signs
- Hydrocephalus
- Altered pituitary function

Primary brain tumors originate from cells and structures within the brain. Secondary, or metastatic, brain tumors develop from structures outside the brain and occur in $20 \%$ to $40 \%$ of all patients with cancer. Brain tumors rarely metastasize outside the CNS, but metastatic lesions to the brain occur commonly from the lung, breast, lower gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, kidney, and skin (melanomas).

The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown. The only known risk factor is exposure to ionizing radiation. Both glial and meningeal neoplasms have been linked to irradiation of the cranium, with a latency period of 10 to 20 years after exposure
(DeAngelis, 2001). Additional possible causes have been investigated, but results of studies are conflicting and unconvincing; suggested causes have included use of cellular telephones, exposure to high-tension wires, use of hair dyes, head trauma, dietary exposure to such factors as nitrates (found in some processed and barbecued foods), and other sources (DeAngelis, 2001).

The incidence of brain tumors appears to have increased in the past few decades. Epidemiologic data, however, suggest that this is due more to aggressive and accurate diagnosis rather than to an actual rise in incidence. It is estimated that there are about 17,000 new cases of primary brain tumors per year, 9,600 in men and 7,400 in women (American Cancer Society, 2002). Secondary tumors or metastases to the brain from a systemic primary cancer are more common (DeAngelis, 2001). The highest incidence of brain tumors in adults occurs in the fifth, sixth, and seventh decades, with a slightly higher incidence in men. In adults, most brain tumors originate from glial cells (glial cells make up the structure and support system of the brain and spinal cord) and are supratentorial (located above the covering of the cerebellum). Neoplastic lesions in the brain ultimately cause death by impairing vital functions, such as respiration, or by increasing intracranial pressure (ICP).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Brain tumors may be classified into several groups: those arising from the coverings of the brain (eg, dural meningioma), those developing in or on the cranial nerves (eg, acoustic neuroma), those originating within brain tissue (eg, gliomas), and metastatic lesions originating elsewhere in the body. Tumors of the pituitary and pineal glands and of cerebral blood vessels are also types of brain tumors. Relevant clinical considerations include the location and the histologic character of the tumor. Tumors may be benign or malignant. A benign tumor can occur in a vital area and can grow large enough to have effects as serious as those of a malignant tumor.

\section*{GLIOMAS}

Glial tumors, the most common type of brain neoplasm, are divided into many categories (DeAngelis, 2001). See Chart 65-1 for the classification of brain tumors. Astrocytomas are the most common type of glioma and are graded from I to IV, indicating the degree of malignancy. The grade is based on cellular density, cell mitosis, and appearance. Usually, these tumors spread by infiltrating into the surrounding neural connective tissue and therefore cannot be totally removed without causing considerable damage to vital structures.

\section*{Classification of Adult Brain Tumors}

\section*{I. Intracerebral Tumors}
A. Gliomas-infiltrate any portion of the brain; most common type of brain tumor
1. Astrocytomas (grades I and II)
2. Glioblastoma multiforme (astrocytoma grades III and IV)
3. Oligodendrocytoma (low and high grades)
4. Ependymoma (grades I to IV)
5. Medulloblastoma
II. Tumors Arising From Supporting Structures
A. Meningiomas
B. Neuromas (acoustic neuroma, schwannoma)
C. Pituitary adenomas
III. Developmental Tumors
A. Angiomas
B. Dermoid, epidermoid, teroma, craniopharyngioma
IV. Metastatic Lesions

Oligodendroglial tumors are another type of glial tumor, representing 20\% of gliomas (DeAngelis, 2001). The histologic distinction between astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas is difficult to make but important, as recent research shows that oligodendrogliomas are more sensitive to chemotherapy than astrocytomas. These tumors are categorized as low-grade and highgrade (anaplastic).

\section*{MENINGIOMAS}

Meningiomas, which represent $20 \%$ of all primary brain tumors, are common benign encapsulated tumors of arachnoid cells on the meninges (DeAngelis, 2001). They are slow-growing and occur most often in middle-aged adults (more often in women). Meningiomas most often occur in areas proximal to the venous sinuses. Manifestations depend on the area involved and are the result of compression rather than invasion of brain tissue. Standard treatment is surgery with complete removal or partial dissection.

\section*{ACOUSTIC NEUROMAS}

An acoustic neuroma is a tumor of the eighth cranial nerve, the cranial nerve most responsible for hearing and balance. It usually arises just within the internal auditory meatus, where it frequently expands before filling the cerebellopontine recess.

An acoustic neuroma may grow slowly and attain considerable size before it is correctly diagnosed. The patient usually experiences loss of hearing, tinnitus, and episodes of vertigo and staggering gait. As the tumor becomes larger, painful sensations of the face may occur on the same side as a result of the tumor's compression of the fifth cranial nerve.

With improved imaging techniques and the use of the operating microscope and microsurgical instrumentation, even large tumors can be removed through a relatively small craniotomy. Some of these tumors may be suitable for stereotactic radiotherapy rather than surgery. See the discussion of stereotactic radiotherapy later in this chapter.

\section*{PITUITARY ADENOMAS}

Pituitary tumors represent about $8 \%$ to $12 \%$ of all brain tumors and cause symptoms as a result of pressure on adjacent structures or hormonal changes (hyperfunction or hypofunction of the pituitary). The pituitary gland, also called the hypophysis, is a relatively small gland located in the sella turcica. It is attached to the
hypothalamus by a short stalk (hypophyseal stalk) and is divided into two lobes: the anterior (adenohypophysis) and the posterior (neurohypophysis).

Pressure Effects of Pituitary Adenomas. Pressure from a pituitary adenoma may be exerted on the optic nerves, optic chiasm, or optic tracts or on the hypothalamus or the third ventricle when the tumor invades the cavernous sinuses or expands into the sphenoid bone. These pressure effects produce headache, visual dysfunction, hypothalamic disorders (eg, disorders of sleep, appetite, temperature and emotions), increased ICP, and enlargement and erosion of the sella turcica.

Hormonal Effects of Pituitary Adenomas. Functioning pituitary tumors can produce one or more hormones normally produced by the anterior pituitary. These hormones may cause prolactinsecreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas), growth hormonesecreting pituitary adenomas that produce acromegaly in adults, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary adenomas that result in Cushing's disease. Adenomas that secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone occur infrequently, whereas adenomas that produce both growth hormone and prolactin are relatively common.

The female patient whose pituitary gland is secreting excessive quantities of prolactin presents with amenorrhea or galactorrhea (excessive or spontaneous flow of milk). Male patients with prolactinomas may present with impotence and hypogonadism. Acromegaly, caused by excess growth hormone, produces enlargement of the hands and feet, distortion of the facial features, and pressure on peripheral nerves (entrapment syndromes). The clinical features of Cushing's disease, a condition associated with prolonged overproduction of cortisol, occur with excessive production of ACTH. Manifestations include a form of obesity with redistribution of fat to the facial, supraclavicular, and abdominal areas; hypertension; purple striae and ecchymoses; osteoporosis; elevated blood glucose levels; and emotional disorders.

\section*{ANGIOMAS}

Brain angiomas (masses composed largely of abnormal blood vessels) are found either in or on the surface of the brain. They occur in the cerebellum in $83 \%$ of cases. Some persist throughout life without causing symptoms; others cause symptoms of a brain tumor. Occasionally, the diagnosis is suggested by the presence of another angioma somewhere in the head or by a bruit (an abnormal sound) audible over the skull. Because the walls of the blood vessels in angiomas are thin, these patients are at risk for a cerebral vascular accident (stroke). In fact, cerebral hemorrhage in people younger than 40 years of age should suggest the possibility of an angioma.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Brain tumors can produce either focal or generalized neurologic signs and symptoms. Generalized symptoms reflect increased ICP, and the most common focal or specific signs and symptoms result from tumors interfering with functions in specific brain regions. Figure 65-1 indicates common tumor sites in the brain.

\section*{INCREASING ICP}

As discussed in Chapter 61, the skull is a rigid compartment containing essential noncompressible contents: brain matter, intravascular blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). According to the modified Monro-Kellie hypothesis, if any one of these skull

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-469.jpg?height=1296&width=1569&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=213}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 65-1 Common brain tumor sites.}
\end{figure}
components increases in volume, ICP increases unless one of the other components decreases in volume. Consequently, any change in volume occupied by the brain (as occurs with disorders such as brain tumor or cerebral edema) produces signs and symptoms of increased ICP.

Symptoms of increased ICP result from a gradual compression of the brain by the enlarging tumor. The effect is a disruption of the equilibrium that exists between the brain, the CSF, and the cerebral blood, all located within the skull. As the tumor grows, compensatory adjustments may occur through compression of intracranial veins, reduction of CSF volume (by increased absorption or decreased production), a modest decrease of cerebral blood flow, and reduction of intracellular and extracellular brain tissue mass. When these compensatory mechanisms fail, the patient develops signs and symptoms of increased ICP. The three most common signs of increased ICP are headache, nausea and vomiting, and a sixth-nerve palsy (DeAngelis, 2001). Personality changes and a variety of focal deficits, including motor, sensory, and cranial nerve dysfunction, are also common.

Headache. Headache, although not always present, is most common in the early morning and is made worse by coughing, straining, or sudden movement. It is thought to be caused by the tumor invading, compressing, or distorting the pain-sensitive structures or by edema that accompanies the tumor. Headaches are usually
described as deep or expanding or as dull but unrelenting. Frontal tumors usually produce a bilateral frontal headache; pituitary gland tumors produce pain radiating between the two temples (bitemporal); in cerebellar tumors, the headache may be located in the suboccipital region at the back of the head.

Vomiting. Vomiting, seldom related to food intake, is usually due to irritation of the vagal centers in the medulla. If the vomiting is of the forceful type, it is described as projectile vomiting.

Visual Disturbances. Papilledema (edema of the optic nerve) is present in $70 \%$ to $75 \%$ of patients and is associated with visual disturbances such as decreased visual acuity, diplopia (double vision), and visual field deficits.

\section*{LOCALIZED SYMPTOMS}

The most common focal or localized symptoms are hemiparesis, seizures, and mental status changes (DeAngelis, 2001). When specific regions of the brain are affected, additional local signs and symptoms occur, such as sensory and motor abnormalities, visual alterations, alterations in cognition, and language disturbances such as aphasia. The progression of the signs and symptoms is important because it indicates tumor growth and expansion. For example, a rapidly developing hemiparesis is more typical of a highly malignant glioma than a low-grade tumor (DeAngelis, 2001).

Although some tumors are not easily localized because they lie in so-called silent areas of the brain (ie, areas in which functions are not definitely determined), many tumors can be localized by correlating the signs and symptoms to known areas of the brain, as follows:
- A motor cortex tumor produces seizure-like movements localized on one side of the body, called Jacksonian seizures.
- An occipital lobe tumor produces visual manifestations: contralateral homonymous hemianopsia (visual loss in half of the visual field on the opposite side of the tumor) and visual hallucinations.
- A cerebellar tumor causes dizziness, an ataxic or staggering gait with a tendency to fall toward the side of the lesion, marked muscle incoordination, and nystagmus (involuntary rhythmic eye movements), usually in the horizontal direction.
- A frontal lobe tumor frequently produces personality disorders, changes in emotional state and behavior, and an uninterested mental attitude. The patient often becomes extremely untidy and careless and may use obscene language.
- A cerebellopontine angle tumor usually originates in the sheath of the acoustic nerve and gives rise to a characteristic sequence of symptoms. Tinnitus and vertigo appear first, soon followed by progressive nerve deafness (eighth cranial nerve dysfunction). Numbness and tingling of the face and the tongue occur (due to involvement of the fifth cranial nerve). Later, weakness or paralysis of the face develops (seventh cranial nerve involvement). Finally, because the enlarging tumor presses on the cerebellum, abnormalities in motor function may be present.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The history of the illness and the manner and time frame in which the symptoms evolved are key components in the diagnosis of brain tumors. A neurologic examination indicates the areas of the CNS involved. To assist in the precise localization of the lesion, a battery of tests is performed. Computed tomography (CT) scans, enhanced by a contrast agent, can give specific information concerning the number, size, and density of the lesions and the extent of secondary cerebral edema. CT scans can provide information about the ventricular system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most helpful diagnostic tool for detecting brain tumors, particularly smaller lesions, and tumors in the brain stem and pituitary regions, where bone interferes with CT (Fig. 65-2). In a few instances, the appearance of a brain tumor on an MRI is so characteristic that a biopsy is unnecessary, especially when the tumor is located in a part of the brain that is difficult to biopsy (American Cancer Society, 2001).

In centers where positron emission tomography (PET) is available, it is used to supplement MRI. On PET scans, low-grade tumors are associated with hypometabolism and high-grade tumors show hypermetabolism. This information can be useful in treatment decisions (DeAngelis, 2001). Computer-assisted stereotactic (three-dimensional) biopsy is being used to diagnose deep-seated brain tumors and to provide a basis for treatment and prognosis. Cerebral angiography provides visualization of cerebral blood vessels and can localize most cerebral tumors.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) can detect an abnormal brain wave in regions occupied by a tumor and is used to evaluate temporal lobe seizures and assist in ruling out other disorders.

Cytologic studies of the CSF may be performed to detect malignant cells because CNS tumors can shed cells into the CSF.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Intracranial tumors can produce personality changes, confusion, speech dysfunction, or disturbances of gait. In elderly patients early signs and symptoms of intracranial tumors can be easily overlooked and incorrectly attributed to cognitive and neurologic changes associated with normal aging. The most frequent tumor types in the elderly are anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and cerebral metastases from other sites. The incidence of primary brain tumors and the likelihood of malignancy increase with age. Signs and symptoms in the elderly must be carefully evaluated because $10 \%$ of brain metastases occur in patients with a history of prior cancer (Rude, 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

A variety of medical treatment modalities, including chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy, are used alone or in combination with surgical resection. Radiation therapy, the cornerstone of treatment of many brain tumors, decreases the incidence of recurrence of incompletely resected tumors. Brachytherapy (the surgical implantation of radiation sources to deliver high doses at a short distance) has had promising results for primary malignancies. It is generally used as an adjunct to conventional radiation therapy or as a rescue measure for recurrent disease.

Intravenous (IV) autologous bone marrow transplantation is used in some patients who will receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy because it has the potential to "rescue" the patient from the bone marrow toxicity associated with high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. A fraction of the patient's bone marrow is aspirated, usually from the iliac crest, and stored. The patient receives large doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy large
numbers of malignant cells. The marrow is then reinfused intravenously after treatment is completed.

Corticosteroids may be used before and after treatment to reduce cerebral edema and promote a smoother, more rapid recovery. Gene-transfer therapy uses retroviral vectors to carry genes to the tumor, reprogramming the tumor tissue for susceptibility to treatment. This approach is being tested.

A new technique being investigated is photodynamic therapy. This is a treatment of primary malignant brain tumors that delivers a targeted therapy while conserving healthy brain tissue (Goodell \& Muller, 2001).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The objective of surgical management is to remove or destroy the entire tumor without increasing the neurologic deficit (paralysis, blindness) or to relieve symptoms by partial removal (decompression). A variety of treatment modalities may be used; the specific approach depends on the type of tumor, its location, and accessibility. In many patients, combinations of these modalities may be used. Most pituitary adenomas are treated by transsphenoidal microsurgical removal (see Chap. 61), whereas the remainder of tumors that cannot be removed completely are treated by radiation. An untreated brain tumor ultimately leads to death, either from increasing ICP or from the damage to brain tissue it causes.

Conventional surgical approaches require an incision into the skull (craniotomy). See Chapter 61 for a discussion of care of the patient following craniotomy. This approach is used in patients with meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, cystic astrocytomas of the cerebellum, colloid cysts of the third ventricle, congenital tumors such as dermoid cyst, and some of the granulomas. For patients with malignant glioma, complete removal of the tumor and cure are not possible, but the rationale for resection includes relieving ICP, removing any necrotic tissue, and reducing the bulk of the
tumor, which theoretically leaves behind fewer cells to become resistant to radiation or chemotherapy.

Stereotactic approaches involve use of a three-dimensional frame that allows very precise localization of the tumor; a stereotactic frame and multiple imaging studies (x-rays, CT scans) are used to localize the tumor and verify its position (Fig. 65-3). New brain-mapping technology helps determine how close diseased areas of the brain are to structures essential for normal brain function. Lasers or radiation can be delivered with stereotactic approaches. Radioisotopes such as iodine 131 ( ${ }^{131}$ I) can also be implanted directly into the tumor to deliver high doses of radiation to the tumor (brachytherapy) while minimizing effects on surrounding brain tissue.

The use of the gamma knife to perform radiosurgery allows deep, inaccessible tumors to be treated, often in a single session. Precise localization of the tumor is accomplished using the stereotactic approach and by minute measurements and precise positioning of the patient. Multiple narrow beams then deliver a very high dose of radiation. An advantage of this method is that no surgical incision is needed; a disadvantage is the lag time between treatment and the desired result (Rafferty-Mitchell, Scanlon \& Laskowski-Jones, 1999).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with a brain tumor may be at an increased risk for aspiration due to cranial nerve dysfunction. Preoperatively, the gag reflex and ability to swallow are evaluated. In patients with diminished gag response, care includes teaching the patient to direct food and fluids toward the unaffected side, having the patient sit upright to eat, offering a semisoft diet, and having suction readily available. Function should be reassessed postoperatively because changes can occur.

\end{figure}

The effects of increased ICP caused by the tumor mass are reviewed in Chapter 61. The nurse performs neurologic checks, monitors vital signs, maintains a neurologic flow chart, spaces nursing interventions to prevent rapid increase in ICP, and reorients the patient when necessary to person, time, and place. Patients with changes in cognition caused by the lesion require frequent reorientation and the use of orienting devices (personal possessions, photographs, lists, clock), supervision of and assistance with self-care, and ongoing monitoring and intervention for prevention of injury. Patients with seizures are carefully monitored and protected from injury.

Motor function is checked at intervals because specific motor deficits may occur, depending on the tumor's location. Sensory disturbances are assessed. Speech is evaluated. Eye movement and pupillary size and reaction may be affected by cranial nerve involvement. In one study that examined the experience of brain tumor patients 3 to 5 days postoperatively, the basic needs of patients were met, but changes suggested included minimizing the atmosphere of urgency and hurry, appointing a primary nurse for each patient, and giving more postoperative information (Lepola et al., 2001). The nursing process for patients undergoing neurosurgery is discussed in Chapter 61.

\section*{CEREBRAL METASTASES}

A significant number of patients with cancer experience neurologic deficits caused by metastasis to the brain. Metastatic lesions to the brain constitute the most common neurologic complication, occurring in $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of patients with cancer (Nevidjon \& Sowers, 2000). This becomes important clinically as more patients with all forms of cancer live longer as a result of improved therapies. Neurologic signs and symptoms include headache, gait disturbances, visual impairment, personality changes, altered mentation (memory loss and confusion), focal weakness, paralysis, aphasia, and seizures. These signs and symptoms can be devastating to both patient and family.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment of metastatic brain cancer is palliative and involves eliminating or reducing serious symptoms. Even when palliation is the goal, distressing signs and symptoms can be relieved, thereby improving the quality of life for both the patient and family. Patients with intracerebral metastases who are not treated have a steady downhill course with a limited survival time, whereas those who are treated may survive for slightly longer periods. The median survival for patients with no treatment for brain metastases is 1 month; with corticosteroid treatment alone it is 2 months; radiation therapy extends the median survival to 3 to 6 months (Nevidjon \& Sowers, 2000).

The therapeutic approach includes radiation therapy (the foundation of treatment), surgery (usually for a single intracranial metastasis), and chemotherapy; more often some combination of these treatments is the optimal method. Gamma knife radiosurgery is considered when three or fewer lesions are present.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Corticosteroids are useful in relieving headache and alterations in level of consciousness. It is thought that corticosteroids (dexamethasone, prednisone) reduce inflammation around the metastatic deposits and decrease the edema surrounding them. Other medications used include osmotic agents (mannitol, glycerol) to decrease the fluid content of the brain, which leads to a decrease
in ICP. Antiseizure agents (eg, phenytoin) are used to prevent and treat seizures (Nevidjon \& Sowers, 2000). Venous thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occur in about $15 \%$ of patients and are associated with significant morbidity. Anticoagulants are generally not prescribed because of the risk for CNS hemorrhage; however, prophylactic therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin is under investigation.

Chemotherapy plays a small role in managing brain metastasis as a result of poor penetration across the blood-brain barrier. Poor drug penetration and sensitivity of brain cells are two factors that determine the responsiveness of metastatic brain tumors to chemotherapy. Research is being directed at multidrug regimens and drug resistance (American Cancer Society, 2001). Encouraging results have been seen with chemotherapeutic agents such as carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and PCV (a tripledrug combination of procarbazine hydrochloride, lomustine, and vincristine). Promising results have been seen with the use of topotecan (Hycamtin), another chemotherapy agent.

Pain is managed in a stepladder progression in the doses and type of analgesic agents needed for relief. If the patient has severe pain, morphine can be infused into the epidural or subarachnoid space through a spinal needle and a catheter as near as possible to the spinal segment where the pain is projected. Small doses of morphine are administered at prescribed intervals (see Chap. 13).

NURSING PROCESS:
THE PATIENT WITH CEREBRAL METASTASES OR INCURABLE BRAIN TUMOR

\section*{Assessment}

The nursing assessment includes a baseline neurologic examination and focuses on how the patient is functioning, moving, and walking; adapting to weakness or paralysis and to visual and speech loss; and dealing with seizures. Assessment addresses symptoms that cause distress to the patient, including pain, respiratory problems, bowel and bladder disorders, sleep disturbances, and impairment of skin integrity, fluid balance, and temperature regulation. Tumor invasion, compression, or obstruction may cause these disorders.

Nutritional status is assessed because cachexia (weak and emaciated condition) is common in patients with metastases. The nurse explores changes associated with poor nutritional status (anorexia, pain, weight loss, altered metabolism, muscle weakness, malabsorption, and diarrhea) and asks the patient about altered taste sensations that may be secondary to dysphagia, weakness, and depression and about distortions and impaired sense of smell (anosmia).

The nurse takes a dietary history to assess food intake, intolerance, and preferences. Calculation of body mass index can confirm the loss of subcutaneous fat and lean body mass (see Chap. 5). Biochemical measurements (albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count, creatinine index, and urinary tests) are reviewed to assess the degree of malnutrition, impaired cellular immunity, and electrolyte balance. A dietitian assists in determining the caloric needs of the patient.

The nurse works with other members of the health care team to assess the impact of the illness on the family in terms of home care, altered relationships, financial problems, time pressures, and family problems. This information is important in helping family members cope with the diagnosis and changes associated with it.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Self-care deficit (feeding, bathing, and toileting) related to loss or impairment of motor and sensory function and decreased cognitive abilities
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to cachexia due to treatment and tumor effects, decreased nutritional intake, and malabsorption
- Anxiety related to fear of dying, uncertainty, change in appearance, altered lifestyle
- Interrupted family processes related to anticipatory grief and the burdens imposed by the care of the person with a terminal illness

Other nursing diagnoses of the patient with cerebral metastases may include acute pain related to tumor compression; impaired gas exchange related to dyspnea; constipation related to decreased fluid and dietary intake and medications; impaired urinary elimination related to reduced fluid intake, vomiting, and reactions to medications; sleep pattern disturbances related to discomfort and fear of dying; impairment of skin integrity related to cachexia, poor tissue perfusion, and decreased mobility; deficient fluid volume related to fever, vomiting, and low fluid intake; and ineffective thermoregulation related to hypothalamic involvement, fever, and chills. See Chapter 16 for assessment and nursing interventions for the patient with cancer.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include compensating for self-care deficits, improving nutrition, reducing anxiety, enhancing family coping skills, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{COMPENSATING FOR SELF-CARE DEFICITS}

The patient may have difficulty participating in goal setting as the tumor metastasizes and affects cognitive function. It is important to encourage the family to keep the patient as independent as possible for as long as possible. Increasing assistance with self-care activities is required. Because the patient with cerebral metastasis and the family live with uncertainty, they are encouraged to plan for each day and to make the most of each day. The tasks and challenges are to assist the patient to find useful coping mechanisms, adaptations, and compensations in solving problems that arise. This helps patients maintain some sense of control. An individualized exercise program helps maintain strength, endurance, and range of motion. Eventually, referral for home or hospice care may be necessary (see Chap. 17).

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITION}

Patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, breathlessness, and pain are rarely interested in eating (Wilkes, 2000). These symptoms are managed or controlled through assessment, planning, and care. The nurse teaches the family how to position the patient for comfort during meals. Meals are planned for the times the patient is rested and in less distress from pain or the effects of treatment.

The patient needs to be clean, comfortable, and free of pain for meals, in an environment that is as attractive as possible. Oral hygiene before meals helps to improve intake. Offensive sights, sounds, and odors are eliminated. Creative strategies may be required to make food more palatable, provide enough fluids, and increase opportunities for socialization during meals. The family may be asked to keep a daily weight chart and to record the quantity of food eaten to determine the daily calorie count. Dietary supplements, if acceptable to the patient, can be provided to meet increased caloric needs. If the patient is not interested in most usual foods, those foods preferred by the patient should be offered. When the patient shows marked deterioration as a result of tumor growth and effects, some other form of nutritional support (eg, tube feeding, parenteral nutrition) may be indicated if consistent with the patient's end-of-life preferences. Nursing interventions include assessing the patency of the central and IV line or feeding tube, monitoring the insertion site for infection, checking the infusion rate, monitoring intake and output, and changing the IV tubing and dressing. Family members are instructed in these techniques if they will be providing care at home. Parenteral nutrition can also be provided at home if indicated.

The patient's quality of life may guide the selection, initiation, and maintenance of nutritional support. The nurse and family should not place too much emphasis on eating or on discussions about food as the patient may not desire aggressive nutritional intervention. The subsequent course of action must be congruent with the wishes and choices of the patient and family.

\section*{RELIEVING ANXIETY}

Patients with cerebral metastases may be restless, with changing moods that may include intense depression, euphoria, paranoia, and severe anxiety. The response of patients to terminal illness reflects their pattern of reaction to other crisis situations. Serious illness imposes additional strains that often bring other unresolved problems to light. The patient's own coping strategies can help deal with anxious and depressed feelings. Caregivers need to be sensitive to the patient's concerns and fears.

Patients need the opportunity to exercise some control over their situation. A sense of mastery can be gained as they learn to understand the disease and its treatment and how to deal with their feelings. The presence of family, friends, a spiritual advisor, and health professionals may be supportive. Support groups such as the Brain Tumor Support Group may provide a feeling of support and strength.

Spending time with patients allows them time to talk and to communicate their fears and concerns. Open communication and acknowledging fears are often therapeutic. Touch is also a form of communication. These patients need reassurance that continuing care will be provided and that they will not be abandoned. The situation becomes more endurable when others share in the experience of dying. If a patient's emotional reactions are very intense or prolonged, additional help from a spiritual advisor, social worker, or mental health professional may be indicated.

\section*{ENHANCING FAMILY PROCESSES}

The family needs to be reassured that their loved one is receiving optimal care and that attention will be paid to the patient's changing symptoms and to their concerns. When the patient can no longer carry out self-care, the family, additional support systems (social worker, home health aid, home care nurse, hospice nurse) may be needed. A nursing goal is to keep anxiety at a manageable level.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient and family often have major responsibility for care at home. Therefore, teaching includes strategies of pain management, prevention of complications related to treatment strategies, and methods to ensure adequate fluid and food intake (Chart 65-2). Teaching needs of the patient and family regarding care priorities are likely to change as the disease progresses. It is important to assess the changing needs of the patient and the family and to inform them about resources and services early to assist them to deal with changes in the patient's condition.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Home care nursing and hospice services are valuable resources that should be made available to the patient and the family early in the course of a terminal illness. Anticipating needs before they occur can assist in smooth initiation of services. Home care needs and interventions focus on four major areas: palliation of symptoms and pain control, assistance in self-care, control of treatment complications, and administration of specific forms of treatment, such as parenteral nutrition. The home care nurse assesses pain management, respiratory status, complications of the disorder and its treatment, and the patient's cognitive and emotional status. Additionally, the nurse assesses the family's ability to perform necessary care and notifies the physician about changing needs or complications if indicated.

The patient and family who elect to care for the patient at home as the disease progresses benefit from the care and support provided through hospice services. Steps to initiate hospice care, including discussion of hospice care as an option, should not be postponed until death is imminent. Exploration of hospice care as an option should be initiated at a time when hospice care can provide support and care to the patient and family consistent with their end-of-life decisions and assist in allowing death with dignity. End-of-life care is further described in Chapter 13.

\section*{SPINAL CORD TUMORS}

Tumors within the spine are classified according to their anatomic relation to the spinal cord. They include intramedullary lesions (within the spinal cord), extramedullary-intradural lesions (within or under the spinal dura), and extramedullary-extradural lesions (outside the dural membrane). Tumors occurring within the spinal cord or exerting pressure on it cause symptoms ranging from localized or shooting pains and weakness and loss of reflexes above the tumor level to progressive loss of motor function and
paralysis. Usually, sharp pain occurs in the area innervated by the spinal roots that arise from the cord in the region of the tumor. In addition, increasing sensory deficits develop below the level of the lesion.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Neurologic examination and diagnostic studies are used to make the diagnosis. Neurologic examination includes assessment of pain, loss of reflexes, loss of sensation or motor function, and the presence of weakness and paralysis. Helpful diagnostic studies include x-rays, radionuclide bone scans, and MRI. MRI is the most sensitive diagnostic tool and is particularly helpful in detecting epidural spinal cord compression and vertebral bone metastases (Jacobs \& Perrin, 2001; Nevidjon \& Sowers, 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of specific intraspinal tumors depends on the type and location of the tumor and the presenting symptoms and physical status of the patient. Surgical intervention is the primary treatment for most spinal cord tumors. Other treatment modalities include partial removal of the tumor, decompression of the spinal cord, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, particularly for intramedullary tumors and metastatic lesions (Jacobs \& Perrin, 2001).

Epidural spinal cord compression occurs in approximately 5\% of patients who die of cancer and is considered a neurologic emergency (Nevidjon \& Sowers, 2000). In the patient with epidural spinal cord compression resulting from metastatic cancer (most commonly from breast, prostate, or lung), high-dose dexamethasone combined with radiation therapy is effective in relieving pain (Nevidjon \& Sowers, 2000).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Tumor removal is desirable but not always possible. The goal is to remove as much tumor as possible while sparing uninvolved portions of the spinal cord. Microsurgical techniques have improved the prognosis for patients with intramedullary tumors. Prognosis is related to the degree of neurologic impairment at the time of surgery, the speed with which symptoms occurred, and the tumor origin. Patients with extensive neurologic deficits before surgery usually do not make significant functional recovery even after successful tumor removal.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROVIDING PREOPERATIVE CARE}

The objectives of preoperative care include recognition of neurologic changes through ongoing assessments, pain control, and management of altered activities of daily living due to sensory and motor deficits and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The nurse assesses for weakness, muscle wasting, spasticity, sensory changes, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and potential respiratory problems, especially if a cervical tumor is present. The patient is also evaluated for coagulation deficiencies. A history of aspirin intake is obtained and reported because the use of aspirin may impede hemostasis postoperatively. Breathing exercises are taught and demonstrated preoperatively. Postoperative pain management strategies are discussed with the patient before surgery.

\section*{ASSESSING THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY}

The patient is monitored for deterioration in neurologic status. A sudden onset of neurologic deficit is an ominous sign and may
be due to vertebral collapse associated with spinal cord infarction. Frequent neurologic checks are carried out, with emphasis on movement, strength, and sensation of the upper and lower extremities. Assessment of sensory function involves pinching the skin of the arms, legs, and trunk to determine if there is loss of feeling and, if so, determining at what level. Vital signs are monitored at regular intervals.

\section*{MANAGING PAIN}

The prescribed pain medication should be administered in adequate amounts and at appropriate intervals to relieve pain and prevent its recurrence. Pain is the hallmark of spinal metastasis. Patients with sensory root involvement or vertebral collapse may suffer excruciating pain, which requires effective pain management.

The bed is usually kept flat initially. The nurse turns the patient as a unit, keeping shoulders and hips aligned and the back straight. The side-lying position is usually the most comfortable because this position imposes the least pressure on the surgical site. Placement of a pillow between the knees of the patient in a side-lying position helps to prevent extreme knee flexion.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

If the tumor was in the cervical area, the possibility of postoperative respiratory compromise arises. The nurse monitors the patient for asymmetric chest movement, abdominal breathing, and abnormal breath sounds. For a high cervical lesion, the endotracheal tube remains in place until adequate respiratory function is ensured. The patient is encouraged to perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises.

The area over the bladder is palpated or a bladder scan is performed to assess for urinary retention. The nurse also monitors for incontinence because urinary dysfunction usually implies significant decompensation of spinal cord function. An intake and output record is maintained. Additionally, the abdomen is auscultated for bowel sounds.

Staining of the dressing may indicate leakage of CSF from the surgical site, which may lead to serious infection or to an inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissues that can cause severe pain in the postoperative period.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. In preparation for discharge, patients are assessed for their ability to function independently in the home and for the availability of resources such as family members to assist in caregiving. Patients with residual sensory involvement are cautioned about the dangers of extremes in temperature. They should be alert to the dangers of heating devices (eg, hot water bottles, heating pads, and space heaters). The patient is taught to check skin integrity daily. Patients with impaired motor function related to motor weakness or paralysis may require training in activities of daily living and safe use of assistive devices, such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair.

The patient and family member are instructed about pain management strategies, bowel and bladder management, and assessment for signs and symptoms that should be reported promptly.

Continuing Care. Referral for inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation may be warranted to improve self-care abilities. A home care referral may be indicated and provides the home care nurse with
the opportunity to assess the patient's physical and psychological status and the patient's and family's ability to adhere to recommended management strategies. During the home visit, the nurse determines whether changes in neurologic function have occurred. The patient's respiratory and nutritional status is assessed. The adequacy of pain management is assessed, and modifications are made to ensure adequate pain relief. The need for hospice services or placement in an extended-care facility is discussed with the patient and family if warranted, and the patient is asked about preferences for end-of-life care (Chart 65-3). Additionally, social workers may be consulted to assist the patient and family members in identifying support groups and agencies that can provide help in coping with the disease process.

\section*{Degenerative Disorders}

Neurologic disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system that are degenerative in nature include Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, and degenerative disc disease. A relatively new phenomenon, post-polio syndrome, may be degenerative in nature and is also discussed. A slow onset of signs and symptoms characterizes these disorders. Patients are managed at home for as long as possible and admitted to the acute care setting for exacerbations, treatments, and surgical interventions as needed.

\section*{PARKINSON'S DISEASE}

Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressing neurologic movement disorder that eventually leads to disability. The degenerative or idiopathic form is the most common; there is also a secondary form with a known or suspected cause. Although the cause of most cases is unknown, research suggests several causative factors, including genetics, atherosclerosis, excessive accumulation of oxygen free radicals, viral infections, head trauma, chronic antipsychotic medication use, and some environmental exposures. Parkinsonian symptoms usually first appear in the fifth decade of life; however, cases have been diagnosed at the age of 30 years. It is the fourth most common neurodegenerative disease. Parkinson's disease affects men more frequently than women and nearly $1 \%$ of the population older than 60 years of age (Gray \& Hildebrand, 2000).

\section*{Chart 65-3 - Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{What Constitutes Assisted Suicide?}

\section*{Situation}

A 76-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a metastatic spinal cord tumor. He is in respiratory distress and near death. The patient and family state they want no heroic measures and the physician writes a "do not resuscitate" order on the chart.

\section*{Dilemma}

What is the nurse's role in caring for this patient at this time?

\section*{Discussion}

Is the "do not resuscitate" order an act of patient-assisted suicide? Is it active or passive euthanasia? What is the nurse's role in caring for the patient if this action conflicts with his/her personal beliefs? If no other nurse is available to provide care, does the nurse have the right to refuse? Is this patient abandonment?

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Parkinson's disease is associated with decreased levels of dopamine due to destruction of pigmented neuronal cells in the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia of the brain (Fig. 65-4). The nuclei of the substantia nigra project fibers or neuronal pathways to the

\end{figure}
corpus striatum, where neurotransmitters are key to control of complex body movements. Through the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (excitatory) and dopamine (inhibitory), striatal neurons relay messages to the higher motor centers that control and refine motor movements. The loss of dopamine stores in this area of the brain results in more excitatory neurotransmitters than inhibitory neurotransmitters, leading to an imbalance that affects voluntary movement.

Basic science research in the past two decades has revealed that more neurotransmitter pathways in the brain than just the dopaminergic system are involved. Parts of the glutamatergic, cholinergic, tryptaminergic, noradrenergic, adrenergic, serotonergic, and peptidergic pathways (responsible for cell metabolism, growth, nutrition, and so forth) show damage in Parkinson's disease (Chase, Oh \& Konitsiotis, 2000; Przuntek, 2000; Rascol, 2000).

Clinical symptoms do not appear until $60 \%$ of the pigmented neurons are lost and the striatal dopamine level is decreased by $80 \%$. Cellular degeneration impairs the extrapyramidal tracts that control semiautomatic functions and coordinated movements; motor cells of the motor cortex and the pyramidal tracts are not affected.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Parkinson's disease has a gradual onset and symptoms progress slowly over a chronic, prolonged course. The three cardinal signs are tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (abnormally slow movements). Other features include hypokinesia, gait disturbances, and postural instability (Gray \& Hildebrand, 2000).

\section*{TREMOR}

Although symptoms are variable, a slow, unilateral, resting tremor is present in $70 \%$ of patients at the time of diagnosis. Resting tremor characteristically disappears with purposeful movement but is evident when the extremities are motionless. The tremor may present as a rhythmic, slow turning motion (pronationsupination) of the forearm and the hand and a motion of the
thumb against the fingers as if rolling a pill (Fig. 65-5). Tremor is present while the patient is at rest; it increases when the patient is walking, concentrating, or feeling anxious.

\section*{RIGIDITY}

Resistance to passive limb movement characterizes muscle rigidity. Passive movement of an extremity may cause the limb to move in jerky increments referred to as cogwheeling. Rigidity of the passive extremity increases when another extremity is engaged in voluntary active movement. Stiffness of the neck, trunk, and shoulders is common. Early in the disease, the patient may complain of shoulder pain.

\section*{BRADYKINESIA}

One of the most common features of Parkinson's disease is bradykinesia. Patients take longer to complete most activities and have difficulty initiating movement, such as rising from a sitting position or turning in bed.

Hypokinesia (abnormally diminished movement) is also common and may appear after the tremor. The freezing phenomenon is a transient inability to perform active movement and is thought to be an extreme form of bradykinesia. Additionally, the patient tends to shuffle and exhibits a decreased arm swing. As dexterity declines, micrographia (shrinking, slow handwriting) develops. The face becomes increasingly masklike and expressionless and the frequency of blinking decreases. Dysphonia (soft, slurred, low-pitched, and less audible speech) may occur due to weakness and incoordination of the muscles responsible for speech. In many cases, the patient develops dysphagia, begins to drool, and is at risk for choking and aspiration.

The patient commonly develops postural and gait problems. There is a loss of postural reflexes, and the patient stands with the head bent forward and walks with a propulsive gait. The posture is caused by the forward flexion of the neck, hips, knees, and elbows. The patient may walk faster and faster, trying to move the feet forward under the body's center of gravity (shuffling gait). Difficulty in pivoting and loss of balance (either forward or backward) places the patient at risk for falls.

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 65-1}

\section*{Ealls and Risk Factors}

Gray, P., \& Hildebrand, K. (2000). Fall risk factors in Parkinson's disease. Journal of Neuroscience Nursing, 32(4), 222-228.

\section*{Purpose}

Patients with Parkinson's disease have frequent falls, yet there is little research on identifying risk factors specific to these patients. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors associated with falls in a group of patients with Parkinson's disease.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The sample for this descriptive, exploratory study was recruited from a hospital-based clinic in Canada. Patients who could stand, walk, and had no other medical conditions that predisposed them to falls were included. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale established the degree of symptoms. Multiple instruments were used to assess demographic, environmental, and medical information; participants also completed fall diaries for 12 weeks. The sample consisted of 118 patients; 48 ( $41 \%$ ) reported no falls and 70 ( $59 \%$ ) reported one or more falls. Participants in the study included 73 (62\%) males.

\section*{Findings}

Demographic, environmental, and medical information and fall diaries were analyzed to identify factors that appeared to increase the risk for falls. A total of 237 falls were reported in the 3-month study period; 59\% of the participants reported one or more falls. Males, as well as patients over age 80 years, reported higher rates of falls. Factors associated with a high risk for falls included duration and severity of parkinsonian symptoms including freezing, involuntary movements, and walking and postural difficulties. Postural hypotension and daily intake of alcohol were additional factors associated with a high risk for falls.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses, especially home care nurses, can use the findings of this study to help identify patients with risk factors: "freezing," involuntary movements, walking and postural difficulties, postural hypotension, and daily use of alcohol. Patients with these risk factors should be targeted for intervention programs and specific patient and family education to reduce falls. Early identification of risk factors would permit nurses to provide assistance, education, support, and appropriate referrals to patients at high risk for falls.

\section*{OTHER MANIFESTATIONS}

The effect of Parkinson's disease on the basal ganglia often produces autonomic symptoms that include excessive and uncontrolled sweating, paroxysmal flushing, orthostatic hypotension, gastric and urinary retention, constipation, and sexual disturbances (Herndon et al., 2000).

Psychiatric changes are often interrelated and may be predictive of one another. They include depression, dementia (progressive mental deterioration), sleep disturbances, and hallucinations (Herndon et al., 2000). Depression is common; whether it is a reaction to the disorder or is related to a biochemical abnormality remains a question. Mental changes may appear in the form of cognitive, perceptual, and memory deficits, although intellect is not usually affected. A number of psychiatric manifestations (personality changes, psychosis, dementia, and acute confusion) are common among the elderly. The prevalence of dementia is about $25 \%$ and the pattern is similar to that of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Although there is no direct documented causal relationship, the rates of depression and dementia are highly correlated in these patients (Herndon et al., 2000).

Approximately $41 \%$ of women and $25 \%$ of men with Parkinson's disease experience sleep disturbances. This may be connected to depression, dementia, or medications. Auditory and visual hallucinations have been reported in approximately $37 \%$ of persons with Parkinson's and may be associated with depression, dementia, lack of sleep, or adverse effects of medications (Herndon et al., 2000).

Complications associated with Parkinson's disease are common and are typically related to disorders of movement. As the disease progresses, patients are at risk for respiratory and urinary tract infection, skin breakdown, and injury from falls. The adverse effects of medications used to treat the symptoms are associated with numerous complications.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Laboratory tests and imaging studies are not helpful in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, although PET scanning has been used in evaluating levodopa (precursor of dopamine) uptake and conversion to dopamine in the corpus striatum (Freed et al., 2001). Currently, the disease is diagnosed clinically from the patient's history and the presence of two of the three cardinal manifestations: tremor, muscle rigidity, and bradykinesia.

Early diagnosis can be difficult because the patient can rarely pinpoint when symptoms started. Often a family member notices a change such as stooped posture, a stiff arm, a slight limp, tremor, or slow, small handwriting. The medical history, presenting symptoms, neurologic examination, and response to pharmacologic management are carefully evaluated when making the diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment is directed at controlling symptoms and maintaining functional independence because there are no medical or surgical approaches that prevent disease progression. Care is individualized for each patient based on presenting symptoms and social, occupational, and emotional needs. Pharmacologic management is the mainstay of treatment, although advances in research have led to increased interest in surgical interventions. Patients are usually cared for at home and admitted to the hospital only for complications or to initiate new treatments.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Antiparkinsonian medications act by 1) increasing striatal dopaminergic activity, 2) reducing the excessive influence of excitatory cholinergic neurons on the extrapyramidal tract, thereby restoring a balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activities, or 3) acting on neurotransmitter pathways other than the dopaminergic pathway.

Antiparkinsonian Medications. Levodopa (Dopar, Larodopa) is the most effective agent and the mainstay of treatment (Karch, 2002; Obeso et al., 2001). Because levodopa is thought to precipitate oxidation, which further damages the substantia nigra and eventually speeds disease progression, physicians delay prescribing the medication or increasing the dosage for as long as possible (Karch, 2002). Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the basal ganglia, producing symptom relief. The beneficial effects of levodopa are most pronounced in the first few years of treatment. Benefits begin to wane and adverse effects become more severe over time. Confusion, hallucinations, depression, and sleep alterations are associated with prolonged use. Levodopa is usually given in combination with carbidopa (Sinemet), an
amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor that helps to maximize the beneficial effects of levodopa by preventing its breakdown outside the brain and reducing its adverse effects (Karch, 2002).

Within 5 to 10 years, most patients develop a response to the medication characterized by dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements), including facial grimacing, rhythmic jerking movements of the hands, head bobbing, chewing and smacking movements, and involuntary movements of the trunk and extremities. The patient may experience an on-off syndrome in which sudden periods of near immobility ("off effect") are followed by a sudden return of effectiveness ("on effect"). Various adjunctive therapies are used to minimize dyskinesias (Przuntek, 2000; Rascol, 2000).

Budipine, available in Europe but not the United States, is a non-dopaminergic, antiparkinsonian medication that significantly reduces akinesia, rigidity, and tremor. It is non-dopaminergic because the action appears to be on neurotransmitter pathways other than the dopaminergic pathway. It may be used as monotherapy or in conjunction with other available antiparkinsonian medications (Przuntek, 2000; Przuntek et al., 2002). The usual dose of 40 to 60 mg is reached gradually. Nausea and dry mouth are the most common side effects, although $75 \%$ of patients experienced no side effects in clinical drug trials (Przuntek, 2000).

Anticholinergic Therapy. Anticholinergic agents (trihexyphenidyl, cycrimine, procyclidine, biperiden, and benztropine mesylate) are effective in controlling tremor and rigidity. They may be used in combination with levodopa. They counteract the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Because the side effects include blurred vision, flushing, rash, constipation, urinary retention, and acute confusional states, these medications are often poorly tolerated in elderly patients. Intraocular pressure must be closely monitored: these medications are contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Patients with prostate hyperplasia are monitored for signs of urinary retention.

Antiviral Therapy. Amantadine hydrochloride (Symmetrel) is an antiviral agent used in early Parkinson's treatment to reduce rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. It is thought to act by releasing dopamine from neuronal storage sites. Studies suggest it may also have antiglutamatergic properties that affect the glutamatergic pathway, thus improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias (Rascol, 2000). Amantadine has a low incidence of side effects, which include psychiatric disturbances (mood changes, confusion, depression, hallucinations), lower extremity edema, nausea, epigastric distress, urinary retention, headache, and visual impairment.

Dopamine Agonists. Bromocriptine mesylate and pergolide (ergot derivatives) are dopamine receptor agonists and are useful in postponing the initiation of carbidopa or levodopa therapy. Dopamine agonists are often added to the medication regimen when carbidopa or levodopa loses effectiveness. Pergolide (Permax) is 10 times more potent than bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel), although this provides no therapeutic advantage. Adverse reactions to these medications include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, hypotension, impotence, and psychiatric effects.

Two new dopamine agonists, ropinirole hydrochloride (Requip) and pramipexole (Mirapex) (nonergot derivatives), are primarily for patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease and are not expected to have the potentially serious adverse effects of pergolide and bromocriptine mesylate. Pramipexole (Mirapex) can
be used without levodopa for treatment of early disease and with levodopa in advanced stages. Cabergoline (Dostinex), an ergot alkaloid with a long duration of action, has been approved for use.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO Inhibitors). Of the MAO inhibitors, selegiline (Eldepryl) is one of the most exciting and controversial developments in the pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease (Herndon et al., 2000). This medication inhibits dopamine breakdown and is thought to slow the progression of the disease. Researchers believe this medication may have a neuroprotective effect in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, but this has not been shown in clinical trials. Selegiline is currently used in combination with a dopamine agonist to delay the use of carbidopa or levodopa therapy. Adverse effects are similar to those of levodopa.

Catechol-0-methyltransferase (COMT) Inhibitors. Clinical trials suggest that the COMT inhibitors entacapone (Comtess) and tolcapone (Tasmar) have little effect on parkinsonian symptoms when given alone but can increase the duration of action of carbidopa or levodopa when given in combination with them. COMT inhibitors block an enzyme that metabolizes levodopa, making more levodopa available for conversion to dopamine in the brain. Entacapone and tolcapone reduce motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants may be prescribed to alleviate the depression that is so common in Parkinson's disease. The usual dosage is one-third to one-half the dosage used in depressed patients without Parkinson's disease. Amitriptyline is typically prescribed because of its anticholinergic and antidepressant effect. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac) and bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin), are effective for treating depression but may aggravate parkinsonism.

Antihistamines. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl), orphenadrine citrate (Banflex), and phenindamine hydrochloride (Neo-Synephrine) have mild central anticholinergic and sedative effects and may reduce tremors.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The limitations of levodopa therapy, improvements in stereotactic surgery, and new approaches in transplantation have renewed interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease. In patients with disabling tremor, rigidity, or severe levodopa-induced dyskinesia, surgery may be considered. Although surgery provides some relief in selected patients, it has not been shown to alter the course of the disease or produce permanent improvement.

Stereotactic Procedures. Thalamotomy and pallidotomy are effective in relieving many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Patients eligible for these procedures are those who have had an inadequate response to medical therapy; they must meet strict criteria to be eligible. Candidates eligible for these procedures are patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who are taking maximum doses of antiparkinsonian medications. Patients with dementia and atypical Parkinson's disease are usually not considered for stereotactic procedures. Parkinson's disease rating scales and specific neurologic testing are used to identify eligible patients.

The intent of thalamotomy and pallidotomy is to interrupt the nerve pathways and thereby alleviate tremor or rigidity. During thalamotomy, a stereotactic electrical stimulator destroys part of the ventrolateral portion of the thalamus in an attempt to
reduce tremor; the most common complications are ataxia and hemiparesis. Pallidotomy involves destroying part of the ventral aspect of the medial globus pallidus through electrical stimulation in patients with advanced disease. The procedure is effective in reducing rigidity, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia, thus improving motor function and activities of daily living in the immediate postoperative course. In small studies, clinical improvements have been demonstrated over 3 to 4 years. The clinical benefit is greater in patients younger than 60 years (Freed et al., 2001). Complications include hemiparesis, stroke, and visual changes.

CT, x-rays, MRI, or angiography is used to localize the appropriate surgical site in the brain. Then the patient's head is positioned in a stereotactic frame (Fig. 65-6). The surgeon makes an incision in the skin and then a burr hole. Next, the surgeon passes an electrode through the burr hole to the target area in the thalamus or globus pallidum. The desired response of the patient to the electrical stimulation is the basis for the final site chosen by the neurosurgeon. Stereotactic procedures are completed on one side of the brain at a time. If rigidity or tremor is bilateral, a 6-month interval is suggested between procedures.

Neural Transplantation. Surgical implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the corpus striatum is performed in an effort to reestablish normal dopamine release. Preliminary evidence has shown high morbidity and mortality rates, and the implants appear to improve parkinsonian symptoms for only 6 months. Researchers are conducting studies to determine if transplanting human fetal brain cells or genetically engineered cells into the nigrostriatal region is effective (Aminoff, 2000). Legal and ethical issues surrounding the use of fetal brain cells have limited the implementation of this procedure. Recently, fetal pig neuronal cells survived transplantation into a patient with Parkinson's disease; this may provide an alternative to human cell transplants (Aminoff, 2000).

Deep Brain Stimulation. Recently approved by the FDA, pacemaker-like brain implants show promising results in relieving tremors. The stimulation can be bilateral or unilateral, although bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is thought to be of greater benefit to patients than results achieved with thalamotomy, pallidotomy, or fetal nigral transplantation (Obeso et al., 2001). In deep brain stimulation, an electrode is placed in the

thalamus and connected to a pulse generator implanted in a subcutaneous subclavicular or abdominal pouch. The batterypowered pulse generator sends high-frequency electrical impulses through a wire placed under the skin to a lead anchored to the skull (Fig. 65-7). The electrode blocks nerve pathways in the brain that cause tremors. These devices are not without complications, both from the surgical procedure needed for implantation and from complications (such as lead leakage) of the device itself (Koller et al., 2001; Obeso et al., 2001).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE}

\section*{Assessment}

Assessment focuses on how the disease has affected the patient's activities of daily living and functional abilities. Patients are observed for degree of disability and the functional changes that occur throughout the day, such as responses to medication. Nearly every patient with a movement disorder has some functional alteration and may have some type of behavioral dysfunction. The following questions may be useful to assess alterations:
- Do you have leg or arm stiffness?
- Have you experienced any irregular jerking of your arms or legs?
- Have you ever been "frozen" or rooted to the spot and unable to move?
- Does your mouth water excessively? Have you (or others) noticed yourself grimacing or making faces or chewing movements?
- What specific activities do you have difficulty doing?

During this assessment, the nurse observes the patient for quality of speech, loss of facial expression, swallowing deficits

\end{figure}
(drooling, poor head control, coughing), tremors, slowness of movement, weakness, forward posture, rigidity, evidence of mental slowness, and confusion. Parkinsonian symptoms, as well as side effects of medications, put these patients at high risk of falls; therefore, a fall risk assessment should be included (Gray \& Hildebrand, 2000).

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Impaired physical mobility related to muscle rigidity and motor weakness
- Self-care deficits (feeding, dressing, hygiene, and toileting) related to tremor and motor disturbance
- Constipation related to medication and reduced activity
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to tremor, slowness in eating, difficulty in chewing and swallowing
- Impaired verbal communication related to decreased speech volume, slowness of speech, inability to move facial muscles
- Ineffective coping related to depression and dysfunction due to disease progression

Other nursing diagnoses may include sleep pattern disturbances, deficient knowledge, risk for injury, risk for activity intolerance, disturbed thought processes, and compromised family coping.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include improving functional mobility, maintaining independence in activities of daily living, achieving adequate bowel elimination, attaining and maintaining acceptable nutritional status, achieving effective communication, and developing positive coping mechanisms.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

A progressive program of daily exercise will increase muscle strength, improve coordination and dexterity, reduce muscular rigidity, and prevent contractures that occur when muscles are not used. Walking, riding a stationary bicycle, swimming, and gardening are all exercises that help maintain joint mobility. Stretching (stretch-hold-relax) and range-of-motion exercises promote joint flexibility. Postural exercises are important to counter the tendency of the head and neck to be drawn forward and down. A physical therapist may be helpful in developing an individualized exercise program and can provide instruction to the patient and caregiver on exercising safely. Faithful adherence to an exercise and walking program helps to delay the progress of the disease. Warm baths and massage in addition to passive and active exercises help relax muscles and relieve painful muscle spasms that accompany rigidity.

Balance may be adversely affected because of the rigidity of the arms (arm swinging is necessary in normal walking). Special walking techniques must be learned to offset the shuffling gait and the tendency to lean forward. The patient is taught to concentrate on walking erect, to watch the horizon, and to use a wide-based gait (ie, walking with the feet separated). A conscious effort must be made to swing the arms, raise the feet while walking,
and to use a heel-toe placement of the feet with long strides. The patient is advised to practice walking to marching music or to the sound of a ticking metronome because this provides sensory reinforcement. Doing breathing exercises while walking helps to move the rib cage and to aerate parts of the lungs. Frequent rest periods aid in preventing frustration and fatigue.

\section*{ENHANCING SELF-CARE ACTIVITIES}

Encouraging, teaching, and supporting the patient during activities of daily living promote self-care. See Chapter 11 for rehabilitation techniques.

Environmental modifications are necessary to compensate for functional disabilities. Patients may have severe mobility problems that make normal activities impossible. Adaptive or assistive devices may be useful. A hospital bed at home with bedside rails, an overbed frame with a trapeze, or a rope tied to the foot of the bed can provide assistance in pulling up without help. An occupational therapist can evaluate the patient's needs in the home and make recommendations regarding adaptive devices and teach the patient and caregiver how to improvise.

\section*{IMPROVING BOWEL ELIMINATION}

The patient may have severe problems with constipation. Among the factors causing constipation are weakness of the muscles used in defecation, lack of exercise, inadequate fluid intake, and decreased autonomic nervous system activity. The medications used for the treatment of the disease also inhibit normal intestinal secretions. A regular bowel routine may be established by encouraging the patient to follow a regular time pattern, consciously increase fluid intake, and eat foods with a moderate fiber content. Laxatives should be avoided. Psyllium, for example, decreases constipation but carries the risk for bowel obstruction (Herndon et al., 2000). A raised toilet seat is useful because the patient has difficulty in moving from a standing to a sitting position.

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITION}

Patients may have difficulty maintaining their weight. Eating becomes a very slow process, requiring concentration due to a dry mouth from medications and difficulty chewing and swallowing. They are at risk for aspiration because of impaired swallowing and the accumulation of saliva. They may be unaware that they are aspirating, and subsequently bronchopneumonia may develop.

Monitoring weight on a weekly basis indicates whether caloric intake is adequate. Supplemental feedings increase caloric intake. As the disease progresses, a nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastroscopy may be necessary to maintain adequate nutrition. A dietitian can be consulted regarding nutritional needs.

\section*{ENHANCING SWALLOWING}

Swallowing disorders can be due to poor head control, tongue tremor, hesitancy in initiating swallowing, difficulty in shaping food into a bolus, and disturbances in pharyngeal motility. To offset these problems, the patient should sit in an upright position during mealtime. A semisolid diet with thick liquids is easier to swallow than solids; thin liquids should be avoided. It is helpful for patients to think through the swallowing sequence. The patient is taught to place the food on the tongue, close the lips and teeth, lift the tongue up and then back, and swallow. The patient is encouraged to chew first on one side of the mouth and then on the other. To control the buildup of saliva, the patient is reminded to hold the head upright and make a conscious effort to swallow. Massaging the facial and neck muscles before meals may be beneficial.

\section*{ENCOURAGING THE USE OF ASSISTIVE DEVICES}

An electric warming tray keeps food hot and permits the patient to rest during the prolonged time that it takes to eat. Special utensils also assist at mealtime. A plate that is stabilized, a nonspill cup, and eating utensils with built-up handles are useful self-help devices. The occupational therapist can assist in identifying appropriate adaptive devices.

\section*{IMPROVING COMMUNICATION}

Speech disorders are present in most patients with Parkinson's disease. Their low-pitched, monotonous, soft speech requires that they make a conscious effort to speak slowly, with deliberate attention to what they are saying. Patients are reminded to face the listener, exaggerate the pronunciation of words, speak in short sentences, and take a few deep breaths before speaking.

A speech therapist may be helpful in designing speech improvement exercises and assisting the family and health care personnel to develop and use a method of communication to meet the patient's needs. A small electronic amplifier is helpful if the patient has difficulty being heard.

\section*{SUPPORTING COPING ABILITIES}

Support can be given by encouraging the patient and pointing out that activities are being maintained through active participation. A combination of physiotherapy, psychotherapy, medication therapy, and support group participation may help reduce the depression that often occurs.

Patients often feel embarrassed, apathetic, inadequate, bored, and lonely. These feelings may be due, in part, to physical slowness and the great effort that even small tasks require. Patients are assisted and encouraged to set achievable goals (eg, improvement of mobility).

Because parkinsonism tends to lead to withdrawal and depression, patients must be active participants in their therapeutic program, including social and recreational events. There should be a planned program of activity throughout the day to prevent too much daytime sleeping as well as disinterest and apathy.

Every effort should be made to encourage patients to carry out the tasks involved in meeting their own daily needs and to remain independent. Doing things for the patient merely to save time is contrary to the basic goal of improving coping abilities and promoting a positive self-concept.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patient and family education is important in the management of Parkinson's disease. Teaching needs depend on the severity of symptoms and the stage of the disease. Care must be taken not to overwhelm the patient and family with too much information early in the disease process. The patient's and family's need for information is ongoing as adaptations become necessary. The education plan should include a clear explanation of the disease, assisting the patient to remain functionally independent as long as possible. Every effort is made to explain the nature of the disease and its management to offset disabling anxieties and fears. The patient and family must be taught about the effects and side effects of medications and about the importance of reporting side effects to the physician (Chart 65-4).

\section*{Continuing Care}

In the early stages patients can be managed well at home. Family members often serve as caregivers, with home care or community services available to assist in meeting health care needs as the disease progresses. The family caregiver may be under considerable stress from living with and caring for a person with a significant disability. Providing information about treatment and care prevents many unnecessary problems. The caregiver is included in the plan and may be advised to learn stress reduction techniques, to include others in the caregiving process, to obtain periodic relief from responsibilities, and to have a yearly health assessment. Allowing family members to express feelings of frustration, anger, and guilt is often helpful to them.

The patient should be evaluated in the home for adaptation and safety needs and compliance with the plan of care. In the advanced stages, patients usually enter long-term care facilities when family support is absent. Periodically, admission to an acute care facility may be necessary for changes in medical management or treatment of complications. Nurses provide support, education, and monitoring of patients over the course of illness.

The nurse involved in home and continuing care needs to remind patients and family members of the need to address health promotion needs such as screening for hypertension and stroke risk assessments in this predominantly elderly population. Patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past are educated about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers. Informational booklets and a newsletter for patient education are published by the National Parkinson's Foundation, Inc. and the American Parkinson's Disease Association.

\section*{HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE}

Huntington's disease is a chronic, progressive, hereditary disease of the nervous system that results in progressive involuntary choreiform movement and dementia. It affects men and women of all races. Because it is transmitted as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, each child of a parent with Huntington's disease has a 50\% risk of inheriting the illness (Bradley et al., 2000).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The basic pathology involves premature death of cells in the striatum (caudate and putamen) of the basal ganglia, the region deep within the brain involved in the control of movement. There is also loss of cells in the cortex, the region of the brain associated with thinking, memory, perception, and judgment, and in the

\section*{Coping Patterns Following Gene Testing}

Williams, J. K., Schutte, D., Evers, C., \& Holkup, P. A. (2000). Redefinition: Coping with normal results from predictive gene testing for neurodegenerative disorders. Research in Nursing \& Health, 23, 260-269.

\section*{Purpose}

Predictive testing for an inherited neurodegenerative disease is a source of intense stress for adults. The purpose of this study was to describe the psychosocial impact and coping process of normal (negative) results from predictive testing for an inherited neurodegenerative disease.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The study used a qualitative, descriptive design and the constant comparative method of data analysis. Ten adults with normal results of predictive testing for Huntington's disease (HD) or the pallido-pont-nigral degeneration (PPND) gene mutation participated in semistructured interviews 1 and 6 months following gene testing. The sample included 8 females, the age range was 33 to 59 years, $80 \%$ were married, and $80 \%$ had known they were at risk for one of the diseases for more than 5 years.

\section*{Findings}

The major descriptive theme identified was redefinition. The redefinition occurred in the following three domains: redefinition of self, relationships with family, and role in society. The process evolved from a personal level at 1 month to a more future-oriented perspective at 6 months following normal gene test results.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses working with individuals at risk for HD and PPND should keep in mind that many people prepare for the worst results when undergoing gene testing. The coping process following negative results (ie, absence of gene for the disease) evolves from a personal focus at 1 month to a broader future perspective at 6 months after testing. These components of the redefinition process are important considerations in planning interventions to promote coping with normal gene results within at-risk families during an extremely stressful time.
cerebellum, the area that coordinates voluntary muscle activity. Researchers now believe that a building block for protein called glutamine abnormally collects in the cell nucleus, causing cell death. The reason that the protein destroys only certain brain cells is unknown. The cells' destruction results in a lack of the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine, which inhibit nerve action (Bradley et al., 2000). Onset usually occurs between the ages of 35 and 45 years, although about $10 \%$ of patients are children. The disease progresses slowly. Despite a ravenous appetite, patients usually become emaciated and exhausted. Patients succumb in 10 to 20 years to heart failure, pneumonia, or infection, or as a result of a fall or choking.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The most prominent clinical features of the disease are abnormal involuntary movements (chorea), intellectual decline, and, often, emotional disturbance. As the disease progresses, a constant writhing, twisting, uncontrollable movement may involve the entire body. These motions are devoid of purpose or rhythm, although patients may try to turn them into purposeful movement. All of the body musculature is involved. Facial movements
produce tics and grimaces. Speech is affected, becoming slurred, hesitant, often explosive, and eventually unintelligible. Chewing and swallowing are difficult, and there is a constant danger of choking and aspiration. Choreiform movements persist but diminish during sleep.

As with speech, the gait becomes disorganized to the point that ambulation eventually is impossible. Although independent ambulation should be encouraged for as long as possible, a wheelchair usually becomes necessary. Eventually, the patient is confined to bed when the chorea interferes with walking, sitting, and all other activities. Bladder and bowel control is lost.

Cognitive function is usually affected, with dementia usually occurring. Initially, the patient generally is aware that the disease is responsible for the myriad dysfunctions that are occurring. The mental and emotional changes that occur may be more devastating to the patient and family than the abnormal movements. Personality changes may result in nervous, irritable, or impatient behaviors. In the early stages, patients are particularly subject to uncontrollable fits of anger, profound, often suicidal depression, apathy, anxiety, psychosis, or euphoria (Hofmann, 1999). Judgment and memory are impaired, and dementia eventually ensues. Hallucinations, delusions, and paranoid thinking may precede the appearance of disjointed movements. Emotional symptoms often become less acute as the disease progresses.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation of characteristic symptoms, a positive family history, and exclusion of other causes. Imaging studies, such as CT and MRI, may show atrophy of the caudate nuclei once the disease is well established (Bradley et al., 2000).

A genetic marker for Huntington's has been identified through the use of recombinant DNA technology. As a result, researchers can now identify presymptomatic individuals who will develop this disease. Although this presymptomatic test can remove the uncertainty, it offers no hope of cure or even specific prediction of the timing of its onset. Researchers continue to study the genetic causes that lead to the death of brain cells (Bradley et al., 2000).

\section*{Management}

Although no treatment halts or reverses the underlying process, several methods of management have fairly good palliative results (Bradley et al., 2000; Sawle, 1999). Thiothixene hydrochloride (Navane) and haloperidol decanoate (Haldol), which predominantly block dopamine receptors, improve the chorea in many patients (Bradley et al., 2000). Chorea also is lessened by reserpine (depletes presynaptic dopamine) and tetrabenazine (reduces dopaminergic transmission). Motor signs must be assessed and evaluated on an ongoing basis so that optimal therapeutic drug levels can be reached. Akathisia (motor restlessness) in the overmedicated patient is dangerous because it may be mistaken for the restless fidgeting of the illness and consequently can be overlooked.

In certain types of the disease, hypokinetic motor impairment resembles parkinsonism. In patients who present with rigidity, some temporary benefit may be obtained from antiparkinson medication, such as levodopa.

Patients who have emotional disturbances, particularly depression, may be helped by antidepressant medications. The threat of suicide is always present. Psychotic symptoms usually
respond to antipsychotic medications. Psychotherapy aimed at allaying anxiety and reducing stress may be beneficial (Hofman, 1999). It is imperative that nurses look beyond the disease to focus on the patient's needs and capabilities (Chart 65-5). One study showed improved physical, mental, and social functioning in a small group of patients with Huntington's disease using remotivation therapy and providing a more stimulating environment (Sullivan, Bird, Alpay et al., 2001). Surgically implanted fetal neural allografts are being tested in hopes of improving the functional, motor, and cognitive function of patients (BachoudLevi, Remy, Nguyen et al., 2000; Diederich \& Goetz, 2000).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The needs of the patient and family for education depend on the nature and severity of physical, cognitive, and psychological changes experienced by the patient. Patients and family members are taught about the medications prescribed and about signs indicating a need for change in medication or dosage. The teaching plan addresses strategies to manage symptoms such as chorea, swallowing problems, limitations in ambulation, and loss of bowel and bladder function. Consultation with a speech therapist may be indicated to assist in identifying alternative communication strategies if speech is affected.

Individuals of child-bearing age often seek information about their risk for transmitting the disease. Even though presymptomatic testing has been offered since 1986, approximately $75 \%$ of individuals at risk choose not to be tested (Hayden, 2000). For most people, the benefits of testing are unclear because of ethical and confidentiality issues. Genetic counseling is crucial following testing, and patients and their families may require long-term psychological counseling and emotional, financial, and legal support (Williams, Schutte, Evers et al., 2000).

Continuing Care. A program combining medical, nursing, psychological, social, occupational, speech, and physical rehabilitation services is needed to help the patient and family cope with this severely disabling illness. Huntington's exacts enormous emotional, physical, social, and financial tolls on every member of the patient's family. The family often live under a heavy burden of uncertainty, anxiety, and guilt. Regular follow-up helps to allay the fear of abandonment.

Home care assistance, day care centers, respite care, and eventually skilled long-term care can assist the patient and family in coping with the constant strain of the illness. Although the relentless progression of the disease cannot be halted, families can benefit from supportive care.

Voluntary organizations can be major aids to families and have been largely responsible for bringing the illness to national attention. The Huntington's Disease Foundation of America helps patients and families by providing information, referrals, family and public education, and support for research.

\section*{ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE}

Alzheimer's disease, or senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type, is a chronic, progressive, and degenerative brain disorder accompanied by profound effects on memory, cognition, and ability for self-care. About $10 \%$ of the population older than age 65 are affected, and the prevalence reaches $47 \%$ by age 85 . Research suggests that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of the

Nursing Diagnosis
Risk for injury from falls and possible skin breakdown (pressure ulcers, abrasions), resulting from constant movement
Nursing Interventions
Pad the sides and head of the bed; ensure that the patient can see over the sides of bed.
Use padded heel and elbow protectors.
Keep the skin meticulously clean.
Apply emollient cleansing agent and skin lotion frequently.
Use soft sheets and bedding.
Have patient wear football padding or other forms of padding.
Encourage ambulation with assistance to maintain muscle tone.
Secure the patient (only if necessary) in bed or chair with padded protective devices, making sure that they are loosened frequently.
Nursing Diagnosis
Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, due to inadequate intake and dehydration resulting from swallowing or chewing disorders and danger of choking or aspirating food
Nursing Interventions
Administer phenothiazines as prescribed before meals (appears to calm some patients).
Use a warming tray.
Talk to the patient before mealtime to promote relaxation; use mealtime for social interaction. Provide undivided attention. Help the patient enjoy the mealtime experience.
Learn the position that is best for this patient. Keep patient as close to upright as possible while feeding. Stabilize patient's head gently with one hand while feeding.
Show the food and tell the patient what the foods are (eg, whether hot or cold).
Encircle the patient with one arm and get as close as possible to provide stability and support. Use pillows and wedges for additional support.
Do not interpret stiffness, turning away, or sudden turning of the head as rejection; these are uncontrollable choreiform movements.
For feeding, use a long-handled spoon (iced-tea spoon). Place spoon on middle of tongue and exert slight pressure.
Place bite-sized food between patient's teeth. Serve stews, casseroles, thick liquids; avoid too many milk drinks (produces mucus).
Disregard messiness. Treat the person with dignity.
Wait for the patient to chew and swallow before introducing another spoonful. Make sure that bite-sized food is small.

Give between-meal feedings. Constant movement expends more calories. Patients often have voracious appetites, particularly for sweets.
Use blenderized meals if patient cannot chew; do not repeatedly give the same strained baby foods; gradually introduce increased textures and consistencies to the diet.
For swallowing difficulties:
Apply gentle deep pressure around the patient's mouth. Rub fingers in circles on the patient's cheeks. Rub fingers simultaneously down each side of the patient's throat.

Alzheimer's is one of the most feared disorders of modern times because it has catastrophic consequences for the patient and family, who experience what has been termed an endless funeral. Chapter 12 discusses the manifestations, management, and nursing care of the patient with Alzheimer's disease.

\section*{AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS}

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease of unknown cause in which there is a loss of motor neurons (nerve cells controlling muscles) in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and the motor
nuclei of the lower brain stem. As these cells die, the muscle fibers that they supply undergo atrophic changes. Neuronal degeneration may occur in both the upper and lower motor neuron systems. Several theories exist regarding the cause of ALS, including autoimmune disease and free radical damage. The leading theory held by researchers is that overexcitation of nerve cells by the neurotransmitter glutamate leads to cell injury and neuronal degeneration.

The incidence of ALS is 203 cases per 100,000 in the general population (Charles \& Swash, 2001; Brown, Meininger \& Swash, 2000). ALS affects more men than women, with onset occurring usually in the fifth or sixth decade. It is often referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease after the famous baseball player who suffered from it.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations depend on the location of the affected motor neurons, because specific neurons activate specific muscle fibers. The chief symptoms are fatigue, progressive muscle weakness, cramps, fasciculations (twitching), and incoordination (Brown, Meininger \& Swash, 2000). Loss of motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord results in progressive weakness and atrophy of the muscles of the arms, trunk, or legs. Spasticity usually is present, and the deep tendon stretch reflexes become brisk and overactive. Usually, the anal and bladder sphincters are intact because the spinal nerves that control muscles of the rectum and urinary bladder are not affected.

In about $25 \%$ of patients, weakness starts in the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, and there is difficulty talking, swallowing, and ultimately breathing. When the patient ingests liquids, soft palate and upper esophageal weakness causes the liquid to be regurgitated through the nose. Weakness of the posterior tongue and palate impairs the ability to laugh, cough, or even blow the nose. When bulbar muscles are impaired, there is progressive difficulty in speaking and swallowing, and aspiration becomes a risk. The voice assumes a nasal sound, and articulation becomes so disrupted that the speech is unintelligible. Some emotional liability may be present, but intellectual function is not impaired. Eventually, respiratory function is compromised.

The prognosis generally is based on the area of the CNS involved and the speed with which the disease progresses. Death usually occurs as a result of infection, respiratory failure, or aspiration. The average time from onset of the disease to death is about 3 years. A few patients survive for longer periods.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

ALS is diagnosed on the basis of the signs and symptoms because no clinical or laboratory tests are specific for this disease. EMG studies of the affected muscles indicate reduction in the number of functioning motor units. MRI may show high signal intensity in the corticospinal tracts; this differentiates it from a multifocal motor neuropathy (Rowland \& Shneider, 2001).

\section*{Management}

There is no specific therapy for ALS. The main focus of medical and nursing management is on interventions to maintain or improve function, well-being, and quality of life (Brown, Meininger \& Swash, 2000). One study of 60 patients with ALS found that despite the decline in physical function, quality of life and religiosity change little over time (Robbins, Simmons, Bremer et al., 2001).

The medication riluzole (Rilutek), a glutamate antagonist, was approved by the FDA in 1995 after clinical trials found that it slows the deterioration of motor neurons. How riluzole works is not clear, but its pharmacologic properties suggest that it may have a neuroprotective effect in the early stages of ALS. Two randomized drug trials showed a dose of 100 mg riluzole per day to be modestly effective in prolonging survival time for patients with ALS (Miller, Mitchell \& Moore, 2001).

Symptomatic treatment and rehabilitative measures are employed to support the patient and improve the quality of life. Baclofen (Lioresal), dantrolene sodium (Dantrium), or diazepam (Valium) may be useful for patients troubled by spasticity, which causes pain and interferes with self-care. Several neurotrophic factors that facilitate nutrition and metabolism for nerve tissue are being investigated (Rowland \& Shneider, 2001).

Most patients with ALS are managed at home and in the community, with hospitalization for acute problems. The most common reasons for hospitalization are dehydration and malnutrition, pneumonia, and respiratory failure (Lechtzin, Wiener, Clawson et al., 2001). Recognizing these problems at an earlier stage in the illness will allow for the development of preventive strategies.

A patient experiencing problems with aspiration and swallowing may require enteral feeding. The American Academy of Neurology practice guidelines suggest the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube before the forced vital capacity drops below 50\% of predicted (Boitano, Jordan \& Benditt, 2001). This tube can be safely placed in patients who are using noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for ventilatory support (Boitano, Jordan \& Benditt, 2001).

Mechanical ventilation (using negative-pressure ventilators) is an option when alveolar hypoventilation develops. A small study of patients who used noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation at night showed that hypoventilation and sleep disturbances were at least partially improved, enhancing their cognitive function (Newsom-Davis et al., 2001). The use of noninvasive positivepressure ventilation also postpones the decision of whether to undergo a tracheotomy for long-term mechanical ventilation (Rowland \& Shneider, 2001).

Decisions about life support measures are made by the patient and family and should be based on a thorough understanding of the disease, the prognosis, and the implications of initiating such therapy. Patients are encouraged to complete an advance directive or "living will" to preserve their autonomy in decision-making.

The ALS Association has broad programs of research funding, patient and clinical services, patient information and support, and medical and public information. The ALS Association Quarterly Newsletter is a source of practical information.

\section*{MUSCULAR DYSTROPHIES}

The muscular dystrophies are a group of chronic muscle disorders characterized by progressive weakening and wasting of the skeletal or voluntary muscles. Most of these diseases are inherited. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and occurs in 1 of every 3,000 male births (Bach, 1999). The pathologic features include degeneration and loss of muscle fibers, variation in muscle fiber size, phagocytosis and regeneration, and replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue. The common characteristics of these diseases include varying degrees of muscle wasting and weakness, abnormal elevation in blood muscle enzymes, and myopathic findings on EMG and muscle biopsy (Bach, 1999). The differences center on the pattern of inheritance, the muscles involved, the age of onset, and the rate of progression. The unique needs of these patients, who in the past did not live to adulthood, must be addressed as they live longer as a result of better supportive care (Carson \& Hieber, 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of the muscular dystrophies at this time focuses on supportive care and preventing complications in the absence of a cure or specific pharmacologic interventions (Bach, 1999; Carson \& Hieber, 2001). Supportive management aims to keep the patient active and functioning as normally as possible and to minimize functional deterioration. An individualized therapeutic exercise program is prescribed to prevent muscle tightness, contractures, and disuse atrophy. Night splints and stretching exercises are used
to delay contractures of the joints, especially the ankles, knees, and hips. Braces may compensate for muscle weakness.

Spinal deformity is a severe problem. Weakness of trunk muscles and spinal collapse occur almost routinely in patients with severe neuromuscular disease. In the battle against spinal deformity, the patient is fitted with an orthotic jacket to improve sitting stability and reduce trunk deformity. This measure also supports cardiovascular status. In time, spinal fusion is performed to maintain spinal stability. Other procedures may be carried out to correct deformities.

Compromised pulmonary function may be due either to progression of the disease or to deformity of the thorax secondary to severe scoliosis. Intercurrent illnesses, upper respiratory infections, and fractures from falls must be vigorously treated in a way that minimizes immobilization because joint contractures become worse when the patient's activities are more restricted than usual.

Other difficulties may be manifested in relation to the underlying disease. Dental and speech problems may result from weakness of the facial muscles, which makes it difficult to attend to dental hygiene and to speak coherently. Gastrointestinal tract problems may include gastric dilation, rectal prolapse, and fecal impaction. Finally, cardiomyopathy appears to be a common complication in all forms of muscular dystrophy.

Genetic counseling is advised for parents and siblings of the patient because of the genetic nature of this disease. The Muscular Dystrophy Association works to combat neuromuscular disease through research, programs of patient services and clinical care, and professional and public education.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The goals of the patient and the nurse are to maintain function at optimal levels and to enhance the quality of life. Therefore, the patient's physical requirements, which are considerable, are addressed without losing sight of emotional and developmental needs (Carson \& Hieber, 2001). The patient and family are actively involved in decision-making, including end-of-life decisions.

During hospitalization for treatment of complications, the knowledge and expertise of the patient and family members responsible for caregiving in the home are assessed. Because the patient and family caregivers often have developed caregiving strategies that work effectively for them, these strategies need to be acknowledged and accepted, and provisions must be made to ensure that they are maintained during hospitalization (Carson \& Hieber, 2001).

Families of chronically ill individuals often need assistance to shift the focus of care from pediatric to adult care. Nursing goals include assisting the person with a chronic condition to make the transition to adult values and expectations while providing ageappropriate ongoing care (Carson \& Hieber, 2001). The nurse may need to help build the confidence of an older adolescent or adult patient by encouraging him or her to pursue job training to become economically independent. Other nursing interventions might include guidance in accessing adult health care and finding appropriate programs in sex education (Carson \& Hieber, 2001).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The management goals are addressed in special rehabilitation programs or in the patient's home and community (Natterlund \& Ahlstrom, 1999). Thus, the pa-
tient and family require information and instruction about the disorder, its anticipated course, and care and management strategies that will optimize the patient's growth and development and physical and psychological status. Members of a variety of healthrelated disciplines are involved in patient and family teaching; recommendations are communicated to all members of the health care team so that they may work toward common goals.

Continuing Care. Both the neuromuscular disease and the associated deformities may progress in adolescence and adulthood. Self-help and assistive devices can aid in maintaining maximum independence. Additional self-help devices, recommended by physical and occupational therapists, often become necessary as more muscle groups are affected.

The family is taught to monitor the patient for respiratory problems, as respiratory infection and cardiac failure are the most common causes of death (Carson \& Hieber, 2001). As respiratory difficulties develop, patients and their families need information regarding respiratory support. Options currently exist that can provide ventilatory support (negative-pressure devices, positive-pressure ventilators) while allowing mobility (Bach, 1999). Patients can remain relatively independent in a wheelchair, for example, while being maintained on a ventilator at home for many years.

The patient is encouraged to continue with range-of-motion exercises to prevent contractures, which are particularly disabling. Practical adaptations must be made, however, to cope with the effects of chronic neuromuscular disability. The patient at various stages of the disease may require a manual or an electric wheelchair, gait aids, upper and lower extremity and spinal orthoses, seating systems, bathroom equipment, lifts, ramps, and additional assistive devices, all of which require a team approach (Bach, 1999). The home care nurse assesses how the patient and family are managing, makes referrals, and coordinates the activities of the physical therapist, occupational therapist, and social services.

Of great concern to the patient are the issues surrounding the threat of increasing disability and dependence on others, accompanied by a significant deterioration in health-related quality of life (Natterlund, Gunnarsson \& Ahlstrom, 2000). The patient is faced with a progressive loss of function, leading eventually to death. Feelings of helplessness and powerlessness are common. Each functional loss is accompanied by grief and mourning. The patient and family are assessed for depression, anger, or denial. The patient and family are assisted to address decisions about end-of-life options before their need arises.

A psychiatric nurse clinician or other mental health professional may assist the patient to cope and adapt to the disease. By understanding and addressing the physical and psychological needs of the patient and family, the nurse provides a hopeful, supportive, and nurturing environment.

\section*{DEGENERATIVE DISK DISEASE}

Low back pain is a significant public health disorder in the United States (Bigos et al., 1994). It is a challenging disorder to quantify. Current estimates are that between $22 \%$ and $65 \%$ of individuals have an episode of back pain in any given year, and between $11 \%$ and $84 \%$ of adults have an episode within their lifetime (Walker, 2000). This results in significant economic and social costs. Acute low back pain has a duration of less than 3 months; chronic or degenerative disease has a duration of 3 months or longer. Most back problems are related to disk disease.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The intervertebral disk is a cartilaginous plate that forms a cushion between the vertebral bodies (Fig. 65-8A). This tough, fibrous material is incorporated in a capsule. A ball-like cushion in the center of the disk is called the nucleus pulposus. In herniation of the intervertebral disk (ruptured disk), the nucleus of the disk protrudes into the annulus (the fibrous ring around the disk), with subsequent nerve compression. Protrusion or rupture of the nucleus pulposus usually is preceded by degenerative changes that occur with aging. Loss of protein polysaccharides in the disk decreases the water content of the nucleus pulposus. The development of radiating cracks in the annulus weakens resistance to nucleus herniation. After trauma (falls and repeated minor stresses such as lifting), the cartilage may be injured.

For most patients, the immediate symptoms of trauma are short-lived, and those resulting from injury to the disk do not appear for months or years. Then, with degeneration in the disk, the capsule pushes back into the spinal canal, or it may rupture and allow the nucleus pulposus to be pushed back against the dural sac or against a spinal nerve as it emerges from the spinal column (see Fig. 65-8B). This sequence produces pain due to pressure in the area of distribution of the involved nerve endings (radiculopathy). Continued pressure may produce degenerative changes in the involved nerve, such as changes in sensation and deep tendon reflexes.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

A herniated disk with accompanying pain may occur in any portion of the spine: cervical, thoracic (rare), or lumbar. The clinical manifestations depend on the location, the rate of development (acute or chronic), and the effect on the surrounding structures.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A thorough health history and physical examination are important to rule out potentially serious conditions that may present as
low back pain, including fracture, tumor, infection, or cauda equina syndrome (Bigos et al., 1994).

MRI has become the diagnostic tool of choice for localizing even small disk protrusions, particularly for lumbar spine disease. If the clinical symptoms are not consistent with the pathology seen on MRI, CT and myelography are then performed. A neurologic examination is carried out to determine if there is reflex, sensory, or motor impairment from root compression and to provide a baseline for future assessment. EMG may be used to localize the specific spinal nerve roots involved.

\section*{Medical Management}

Herniations of the cervical and the lumbar disks occur most commonly and are usually managed conservatively with bed rest and medication. The specific conservative management strategies, along with surgical interventions for each form of herniation, are discussed next.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In general, surgical excision of a herniated disk is performed when there is evidence of a progressing neurologic deficit (muscle weakness and atrophy, loss of sensory and motor function, loss of sphincter control) and continuing pain and sciatica (leg pain resulting from sciatic nerve involvement) that are unresponsive to conservative management. The goal of surgical treatment is to reduce the pressure on the nerve root to relieve pain and reverse neurologic deficits (Hall, 1999). Microsurgical techniques are making it possible to remove only the amount of tissue that is necessary, better preserving the integrity of normal tissue and imposing less trauma on the body. During these procedures, spinal cord function can be monitored electrophysiologically.

To achieve the goal of pain relief, several surgical techniques are used, depending on the type of disk herniation, surgical morbidity, and overall results of surgery:
- Discectomy: removal of herniated or extruded fragments of intervertebral disk

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-488.jpg?height=840&width=1788&top_left_y=1693&top_left_x=197}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 65-8 (A) Normal lumbar spine vertebrae, intervertebral disks, and spinal nerve root; (B) ruptured vertebral disk.}
\end{figure}
- Laminectomy: removal of the bone between the spinal process and facet pedicle junction to expose the neural elements in the spinal canal (Hall, 1999); allows the surgeon to inspect the spinal canal, identify and remove pathology, and relieve compression of the cord and roots
- Hemilaminectomy: removal of part of the lamina and part of the posterior arch of the vertebra
- Partial laminectomy or laminotomy: creation of a hole in the lamina of a vertebra (Hall, 1999)
- Discectomy with fusion: a bone graft (from iliac crest or bone bank) is used to fuse the vertebral spinous process; the object of spinal fusion is to bridge over the defective disk to stabilize the spine and reduce the rate of recurrence
- Foraminotomy: removal of the intervertebral foramen to increase the space for exit of a spinal nerve, resulting in reduced pain, compression, and edema

Surgical procedures for herniated cervical disk and lumbar disk are discussed in the sections that follow.

\section*{HERNIATION OF A CERVICAL INTERVERTEBRAL DISK}

The cervical spine is subjected to stresses that result from disk degeneration (from aging, occupational stresses) and spondylosis (degenerative changes occurring in disk and adjacent vertebral bodies). Cervical disk degeneration may lead to lesions that can cause damage to the spinal cord and its roots.

A cervical disk herniation usually occurs at the C5-6 and C6-7 interspaces. Pain and stiffness may occur in the neck, the top of the shoulders, and the region of the scapulae. Sometimes patients interpret these signs as symptoms of heart trouble or bursitis. Pain may also occur in the upper extremities and head, accompanied by paresthesia (tingling or a "pins and needles" sensation) and numbness of the upper extremities. Cervical MRI usually confirms the diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of treatment are (1) to rest and immobilize the cervical spine to give the soft tissues time to heal and (2) to reduce inflammation in the supporting tissues and the affected nerve roots in the cervical spine. Bed rest (usually 1 to 2 days) is important because it eliminates the stress of gravity and relieves the cervical spine from the need to support the head. It also reduces inflammation and edema in soft tissues around the disk, relieving pressure on the nerve roots. Proper positioning on a firm mattress may bring dramatic relief from pain.

The cervical spine may be rested and immobilized by a cervical collar, cervical traction, or a brace. A collar allows maximal opening of the intervertebral foramina and holds the head in a neutral or slightly flexed position. The patient may have to wear the collar 24 hours a day during the acute phase. The skin under the collar is inspected for irritation. When the patient is free of pain, cervical isometric exercises are started to strengthen the neck muscles.

Cervical traction is accomplished by means of a head halter attached to a pulley and weight. It increases vertebral separation and thus relieves pressure on the nerve roots. The head of the bed is elevated to provide countertraction (see Chap. 67). If the skin becomes irritated, the halter can be padded. Experience has
shown that a male patient may suffer more skin irritation if he shaves; the beard offers a natural form of padding.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Analgesic agents (NSAIDs, propoxyphene [Darvon], oxycodone [Tylox], or hydrocodone [Vicodin]) are prescribed during the acute phase to relieve pain, and sedatives may be administered to control the anxiety often associated with cervical disk disease. Muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine [Flexeril], methocarbamol [Robaxin], metaxalone [Skelaxin]) are administered to interrupt the cycle of muscle spasm and to promote comfort. NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen [Motrin, Advil], naproxen [Naprosyn, Anaprox]) or corticosteroids are prescribed to treat the inflammatory response that usually occurs in the supporting tissues and affected nerve roots. Occasionally, an injection of a corticosteroid into the epidural space may be administered for relief of radicular (spinal nerve root) pain. NSAIDs are given with food and antacids to prevent gastrointestinal irritation. Hot, moist compresses (for 10 to 20 minutes) applied to the back of the neck several times daily increase blood flow to the muscles and help relax the spastic muscles and the patient.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical excision of the herniated disk may be necessary when there is a significant neurologic deficit, progression of the deficit, evidence of cord compression, or pain that either worsens or fails to improve. A cervical discectomy, with or without fusion, may be performed to alleviate symptoms. An anterior surgical approach may be used through a transverse incision to remove disk material that has herniated into the spinal canal and foramina, or a posterior approach may be used at the appropriate level of the cervical spine. Potential complications with the anterior approach include carotid or vertebral artery injury, recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction, esophageal perforation, and airway obstruction. Complications of the posterior approach include damage to the nerve root or the spinal cord due to retraction or contusion of either of these structures, resulting in weakness of muscles supplied by the nerve root or cord.

Microsurgery, such as endoscopic microdiscectomy, may be performed in selected patients through a small incision and using magnification techniques. The patient who undergoes microsurgery usually has less tissue trauma and pain and consequently a shorter hospital stay than after conventional surgical approaches.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING A CERVICAL DISCECTOMY}

\section*{Assessment}

The patient is asked about past injuries to the neck (whiplash) because unresolved trauma may cause persistent discomfort, pain and tenderness, and symptoms of arthritis in the injured joint of the cervical spine. Assessment includes determining the onset, location, and radiation of pain, paresthesias, limited movement, and diminished function of the neck, shoulders, and upper extremities. It is important to determine whether the symptoms are bilateral because with large herniations, bilateral symptoms may be due to cord compression. The area around the cervical spine is palpated to assess muscle tone and tenderness. Range of motion in the neck and shoulders is evaluated.

The patient is asked about any health concerns that may influence the postoperative course. The nurse determines the patient's need for information about the surgical procedure and reinforces what the physician has explained. Strategies for pain management are discussed with the patient.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to the surgical procedure
- Impaired physical mobility related to the postoperative surgical regimen
- Deficient knowledge about the postoperative course and home care management

Other nursing diagnoses may include preoperative anxiety, postoperative constipation, urinary retention related to surgical procedure and dehydration, self-care deficits related to neck orthosis, and sleep pattern disturbance related to disruption in lifestyle.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on all the assessment data, the potential complications may include the following:
- Hematoma at the surgical site, resulting in cord compression and neurologic deficit
- Recurrent or persistent pain after surgery

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include relief of pain, improved mobility, increased knowledge and self-care ability, and prevention of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The patient may be kept flat in bed for 12 to 24 hours. If the patient has had a bone fusion with bone removed from the iliac crest, considerable pain may be experienced. Interventions consist of monitoring the donor site for hematoma formation, administering the prescribed postoperative analgesic agent, positioning for comfort, and reassuring the patient that the pain can be relieved. If the patient experiences a sudden reappearance or increase of pain, extrusion of the graft may have occurred, requiring reoperation and surgical repositioning of the graft. This should be promptly reported to the surgeon.

The patient may experience a sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia due to temporary edema. These symptoms are relieved by throat lozenges, voice rest, and humidification. A puréed diet may be given if the patient has dysphagia.

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

Postoperatively, a cervical collar (neck orthosis) is usually worn, which contributes to limited neck motion and altered mobility. Patients are instructed to turn the body instead of the neck when looking from side to side. The neck should be kept in a neutral
(midline) position. Patients are assisted during position changes, making sure that head, shoulders, and thorax are kept aligned. When assisting a patient to a sitting position, the nurse supports the patient's neck and shoulders. Patients should wear shoes when ambulating to increase stability.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The patient is evaluated for bleeding and hematoma formation by assessing for excessive pressure in the neck or severe pain in the incision area. The dressing is inspected for serosanguineous drainage, which suggests a dural leak. In this event, meningitis is a threat. A complaint of headache requires careful evaluation. Neurologic checks are made for swallowing deficits and upper and lower extremity weakness because cord compression may produce rapid or delayed onset of paralysis. The patient who has had an anterior cervical discectomy is also assessed for a sudden return of radicular (spinal nerve root) pain, which may indicate instability of the spine.

Throughout the postoperative course, the patient is monitored frequently to detect any signs of respiratory difficulty because retractors during surgery may injure the recurrent laryngeal nerve, resulting in hoarseness and the inability to cough effectively and clear pulmonary secretions. In addition, the blood pressure and pulse are monitored to evaluate cardiovascular status.

Bleeding at the surgical site and subsequent hematoma formation may occur. Severe localized pain not relieved by analgesic agents should be reported to the surgeon. A change in neurologic status (motor or sensory function) should be reported promptly because it suggests hematoma formation that may necessitate surgery to prevent irreversible motor and sensory deficits.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient's hospital stay is likely to be short; therefore, the patient and family should understand the care that is important for a smooth recovery. A cervical collar is usually worn for about 6 weeks. The patient is instructed in use and care of the cervical collar. Patients are instructed to alternate tasks in which the body does not move (eg, reading) with tasks that require greater body movement.

The patient is instructed about strategies for pain management and about signs and symptoms that may indicate complications that should be reported to the physician. The nurse assesses the patient's understanding of these management strategies, limitations, and recommendations. Additionally, the nurse assists the patient in identifying strategies to cope with activities of daily living (ie, self-care and childcare) and minimize risks to the surgical site (Chart 65-6).

A discharge teaching plan is developed collaboratively by members of the health care team to decrease the risk for recurrent disk herniation. Topics include those previously discussed as well as proper body mechanics, maintenance of optimal weight, proper exercise techniques, and modifications in activity.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Patients are instructed to see their physician at prescribed intervals to document the disappearance of old symptoms and for assessment of range of motion of the neck. Recurrent or persistent pain may occur despite removal of the offending disk or disk
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_f93998ba91c650b336ccg-491.jpg?height=1502&width=1780&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=109)
fragments. Patients who undergo discectomy usually have consented to surgery after prolonged pain; they have often undergone repeated courses of ineffective conservative management and previous surgeries to relieve the pain. Therefore, the recurrence or persistence of symptoms postoperatively, including pain and sensory deficits, is often discouraging for the patient and family. The patient who experiences recurrence of symptoms requires emotional support and understanding. Additionally, the patient is assisted in modifying activities and in considering options for subsequent treatment.

The patient with degenerative disk disease tends to focus on obvious needs, issues, and deficits. The nurse needs to remind patients and family members of the need for participating in health promotion and health screening practices.

\section*{HERNIATION OF A LUMBAR DISK}

Most lumbar disk herniations occur at the L4-5 or the L5-S1 interspaces (Humphreys \& Eck, 1999). A herniated lumbar disk produces low back pain accompanied by varying degrees of sensory and motor impairment.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient complains of low back pain with muscle spasms, followed by radiation of the pain into one hip and down into the leg (sciatica). Pain is aggravated by actions that increase intraspinal fluid pressure (bending, lifting, straining, as in sneezing and coughing) and usually is relieved by bed rest. Usually there is some type of postural deformity, because pain causes an alteration of the normal spinal mechanics. If the patient lies on the back and attempts to raise a leg in a straight position, pain radiates into the leg because this maneuver, called the straight leg-raising test, stretches the sciatic nerve. Additional signs include muscle weakness, alterations in tendon reflexes, and sensory loss.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of lumbar disk disease is based on the history and physical findings and the use of imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and myelography.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to relieve pain, slow disease progression, and increase the patient's functional ability. Bed rest for 1 to 2 days on a firm mattress (to limit spinal flexion) is encouraged to reduce the weight load and gravitational forces, thereby freeing the disk from stress (Humphrey \& Eck, 1999). The patient is allowed to assume a comfortable position; usually, a semiFowler's position with moderate hip and knee flexion relaxes the back muscles. When the patient is in a side-lying position, a pillow is placed between the legs. To get out of bed, the patient lies on one side while pushing up to a sitting position.

Because muscle spasm is prominent during the acute phase, muscle relaxants are used. NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids may be administered to counter the inflammation that usually occurs in the supporting tissues and the affected nerve roots. Moist heat and massage help to relax spastic muscles and have a sedative effect. Antidepressant agents appear to help in low back pain that is neuropathic in origin (Fishbain, 2000). See also Nursing Process: The Patient With Low Back Pain in Chapter 13 for nursing interventions.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In the lumbar region, surgical treatment includes lumbar disk excision through a posterolateral laminotomy and the newer techniques of microdiscectomy and percutaneous discectomy. In microdiscectomy, an operating microscope is used to visualize the offending disk and compressed nerve roots; it permits a small incision ( 2.5 cm [ 1 inch ]) and minimal blood loss and takes about 30 minutes of operating time. Generally, it involves a short hospital stay, and the patient makes a rapid recovery. Percutaneous discectomy is an alternative treatment for herniated intervertebral disks of the lumbar spine at the L4-5 level. One approach in current use is through a $2.5-\mathrm{cm}$ ( 1 -inch) incision just above the iliac crest. A tube, trocar, or cannula is inserted under x-ray guidance through the retroperitoneal space to the involved disk space. Special instruments are used to remove the disk. The operating time is about 15 minutes. Blood loss and postoperative pain are minimal, and the patient is generally discharged within 2 days after surgery. The disadvantage of this procedure is the possibility of damage to structures in the surgical pathway.

Complications of Disk Surgery. A patient undergoing a disk procedure at one level of the vertebral column may have a degenerative process at other levels. A herniation relapse may occur at the same level or elsewhere, so that the patient may become a candidate for another disk procedure. Arachnoiditis (inflammation of the arachnoid membrane) may occur after surgery (and after myelography); it involves an insidious onset of diffuse, frequently burning pain in the lower back, radiating into the buttocks. Disk excision can leave adhesions and scarring around the spinal nerves and dura, which then produce inflammatory changes that create chronic neuritis and neurofibrosis. Disk surgery may relieve pressure on the spinal nerves, but it does not reverse the effects of neural injury and scarring and the pain that results. Failed disk syndrome (recurrence of sciatica after lumbar discectomy) remains a common cause of disability.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROVIDING PREOPERATIVE CARE}

Most patients fear surgery on any part of the spine and therefore need explanations about the surgery and reassurance that surgery will not weaken the back. When data are being collected for the health history, any reports of pain, paresthesia, and muscle spasm are recorded to provide a baseline for comparison after surgery. Preoperative assessment also includes an evaluation of movement of the extremities as well as bladder and bowel function. To facilitate the postoperative turning procedure, the patient is taught to turn as a unit (called logrolling) as part of the preoperative preparation (Fig. 65-9). Before surgery, the patient is also encouraged to take deep breaths, cough, and perform muscle-setting exercises to maintain muscle tone.

\section*{ASSESSING THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY}

After lumbar disk excision, vital signs are checked frequently and the wound is inspected for hemorrhage because vascular injury is a complication of disk surgery. Because postoperative neurologic deficits may occur from nerve root injury, the sensation and motor strength of the lower extremities are evaluated at specified intervals, along with the color and temperature of the legs and sensation of the toes. It is important to assess for urinary retention, another sign of neurologic deterioration.

In discectomy with fusion, the patient has an additional surgical incision if bone fragments were taken from the iliac crest or fibula to serve as wedges in the spine. The recovery period is longer than for those patients who underwent discectomy without spinal fusion because bony union must take place.

\section*{POSITIONING THE PATIENT}

To position the patient, a pillow is placed under the head and the knee rest is elevated slightly to relax the back muscles. When the patient is lying on one side, however, extreme knee flexion must be avoided. The patient is encouraged to move from side to side to relieve pressure and is reassured that no injury will result from moving. When the patient is ready to turn, the bed is placed in a flat position and a pillow is placed between the legs. The patient turns as a unit (logrolls), without twisting the back.

To get out of bed, the patient lies on one side while pushing up to a sitting position. At the same time, the nurse or family member eases the patient's legs over the side of the bed. Coming to a sitting or standing posture is accomplished in one long, smooth

motion. Most patients walk to the bathroom the same day as surgery. Sitting is discouraged except for defecation.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient is advised to gradually increase activity as tolerated because it takes up to 6 weeks for the ligaments to heal. Excessive activity may result in spasm of the paraspinal muscles.

Activities that produce flexion strain on the spine (eg, driving a car) should be avoided until healing has taken place. Heat may be applied to the back to relax muscle spasms. Scheduled rest periods are important, and the patient is advised to avoid heavy work for 2 to 3 months after surgery. Exercises are prescribed to strengthen the abdominal and erector spinal muscles. A back brace or corset may be necessary if back pain persists.

\section*{POST-POLIO SYNDROME}

Patients who survived the polio epidemic of the 1950s, many now elderly, are developing new symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. It is estimated that between $60 \%$ and $80 \%$ of the 640,000 polio survivors are experiencing the phenomenon known as post-polio syndrome. Men and women appear to be equally at risk (Chasens \& Umlauf, 2000).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The exact cause of post-polio syndrome is not known, but researchers suspect that with aging or muscle overuse the neurons not destroyed originally by the poliovirus cannot continue generating axon sprouts. These new terminal axon sprouts reinnervated the affected muscles following the initial insult but may be more vulnerable as the body ages (Chasens \& Umlauf, 2000).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

No specific diagnostic test exists for this syndrome. The clinical diagnosis is made on the basis of the history and physical examination and exclusion of other medical conditions that may be causing the new symptoms. Patients report a history of paralytic poliomyelitis with partial or complete recovery of function with a plateau of function for at least 10 years and then the recurrence of symptoms (Chasens \& Umlauf, 2000; Chasens, Umlauf, Valappil et al., 2001).

\section*{Management}

No specific medical or surgical treatment is available for this syndrome, and therefore nursing plays a pivotal role in the team approach to assisting patients and families in dealing with the symptoms of progressive loss of muscle strength and significant fatigue. Other health care professionals who may assist in patient care include physical, occupational, speech, and respiratory therapists. Nursing interventions are aimed at slowing the loss of strength and maintaining the patient's physical, psychological, and social well-being.

Patients need to plan and coordinate activities to conserve energy and reduce fatigue. Rest periods should be planned and assistive devices used to reduce weakness and fatigue. Important activities should be planned for the morning, as fatigue often increases in the afternoon and evening (Chasens \& Umlauf, 2000).

One study investigated the barriers (internal and external environmental phenomena) that created further disability in polio survivors (Harrison \& Stuifbergen, 2001). Disability, the inability to perform societal roles, was correlated with perceived barriers to health but not with functional limitations, comorbidity, or secondary conditions. Secondary conditions were correlated with the number of years that the patient had lived with the condition.

Pain in muscles and joints may be a problem. Nonpharmacologic techniques such as the application of heat and cold are most appropriate because these patients tend to have strong reactions to medications (Chasens \& Umlouf, 2000).

Maintaining a balance between adequate nutritional intake yet avoiding excess calories that can lead to obesity in this sedentary group of patients is a challenge. Pulmonary hygiene and adequate fluid intake can help with airway management. Several interventions can improve sleep, including limiting caffeine intake before bedtime and assessing for nocturia. If nocturia is an issue, the patient needs to be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea (Chasens et al., 2001). Supportive ventilation may be appropriate with continuous positive airway pressure if sleep apnea is a problem.

Bone density testing in patients with post-polio syndrome has demonstrated low bone mass and osteoporosis. Thus, the importance of identifying risks, preventing falls, and treating osteoporosis must be discussed with patients and families. The nurse also needs to remind patients and family members of the need for health promotion activities and health screening.

\section*{(1) critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 68 -year-old patient with known cerebral metastases is admitted to the hospital. He reports a new-onset right-sided weakness and headache. What immediate action should you take? What medical treatments can you anticipate? What surgical treatment (if any) would be anticipated? What teaching for the patient and the family is warranted, and why?

\section*{Assessment of Musculoskeletal Function}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}
on completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the anatomy and physiology of the musculoskeletal system.
2. Discuss the significance of the health history to the assessment of musculoskeletal health.
3. Describe the significance of physical assessment to the diagnosis of musculoskeletal dysfunction.
4. Specify the diagnostic tests used for assessment of musculoskeletal function.
5. Describe physical assessment of the musculoskeletal system.

$T_{h}$he musculoskeletal system includes the bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bursae of the body. The problems associated with these structures are common and affect all age groups. Problems with the musculoskeletal system are generally not life-threatening, but they have a significant effect on the patient's normal activities and productivity. Nurses in all practice areas encounter patients with changes in musculoskeletal function.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The health and proper functioning of the musculoskeletal system is interdependent with that of the other body systems. The bony structure provides protection for vital organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs. The bony skeleton provides a sturdy framework to support body structures. The bone matrix stores calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and fluoride. More than $98 \%$ of the totalbody calcium is present in bone. In addition, the red bone marrow located within bone cavities produces red and white blood cells in a process called hematopoiesis. Joints hold the bones together and allow the body to move. The muscles attached to the skeleton contract, moving the bones and producing heat, which helps to maintain body temperature.

\section*{STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE SKELETAL SYSTEM}

There are 206 bones in the human body, divided into four categories:
- Long bones (eg, femur)
- Short bones (eg, metacarpals)
- Flat bones (eg, sternum)
- Irregular bones (eg, vertebrae)

The shape and construction of a specific bone are determined by its function and the forces exerted on it. Bones are constructed of cancellous (trabecular) or cortical (compact) bone tissue. Long bones are shaped like rods or shafts with rounded ends (Fig. 66-1). The shaft, known as the diaphysis, is primarily cortical bone. The ends of the long bones, called epiphyses, are primarily cancellous bone. The epiphyseal plate separates the epiphyses from the diaphysis and is the center for longitudinal growth in children. In the adult, it is calcified. The ends of long bones are covered at the joints by articular cartilage, which is a tough, elastic, avascular tissue. Long bones are designed for weight bearing and movement. Short bones consist of cancellous bone covered by a layer of compact bone. Flat bones are important sites for hematopoiesis and frequently provide vital organ protection. They are made of cancellous bone layered between compact bone. Irregular bones have unique shapes related to their functions. Generally, irregular bone structure is similar to that of flat bones.

Bone is composed of cells, protein matrix, and mineral deposits. The cells are of three basic types-osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts function in bone formation by secreting bone matrix. The matrix, which consists of collagen and ground substances (glycoproteins and proteoglycans), provides a framework in which inorganic mineral salts are deposited. Osteocytes are mature bone cells involved in bone-maintenance functions; they are located in lacunae (bone matrix units). Osteoclasts, located in shallow Howship's lacunae (small pits in bones), are multinuclear cells involved in destroying, resorbing, and remolding bone. The microscopic functioning unit of mature cortical bone is the osteon (Haversian system). The center of the osteon, the Haversian canal, contains a capillary. Around the capillary are circles of mineralized bone matrix called lamellae. Within the lamellae are lacunae containing osteocytes. These are nourished

through tiny structures, canaliculi (canals), that communicate with adjacent blood vessels within the Haversian system (see Fig. 66-1).

Lacunae in cancellous bone are layered in an irregular lattice network (trabeculae). Red bone marrow fills the lattice network. Capillaries nourish the osteocytes located in the lacunae.

Covering the bone is a dense, fibrous membrane known as the periosteum. The periosteum nourishes bone and allows for its growth; it also provides for the attachment of tendons and ligaments. The periosteum contains nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics. The layer closest to the bone contains osteoblasts, which are bone-forming cells.

The endosteum is a thin, vascular membrane that covers the marrow cavity of long bones and the spaces in cancellous bone. Osteoclasts, which dissolve bone to maintain the marrow cavity, are located near the endosteum in Howship's lacunae.

Bone marrow is a vascular tissue located in the medullary (shaft) cavity of long bones and in flat bones. Red bone marrow, located mainly in the sternum, ilium, vertebrae, and ribs in adults, is responsible for producing red and white blood cells. In adults, the long bone is filled with fatty, yellow marrow.

Bone tissue is well vascularized. Cancellous bone receives a rich blood supply through metaphyseal and epiphyseal vessels. Periosteal vessels carry blood to compact bone through minute Volkmann's canals. In addition, nutrient arteries penetrate the periosteum and enter the medullary cavity through foramina (small openings). Nutrient arteries supply blood to the marrow and bone. The venous system may accompany arteries or may exit independently.

\section*{Bone Formation (Osteogenesis)}

Bone begins to form long before birth. Ossification is the process by which the bone matrix (collagen fibers and ground substance) is formed and hardening minerals (eg, calcium salts) are deposited on the collagen fibers. The collagen fibers give tensile strength to the bone, and the calcium provides compressional strength.

There are two basic processes of ossification: endochondral and intramembranous. Most bones in the body are formed by endochondral ossification, in which a cartilage-like tissue (osteoid) is formed, resorbed, and replaced by bone. Intramembranous ossification occurs when bone develops within membrane, as in the bones of the face and skull.

\section*{Bone Maintenance}

Bone is a dynamic tissue in a constant state of turnoverresorption and formation. The important regulating factors that determine the balance between bone formation and bone resorption include local stress, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and blood supply.

Local stress (weight bearing) acts to simulate bone formation and remodeling. Weight-bearing bones are thick and strong. Without weight-bearing or stress, as in prolonged bed rest, the bone loses calcium (resorption) and becomes osteopenic and weak. The weak bone may fracture easily.

Biologically active vitamin D (calcitriol) functions to increase the amount of calcium in the blood by promoting absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract. It also facilitates mineralization of osteoid tissue. A deficiency of vitamin D results in bone mineralization deficit, deformity, and fracture.

Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin are the major hormonal regulators of calcium homeostasis. Parathyroid hormone regulates the concentration of calcium in the blood, in part by promoting movement of calcium from the bone. In response to low calcium levels in the blood, increased levels of parathyroid hormone prompt the mobilization of calcium, the demineralization of bone, and the formation of bone cysts. Calcitonin, secreted by the thyroid gland in response to elevated blood calcium levels, inhibits bone resorption and increases the deposit of calcium in bone.

Blood supply to the bone also affects bone formation. With diminished blood supply or hyperemia (congestion), osteogenesis (bone formation) and bone density decrease. Bone necrosis occurs when the bone is deprived of blood.

\section*{Bone Healing}

Most fractures heal through a combination of intramembranous and endochondral ossification processes. When a bone is fractured, the bone fragments are not merely patched together with scar tissue. Instead, the bone regenerates itself.

Fracture healing occurs in four areas, including:
- Bone marrow, where endothelial cells rapidly undergo transformation and become osteoblastic bone-forming cells
- Bone cortex, where new osteons are formed
- Periosteum, where a hard callus/bone is formed through intramembranous ossification peripheral to the fracture, and where a cartilage model is formed through endochondral ossification adjacent to the fracture site
- External soft tissue, where a bridging callus (fibrous tissue) stabilizes the fracture

Buckwalter (2000) summarized the process of fracture healing into six stages stimulated by the release and activation of biologic regulators and signaling molecules:
1. Hematoma and inflammation: The body's response is similar to that after injury elsewhere in the body. There is bleeding into the injured tissue and formation of a fracture hematoma. The hematoma is the source of signaling molecules, such as cytokines, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- $\beta$ ), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which initiate the fracture healing processes. The fracture fragment ends become devitalized because of the interrupted blood supply. The injured area is invaded by macrophages (large white blood cells), which débride the area. Inflammation, swelling, and pain are present. The inflammatory stage lasts several days and resolves with a decrease in pain and swelling.
2. Angiogenesis and cartilage formation: Under the influence of signaling molecules, cell proliferation and differentiation occur. Blood vessels and cartilage overlie the fracture.
3. Cartilage calcification: Chondrocytes in the cartilage callus form matrix vesicles, which regulate calcification of the cartilage. Enzymes within these matrix vesicles prepare the cartilage for calcium release and deposit.
4. Cartilage removal: The calcified cartilage is invaded by blood vessels and becomes resorbed by chondroblasts and osteoclasts. It is replaced by woven bone similar to that of the growth plate.
5. Bone formation: Minerals continue to be deposited until the bone is firmly reunited. With major adult long bone fractures, ossification takes 3 to 4 months.
6. Remodeling: The final stage of fracture repair consists of remodeling the new bone into its former structural arrangement. Remodeling may take months to years, depending on the extent of bone modification needed, the function of the bone, and the functional stresses on the bone. Cancellous bone heals and remodels more rapidly than does compact cortical bone.
Serial x-ray films are used to monitor the progress of bone healing. The type of bone fractured, the adequacy of blood supply, the surface contact of the fragments, and the general health of the person influence the rate of fracture healing. Adequate immobilization is essential until there is x-ray evidence of bone formation with ossification.

\section*{BONE HEALING WITH FRAGMENTS FIRMLY APPROXIMATED}

When fractures are treated with open rigid compression plate fixation techniques, the bony fragments can be placed in direct contact. Primary bone healing occurs through cortical bone (Haversian) remodeling. Little or no cartilaginous callus develops. Immature bone develops from the endosteum. There is an intensive regeneration of new osteons, which develop in the fracture line by a process similar to normal bone maintenance. Fracture strength is obtained when the new osteons have become established.

\section*{STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE ARTICULAR SYSTEM}

The junction of two or more bones is called a joint (articulation). There are three basic kinds of joints: synarthrosis, amphiarthrosis, and diarthrosis joints. Synarthrosis joints are immovable, as exemplified by the skull sutures. Amphiarthrosis joints, such as the vertebral joints and the symphysis pubis, allow limited motion. The bones of amphiarthrosis joints are joined by fibrous cartilage. Diarthrosis joints are freely movable joints (Fig. 66-2).

There are several types of diarthrosis joints:
- Ball-and-socket joints, best exemplified by the hip and the shoulder, permit full freedom of movement.
- Hinge joints permit bending in one direction only and are best exemplified by the elbow and the knee.
- Saddle joints allow movement in two planes at right angles to each other. The joint at the base of the thumb is a saddle, biaxial joint.
- Pivot joints are characterized by the articulation between the radius and the ulna. They permit rotation for such activities as turning a doorknob.
- Gliding joints allow for limited movement in all directions and are represented by the joints of the carpal bones in the wrist.
