                        <p>Human genome discoveries have ushered in a new era of medicine, genomic medicine, which recognizes that multiple genes work in concert with environmental influences to cause disease. Genomic medicine aims to improve predictions about individuals' susceptibility to diseases, the time of onset for those diseases, their extent and eventual severity, and which treatments or medications are likely to be most effective or harmful (Billings, 2000). Already, new gene-based strategies for disease detection, management, and treatment have been created, allowing health professionals to tailor care to an individual's particular genetic make-up.</p>
                        <p>To meet the challenges of genomic medicine, nurses need to understand the new technologies and treatments of gene-based health care. Nurses also must recognize that they are a vital link between patients and health care services; patients often turn to nurses first with questions about family history of risk factors, genetics information, and genetic tests and interpretations. Incorporating genetics into nursing means bringing a genetics framework to health assessments, planning, and interventions that supports identification of and response to individuals' changing genetics-related health needs (Lea, Williams, Jenkins, et al., 2000).</p>
                        <p>Nurses must learn to recognize patterns of inheritance when obtaining family and medical histories and understand when it is appropriate to consider new gene-based testing and treatment options. This chapter offers a foundation for the clinical applications of genetics principles in medical and surgical nursing, outlines the nurse's role in genetic counseling and evaluation, addresses important ethical issues, and provides genetics resources for nurses and patients.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-1" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">A Framework for Integrating Genetics Into Nursing Practice</span></h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Nursing's unique contribution to genomic medicine is its philosophy of holism. Nurses are ideally positioned to incorporate genetics into their assessments, planning, and interventions for patients at different ages and stages across the lifespan and in all settings. The holistic view that characterizes nursing takes into account each person's intellectual, physical, spiritual, social, cultural, biopsychologic, ethical, and esthetic experiences while addressing genetics information, gene-based testing, diagnosis, and treatments. Thus, knowledge about genetics is basic to nursing practice (Lea, Anderson & Monsen, 1998).</p>
                        <p>A framework for integrating genetics into nursing practice includes a philosophy of care that recognizes when genetics factors are playing a role or could play a role in an individual's health. This means using family history and the results of genetics tests effectively, informing patients about genetics concepts, understanding the personal and societal impact of genetics information, and valuing the privacy and confidentiality of genetics information.</p>
                        <p>A person's response to genetics information, genetic testing, or conditions may be either disabling or empowering. Genetics information may stigmatize individuals if it affects how they view themselves or how others view them. Nurses can help individuals and families understand the genetic aspect of themselves and learn how genetic traits and conditions are passed on within families and how genetic and environmental factors influence health and disease (Lea, Anderson & Monsen, 1998; Peters et al., 1999).</p>
                        <p>Nurses facilitate communication among family members, the health care system, and community resources; they offer valuable support by virtue of their continuity of care with patients and families. All nurses should be able to recognize when a client is asking a question related to genetics information and should know how to obtain genetics information by gathering family and health histories and conducting physical and developmental assessments. Being able to recognize a genetics concern allows the nurse to provide appropriate genetics resources and support to individuals and families (Lea, Jenkins & Francomano, 1998).</p>
                        <p>Key to nurses' genetics framework is the awareness of one's attitudes, experience, and assumptions about genetics concepts and how these are manifested in one's own practice. Chart 9-1 offers insights on how nurses can conduct periodic self-assessments.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span> Chart 9-1: Examining Our Own Attitudes, Experiences, and Assumptions</h4>
                            <p>Self-knowledge is one of the cornerstones to providing quality nursing care, and as practitioners, our attitudes and experiences have an impact on clinical practice. These attitudes emerge from social, cultural, and religious experiences in one's personal life. Awareness of our own values, beliefs, and cultural perceptions not only is important to the nurse-patient relationship, but it is also the first step in developing a genetics framework.</p>
                            <p>Periodic self-assessment can help maintain an effective framework as nurses update genetics knowledge and practice. Nurses can develop an awareness of their own attitudes, experiences, and assumptions about genetics concepts by considering the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>One's family's beliefs or values about health.</strong> What are your family, religious, or cultural beliefs about the cause of illness? How have your values or biases influenced your understanding of genetic conditions?</li>
                                <li><strong>One's philosophical, theologic, cultural, and ethical perspectives related to health.</strong> How would these attitudes influence your own use of genetics information or services? What experiences have you had with people from different social, cultural, religious, or ethnic groups? How would you deliver genetics information to individuals from different social, cultural, or ethnic groups? Can you recognize when personal values or biases may affect or interfere with the delivery of genetics information?</li>
                                <li><strong>One's level of genetics expertise.</strong> Can you recognize the limitations of your own genetics experience and know when to refer patients for further genetics work-up?</li>
                                <li><strong>One's experience with birth defects, chronic illnesses, and genetic conditions.</strong> Do you have a family member or friend who has a genetic condition or disorder? Has your experience been that genetic disorders are disabling or empowering? Do you view a parent "at fault" for having a baby born with a birth defect or genetic condition? Do you advocate for fair access and other rights for individuals who have birth defects, genetic conditions, or other disabilities?</li>
                                <li><strong>One's view of DNA (the most basic concept of who we are, since our genetic makeup is unlike that of any other person except an identical twin).</strong> What are your assumptions about DNA? For example, do you assume that the genetic component of "the self" is a defective self? As another example, healthy carriers of genetic alterations that predispose them to develop certain diseases in the future now belong to a new class of "at risk" individuals. A person who is "at risk" is not ill at present, but may not remain well as long as the "average" person. Is it good to know that you are "at risk" or is this information that should not be identified or revealed because of the risk of potential discrimination?</li>
                                <li><strong>One's beliefs about reproductive options.</strong> What are your beliefs regarding reproductive options such as prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination? How might these influence your care of a patient who holds different beliefs?</li>
                                <li><strong>One's view of genetic testing and engineering.</strong> Do you see genetic testing and engineering—the ability to eliminate or enhance certain traits—as a way to create an "ideal genetic self"?</li>
                                <li><strong>One's approach to patients with disabilities.</strong> How are your attitudes made apparent in your practice and practice settings? For example, do you have access to TTY machines and/or interpreters for those who have hearing impairment? Are your intake procedures adapted to meet the needs of an individual with disabilities?</li>
                            </ul>
