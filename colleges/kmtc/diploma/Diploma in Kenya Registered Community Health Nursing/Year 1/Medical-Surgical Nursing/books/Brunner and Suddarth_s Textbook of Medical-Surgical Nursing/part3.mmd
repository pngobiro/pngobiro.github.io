2. Have the patient sit in a neutral position with head facing forward. Place the distal tip of the tubing at the tip of the patient's nose (N); extend tube to the tragus (tip) of the ear (E), and then extend the tube straight down to the tip of the xiphoid $(X)$. Mark this point ' $B$ ' on the tubing.

Cetacaine (tetracaine/benzocaine) to numb the nasal passage and suppress the gag reflex. This makes the entire procedure more tolerable. Having the patient gargle with a liquid anesthetic or hold ice chips in the mouth for a few minutes can have the same effect. Encouraging the patient to breathe through the mouth or to pant often helps, as does swallowing water, if permitted.

A polyurethane tube may need to be warmed to make it more pliable. To make the tube easier to insert, it should be lubricated with a water-soluble substance (K-Y jelly) unless it has a dry coating called hydromer, which, when moistened, provides its own lubrication. The nurse wears gloves during the procedure.

The patient is placed in Fowler's position, and the nostrils are inspected for any obstruction. The more patent nostril is selected for use. The tip of the patient's nose is tilted, and the tube is aligned to enter the nostril. When the tube reaches the nasopharynx, the patient is instructed to lower the head slightly and to begin to swallow as the tube is advanced. The patient may also sip water through a straw to facilitate advancement of the tube. The oropharynx is inspected to ensure that the tube has not coiled in the pharynx or mouth.

\section*{Confirming Placement}

To ensure patient safety, it is essential to confirm that the tube has been placed correctly, particularly because tubes may be accidentally inserted in the lungs, which may be undetected in highrisk patients. Examples of high-risk patients are those with a decreased level of consciousness, confused mental state, poor or absent cough and gag reflexes, or agitation during insertion. Presence of an endotracheal tube and recent removal of an endotracheal tube also increase the risk for inadvertent placement of the tube in the lung (Metheny, 1998). Initially, an x-ray study should confirm tube placement. However, each time liquids or medications are administered, and once a shift for continuous feedings, the tube must be checked to ensure that it remains properly placed. The traditional recommendation has been to inject air through the tube while auscultating the epigastric area with a stethoscope to detect air insufflations. However, studies indicate that this auscultatory method is not accurate in determining whether the tube has been inserted into the stomach, intestines, or respiratory tract (Metheny et al., 1999). Instead of the auscultation method, a combination of three methods is recommended:
- Measurement of tube length
- Visual assessment of aspirate
- pH measurement of aspirate

After the tube is inserted, the exposed portion of the tube is measured and the length is documented. The nurse measures the exposed tube length every shift and compares it with the original measurement. An increase in the length of exposed tube may indicate dislodgement, or a leaking or ruptured balloon if the tube has a balloon.

Visual assessment of the color of the aspirate may help identify tube placement. Metheny et al. (1994) found that gastric aspirate is most frequently cloudy and green, tan or off-white, or bloody or brown. Intestinal aspirate is primarily clear and yellow to bile-colored. Pleural fluid is usually pale yellow and serous, and tracheobronchial secretions are usually tan or off-white mucus. Researchers suggest that the appearance of the aspirate may be helpful in distinguishing between gastric and intestinal placement but is of little value in ruling out respiratory placement. This method is less helpful when the patient is receiving continuous
feedings, because aspirate often looks like the formula that is used for the feeding (Metheny \& Titler, 2001).

Determining the pH of the tube aspirate is a more accurate method of confirming tube placement. The pH method can also be used to monitor the advancement of the tube into the small intestines. The pH of gastric aspirate is acidic (1 to 5). The pH of intestinal aspirate is approximately 6 or greater, and the pH of respiratory aspirate is more alkaline (7 or greater). pH testing is best suited for distinguishing between gastric and intestinal placement. A pH sensor enteral tube is available which does not require fluid aspirate to obtain pH values; it can be useful in distinguishing gastric from small bowel placement of the tube. The pH method is less helpful with continuous feedings, because tube feedings have a pH value of 6.6 and neutralize the GI pH (Metheny \& Titler, 2001). For more information, see Nursing Research Profile 36-1.

Using gastric aspiration as a means of verifying that the NG tube has been placed correctly may be a problem because of the characteristic properties and diameter of the tubes. Studies suggest that aspiration may be performed more easily with polyurethane tubes and tubes with a size 10 Fr diameter. Metheny et al. (1993) recommended the following steps if problems occur with aspiration of fluid from small-bore feeding tubes:
1. Insufflate 20 mL of air through the tube with a large syringe ( 30 to 60 mL ).
2. Pull back on the plunger.
3. If step 2 is ineffective, insufflate another 20 mL of air and replace the large syringe with a smaller one ( 12 mL ); attempt to aspirate.
4. If the measure is still ineffective, repeat step 3.
5. Change the patient's position and attempt to aspirate.

\section*{Securing the Tube}

After the correct position of the tip has been confirmed, the NG tube is secured to the nose (Fig. 36-4). A liquid skin barrier should be applied to the skin where the NG tube will be secured. The prepared area is covered with a strip of hypoallergenic tape or Op-site; the tube is then placed over the tape and secured with a second piece of tape. The nasoenteric tube can be secured by taping it to the forehead (see Fig. 36-4). This keeps the tube from dislodging when the patient moves but still allows it to pass into the intestine. Instead of tape, a feeding tube attachment device (Hollister) can be used to secure the tube. This device adheres to the nose and uses an adjustable clip to hold the tube in place (Fig. 36-5). After the nasoenteric tube has progressed into the intestine (after approximately 24 hours), the tube may be taped in place.

\section*{Advancing the Nasoenteric Decompression Tube}

After the tube has passed through the pyloric sphincter, it may be advanced 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 in) every hour. To enable gravity and peristalsis to assist in the passage of the tube, the patient is generally asked to lie in the following positions in this order: on the right side for 2 hours, on the back for 2 hours, and then on the left side for 2 hours. Ambulation, if possible, also helps advance the tube. If the tube is advanced too rapidly, it will curl and kink in the stomach. The tube is irrigated with normal saline solution every 6 to 8 hours to prevent blockage.

Metheny, N. A., Smith, L., \& Stewart, B. J. (2000). Development of a reliable and valid bedside test for bilirubin and its utility for improving prediction of feeding tube location. Nursing Research, 49, 302-309.

\section*{Purpose}

Although a wide variety of methods have been used to assess feeding tube location at the bedside, pH testing of aspirate has been found to be the most reliable in differentiating between gastric and respiratory placement of the tube and between gastric and intestinal placement of the tube. However, it is not reliable in distinguishing intestinal from respiratory fluids, because both of these fluids are alkaline. One new method that is being studied to distinguish these fluids is testing the tube aspirate for bilirubin, which is normally found in intestinal fluids but not in respiratory fluids.

The purposes of this study were (1) to assess the validity of a visual bilirubin teststrip used with a colorimetric visual bilirubin (VBIL) scale to predict laboratory bilirubin values, (2) to evaluate the interrater reliability of staff nurses using the visual bilirubin test strip and VBIL scale, and (3) to evaluate the ability of the visual bilirubin test strip and VBIL scale in combination with pH testing to predict feeding tube placement in the respiratory tract, stomach, or intestine.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Concurrent pH and bilirubin testing was conducted on 631 GI specimens obtained from adult, acutely ill patients with newly inserted feeding tubes; the testing was done within 5 minutes of x-ray studies obtained to confirm tube placement. Also, 225 respiratory specimens were tested. A teststrip and VBIL scale as well as laboratory assay were used to measure bilirubin. A pH meter and pH teststrips were used to
measure pH. Results were read by research assistants and staff nurses, who were blinded to (unaware of) the source or type of specimens. These readings were compared with the x-ray results.

\section*{Findings}

There was a high correlation (0.93) between the readings made from the VBIL scale and the laboratory bilirubin assay. A pH reading greater than 5 and a bilirubin reading lower than $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ accurately identified $100 \%$ of the respiratory specimens. A pH of 5 or less and a bilirubin concentration lower than $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ accurately identified $98 \%$ of the gastric specimens. Approximately $88 \%$ of the specimens with a pH greater than 5 and a bilirubin value of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or higher were intestinal specimens.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Use of the VBIL scale and bilirubin test strip has the potential for greatly improving the accuracy of determining feeding tube placement at the bedside. However, before its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this purpose, further refinements are required to make sure that the most accurate readings can be made. Until such approval, nurses must rely on the auscultatory method, pH measurements, and observations of the patient's physical status to determine tube placement. Any question about correct tube placement should be investigated, and placement should be confirmed by x-ray studies whenever indicated.

\section*{Monitoring the Patient and Maintaining Tube Function}

If the NG tube is used for decompression, it is attached to intermittent low suction. If it is used for enteral nutrition, the end of the tube is plugged between feedings. The nurse confirms tube placement before any fluids or medications are instilled and once a shift for continuous feedings. Displacement of the tube may be caused by tension on the tube (when the patient moves around in the bed or room), coughing, tracheal or nasotracheal suctioning, or airway intubation. If the NG tube is removed inadvertently in a patient who has undergone esophageal or gastric surgery, it is replaced by the physician, usually under fluoroscopy to avoid trauma to the suture line.

It is important to keep an accurate record of all fluid intake, feedings, and irrigation. To maintain patency, the tube is irrigated every 4 to 6 hours with normal saline to avoid electrolyte loss through gastric drainage. If an automatic flush enteral pump is used, the flushing schedule may be altered. The nurse records the amount, color, and type of all drainage every 8 hours.

When double- or triple-lumen tubes are used, each lumen is labeled according to its intended use: aspiration, feeding, or balloon inflation. To avoid tension on the tube, the portion of the tube from the nose to the drainage unit is fixed in position, either with a safety pin or with adhesive tape loops that are pinned to the patient's pajamas or gown. The tube must be looped loosely to prevent tension and dislodgement (see Fig. 36-4).

\section*{Providing Oral and Nasal Hygiene}

Regular and conscientious oral and nasal hygiene is a vital part of patient care, because the tube causes discomfort and pressure and may be in place for several days. Moistened cotton-tipped swabs can be used to clean the nose, followed by cleansing with a watersoluble lubricant. Frequent mouth care is comforting for the patient. The nasal tape is changed every 2 to 3 days, and the nose is inspected for skin irritation. If the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa are
excessively dry, steam or cool vapor inhalations may be beneficial. Throat lozenges, an ice collar, chewing gum, or sucking on hard candies (if permitted), and frequent movement also assist in relieving patient discomfort. These activities keep the mucous membranes moist and help prevent inflammation of the parotid glands.

\section*{Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications}

Patients with NG or nasoenteric intubation are susceptible to a variety of problems, including fluid volume deficit, pulmonary complications, and tube-related irritations. These potential complications require careful ongoing assessment.

Symptoms of fluid volume deficit include dry skin and mucous membranes, decreased urinary output, lethargy, and decreased body temperature. Assessment of fluid volume deficit involves maintaining an accurate record of intake and output. This includes measuring NG drainage, fluid instilled by irrigation of the NG tube, water taken by mouth, vomitus, water administered with tube feedings, and intravenous (IV) fluids. Laboratory values, particularly blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, are monitored. The nurse assesses 24-hour fluid balance and reports negative fluid balance, increased NG output, interruption of IV therapy, or any other disturbance in fluid intake or output.

Pulmonary complications from NG intubation occur because coughing and clearing of the pharynx are impaired, because gas buildup can irritate the phrenic nerve, and because tubes may become dislodged, retracting the distal end above the esophagogastric sphincter. Medications (antacids, simethicone, and metoclopramide) are administered to decrease potential problems. Signs and symptoms of complications include coughing during the administration of foods or medications, difficulty clearing the airway, tachypnea, and fever. Assessment includes regular auscultation of lung sounds and routine assessment of vital signs. It is important to encourage the patient to cough and to take deep breaths regularly. The nurse also carefully confirms the proper placement of the tube before instilling any fluids or medications.

Irritation of the mucous membranes is a common complication of NG intubation. The nostrils, oral mucosa, esophagus, and trachea are susceptible to irritation and necrosis. Visible areas are inspected frequently, and the adequacy of hydration is assessed. When providing oral hygiene, the nurse carefully inspects the mucous membranes for signs of irritation or excessive dryness. The nurse palpates the area around the parotid glands to detect any tenderness or enlarged nodes, indicating parotitis, and observes for any skin or mucous membrane irritation or necrosis. In addition, it is important to assess the patient for esophagitis and tracheitis; symptoms include sore throat and hoarseness.

\section*{Removing the Tube}

Before removing a tube, the nurse may intermittently clamp and unclamp the NG tube for a trial period of 24 hours to ensure that the patient does not experience nausea, vomiting, or distention. Before the tube is removed, it is flushed with 10 mL of normal saline to ensure that it is free of debris and away from the gastric lining; then the balloon (if present) is deflated. Gloves are worn to remove the tube. The tube is withdrawn gently and slowly for 15 to 20 cm ( 6 to 8 in ) until the tip reaches the esophagus; the
remainder is withdrawn rapidly from the nostril. A nasointestinal tube is withdrawn at intervals of 10 minutes until the end reaches the esophagus. If the tube does not come out easily, force should not be used, and the problem should be reported to the physician. As the tube is withdrawn, it is concealed in a towel, because the sight of it may be unpleasant to the patient. After the tube is removed, the nurse provides oral hygiene.

\section*{Tube Feedings With Nasogastric and Nasoenteric Devices}

Tube feedings are given to meet nutritional requirements when oral intake is inadequate or not possible and the GI tract is functioning normally. Tube feedings have several advantages over parenteral nutrition: they are low in cost, safe, well tolerated by the patient, and easy to use both in extended care facilities and in the patient's home. Tube feedings have other advantages:
- They preserve GI integrity by delivery of nutrients and medications (antacids, simethicone, and metoclopramide) intraluminally
- They preserve the normal sequence of intestinal and hepatic metabolism
- They maintain fat metabolism and lipoprotein synthesis
- They maintain normal insulin/glucagon ratios

Tube feedings are delivered to the stomach (in the case of NG intubation or gastrostomy) or to the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum (in the case of nasoduodenal or nasojejunal tube feeding). Nasoduodenal or nasojejunal feeding is indicated when the esophagus and stomach need to be bypassed or when the patient is at risk for aspiration (breathing fluids or foods into the trachea and lungs). For long-term feedings (longer than 4 weeks), nasoduodenal, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy tubes are preferred for administration of medications or food. The numerous conditions requiring enteral nutrition are summarized in Table 36-2.

\section*{OSMOSIS AND OSMOLALITY}

Osmolality is an important consideration for patients receiving tube feedings through the duodenum or jejunum, because feeding formulas with a high osmolality may lead to undesirable effects, such as dumping syndrome (described below).

Fluid balance is maintained by osmosis, the process by which water moves through membranes from a dilute solution of lower osmolality (ionic concentration) to a more concentrated solution of higher osmolality until both solutions are of nearly equal osmolality. The osmolality of normal body fluids is approximately $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$. The body attempts to keep the osmolality of the contents of the stomach and intestines at approximately this level.

Highly concentrated solutions and certain foods can upset the normal fluid balance in the body. Individual amino acids and carbohydrates are small particles that have great osmotic effect. Proteins are extremely large particles and therefore have less osmotic effect. Fats are not water-soluble and do not enter into a solution in water; thus, they have no osmotic effect. Electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, are comparatively small particles; they have a great effect on osmolality and consequently on the patient's ability to tolerate a given solution.

When a concentrated solution of high osmolality is taken in large amounts, water will move to the stomach and intestines from fluid surrounding the organs and the vascular compartment. The patient has a feeling of fullness, nausea, and diarrhea; this causes dehydration, hypotension, and tachycardia, collectively termed the dumping syndrome. Starting with a more dilute solution and increasing the concentration over several days can generally alleviate this problem. Patients vary in the degree to which they tolerate the effects of high osmolality; usually debilitated patients are more sensitive. The nurse needs to be knowledgeable about the osmolality of the patient's formula and needs to observe for and take steps to prevent undesired effects.

\section*{TUBE FEEDING FORMULAS}

The choice of formula to be delivered by tube feeding is influenced by the status of the GI tract and the nutritional needs of

}
the patient. The formula characteristics evaluated include chemical composition of the nutrient source (protein, carbohydrates, fat), caloric density, osmolality, residue, bacteriologic safety, vitamins, minerals, and cost.

Various major formula types for tube feedings are available commercially. Blenderized formulas can be made by the patient's family or obtained in a ready-to-use form that is carefully prepared according to directions. Commercially prepared polymeric formulas (formulas with high molecular weight) are composed of protein, carbohydrates, and fats in a high-molecular-weight form (Boost Plus, TwoCal HN, Isosource). Chemically defined formulas contain predigested and easy-to-absorb nutrients (Osmolite HN). Modular products contain only one major nutrient, such as protein (Promote). Disease-specific formulas are available for various conditions, such as renal failure (Nepro), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Pulmocare). Nepro is high in calories and low in electrolytes. It is ideal for patients who require electrolyte and fluid restriction. Pulmocare is high in fat and low in carbohydrates. Its high density ( 1.5 calories $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ) is ideal for patients who require fluid restriction, and it is also designed to reduce carbon dioxide production. Fiber has also been added to formulas (Jevity) in an attempt to decrease the occurrence of diarrhea. Some feedings are given as supplements, and others are designed to meet the patient's total nutritional needs. Dietitians collaborate with physicians and nurses in determining the best formula for the individual patient.

NURSING ALERT Commercial formulas frequently present problems because the composition is fixed and some patients are not able to tolerate certain ingredients, such as sodium, protein, or potassium. Modular products may be substituted, and the critical constituents of sodium, potassium, and fat can be added. Attention is given to including all essential minerals and vitamins. Total intake of calories, nutrients, and fluids must be assessed when there is a reduction in total intake or excessive dilution of feedings.

\section*{TUBE FEEDING ADMINISTRATION METHODS}

Many patients do not tolerate NG and nasoenteric tube feedings well. Often a medium- or fine-bore Silastic nasoenteric tube is tolerated better than a plastic or rubber tube. The finer-bore tube requires a finely dispersed formula to ensure that the patency of the tube is maintained. For long-term tube feeding therapy, a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube is used (see later discussion).

The tube feeding method chosen depends on the location of the tube, patient tolerance, convenience, and cost. Intermittent bolus feedings are administered into the stomach (usually by gastrostomy tube) in large amounts at designated intervals and may be given 4 to 8 times per day. The intermittent gravity drip is another method for administering tube feedings into the stomach and is commonly used when the patient is at home. In this instance, the tube feeding is administered over 30 minutes at designated intervals. Both of these tube-feeding methods are practical and inexpensive. However, the feedings delivered at variable rates may be poorly tolerated and time-consuming.

The continuous infusion method is used when feedings are administered into the small intestine. This method is preferred for patients who are at risk for aspiration or who tolerate the tube feedings poorly. The feedings are given continuously at a constant rate by means of a pump. The continuous tube feeding method, which requires a pump device, decreases abdominal dis-
tention, gastric residuals, and the risk of aspiration. However, pumps are expensive, and they permit the patient less flexibility than intermittent feedings do.

An alternative to the continuous infusion method is cyclic feeding. The infusion is given at a faster rate over a shorter time (usually 8 to 12 hours). Feeding may be infused at night to avoid interrupting the patient's lifestyle. Cyclic continuous infusions may be appropriate for patients who are being weaned from tube feedings to an oral diet, as a supplement for a patient who cannot eat enough, and for patients at home who need daytime hours free from the pump.

Tube feeding solutions vary in terms of required preparation, consistency, and the number of calories and supplemental vitamins they contain. The choice of solution depends on the size and location of the tube, the patient's nutrient needs, the type of nutritional supplement, the method of delivery, and the convenience for the patient at home. A wide variety of containers, feeding tubes and catheters, delivery systems, and pumps are available for use with tube feedings.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT RECEIVING A TUBE FEEDING}

\section*{Assessment}

A preliminary assessment of the patient who requires a tube feeding includes several considerations, as well as the family's need for information:
- What is the patient's nutritional status, as judged by current physical appearance, dietary history, and recent weight loss?
- Are there any existing chronic illnesses or factors that will increase metabolic demands on the body (eg, surgical stress, fever)?
- What is the patient's hydration status? What are the electrolyte levels?
- Is the patient's digestive tract functioning?
- Are the kidneys functioning normally?
- Are fluid requirements (ie, 30 to $40 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) being met?
- What medications and other therapies is the patient receiving that may affect digestive intake and function of the digestive system?
- Does the dietary prescription fulfill the patient's needs?

In addition, a more elaborate assessment is performed for patients who require extensive nutritional therapy. A team that includes the nurse, physician, and dietitian conducts this assessment. In addition to the history and physical examination (which includes anthropometric measurements), nutritional assessment consists of recording any weight change; determining albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin levels and total lymphocyte count; testing for the delayed hypersensitivity reaction; and evaluating muscle function. (See Chapter 5 for a detailed description of nutritional assessment.)

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inadequate intake of nutrients
- Risk for diarrhea related to the dumping syndrome or to tube feeding intolerance
- Risk for ineffective airway clearance related to aspiration of tube feeding
- Risk for deficient fluid volume related to hypertonic dehydration
- Risk for ineffective coping related to discomfort imposed by the presence of the NG or nasoenteric tube
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management
- Deficient knowledge about home tube feeding regimen

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Complications of NG and nasoenteric tube feeding therapy are classified into three types-GI, mechanical, and metabolic. Table 36-3 lists complications, possible causes, and appropriate interventions.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include nutritional balance, normal bowel elimination pattern, reduced risk of aspiration, adequate hydration, individual coping, knowledge and skill in selfcare, and prevention of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING FEEDING EQUIPMENT AND NUTRITIONAL BALANCE}

The temperature and volume of the feeding, the flow rate, and the total fluid intake are important factors to be considered when tube feedings are administered. The schedule of tube feedings, including the correct quantity and frequency, is maintained. The nurse must carefully monitor the drip rate and avoid administering fluids too rapidly.

Feedings are administered by gravity (drip), bolus, or continuous controlled pump ( $\mathrm{mL} /$ hour or drops/hour). Gravity feedings are placed above the level of the stomach, with the speed of administration determined by gravity. Bolus feedings are given in large volumes ( 300 to 400 mL every 4 to 6 hours). Continuous feeding is the preferred method; delivery of the feeding in small amounts over long periods reduces the incidence of aspiration, distention, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Continuous administration rates of about 100 to $150 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour ( 2400 to 3600 calories/day) are effective in inducing positive nitrogen balance and progressive weight gain without producing abdominal cramps and diarrhea. If the feeding is intermittent, 200 to 350 mL is given in 10 to 15 minutes. Enteral pumps are mechanical devices that control the delivery rate of feeding formula (Fig. 36-6). Pumps allow for a constant flow rate and can infuse a viscous formula through a small-diameter feeding tube. These pumps are relatively heavy and must be attached to an IV pole. For home use, there are portable lightweight enteral pumps available that weigh about 4 pounds and are easy to handle. An enteral pump is available with an automatic water flush system. In addition to administering the feeding formula, these pumps provide hourly water flushes that are designed to prevent clogged feeding tubes (Petnicki, 1998).

Residual gastric content is measured before each intermittent feeding and every 4 to 8 hours during continuous feedings. (This aspirated fluid is readministered to the patient.) The research findings of McClave et al. (1992) indicated that, if the amount of aspirated gastric content is greater than or equal to 200 mL for NG tubes or if residual volumes are greater than or equal to 100 mL for gastrostomy tubes, tube feeding intolerance should be considered. Tube feedings may be continued with close monitoring of gastric residual volume, radiographic studies, and the patient's physical status. If excessive residual volumes occur twice, the nurse notifies the physician.

Maintaining tube function is an ongoing responsibility of the nurse, patient, or primary caregiver. To ensure patency and to decrease the chance of bacterial growth, crusting, or occlusion of the tube, 20 to 30 mL of water is administered in each of the following instances:
- Before and after each dose of medication and each tube feeding
- After checking for gastric residuals and gastric pH
- Every 4 to 6 hours with continuous feedings
- If the tube feeding is discontinued for any reason

\section*{PROVIDING MEDICATIONS BY TUBE}

When different types of medications are administered, each type is given separately, using a bolus method that is compatible with the medication's preparation (Table 36-4). The tube is flushed with 20 to 30 mL of water after each dose. If a liquid form of a medication is not available and the medication can be crushed, it must first be reduced to a fine powder or the tube will become clogged. Devices are available (eg, Handicrush Irrigation Syringe by Nestle) that crush and dissolve tablets with water (Fig. 36-7). Medications are not mixed with each other or with the feeding formula. When small-bore feeding tubes for continuous infusion are irrigated after medication administration, a $30-\mathrm{mL}$ or larger syringe is used, because the pressure generated by smaller syringes could rupture the tube.

\section*{MAINTAINING FEEDING REGIMENS AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS}

Tube feeding formula is delivered to patients by either an open or a closed system. The open system comes in cans or as a powder and may be mixed with water. The feeding container (which is hung on a pole) and the tubing used with the open system are changed-usually every 24 to 72 hours. To avoid bacterial contamination, the amount of feeding formula in the bag should never exceed what is expected to be infused in 4 hours.

Closed delivery systems use a prefilled, sterile container that is spiked with enteral tubing. The bag holding the feeding formula for the closed system can be hung safely for 24 to 48 hours.

The tube-feeding regimen must be assessed frequently to evaluate its effectiveness and avoid complications (Chart 36-1).

\section*{MAINTAINING NORMAL BOWEL ELIMINATION PATTERN}

Patients receiving NG or nasoenteric tube feedings commonly have diarrhea (watery stools occurring three or more times in 24 hours). Pasty, unformed stool is expected with enteral therapy, because many formulas have little or no residue. The dumping syndrome also leads to diarrhea, but to confirm dumping syndrome as the cause of diarrhea other possible causes must be ruled out, among them the following:

The dumping syndrome results from rapid distention of the jejunum when hypertonic solutions are administered quickly
(over 10 to 20 minutes). Foods high in carbohydrates and electrolytes draw extracellular fluid from the vascular system into the jejunum so that dilution and absorption can occur. Measures for managing the GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea) associated with the dumping syndrome are presented in Chart 36-2.

\section*{REDUCING THE RISK OF ASPIRATION}

Aspiration pneumonia occurs when stomach contents or enteral feedings are regurgitated and aspirated, or when an NG tube is improperly positioned and feedings are instilled into the pharynx or the trachea. Nasoenteric tubes, especially those that provide for gastric and esophageal or duodenal decompression, have helped decrease the frequency of regurgitation and aspiration.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-009.jpg?height=938&width=1139&top_left_y=200&top_left_x=109}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 36-6 Nasoenteric tube feeding by continuous controlled pump.}
\end{figure}

To prevent aspiration, the nurse must establish the correct tube feeding placement before every feeding, each time medications are administered, and once every shift if the tube feeding is continuous. Feedings and medications should always be given with the patient in the proper position to prevent regurgitation. To reduce the risk of reflux and pulmonary aspiration, the semiFowler's position is necessary for an NG feeding, with the patient's head elevated at least 30 to 45 degrees. This position is maintained at least 1 hour after completion of an intermittent tube feeding and is maintained at all times for patients receiving continuous tube feedings. Another prevention strategy is to monitor residual volumes (Edwards \& Metheny, 2000).

If aspiration is suspected, the feeding is stopped immediately, the pharynx and trachea are suctioned, and the patient is placed on the right side with the head of the bed down. The physician is notified immediately.

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE HYDRATION}

The nurse carefully monitors hydration because, in many cases, the patient cannot communicate the need for water. Water (at least $2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) is given every 4 to 6 hours and after feedings to prevent hypertonic dehydration. At the beginning of administration, the feeding is diluted to at least half-strength and not more than 50 to 100 mL is given at a time, or 40 to $60 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour is given in continuous drip administration. This gradual administration helps the patient to develop tolerance, especially for hyperosmolar solutions. Key nursing interventions include observing for signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, thirst, decreased urine output); administering water routinely and as needed; and monitoring intake, output, and fluid balance (24-hour intake versus output).

\end{tabular}

\section*{PROMOTING COPING ABILITY}

The psychosocial goal of nursing care is to support and encourage the patient to accept physical changes and to convey hope that daily progressive improvement is possible. If the patient is having difficulty adjusting to the treatment, the nurse intervenes

\section*{Chart 36-1 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Measures for Assessing \\ Tube Feeding Regimens}

\footnotetext{
The following nursing measures may be implemented when assessing the effectiveness and safety of tube feeding:
1. Assess tube placement, patient's position (head of bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees), and formula flow rate.
2. Determine the patient's ability to tolerate the formula. Observe for fullness, bloating, distention, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, and stool pattern and character.
3. Check clinical responses, as noted in laboratory findings (blood urea nitrogen, serum protein, prealbumin, electrolytes, renal function, hemoglobin, hematocrit).
4. Observe for signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, thirst, decreased urine output).
5. Record the amount of formula actually taken in by the patient.
6. Report an elevated blood glucose level, decreased urinary output, sudden weight gain, and periorbital or dependent edema.
7. Replace any formula administered by an open system every 4 hours with fresh formula. Formula should be at room temperature or cool (not cold).
8. Change tube feeding container and tubing every 24 to 72 hours.
9. Assess residual volume before each feeding or, in the case of continuous feedings, every 4 hours. Return the aspirate to the stomach.
10. Monitor intake and output.
11. Weigh the patient twice weekly.
12. Consult the dietitian regularly.

\end{figure}

\section*{Preventing Symptoms of Dumping Syndrome}

The following strategies may help prevent some of the uncomfortable symptoms of dumping syndrome related to tube feeding:
- Slow the formula instillation rate to provide time for carbohydrates and electrolytes to be diluted.
- Administer feedings at room temperature, because temperature extremes stimulate peristalsis.
- Administer feeding by continuous drip (if tolerated) rather than by bolus, to prevent sudden distention of the intestine.
- Advise the patient to remain in semi-Fowler's position for 1 hour after the feeding; this position prolongs intestinal transit time by decreasing the effect of gravity.
- Instill the minimal amount of water needed to flush the tubing before and after a feeding, because fluid given with a feeding increases intestinal transit time.
by encouraging self-care (eg, recording daily weight and intake and output), within the parameters of the patient's activity level. In addition, the nurse reinforces an optimistic approach by identifying signs and symptoms that indicate progress (daily weight gain, electrolyte balance, absence of nausea and diarrhea).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients who require long-term tube feedings in the home care setting have conditions such as obstruction of the upper GI tract, malabsorption syndrome, surgery of the GI tract or of the head or neck region, or decreased level of consciousness. For a patient to be considered for tube feeding at home, the following criteria must be met: The patient must be medically stable and must have successfully completed a tube feeding trial (tolerated $70 \%$ of feeding). In addition, the patient must be capable of self-care or have a caregiver who is willing to assume the responsibility, and the patient or caregiver must have access to supplies and interest in learning how to administer tube feedings at home.

Preparation of the patient for home administration of enteral feedings begins while the patient is still hospitalized. Ideally, the nurse teaches while administering the feedings so that the patient can observe the mechanics of the procedure, participate in the procedure, ask questions, and express any concerns. Before discharge, the nurse provides information about the equipment needed, formula purchase and storage, and administration of the feedings (frequency, quantity, rate of instillation).

Family members who will be active in the patient's home care are encouraged to participate in all teaching sessions. Available printed information about the equipment, the formula, and the procedure is reviewed. The nurse encourages the patient and caregiver to learn to use the equipment with the supervision of the nurse. Arrangements are made for the caregiver to obtain the equipment and formula and have it ready for use before the patient's discharge.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral to a home care agency is important so that a nurse can arrange to be present to supervise and provide support during the first feeding at home. Further visits will depend on the skill and comfort of the patient or caregiver in administering the feedings.

During all visits, the nurse monitors the patient's physical status (weight, vital signs, activity level) and the ability of the patient and family to administer the tube feedings correctly. In addition, the nurse assesses for any complications (dumping syndrome, nausea or vomiting, weight loss, lethargy, confusion, excessive thirst). The patient or caregiver is encouraged to keep a diary to record times and amounts of feedings and any symptoms that occur. The nurse reviews the diary with the patient and caregiver during home visits.

\section*{Gastrostomy}

A gastrostomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening is created into the stomach for the purpose of administering foods and fluids. In some instances, a gastrostomy is preferred for prolonged nutrition (greater then 3 to 4 weeks)-for example, in the elderly or debilitated patient. Gastrostomy is also preferred over NG feedings in the comatose patient because the gastroesophageal sphincter remains intact. Regurgitation and aspiration are less likely to occur with a gastrostomy than with NG feedings.

Different types of feeding gastrostomies may be used, including the Stamm (temporary and permanent), Janeway (permanent), and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (temporary) systems. The Stamm and Janeway gastrostomies require either an upper abdominal midline incision or a left upper quadrant transverse incision. The Stamm procedure requires the use of concentric purse-string sutures to secure the tube to the anterior gastric wall. To create the gastrostomy, an exit wound is created in the left upper abdomen. The Janeway procedure necessitates the creation of a tunnel (called a gastric tube) that is brought out through the abdomen to form a permanent stoma.

A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a procedure that requires the services of two physicians (or a physician and a nurse with specialty skills). After administering a local anesthetic, one physician inserts a cannula into the stomach through an abdominal incision and then threads a nonabsorbable suture through the cannula; the second physician looks through an endoscope that has been passed into the upper GI tract and uses the endoscopic snare to grasp the end of the suture and guide it up through the patient's mouth. The suture is knotted to the dilator tip at the end of the PEG tube. The endoscopist then advances the dilator tip through the patient's mouth while the first physician pulls the suture through the cannula site. The attached PEG tube is guided down the esophagus, into the stomach, and out through the abdominal incision (Fig. 36-8A). The mushroom catheter tip and internal crossbar secure the tube against the stomach wall. An external crossbar or bumper keeps the catheter

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-011.jpg?height=664&width=1769&top_left_y=1866&top_left_x=104}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 36-8 (A) A detail of the abdomen and the PEG tube, showing catheter fixation. (B) A detail of the abdomen and the nonobturated LPGD, showing balloon fixation.}
\end{figure}
in place. A tubing adaptor is in place between feedings, and a clamp or plug is used to close or open the tubing. If an endoscope is unable to pass through the esophagus, then the gastrostomy can be performed under x-ray guidance through the abdominal wall. This procedure is known as fluoroscopically guided percutaneous gastrostomy, or FGPG (Johnson, 1997).

The initial PEG device can be removed and replaced once the tract is well established ( 10 to 14 days after insertion). Replacement of the PEG device is indicated to provide long-term nutritional support, to replace a clotted or migrated tube, or to enhance patient comfort. The PEG replacement device should be fitted securely to the stoma to prevent leakage of gastric acid and is maintained in place through traction between the internal and anchoring devices.

An alternative to the PEG device is a low-profile gastrostomy device (LPGD) (see Fig. 36-8B). The LPGD may be inserted 3 to 6 months after initial gastrostomy tube placement. These devices are inserted flush with the skin; they eliminate the possibility of tube migration and obstruction and have antireflux valves to prevent gastric reflux. Two types of devices may be usedobturated or nonobturated. The obturated devices (G-button) have a dome tip that acts as an internal stabilizer. A major drawback is the need for a physician to obturate (insert a tube that is larger than the actual stoma). The nonobturated device (MIC-KEY) has an external skin disk and is inserted into the stoma without force; a balloon is inflated to secure placement. A nurse in the home setting can insert these devices easily. The drawbacks of both types of LPGDs are the inability to check residual volumes (one-way valve) and the need for a special adaptor to connect the device to the feeding container.

Patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux are at risk for aspiration pneumonia and therefore are not candidates for a gastrostomy. A jejunostomy is preferred, or jejunal feeding through a nasojejunal tube may be recommended.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A GASTROSTOMY}

\section*{Assessment}

The focus of the preoperative assessment is to determine the patient's ability both to understand and to cope with the impending surgical experience. The nurse evaluates the patient's ability to adjust to a change in body image and to participate in self-care, along with the patient's and the family's psychological status.

The purpose of the operative procedure is explained so that the patient will have a better understanding of the expected postoperative course. The patient needs to know that the result of this surgery is to bypass the mouth and esophagus so that liquid feedings can be administered directly into the stomach by means of a rubber or plastic tube or a prosthesis. If the prosthesis is to be permanent, the patient should be made aware of this. Psychologically, this is often difficult for the patient to accept. If the procedure is being performed to relieve discomfort, prolonged vomiting, debilitation, or an inability to eat, the patient may find it more acceptable.

The nurse evaluates the patient's skin condition and determines whether a delay in healing may be anticipated because of a systemic disorder (eg, diabetes mellitus, cancer).

In the postoperative period, the patient's fluid and nutritional needs are assessed to ensure proper intake of food and fluids. The nurse inspects the tube for proper maintenance and the incision for signs of infection. At the same time, the nurse evaluates the
patient's response to the change in body image and the patient's understanding of the feeding methods. Interventions are identified to help the patient cope with the tube and learn self-care measures.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses in the postoperative period may include the following:
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to enteral feeding problems
- Risk for infection related to presence of wound and tube
- Risk for impaired skin integrity at tube site
- Ineffective coping related to inability to eat normally
- Disturbed body image related to presence of tube
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management related to knowledge deficit about home care and the feeding procedure

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Wound infection, cellulitis, and abdominal wall abscess
- GI bleeding
- Premature removal of the tube

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include attaining an optimal level of nutrition, preventing infection, maintaining skin integrity, enhancing coping, adjusting to changes in body image, acquiring knowledge of and skill in self-care, and preventing complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MEETING NUTRITIONAL NEEDS}

The first fluid nourishment is administered soon after surgery and usually consists of tap water and $10 \%$ glucose. At first, only 30 to 60 mL ( 1 to 2 oz ) is given at one time, but the amount is increased gradually. By the second day, 180 to 240 mL ( 6 to 8 oz ) may be given at one time, provided it is tolerated and no leakage of fluid occurs around the tube. Water and milk can be instilled after 24 hours for a permanent gastrostomy. High-calorie liquids are added gradually. In some settings, during the early postoperative period the nurse aspirates gastric secretions and reinstills them after adding enough feeding solution to bring the volume to the desired total. By this method, gastric dilation is avoided.

Blenderized foods are added gradually to clear liquids until a full diet is achieved. Powdered feedings that are easily liquefied are commercially available. The patient who receives blenderized tube feedings typically is not forced to give up usual dietary patterns, which may prove to be psychologically more acceptable. In addition, near-normal bowel function is promoted because the fiber and residue are similar to that of a normal diet. Intake of milk is avoided in patients with lactase deficiency.

\section*{PROVIDING TUBE CARE AND PREVENTING INFECTION}

A small dressing can be applied over the tube outlet, and the gastrostomy tube can be held in place by a thin strip of adhesive tape that is first placed around the tube and then firmly attached to
the abdomen. The dressing protects the skin around the incision from seepage of gastric acid and spillage of feedings.

The nurse verifies the tube's placement, assesses residuals, and rotates the tube or stabilizing disk once daily to prevent skin breakdown. Some gastrostomy tubes have balloons that are inflated with water to anchor the tube in the stomach. The adequacy of balloon inflation is checked weekly by deflating the balloon using a Luer-tip syringe.

\section*{PROVIDING SKIN CARE}

The skin surrounding a gastrostomy requires special care because it may become irritated from the enzymatic action of gastric juices that leak around the tube. Left untreated, the skin becomes macerated, red, raw, and painful. The nurse washes the area around the tube with soap and water daily, removes any encrustation with saline solution, rinses the area well with water, and pats it dry. Once the stoma heals and drainage ceases, a dressing is not required. A long-term gastrostomy may require a special dressing or stabilization device to protect the skin around the tube from gastric secretions and to help secure the tube in place (Fig. 36-9).

Skin at the exit site is evaluated daily for signs of breakdown, irritation, excoriation, and the presence of drainage or gastric leakage. The nurse encourages the patient and family members to participate in this inspection and in hygiene activities. If skin problems do occur, an enterostomal therapist or wound care specialist can be of assistance.

\section*{ENHANCING BODY IMAGE}

The patient with a gastrostomy has experienced a major assault to body image. Eating, a physiologic and social function, can no longer be taken for granted. The patient is also aware that gastrostomy as a therapeutic intervention is performed only in the presence of a major, chronic, or perhaps terminal illness.

Calm discussion of the purposes and routines of gastrostomy feeding can help keep the patient from feeling overwhelmed. Talking with a person who has had a gastrostomy can also help the patient to accept the expected changes. Adjusting to a change in body image takes time and requires family support and acceptance. Evaluating the existing family support system is necessary. One family member may emerge as the primary support person.

Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}
\end{figure}

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

During the postoperative course, the nurse monitors the patient for potential complications. The most common complications are wound infection and other wound problems, including cellulitis at the wound site and abscesses in the abdominal wall. Because many patients who receive tube feedings are debilitated and have compromised nutritional status, any signs of infections are promptly reported to the physician so that appropriate antibiotic therapy can be instituted.

Bleeding from the insertion site in the stomach may also occur. The nurse closely monitors the patient's vital signs and observes all drainage from the operative site, vomitus, and stool for evidence of bleeding. Any signs of bleeding are reported promptly.

Premature removal of the tube, whether it is done inadvertently by the patient or by the caregiver, is another complication. If the tube is removed prematurely, the skin is cleansed and a sterile dressing is applied; the nurse immediately notifies the physician. The tract will close within 4 to 6 hours if the tube is not replaced promptly.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient who is to receive gastrostomy tube feedings in the home setting must be capable of, and responsible for, administering the tube feedings or have a caregiver who is able to do so. There must also be the physical, financial, and social resources to maintain care.

The nurse assesses the patient's level of knowledge, interest in learning about the tube feeding, and ability to understand and apply the information before providing detailed instructions about how to prepare the formula and manage the tube feeding. Written materials for patients and caregivers are designed to outline the care instructions. To facilitate self-care, the nurse encourages the patient to participate in the tube feedings during hospitalization and to establish as normal a routine as possible.

Demonstration of the tube feeding begins by showing the patient how to check for residual gastric contents before the feeding. The patient then learns how to check and maintain the patency of the tube by administering room-temperature water before and after the feeding. This will establish patency before the feeding and then clear the tube of food particles, which could decompose if allowed to remain in the tube. All feedings are given at room temperature or near body temperature.

For a bolus feeding, the nurse shows the patient how to introduce the liquid into the catheter by using a funnel or the barrel of a syringe. The receptacle is tilted to allow air to escape while the liquid is being instilled initially. As the funnel or syringe fills with liquid, the feeding is allowed to flow into the stomach by gravity by holding the barrel or syringe perpendicular to the abdomen (Fig. 36-10). Raising or lowering the receptacle to no higher than 45 cm ( 18 in ) above the abdominal wall regulates the rate of flow.

A bolus feeding of 300 to 500 mL usually is given for each meal and requires 10 to 15 minutes to complete. The amount is often determined by the patient's reaction. If the patient feels full, it may be desirable to give smaller amounts more frequently.

The patient and caregiver must understand that keeping the head of the bed elevated for at least 1 hour after feeding facilitates digestion and decreases the risk for aspiration. Any obstruction requires that the feeding be stopped and the physician notified.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-014.jpg?height=712&width=859&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=211}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 36-10 Bolus gastrostomy feeding by gravity. (A) Feeding is instilled at an angle so that air does not enter the stomach. (B) Syringe is raised perpendicular to the abdomen so that feeding can enter by gravity.}
\end{figure}

The patient or caregiver is instructed to flush the tube with 30 mL of water after each bolus or medication administration, and otherwise to flush the tube daily to keep it patent. Adaptors are available that can be secured to the end of the tube to create a "Y" site for ease of flushing or medication delivery. The flushing equipment is cleaned with warm, soapy water and rinsed after each use.

The patient and caregiver are made aware that the tube is marked at skin level to provide the patient a baseline for later comparison. They are advised to monitor the tube's length and to notify the physician or home care nurse if the segment of the tube outside the body becomes shorter or longer.

If the patient is to use an intermittent or continuous-pressure feeding pump at home, instruction in the use of the particular type of pump is essential. Most feeding pumps have built-in alarms that signal when the bag is empty, when the battery is low, or when an occlusion is present. The patient and caregiver need to be aware of these alarms and how to troubleshoot the pump.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral to a home care agency is important to ensure initial supervision and support for the patient and caregiver. The home care nurse assesses the patient's status and progress and evaluates the techniques that are used in administering the tube feeding. Further instruction and supervision in the home setting may be required to help the patient and caregiver adapt to a physical environment and equipment that are different from the hospital setting. The nurse also reviews with the patient and caregiver information about complications to report (eg, dumping syndrome, nausea and vomiting, infection of the skin at the insertion site of the tube).

The home care nurse assists the patient and family in establishing as normal a routine as possible. Some patients will want to experience a sensation of normal eating and are advised that they can try smelling, tasting, and chewing small amounts of food before taking their tube feedings. This stimulates the flow of salivary and gastric secretions and may give some sensation of a normal meal. The chewed food can then be deposited by the patient into a funnel or syringe attached to the gastrostomy tube for ad-
ministration into the stomach. The patient or caregiver is encouraged to keep a diary to record the times and amounts of feedings and any symptoms that occur. The nurse reviews the diary during home visits. When the tube is to be replaced, the patient or caregiver must be taught how to do this.

\section*{Parenteral Nutrition}

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a method of providing nutrients to the body by an IV route. It is a very complex admixture of individual chemicals combined in a single container. The components of a PN admixture are proteins, carbohydrates, fats, electrolytes, vitamins, trace minerals, and sterile water. The goals of PN are to improve nutritional status, establish a positive nitrogen balance, maintain muscle mass, promote weight gain, and enhance the healing process.

\section*{ESTABLISHING POSITIVE NITROGEN BALANCE}

When a patient's intake of protein and nutrients is significantly less than that required by the body to meet energy expenditures, a state of negative nitrogen balance results. In response, the body begins to convert the protein found in muscles into carbohydrates to be used to meet energy needs. The result is muscle wasting, weight loss, fatigue, and, if left uncorrected, death.

The average postoperative adult patient requires approximately 1500 calories per day to keep the body from using its own store of
protein. Traditional IV fluids do not provide sufficient calories or nitrogen to meet the body's daily requirements. PN solutions, which supply nutrients such as dextrose, amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, and fat emulsions, provide enough calories and nitrogen to meet the patient's daily nutritional needs. In general, PN can provide 30 to $35 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight and 1.0 to 1.5 g of protein/kg of body weight (Rombeau \& Rolandelli, 2000).

The patient with fever, trauma, burns, major surgery, or hypermetabolic disease may require up to 10,000 additional calories daily. The volume of fluid necessary to provide these calories would surpass fluid tolerance and lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure. To provide the required calories in small volume, it is necessary to increase the concentration of nutrients and use a route of administration (ie, a large, high-flow vein [subclavian vein]) that will rapidly dilute incoming nutrients to the proper levels of body tolerance.

When highly concentrated glucose is administered, caloric requirements are satisfied and the body uses amino acids for protein synthesis rather than for energy. Additional potassium is added to the solution to maintain proper electrolyte balance and to transport glucose and amino acids across cell membranes. To prevent deficiencies and fulfill requirements for tissue synthesis, other elements, such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sodium chloride, are added (Rombeau \& Rolandelli, 2000).

\section*{CLINICAL INDICATIONS}

The indications for PN include a $10 \%$ deficit in body weight (compared with preillness weight), an inability to take oral food or fluids within 7 days after surgery, and hypercatabolic situations such as major infection with fever. In both the home and hospital setting, PN is indicated in the following situations:
- The patient's intake is insufficient to maintain an anabolic state (eg, severe burns, malnutrition, short bowel syndrome, AIDS, sepsis, cancer).
- The patient's ability to ingest food orally or by tube is impaired (eg, paralytic ileus, Crohn's disease with obstruction, postradiation enteritis, severe hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy).
- The patient is not interested in or is unwilling to ingest adequate nutrients (eg, anorexia nervosa, postoperative elderly patients).
- The underlying medical condition precludes being fed orally or by tube (eg, acute pancreatitis, high enterocutaneous fistula).
- Preoperative and postoperative nutritional needs are prolonged (eg, extensive bowel surgery).

\section*{FORMULAS}

A total of 2 to 3 L of solution is administered over a 24 -hour period using a filter (1.2-micron particulate filter). Before administration, the PN infusion must be inspected for clarity and any precipitate. The label is compared with the physician's order, noting the expiration date. Fat emulsions (Intralipid) may be infused simultaneously with PN through a Y-connector close to the infusion site. Fat emulsions should not be filtered. Before administration, the fat emulsion solution is inspected for frothiness, separation, or oily appearance. Usually 500 mL of a $10 \%$ emulsion is administered over 4 to 6 hours, one to three times a week. Fat emulsions can provide up to $30 \%$ of the total daily calorie intake.

Lipid emulsions can be admixed with other components of PN to create a total nutrient admixture (TNA). TNA is commonly called a "three-in-one" formulation. All the parenteral nutrient components are mixed in one container and administered to the patient over a 24 -hour period. A special final filter ( 1.5 micron filter) is used with this solution. Before administration, the solution is observed for oil droplets that have separated from the solution, forming a noticeable layer (cracking of lipid emulsion); such a solution should be discarded. Advantages of the TNA over PN are cost savings in preparation and equipment, decreased risk of contamination, decreased risk of catheter contamination, decreased pharmacy preparation time, less nursing time, and increased patient convenience and satisfaction. Ideally, the pharmacist, nutritionist, and physician collaborate to determine the specific formula needed.

\section*{INITIATING THERAPY}

PN solutions are initiated slowly and advanced gradually each day to the desired rate, as the patient's fluid and glucose tolerance permits. The patient's laboratory test results and response to PN therapy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the nutritional support team. Standing orders are initiated for weighing the patient; monitoring intake, output, and blood glucose; and baseline and periodic monitoring of complete blood count, platelet count, and chemistry panel, including serum carbon dioxide, magnesium, phosphorus, triglycerides, and prealbumin. A 24-hour urine nitrogen determination may be performed for analysis of nitrogen balance. In most hospitals, the physician prescribes PN solutions on a daily standard PN order form. The formulation of the PN solutions is calculated carefully each day to meet the complete nutritional needs of the individual patient.

\section*{ADMINISTRATION METHODS}

Various vascular access devices are used to administer PN solutions in clinical practice. PN may be administered by either peripheral or central IV lines, depending on the patient's condition and the anticipated length of therapy.

\section*{Peripheral Method}

To supplement oral intake when complete bowel rest is not indicated and NG or nasoenteric suction is not required, a peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) formula may be prescribed. PPN is administered through a peripheral vein; this is possible because the solution is less hypertonic than PN solution. PPN formulas are not nutritionally complete. Protein and dextrose are limited. Dextrose concentrations of more than $10 \%$ should not be administered through peripheral veins because they irritate the intima (innermost walls) of small veins, causing chemical phlebitis. Lipids are administered simultaneously to buffer the PPN and to protect the peripheral vein from irritation. The usual length of therapy using PPN is 5 to 7 days (Hamilton, 2000).

\section*{Central Method}

Because PN solutions have five or six times the solute concentration of blood (and exert an osmotic pressure of about $2000 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ), they are injurious to the intima of peripheral veins. Therefore, to prevent phlebitis and other venous complications, these solutions are administered into the vascular system through a catheter inserted into a high-flow, large blood vessel (the
subclavian vein). Concentrated solutions are then very rapidly diluted to isotonic levels by the blood in this vessel.

Four types of central venous access devices (CVAD) are available-nontunneled (or percutaneous) central catheters, peripherally inserted central catheters, tunneled catheters, and implanted ports. Whenever one of these catheters is inserted, catheter tip placement should be confirmed by x-ray studies before PN therapy is initiated. The optimal position is the midproximal third of the superior vena cava.

\section*{NONTUNNELED CENTRAL CATHETERS}

Nontunneled central catheters are used for short-term (less than 30 days) IV therapy in the acute care, long-term care, and home care settings. The physician inserts these catheters. Examples of nontunneled central catheters are Vas Cath, Percutaneous Subclavian, and Hohn catheters. The subclavian vein is the most common vessel used, because the subclavian area provides a stable insertion site to which the catheter can be anchored, allows the patient freedom of movement, and provides easy access to the dressing site. The jugular or femoral vein also may be used. Single-, double-, and triple-lumen central catheters are available for central lines. To ensure accessibility, a triple-lumen subclavian catheter should be used, because it offers three ports for various uses (Fig. 36-11). The 16gauge distal lumen can be used to infuse blood or other viscous fluids. The 18-gauge middle lumen is reserved for PN infusion. The 18-gauge proximal port can be used for administration of blood or medications. A port not being used for fluid administration can be used for obtaining blood specimens if indicated.

If a single-lumen central catheter is used for administering PN, various restrictions apply. Blood cannot be drawn from the catheter and medications cannot be administered through it, because the medication may be incompatible with the components of the nutritional solution (insulin is an exception). If medications must be given, they must be infused through a separate peripheral IV line,
not by piggyback into the PN line. Transfusions of blood products also cannot be given through the main line, because red cells may possibly coat the lumen of the catheter, thereby reducing the flow of the nutritional solution.

\section*{PERIPHERALLY INSERTED CENTRAL CATHETERS}

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are used for intermediate-term ( 3 to 12 months) IV therapy in the hospital, long-term care, or home setting. These catheters may be inserted at the bedside or in the outpatient setting by a specially trained nurse. The basilic or cephalic vein is accessed through the antecubital space, and the catheter is threaded to a designated location, depending on the type of solution to be infused (superior vena cava for PN ). Taking of blood pressure and blood specimens from the extremity with the PICC is avoided (see Chapter 14).

\section*{TUNNELED CENTRAL CATHETERS}

Tunneled central catheters are for long-term use and may remain in place for many years. These catheters are cuffed and can have single or double lumens; examples are the Hickman, Goshong, and Permacath. These catheters are inserted surgically. They are threaded under the skin (reducing the risk of ascending infection) to the subclavian vein, and the distal end of the catheter is advanced into the superior vena cava 2 to 3 cm above the junction with the right atrium (see Chapter 16).

\section*{IMPLANTED PORTS}

Implanted ports are also used for long-term home IV therapy; examples include the Port-A-Cath, Mediport, Hickman Port, and P.A.S. Port. Instead of exiting from the skin, as do the Hickman and Groshong catheters, the end of the catheter is attached to a small chamber that is placed in a subcutaneous pocket, either on the anterior chest wall or on the forearm. The subcutaneous port requires minimal care and allows the patient complete freedom

\begin{figure}

of activity. Implanted ports are more expensive than the external catheters, and access requires passing a special needle (Hubertipped) through the skin into the chamber to initiate IV therapy (see Chapter 16). Taking of blood pressure and blood specimens from the extremity with the port system is avoided.

\section*{NONTUNNELED CENTRAL CATHETER INSERTION}

The procedure is explained so that the patient understands the importance of not touching the catheter insertion site and is aware of what to expect during the insertion procedure. To insert the catheter, the patient is placed supine, in head-low position (to produce dilation of neck and shoulder vessels, which makes entry easier and prevents air embolus). The area is shaved if necessary, and the skin is prepared with acetone and alcohol to remove surface oils. Final skin preparation includes cleaning with tincture of $2 \%$ iodine or chlorhexidine. To afford maximal accuracy in the placement of the catheter, the patient is instructed to turn the head away from the site of venipuncture and to remain motionless while the catheter is inserted and the wound is dressed.

The preferred insertion route is the subclavian vein, which leads into the superior vena cava. The external jugular route can be used, but usually only in emergency situations. Because a nontunneled central catheter is always a potential source of serious infection, the site should be changed every 4 weeks or as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Sterile drapes are applied to the upper chest. The patient may be asked to wear a facemask to prevent the spread of microorganisms. Procaine or lidocaine is injected to anesthetize the skin and underlying tissues. The target area is the inferior border at the midpoint of the clavicle. A large-bore needle on a syringe is inserted and moved parallel to and beneath the clavicle until it enters the vein. The syringe is then detached and a radiopaque catheter is inserted through the needle into the vein.

When the catheter is positioned, the needle is withdrawn and the hub of the catheter is attached to the IV tubing. Until the syringe is detached from the needle and the catheter is inserted, the patient may be asked to perform the Valsalva maneuver. (To do this, the patient is instructed to take a deep breath, hold it, and bear down with mouth closed. Compression of the abdomen may also accomplish the maneuver.) The Valsalva maneuver is performed to produce a positive phase in central venous pressure, to lessen the possibility of air being drawn into the circulatory system (air embolism). The physician sutures the catheter to the skin to avoid inadvertent removal.

The catheter insertion site is swabbed with either tincture of $2 \%$ iodine or a chlorhexidine solution. A gauze or transparent dressing is applied using strict sterile technique. An isotonic IV solution, such as dextrose $5 \%$ in water ( $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$ ), is administered to keep the vein patent.

The position of the tip of the catheter is checked with fluoroscopy to confirm its location in the superior vena cava and to rule out a pneumothorax resulting from puncture of the pleura. Once the catheter position is confirmed, the prescribed PN solution is started. The initial rate of infusion is usually 50 $\mathrm{mL} /$ hour , and the rate is gradually increased to the maintenance rate or predetermined dose (eg, 100 to $125 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour ). An infusion pump is always used for administration of PN or PPN.

An injection site cap is attached to the end of each central catheter lumen, creating a closed system. IV infusion tubing is connected to the insertion site cap of the central catheter with a threaded needleless adapter or Luer-lock device. Each lumen is labeled according to location (proximal, middle, distal). To ensure patency, all lumens are flushed with a diluted heparin flush ini-
tially, daily when not in use, after each intermittent infusion, after blood drawing, and whenever an infusion is disconnected. Force is never used to flush the catheter. If resistance is met, aspiration may be effective in cleansing the lumen; if this is not effective, the physician is notified. Low-dose t-PA (alteplase) may be prescribed to dissolve a clot or fibrin sheath. If attempts to clear the lumen are ineffective, the lumen is labeled as "clotted off."

\section*{DISCONTINUING PARENTERAL NUTRITION}

The PN solution is discontinued gradually to allow the patient to adjust to decreased levels of glucose. After administration of the PN solution is terminated, isotonic glucose is administered for several hours to protect against rebound hypoglycemia. Providing oral carbohydrates will shorten the tapering time. Specific symptoms of rebound hypoglycemia include weakness, faintness, sweating, shakiness, feeling cold, confusion, and increased heart rate. Once all IV therapy is completed, the nurse (with a physician's order) removes the nontunneled central venous catheter or PICC and applies an occlusive dressing to the exit site. Tunneled catheters and implanted ports are removed by the physician.

In cases of serious illness when death is imminent, some patients or families may request that PN be discontinued. This difficult issue poses many ethical questions, some of which are discussed in Chart 36-3.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT RECEIVING PARENTERAL NUTRITION}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse assists in identifying patients who may be candidates for PN. Indicators include any significant weight loss ( $10 \%$ or more of usual weight), a decrease in oral food intake for more than 1 week, any significant sign of protein loss (serum albumin levels less than $3.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ [ $32 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ], muscle wasting, decreased tissue healing, or abnormal urea nitrogen excretion), and persistent vomiting and diarrhea. The nurse carefully monitors the patient's hydration, electrolyte levels, and calorie intake.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inadequate oral intake of nutrients
- Risk for infection related to contamination of the central catheter site or infusion line
- Risk for excess or deficient fluid volume related to altered infusion rate
- Risk for immobility related to fear that the catheter will become dislodged or occluded
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management related to knowledge deficit about home PN therapy

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The most common complications are pneumothorax, air embolism, a clotted or displaced catheter, sepsis, hyperglycemia, rebound hypoglycemia, and fluid overload. These problems

\section*{Chart 36-3 - Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{Is It Ethical to Withhold or Withdraw Nutrition and Hydration?}

\section*{Situation}

It is generally agreed that patients (or their designated decision makers) can refuse life-saving treatment, particularly if the means of treatment are extraordinary (eg, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal oxygenators). Extraordinary means include medications, treatments, and procedures that can be obtained only at excessive cost, pain, or inconvenience and offer no reasonable hope of benefit. Nutrition and hydration therapy, however, are perceived as ordinary means by many.

Ordinary means are those medications, treatments, and procedures that offer a reasonable hope of benefit and can be obtained without excessive expense, pain, or inconvenience. Additionally, withdrawing or withholding nutrition and hydration can in and of itself cause death. Thus, some have argued that nutrition and hydration should always be provided to every patient, regardless of the patient's preference or condition.

\section*{Dilemma}

The patient's desire to have nutrition or hydration withdrawn or withheld may conflict with the reluctance of others to harm the patient by withdrawing the food and water needed for survival (autonomy versus nonmaleficence).

\section*{Discussion}
- What arguments would you offer against the withholding and withdrawing of nutrition and hydration?
- What arguments would you offer in favor of withholding and withdrawing of nutrition and hydration?
- Are foods and fluids always "ordinary means," or are there instances in which they might be considered "extraordinary"? Support your answer.
Answer the above questions using as an example a patient in a persistent vegetative state (ie, unable to express his or her wishes).
and the associated collaborative interventions are described in Table 36-5.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include optimal level of nutrition, absence of infection, adequate fluid volume, optimal level of activity (within individual limitations), knowledge of and skill in self-care, and prevention of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING OPTIMAL NUTRITION}

A continuous, uniform infusion of PN solution over a 24 -hour period is desired. In some cases, however (eg, home care patients), cyclic PN may be appropriate. With cyclic PN, there is a set time during a 24-hour period when PN is infused and a set time when it is not. The time periods for infusion are sufficient to meet the patient's nutritional and pharmacologic needs. Ideally, cyclic PN is infused over an 8 - to 10 -hour period during the night.

The patient is weighed daily (this may be decreased to two or three times per week), at the same time of the day under the same conditions for accurate comparison. Under the PN regimen (without additional energy expenditure), a satisfactory weight
gain is usually achieved. It is important to keep accurate intake and output records and calculations of fluid balance. A calorie count is kept of any oral nutrients. Trace elements (copper, zinc, chromium, manganese, and selenium) are included in PN solutions and are individualized for each patient. The PN solutions are prescribed daily by the physician on a standard PN order form based on laboratory values and patient tolerance.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

The high glucose content of PN solutions makes these solutions ideal culture media for bacterial and fungal growth, and CVADs provide a port of entry. Candida albicans is the most common infectious organism. Other infectious organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Meticulous technique is essential to prevent infection.

The primary sources of microorganisms for catheter-related infections are the skin and the catheter hub. The catheter site is covered with an occlusive gauze dressing that is usually changed every other day. Alternatively, a transparent dressing may be used and changed weekly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends changing dressings for CVADs only if they are damp, bloody, loose, or soiled. The dressings are changed using sterile technique. The nurse and patient wear masks during dressing changes to reduce the possibility of airborne contamination. The area is checked for leakage, bloody drainage, a kinked catheter, and skin reactions such as inflammation, redness, swelling, tenderness, or purulent drainage. The nurse puts on sterile gloves and cleanses the area with tincture of $2 \%$ iodine or a chlorhexidine solution on a sterile gauze. The site is cleaned thoroughly using circular motion from the site outward approximately 3 inches. This is repeated two times. This is followed with the same cleaning procedure using $2 \times 2$-inch gauze pads moistened with sterile water or saline solution (alcohol is used to remove iodine). Next the catheter lumens are cleaned from the exit site to the distal end with an alcohol wipe. The insertion site is covered with an occlusive gauze pad or transparent dressing centered over the area.

The advantages of using a transparent dressing over the gauze pad are that it allows frequent examination of the catheter site without changing the dressing, it adheres well, and it is more comfortable for the patient. When an extension set is used with a central catheter, it is considered an extension of the catheter itself. It is not routinely changed with dressing or tubing changes. The connection (hub) between the catheter and extension tubing is secured with adhesive tape to prevent separation and exposure to air. Main-line IV tubing and filters are changed every 72 to 96 hours, and all connections are taped securely to avoid breaks in the integrity of the system. The dressing and tubing are labeled with the date, time of insertion, time of dressing change, and initials of the person who carried out the procedure; this information is also documented in the medical record.

The catheter is another major source of colonization and infection. Antiseptic-impregnated central venous catheters are new devices that reduce catheter colonization by coating of the catheter surfaces with antimicrobial agents. Two types are available, one coated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine and the other with minocycline/rifampin (Hanna et al., 2001).

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID BALANCE}

An infusion pump is necessary for PN to maintain an accurate rate of administration. A designated rate is set in milliliters per hour, and the rate checked every 30 to 60 minutes. An alarm signals a problem. The infusion rate should not be increased or decreased

to compensate for fluids that have infused too quickly or too slowly. If the solution runs out, $10 \%$ dextrose and water is infused until the next PN solution is available from the pharmacy.

If the rate is too rapid, hyperosmolar diuresis occurs (excess sugar will be excreted), which, if severe enough, can cause intractable seizures, coma, and death. Symptoms of rapid hypertonic fluid intake include headache, nausea, fever, chills, and increasing lethargy.

If the flow rate is too slow, the patient does not get the maximal benefit of calories and nitrogen. Intake and output are recorded every 8 hours so that fluid imbalance can be readily detected. The patient is weighed two or three times a week; in ideal situations, the patient will show neither weight loss nor significant weight gain. The nurse assesses for signs of dehydration (eg, thirst, decreased skin turgor, decreased central venous pressure) and reports these findings to the physician immediately. It is es-
sential to monitor blood glucose levels, because hyperglycemia can cause diuresis and excessive fluid loss.

\section*{ENCOURAGING ACTIVITY}

Activities and ambulation are encouraged when the patient is physically capable. With a catheter in the subclavian vein, the patient is free to move the extremities and should be encouraged to maintain good muscle tone. If applicable, the teaching and exercise program initiated in the occupational and physical therapy departments should be reinforced.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Successful home PN requires teaching the patient and family specialized skills using an intensive training program and follow-up

\section*{Chart 36-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION}

Teaching Patients About Home Parenteral Nutrition

An effective home care teaching program prepares the patient to manage the appropriate form of PN: how to store solutions, set up the infusion, flush the line with heparin, change the dressings, and troubleshoot for problems. The most common complication is sepsis. Strict aseptic technique is taught for hand hygiene, handling equipment, changing the dressing, and preparing the solution.

\section*{Troubleshooting Mechanical Difficulties}

Mechanical problems usually arise from technical complications in the infusion pump or catheter site. The patient needs to know how to measure the length of the external portion of the catheter; this measurement is used as a comparison if the line is pulled or if dislodgement is suspected. The patient also needs to know how to recognize catheter problems (eg, leakage, loose cap, blood clot, dislodgement) and should receive a list of instructions explaining what to do for each problem.

\section*{Recognizing Metabolic Complications}

The patient is given a list of symptoms that indicate metabolic complications (neuropathies, mentation changes, diarrhea, nausea, skin
changes, decreased urine output) and directions on how to contact the home health care nurse or physician if any of these complications occurs. The patient is instructed to have weekly serum chemistry and hematology tests as well.

\section*{Obtaining Psychosocial Support}

The psychosocial aspects of home PN are as important as the physiologic and technical concerns. Patients must cope with the loss of eating and with changes in lifestyle brought on by sleep disturbances (frequent urination during infusions, usually two or three times during the night).

Major psychosocial reactions include depression, anger, withdrawal, anxiety, and impaired self-image. A successful home parenteral nutrition program depends on the patient's and family's motivation, emotional stability, and technical competence. Patients and families need to know which support groups are available in the community to help them cope with the transition and to minimize disruption of lifestyle.
supervision in the home. This is accomplished through a team effort. The financial costs of such programs, although high, are less than those incurred in a hospital. Initiation of a home program may be the only way the patient can be discharged from the hospital.

Ideal candidates for home PN are those patients who have a reasonable life expectancy after return home, have only a limited number of medical illnesses other than the one that has resulted in the need for PN, and are highly motivated and fairly selfsufficient. In addition, ability to learn, availability of family interest and support, adequate finances, and the physical plan of the home are factors that must be assessed when the decision for home PN is made.

Home health care agencies sponsoring home PN programs have developed teaching brochures for every aspect of the treatment, including catheter and dressing care, use of an infusion pump, administration of fat emulsions, and instillation of heparin flushes. Teaching begins in the hospital and continues in the home or in an ambulatory infusion center.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The home care nurse should be aware that the average patient needs about 2 weeks of instruction and reinforcement. For more information about home patient education, see Charts 36-4 and 36-5.

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are caring for a patient with an NG feeding tube. Before administering the patient's tube feeding, you explain to the patient that you will be checking to make sure the tube is placed correctly. The patient responds that she is accustomed to this and that the other nurses "check the tube by placing the end of it in a cup of water;" the patient also states that the nurses then "put air in the tube and use a stethoscope to listen for bubbles in my stomach." How would you respond to the patient? What research findings guide your actions in confirming the placement of the tube? What follow-up actions would you take to ensure that there is consistency among the nursing staff in the procedure used for confirmation of tube placement?
2. A patient who is receiving gastrostomy tube feedings is to be discharged from the hospital to return home within the next few days. Several family members are to be taught how to administer the tube feedings. What are the learning priorities that should be accomplished before the patient is discharged? What assessment parameters should be used to determine whether the family has the necessary resources for providing care for the patient at home?
3. A patient who had major abdominal surgery 1 week ago and who has developed a paralytic ileus is to begin receiving PN. What explanation would you give to this patient about the benefits of PN and the procedure for its administration? How would you alter your plan of care to include assessment for complications of PN? What assessment would you conduct to determine whether the patient is a candidate for home PN therapy?

$A_{n}$n individual's nutritional status depends not only on the type and amount of intake but also on the functioning of the gastric and intestinal portions of the gastrointestinal (GI) system. This chapter describes disorders of the stomach and duodenum and their treatment.

\section*{Castritis}

Gastritis (inflammation of the gastric or stomach mucosa) is a common GI problem. Gastritis may be acute, lasting several hours to a few days, or chronic, resulting from repeated exposure to irritating agents or recurring episodes of acute gastritis.

Acute gastritis is often caused by dietary indiscretion-the person eats food that is contaminated with disease-causing microorganisms or that is irritating or too highly seasoned. Other causes of acute gastritis include overuse of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), excessive alcohol intake, bile reflux, and radiation therapy. A more severe form of acute gastritis is caused by the ingestion of strong acid or alkali, which may cause the mucosa to become gangrenous or to perforate. Scarring can occur, resulting in pyloric obstruction. Gastritis also may be the first sign of an acute systemic infection.

Chronic gastritis and prolonged inflammation of the stomach may be caused by either benign or malignant ulcers of the stomach or by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. Chronic gastritis is sometimes associated with autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia; dietary factors such as caffeine; the use of medications, especially NSAIDs; alcohol; smoking; or reflux of intestinal contents into the stomach.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In gastritis, the gastric mucous membrane becomes edematous and hyperemic (congested with fluid and blood) and undergoes superficial erosion (Fig. 37-1). It secretes a scanty amount of gastric juice, containing very little acid but much mucus. Superficial ulceration may occur and can lead to hemorrhage.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient with acute gastritis may have abdominal discomfort, headache, lassitude, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, and hiccupping. Some patients, however, have no symptoms. The patient with chronic gastritis may complain of anorexia, heartburn after eating, belching, a sour taste in the mouth, or nausea and vomiting. Patients with chronic gastritis from vitamin deficiency usually have evidence of malabsorption of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ caused by antibodies against intrinsic factor.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Gastritis is sometimes associated with achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria (absence or low levels of hydrochloric acid $[\mathrm{HCl}]$ ) or with hyperchlorhydria (high levels of HCl ). Diagnosis can be determined by endoscopy, upper GI radiographic studies, and histologic examination of a tissue specimen obtained by biopsy. In addition to biopsy, other diagnostic measures for detecting H. pylori include serologic testing for antibodies against the H. pylori antigen, a 1 -minute ultrarapid urease test, and a breath test.

\section*{Medical Management}

The gastric mucosa is capable of repairing itself after a bout of gastritis. As a rule, the patient recovers in about 1 day, although the appetite may be diminished for an additional 2 or 3 days. Acute gastritis is also managed by instructing the patient to refrain from alcohol and food until symptoms subside. After the patient can take nourishment by mouth, a nonirritating diet is recommended. If the symptoms persist, fluids may need to be administered parenterally. If bleeding is present, management is similar to the procedures used for upper GI tract hemorrhage (discussed later in this chapter).

If gastritis is caused by ingestion of strong acids or alkalis, treatment consists of diluting and neutralizing the offending agent. To neutralize acids, common antacids (eg, aluminum hydroxide) are used; to neutralize an alkali, diluted lemon juice or diluted vinegar is used. If corrosion is extensive or severe, emetics and lavage are avoided because of the danger of perforation and damage to the esophagus.

Therapy is supportive and may include nasogastric (NG) intubation, analgesic agents and sedatives, antacids, and intravenous (IV) fluids. Fiberoptic endoscopy may be necessary. In extreme cases, emergency surgery may be required to remove gangrenous or perforated tissue. Gastrojejunostomy or gastric resection may be necessary to treat pyloric obstruction, a narrowing of the pyloric orifice.

Chronic gastritis is managed by modifying the patient's diet, promoting rest, reducing stress, and initiating pharmacotherapy. H. pylori may be treated with antibiotics (eg, tetracycline or amoxicillin, combined with clarithromycin) and a proton pump inhibitor (eg, lansoprazole [Prevacid]), and possibly bismuth salts (Pepto-Bismol) (Table 37-1). Research is being conducted to develop a vaccine against H. pylori (Alsahli et al., 2001).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH GASTRITIS}

\section*{Assessment}

When obtaining the history, the nurse asks about the patient's presenting signs and symptoms. Does the patient have heartburn, indigestion, nausea, or vomiting? Do the symptoms occur
antrectomy: removal of the pyloric (antrum) portion of the stomach with anastomosis (surgical connection) to the duodenum (gastroduodenostomy or Billroth I) or anastomosis to the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy or Billroth II)
dumping syndrome: physiologic response to rapid emptying of gastric contents into the jejunum, manifested by nausea, weak-
ness, sweating, palpitations, syncope, and possibly diarrhea; occurs in patients who have had partial gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy
duodenum: first portion of the small intestine, between the stomach and the jejunum gastric: refers to the stomach gastritis: inflammation of the stomach hematemesis: vomiting of blood
melena: tarry or black stools; indicative of blood in stools
morbid obesity: 100 pounds or more over ideal body weight
pyloroplasty: surgical procedure to increase the opening of the pyloric orifice
pylorus: opening between the stomach and the duodenum
pyrosis: heartburn

\end{figure}
at any specific time of the day, before or after meals, after ingesting spicy or irritating foods, or after the ingestion of certain drugs or alcohol? Has there been recent weight gain or loss? Are the symptoms related to anxiety, stress, allergies, eating or drinking too much, or eating too quickly? How are the symptoms relieved? Is there a history of previous gastric disease or surgery? A diet history plus a 72-hour dietary recall (a list of everything the patient ate and drank in the last 72 hours) may be helpful.

A thorough history is important because it helps the nurse to identify whether known dietary excesses or other indiscretions are associated with the current symptoms, whether others in the patient's environment have similar symptoms, whether the patient is vomiting blood, and whether any known caustic element has been ingested. The nurse also identifies the duration of the current symptoms, any methods used by the patient to treat these symptoms, and whether the methods are effective. Signs to note during the physical examination include abdominal tenderness, dehydration, and evidence of any systemic disorder that might be responsible for the symptoms of gastritis.

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Anxiety related to treatment
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inadequate intake of nutrients
- Risk for imbalanced fluid volume related to insufficient fluid intake and excessive fluid loss subsequent to vomiting
- Deficient knowledge about dietary management and disease process
- Acute pain related to irritated stomach mucosa

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include reduced anxiety, avoidance of irritating foods, adequate intake of nutrients, maintenance of fluid balance, increased awareness of dietary management, and relief of pain.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

If the patient has ingested acids or alkalis, emergency measures may be needed. The nurse offers supportive therapy to the patient and family during treatment and after the ingested acid or alkali has been neutralized or diluted. In some cases, the nurse may need to prepare the patient for additional diagnostic studies (endoscopy) or surgery. The patient usually feels anxious about the pain and the treatment modalities. The nurse uses a calm approach to assess the patient and to answer all questions as completely as possible. It is important to explain all procedures and treatments according to the patient's level of understanding.

\section*{PROMOTING OPTIMAL NUTRITION}

For acute gastritis, the nurse provides physical and emotional support and helps the patient manage the symptoms, which may include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and fatigue. The patient should take no foods or fluids by mouth-possibly for days-until the acute symptoms subside, thus allowing the gastric mucosa to heal. If IV therapy is necessary, the nurse monitors it regularly, along with serum electrolyte values. After the symptoms subside, the nurse can offer the patient ice chips followed by clear liquids. Introducing solid food as soon as possible will provide oral nutrition, decrease the need for IV therapy, and minimize irritation to the gastric mucosa. As food is introduced, the nurse evaluates and reports any symptoms that suggest a repeat episode of gastritis.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The nurse discourages the intake of caffeinated beverages, because caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that increases gastric activity and pepsin secretion. It also is important to discourage alcohol use. Discouraging cigarette smoking is important because nicotine reduces the secretion of pancreatic bicarbonate and thus inhibits the neutralization of gastric acid in the duodenum (Eastwood, 1997). When appropriate, the nurse refers the patient for alcohol counseling and smoking cessation programs.

\section*{PROMOTING FLUID BALANCE}

Daily fluid intake and output are monitored to detect early signs of dehydration (minimal urine output of $30 \mathrm{~mL} /$ hour, minimal intake of $1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day $)$. If food and fluids are withheld, IV fluids ( $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) usually are prescribed and a record of fluid intake plus caloric value ( 1 L of $5 \%$ dextrose in water = 170 calories of carbohydrate) needs to be maintained. Electrolyte values (sodium, potassium, chloride) are assessed every 24 hours to detect imbalance.

The nurse must always be alert for any indicators of hemorrhagic gastritis, which include hematemesis (vomiting of blood), tachycardia, and hypotension. If these occur, the physician is notified and the patient's vital signs are monitored as the patient's condition warrants. Guidelines for managing upper GI tract bleeding are discussed later in this chapter.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Measures to help relieve pain include instructing the patient to avoid foods and beverages that may be irritating to the gastric mucosa (described earlier) and instructing the patient about using medications to relieve chronic gastritis. To follow up, the nurse assesses the patient's level of pain and the extent of comfort attained from the use of medications and avoidance of irritating substances.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse evaluates the patient's knowledge about gastritis and develops an individualized teaching plan that includes information about stress management, diet, and medications (Chart 37-1). Dietary instructions take into account the patient's daily caloric needs, food preferences, and pattern of eating. The nurse and patient review foods and other substances to be avoided (eg, spicy, irritating, or highly seasoned foods; caffeine; nicotine; alcohol). Consultation with a dietitian may be recommended.

Providing information about prescribed antibiotics, bismuth salts, medications to decrease gastric secretion, and medications to protect mucosal cells from gastric secretions can help the patient recover and prevent recurrence. Patients with pernicious anemia need information about long-term vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ injections; the nurse may instruct a family member about administering these injections or make arrangements for the patient to receive the injections from a health care provider. Finally, the nurse emphasizes the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with health care providers.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers}

A peptic ulcer is an excavation (hollowed-out area) that forms in the mucosal wall of the stomach, in the pylorus (opening between stomach and duodenum), in the duodenum (first part of small intestine), or in the esophagus. A peptic ulcer is frequently referred to as a gastric, duodenal, or esophageal ulcer, depending on its location, or as peptic ulcer disease. Erosion of a circumscribed area of mucous membrane is the cause (Fig. 37-2). This erosion may extend as deeply as the muscle layers or through the muscle to the peritoneum. Peptic ulcers are more likely to be in the duodenum than in the stomach. As a rule they occur alone, but they may occur in multiples. Chronic gastric ulcers tend to occur in the lesser curvature of the stomach, near the pylorus. Table 37-2 compares the features of gastric and duodenal ulcers.

Peptic ulcer disease occurs with the greatest frequency in people between the ages of 40 and 60 years. It is relatively uncommon in women of childbearing age, but it has been observed in children and even in infants. After menopause, the incidence of peptic ulcers in women is almost equal to that in men. Peptic ulcers in the body of the stomach can occur without excessive acid secretion.

\section*{Signs, Symptoms, and Clinical Findings}

In the past, stress and anxiety were thought to be causes of ulcers. Research has identified that peptic ulcers result from infection with the gram-negative bacteria H. pylori (Tytgat, 2000). However, ulcers do seem to develop more commonly in people who are tense; whether this is a contributing factor to the condition is uncertain. In addition, excessive secretion of HCl in the stomach may contribute to the formation of gastric ulcers, and stress may be associated with its increased secretion. The ingestion of milk and caffeinated beverages, smoking, and alcohol also may increase HCl secretion.

Familial tendency may be a significant predisposing factor. A further genetic link is noted in the finding that people with blood type O are more susceptible to peptic ulcers than are those with blood type A, B, or AB. There also is an association between duodenal ulcers and chronic pulmonary disease or chronic renal disease. Other predisposing factors associated with peptic ulcer include chronic use of NSAIDs, alcohol ingestion, and excessive smoking.

Rarely, ulcers are caused by excessive amounts of the hormone gastrin, produced by tumors. This Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) consists of severe peptic ulcers, extreme gastric hyperacidity, and gastrin-secreting benign or malignant tumors of the pancreas. Stress ulcers, which are clinically different from peptic ulcers, are ulcerations in the mucosa that can occur in the gastroduodenal area. Stress ulcers may occur in patients who are exposed to stressful conditions. Esophageal ulcers occur as a result of the backward flow of HCl from the stomach into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Peptic ulcers occur mainly in the gastroduodenal mucosa because this tissue cannot withstand the digestive action of gastric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$ and pepsin. The erosion is caused by the increased concentration or activity of acid-pepsin, or by decreased resistance of the mucosa. A damaged mucosa cannot secrete enough mucus to act as a barrier against HCl . The use of NSAIDs inhibits the secretion of mucus that protects the mucosa. Patients with duodenal ulcer disease secrete more acid than normal, whereas patients with gastric ulcer tend to secrete normal or decreased levels of acid.

ZES is suspected when a patient has several peptic ulcers or an ulcer that is resistant to standard medical therapy. It is identified by the following findings: hypersecretion of gastric juice, duodenal ulcers, and gastrinomas (islet cell tumors) in the pancreas. Ninety percent of tumors are found in the "gastric triangle," which encompasses the cystic and common bile ducts, the second and third portions of the duodenum, and the neck and body of the pancreas. Approximately one third of gastrinomas are malignant. Diarrhea and steatorrhea (unabsorbed fat in the stool) may be evident. The patient may have coexisting parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia and may therefore exhibit signs of hypercalcemia. The most common complaint is epigastric pain. H. pylori is not a risk factor for ZES.

Stress ulcer is the term given to the acute mucosal ulceration of the duodenal or gastric area that occurs after physiologically stressful events, such as burns, shock, severe sepsis, and multiple organ traumas. These ulcers are most common in ventilator-dependent patients after trauma or surgery. Fiberoptic endoscopy within 24 hours after injury reveals shallow erosions of the stomach wall; by 72 hours, multiple gastric erosions are observed. As the stressful condition continues, the ulcers spread. When the patient recovers, the lesions are reversed. This pattern is typical of stress ulceration.

Differences of opinion exist as to the actual cause of mucosal ulceration in stress ulcers. Usually, it is preceded by shock; this leads to decreased gastric mucosal blood flow and to reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach. In addition, large quantities of pepsin are released. The combination of ischemia, acid, and pepsin creates an ideal climate for ulceration.

Stress ulcers should be distinguished from Cushing's ulcers and Curling's ulcers, two other types of gastric ulcers. Cushing's ulcers are common in patients with trauma to the brain. They may occur in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum and are usually deeper and more penetrating than stress ulcers. Curling's ulcer is frequently observed about 72 hours after extensive burns and involves the antrum of the stomach or the duodenum.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of an ulcer may last for a few days, weeks, or months and may disappear only to reappear, often without an identifiable cause. Many people have symptomless ulcers, and in 20\% to 30\% perforation or hemorrhage may occur without any preceding manifestations.

As a rule, the patient with an ulcer complains of dull, gnawing pain or a burning sensation in the midepigastrium or in the back. It is believed that the pain occurs when the increased acid content of the stomach and duodenum erodes the lesion and stimulates the exposed nerve endings. Another theory suggests that contact of the lesion with acid stimulates a local reflex mechanism that initiates contraction of the adjacent smooth muscle. Pain is usually relieved by eating, because food neutralizes the
acid, or by taking alkali; however, once the stomach has emptied or the alkali's effect has decreased, the pain returns. Sharply localized tenderness can be elicited by applying gentle pressure to the epigastrium at or slightly to the right of the midline.

Other symptoms include pyrosis (heartburn), vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and bleeding. Pyrosis is a burning sensation in the esophagus and stomach that moves up to the mouth. Heartburn is often accompanied by sour eructation, or burping, which is common when the patient's stomach is empty.

Although vomiting is rare in uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, it may be a symptom of a peptic ulcer complication. It results from obstruction of the pyloric orifice, caused by either muscular spasm of the pylorus or mechanical obstruction from scarring or acute swelling of the inflamed mucous membrane adjacent to the ulcer. Vomiting may or may not be preceded by nausea; usually it follows a bout of severe pain and bloating, which is relieved by ejection of the gastric contents. Emesis often contains undigested food eaten many hours earlier. Constipation or diarrhea can occur, probably as a result of diet and medications.

Fifteen percent of patients with gastric ulcers experience bleeding. Patients may present with GI bleeding as evidenced by the passage of tarry stools. A small portion of patients who bleed from an acute ulcer have had no previous digestive complaints, but they develop symptoms thereafter (Yamada, 1999).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A physical examination may reveal pain, epigastric tenderness, or abdominal distention. A barium study of the upper GI tract may show an ulcer; however, endoscopy is the preferred diagnostic procedure because it allows direct visualization of inflammatory changes, ulcers, and lesions. Through endoscopy, a biopsy of the gastric mucosa and of any suspicious lesions can be obtained. Endoscopy may reveal lesions that are not evident on x-ray studies because of their size or location.

Stools may be tested periodically until they are negative for occult blood. Gastric secretory studies are of value in diagnosing achlorhydria and ZES. H. pylori infection may be determined by biopsy and histology with culture. There is also a breath test that detects H. pylori, as well as a serologic test for antibodies to the H. pylori antigen. Pain that is relieved by ingesting food or antacids and absence of pain on arising are also highly suggestive of an ulcer.

\section*{Medical Management}

Once the diagnosis is established, the patient is informed that the problem can be controlled. Recurrence may develop; however, peptic ulcers treated with antibiotics to eradicate $H$. pylori have a lower recurrence rate than those not treated with antibiotics. The goals are to eradicate H. pylori and to manage gastric acidity. Methods used include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgical intervention.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Currently, the most commonly used therapy in the treatment of ulcers is a combination of antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and bismuth salts that suppresses or eradicates H. pylori; histamine $2\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\right)$ receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are used to treat NSAID-induced and other ulcers not associated with H. pylori ulcers. Table 37-1 provides details about pharmacologic treatment.

The patient is advised to adhere to the medication regimen to ensure complete healing of the ulcer. Because most patients become symptom-free within a week, it becomes a nursing responsibility to stress the importance of following the prescribed regimen so that the healing process can continue uninterrupted and the return of chronic ulcer symptoms can be prevented. Rest, sedatives, and tranquilizers may add to the patient's comfort and are prescribed as needed. Maintenance dosages of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists are usually recommended for 1 year.

For patients with ZES, hypersecretion of acid may be controlled with high doses of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists. These patients may require twice the normal dose, and dosages usually need to be increased with prolonged use. Octreotide (Sandostatin), a medication that suppresses gastrin levels, also may be prescribed.

Patients at risk for stress ulcers may be treated prophylactically with IV $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists and cytoprotective agents (e.g., misoprostol, sucralfate) because of the risk for upper GI tract hemorrhage. Frequent gastric aspiration is performed to allow monitoring of gastric secretion pH .

\section*{STRESS REDUCTION AND REST}

Reducing environmental stress requires physical and psychological modifications on the patient's part as well as the aid and cooperation of family members and significant others. The patient may need help in identifying situations that are stressful or exhausting. A rushed lifestyle and an irregular schedule may aggravate symptoms and interfere with regular meals taken in relaxed settings and with the regular administration of medications. The patient may benefit from regular rest periods during the day, at least during the acute phase of the disease. Biofeedback, hypnosis, or behavior modification may be helpful.

\section*{SMOKING CESSATION}

Studies have shown that smoking decreases the secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas into the duodenum, resulting in increased acidity of the duodenum. Research indicates that continuing to smoke cigarettes may significantly inhibit ulcer repair. Therefore, the patient is strongly encouraged to stop smoking. Smoking cessation support groups and other smoking cessation approaches are helpful for many patients (Eastwood, 1997).

\section*{DIETARY MODIFICATION}

The intent of dietary modification for patients with peptic ulcers is to avoid oversecretion of acid and hypermotility in the GI tract. These can be minimized by avoiding extremes of temperature and overstimulation from consumption of meat extracts, alcohol, coffee (including decaffeinated coffee, which also stimulates acid secretion) and other caffeinated beverages, and diets rich in milk and cream (which stimulate acid secretion). In addition, an effort is made to neutralize acid by eating three regular meals a day. Small, frequent feedings are not necessary as long as an antacid or a histamine blocker is taken. Diet compatibility becomes an individual matter: the patient eats foods that can be tolerated and avoids those that produce pain.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The introduction of antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori and of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists as treatment for ulcers has greatly reduced the need for surgical interventions. However, surgery is usually recommended for patients with intractable ulcers (those that fail to heal after 12 to 16 weeks of medical treatment), life-threatening hemorrhage, perforation, or obstruction, and for those with ZES not responding to medications (Yamada, 1999). Surgical procedures
include vagotomy, with or without pyloroplasty, and the Billroth I and Billroth II procedures (Table 37-3; see also the section on gastric surgery later in this chapter). Patients who need ulcer surgery may have had a long illness. They may be discouraged and have had interruptions in their work role and pressures in their family life.

\section*{FOLLOW-UP CARE}

Recurrence within 1 year may be prevented with the prophylactic use of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists given at a reduced dose. Not all patients require maintenance therapy; it may be prescribed only for those with two or three recurrences per year, those who have had a complication such as bleeding or outlet obstruction, or those who are candidates for gastric surgery but are at too high a risk for surgery. The likelihood of recurrence is reduced if the patient avoids smoking, coffee (including decaffeinated coffee) and other caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and ulcerogenic medications (eg, NSAIDs).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS:}

\section*{THE PATIENT WITH ULCER DISEASE}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse asks the patient to describe the pain and the methods used to relieve it (e.g., food, antacids). The patient usually describes peptic ulcer pain as burning or gnawing; it occurs about 2 hours after a meal and frequently awakens the patient between midnight and 3 AM. Taking antacids, eating, or vomiting often relieves the pain. If the patient reports a recent history of vomiting, the nurse determines how often emesis has occurred and notes important characteristics of the vomitus: Is it bright red, does it resemble coffee grounds, or is there undigested food from previous meals? Has the patient noted any bloody or tarry stools?

The nurse also asks the patient to list his or her usual food intake for a 72-hour period and to describe food habits (e.g., speed of eating, regularity of meals, preference for spicy foods, use of seasonings, use of caffeinated beverages and decaffeinated coffee). Lifestyle and habits are a concern as well. Does the patient use irritating substances? For example, does he or she smoke cigarettes? If yes, how many? Does the patient ingest alcohol? If yes, how much and how often? Are NSAIDs used? The nurse inquires about the patient's level of anxiety and his or her perception of current stressors. How does the patient express anger or cope with stressful situations? Is the patient experiencing occupational stress or problems within the family? Is there a family history of ulcer disease?

The nurse assesses vital signs and reports tachycardia and hypotension, which may indicate anemia from GI bleeding. The stool is tested for occult blood, and a physical examination, including palpation of the abdomen for localized tenderness, is performed as well.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to the effect of gastric acid secretion on damaged tissue
- Anxiety related to coping with an acute disease
- Imbalanced nutrition related to changes in diet
- Deficient knowledge about prevention of symptoms and management of the condition

\section*{DESCRIPTION}

Severing of the vagus nerve. Decreases gastric acid by diminishing cholinergic stimulation to the parietal cells, making them less responsive to gastrin. May be done via open surgical approach, laparoscopy, or thoracoscopy

Severs the right and left vagus nerves as they enter the stomach at the distal part of the esophagus.

Severs vagal innervation to the stomach but maintains innervation to the rest of the abdominal organs.
Denervates acid-secreting parietal cells but preserves vagal innervation to the gastric antrum and pylorus.
A surgical procedure in which a longitudinal incision is made into the pylorus and transversely sutured closed to enlarge the outlet and relax the muscle

\section*{COMMENTS}

May be performed to reduce gastric acid secretion. A drainage type of procedure (see pyloroplasty) is usually performed to assist with gastric emptying (because there is total denervation of the stomach). Some patients experience problems with feeling of fullness, dumping syndrome, diarrhea, and gastritis.

This type of vagotomy is most commonly used to decrease acid secretions and reduce gastric and intestinal motility. Recurrence rate of ulcer is $10 \%-15 \%$.

No dumping syndrome. No need for drainage procedure. Recurrence rate of ulcer is $10 \%-15 \%$.
Usually accompanies truncal and selective vagotomies, which produce delayed gastric emptying due to decreased innervation.

Removal of the lower portion of the antrum of the stomach (which contains the cells that secrete gastrin) as well as a small portion of the duodenum and pylorus. The remaining segment is anastomosed to the duodenum (Billroth I) or to the jejunum (Billroth II)

May be performed in conjunction with a truncal vagotomy. The patient may have problems with feeling of fullness, dumping syndrome, and diarrhea. Recurrence rate of ulcer is $<1 \%$.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications may include the following:
- Hemorrhage
- Perforation
- Penetration
- Pyloric obstruction (gastric outlet obstruction)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include relief of pain, reduced anxiety, maintenance of nutritional requirements, knowledge about the management and prevention of ulcer recurrence, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Pain relief can be achieved with prescribed medications. The patient should avoid aspirin, foods and beverages that contain caffeine, and decaffeinated coffee, and meals should be eaten at regularly paced intervals in a relaxed setting. Some patients benefit from learning relaxation techniques to help manage stress and pain and to enhance smoking cessation efforts.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

The nurse assesses the patient's level of anxiety. Patients with peptic ulcers are usually anxious, but their anxiety is not always obvious. Appropriate information is provided at the patient's level of understanding, all questions are answered, and the patient is encouraged to express fears openly. Explaining diagnostic tests and administering medications on schedule also help to reduce anxiety. The nurse interacts with the patient in a relaxed manner, helps identify stressors, and explains various coping techniques
and relaxation methods, such as biofeedback, hypnosis, or behavior modification. The patient's family is also encouraged to participate in care and to provide emotional support.

\section*{MAINTAINING OPTIMAL NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

The nurse assesses the patient for malnutrition and weight loss. After recovery from an acute phase of peptic ulcer disease, the patient is advised about the importance of complying with the medication regimen and dietary restrictions.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Hemorrhage}

Gastritis and hemorrhage from peptic ulcer are the two most common causes of upper GI tract bleeding (which may also occur with esophageal varices, as discussed in Chapter 39). Hemorrhage, the most common complication, occurs in about $15 \%$ of patients with peptic ulcers (Yamada, 1999). The site of bleeding is usually the distal portion of the duodenum. Bleeding may be manifested by hematemesis or melena (tarry stools). The vomited blood can be bright red, or it can have a "coffee grounds" appearance (which is dark) from the oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. When the hemorrhage is large ( 2000 to 3000 mL ), most of the blood is vomited. Because large quantities of blood may be lost quickly, immediate correction of blood loss may be required to prevent hemorrhagic shock. When the hemorrhage is small, much or all of the blood is passed in the stools, which will appear tarry black because of the digested hemoglobin. Management depends on the amount of blood lost and the rate of bleeding.

The nurse assesses the patient for faintness or dizziness and nausea, which may precede or accompany bleeding. It is important to monitor vital signs frequently and to evaluate the patient for tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea. Other nursing interventions include monitoring the hemoglobin and hematocrit,
testing the stool for gross or occult blood, and recording hourly urinary output to detect anuria or oliguria (absence or decreased urine production).

Many times the bleeding from a peptic ulcer stops spontaneously; however, the incidence of recurrent bleeding is high. Because bleeding can be fatal, the cause and severity of the hemorrhage must be identified quickly and the blood loss treated to prevent hemorrhagic shock. Management of upper GI tract bleeding consists of quickly determining the amount of blood lost and the rate of bleeding, rapidly replacing the blood that has been lost, stopping the bleeding, stabilizing the patient, and diagnosing and treating the cause. Related nursing and collaborative interventions include the following:
- Inserting a peripheral IV line for the infusion of saline or lactated Ringer's solution and blood products. The nurse may need to assist with the placement of a pulmonary artery catheter for hemodynamic monitoring. Blood component therapy is initiated if there are signs of shock (eg, tachycardia, sweating, coldness of the extremities).
- Monitoring the hemoglobin and hematocrit to assist in evaluating blood loss
- Inserting an NG tube to distinguish fresh blood from "coffee grounds" material, to aid in the removal of clots and acid, to prevent nausea and vomiting, and to provide a means of monitoring further bleeding
- Administering a room-temperature lavage of saline solution or water. This is controversial; some authorities recommend using ice lavage (Yamada, 1999).
- Inserting an indwelling urinary catheter and monitoring urinary output
- Monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation and administering oxygen therapy
- Placing the patient in the recumbent position with the legs elevated to prevent hypotension; or, to prevent aspiration from vomiting, placing the patient on the left side
- Treating hemorrhagic shock (described in Chapter 15)

If bleeding cannot be managed by the measures described, other treatment modalities may be used. Transendoscopic coagulation by laser, heat probe, medication, a sclerosing agent, or a combination of these therapies can halt bleeding and make surgical intervention unnecessary. There is much debate regarding how soon endoscopy should be performed. Some believe that endoscopy should be performed in the first 24 hours after hemorrhage has been stabilized. Others believe that endoscopy may be performed during acute bleeding, as long as the esophageal or gastric area can be visualized (blood may decrease visibility) (Yamada, 1999).

For those who are unable to undergo surgery, selective embolization may be used. This procedure involves forcing emboli of autologous blood clots with or without Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin sponge) through a catheter in the artery to a point above the bleeding lesion. A radiologist performs this procedure.

Rebleeding may occur and often warrants surgical intervention. The nurse monitors the patient carefully so that bleeding can be detected quickly. Signs of bleeding include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, mental confusion, thirst, and oliguria. If bleeding recurs within 48 hours after medical therapy has begun, or if more than 6 to 10 units of blood are required within 24 hours to maintain blood volume, the patient is likely to require surgery. Some physicians recommend surgical intervention if a patient hemorrhages three times. Other criteria for surgery are the patient's age (massive hemorrhaging is three times more likely to be fatal in those older than 60 years of age); a history of chronic duodenal ulcer; and
a coincidental gastric ulcer (Yamada, 1999). The area of the ulcer is removed or the bleeding vessels are ligated. Many patients also undergo procedures (eg, vagotomy and pyloroplasty, gastrectomy) aimed at controlling the underlying cause of the ulcers (see Table 37-3).

\section*{Perforation and Penetration}

Perforation is the erosion of the ulcer through the gastric serosa into the peritoneal cavity without warning. It is an abdominal catastrophe and requires immediate surgery. Penetration is erosion of the ulcer through the gastric serosa into adjacent structures such as the pancreas, biliary tract, or gastrohepatic omentum. Symptoms of penetration include back and epigastric pain not relieved by medications that were effective in the past. Like perforation, penetration usually requires surgical intervention.

Signs and symptoms of perforation include the following:
- Sudden, severe upper abdominal pain (persisting and increasing in intensity); pain may be referred to the shoulders, especially the right shoulder, because of irritation of the phrenic nerve in the diaphragm.
- Vomiting and collapse (fainting)
- Extremely tender and rigid (boardlike) abdomen
- Hypotension and tachycardia, indicating shock

Because chemical peritonitis develops within a few hours after perforation and is followed by bacterial peritonitis, the perforation must be closed as quickly as possible. In a few patients, it may be deemed safe and advisable to perform surgery for the ulcer disease in addition to suturing the perforation.

Postoperatively, the stomach contents are drained by means of an NG tube. The nurse monitors fluid and electrolyte balance and assesses the patient for peritonitis or localized infection (increased temperature, abdominal pain, paralytic ileus, increased or absent bowel sounds, abdominal distention). Antibiotic therapy is administered parenterally as prescribed.

\section*{Pyloric Obstruction}

Pyloric obstruction, also called gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), occurs when the area distal to the pyloric sphincter becomes scarred and stenosed from spasm or edema or from scar tissue that forms when an ulcer alternately heals and breaks down. The patient has nausea and vomiting, constipation, epigastric fullness, anorexia, and, later, weight loss.

In treating the patient with pyloric obstruction, the first consideration is to insert an NG tube to decompress the stomach. Confirmation that obstruction is the cause of the discomfort is accomplished by assessing the amount of fluid aspirated from the NG tube. A residual of more than 400 mL strongly suggests obstruction. Usually an upper GI study or endoscopy is performed to confirm gastric outlet obstruction. Decompression of the stomach and management of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balances may improve the patient's condition and avert the need for surgical intervention. A balloon dilatation of the pylorus via endoscopy may be beneficial. If the obstruction is unrelieved by medical management, surgery (in the form of a vagotomy and antrectomy or gastrojejunostomy and vagotomy) may be required.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

To manage ulcer disease successfully, the patient is instructed about the factors that will help or aggravate the condition (Chart 37-2). The nurse reviews information about medications to be taken at
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-034.jpg?height=586&width=1783&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=202)
home, including name, dosage, frequency, and possible side effects, stressing the importance of continuing to take medications even after signs and symptoms have decreased or subsided. Then the patient is instructed to avoid certain medications and foods that exacerbate symptoms as well as substances that have acidproducing potential (eg, alcohol; caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and colas). It is important to counsel the patient to eat meals at regular times and in a relaxed setting, and to avoid overeating. If relevant, the nurse also informs the patient about the irritant effects of smoking on the ulcer and provides information about smoking cessation programs.

1NURSING ALERT The nurse reviews with the patient and family the signs and symptoms of complications to be reported. They include hemorrhage (cool skin, confusion, increased heart rate, labored breathing, and blood in the stool); penetration and perforation (severe abdominal pain, rigid and tender abdomen, vomiting, elevated temperature, and increased heart rate); and pyloric obstruction (nausea, vomiting, distended abdomen, and abdominal pain).

The nurse reinforces the importance of follow-up care for approximately 1 year, the need to report recurrence of symptoms, and the need for treating possible problems that occur after surgery, such as intolerance to dairy products and sweet foods.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include the following:
1. Reports freedom from pain between meals
2. Feels less anxiety by avoiding stress
3. Complies with therapeutic regimen
a. Avoids irritating foods and beverages
b. Eats regularly scheduled meals
c. Takes prescribed medications as scheduled
d. Uses coping mechanisms to deal with stress
4. Maintains weight
5. Is free of complications

\section*{Morbid Obesity}

One in three Americans is 20\% or more over his or her ideal body weight (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001).
Morbid obesity is the term applied to people who are more than
two times their ideal body weight or whose body mass index (BMI) exceeds $30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. (See Chapter 5.)

Another definition of morbid obesity is body weight that is more than 100 pounds greater than the ideal body weight (Monteforte \& Turkelson, 2000). Patients with morbid obesity are at higher risk for health complications, such as cardiovascular disease, arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, and diabetes. They frequently suffer from low self-esteem, impaired body image, and depression.

\section*{Medical Management}

Conservative management consists of placing the person on a weight loss diet in conjunction with behavioral modification and exercise; however, diet therapy is usually unsuccessful. There is a belief that depression may be a contributing factor to weight gain, and treatment of the depression with bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin) may be helpful (Wangsness, 2000). Some physicians recommend acupuncture and hypnosis before recommending surgery.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT}

Several medications have recently been approved for obesity. They include sibutramine HCl (Meridia) and orlistat (Xenical). By inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, sibutramine decreases appetite. Orlistat reduces caloric intake by binding to gastric and pancreatic lipase to prevent digestion of fats. Both medications require a physician's prescription. Sibutramine may increase blood pressure and should not be taken by people with a history of coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, dysrhythmias, or kidney disease; by those taking antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors; or by pregnant or nursing women. Side effects may include dry mouth, insomnia, headache, increased sweating, and increased heart rate. Side effects of orlistat may include increased bowel movements, gas with oily discharge, decreased food absorption, decreased bile flow, and decreased absorption of some vitamins. A multivitamin is usually recommended for patients taking orlistat. Women who are pregnant or nursing should not take orlistat (Hussar, 2000).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Bariatric surgery, or surgery for morbid obesity, is performed only after other nonsurgical attempts at weight control have failed. The first surgical procedure to treat morbid obesity was the jejunoileal bypass. This procedure, which resulted in significant
complications, has been largely replaced by gastric restriction procedures. Gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty are the current operations of choice. These procedures may be performed laparoscopically or by an open surgical technique.

In gastric bypass surgery, the proximal segment of the stomach is transected to form a small pouch with a small gastroenterostomy stoma. The Roux-en- Y gastric bypass is the recommended procedure for long-term weight loss. In this procedure, a horizontal row of staples creates a stomach pouch with a $1-\mathrm{cm}$ stoma that is anastomosed with a portion of distal jejunum, creating a gastroenterostomy. The transected proximal portion of the jejunum is anastomosed to the distal jejunum (Fig. 37-3A).

In vertical banded gastroplasty, a double row of staples is applied vertically along the lesser curvature of the stomach, beginning at the angle of His. A small stoma is created at the end of the staples by adding a circle of staples or a band of polypropylene mesh or silicone tubing (see Fig. 37-3B).

After weight loss, the patient may need surgical intervention for body contouring. This may include lipoplasty to remove fat deposits or a panniculectomy to remove excess abdominal skinfolds.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management focuses on care of the patient after surgery. General postoperative nursing care is similar to that for a patient recovering from a gastric resection, but with attention given to the risks of complications associated with morbid obesity. Complications that may occur in the immediate postoperative period include peritonitis, stomal obstruction, stomal ulcers, atelectasis and pneumonia, thromboembolism, and metabolic imbalances resulting from prolonged vomiting and diarrhea. After bowel sounds have returned and oral intake is resumed, the nurse provides six
small feedings consisting of a total of 600 to 800 calories per day and encourages fluid intake to prevent dehydration.

Patients are usually discharged in 4 to 5 days with detailed dietary instructions. The nurse instructs patients to report excessive thirst or concentrated urine, both of which are indications of dehydration. Psychosocial interventions are also essential for these patients. Efforts are directed toward helping them modify their eating behaviors and cope with changes in body image. The nurse explains that noncompliance by eating too much or too fast or eating highcalorie liquid and soft foods results in vomiting and painful esophageal distention. The nurse discusses dietary instructions before discharge and schedules monthly outpatient visits. Long-term side effects may include increased risk of gallstones, nutritional deficiencies, and potential to regain weight.

\section*{Gastric Cancer}

The incidence of cancer of the stomach continues to decrease in the United States; however, it still accounts for 12,400 deaths annually (American Cancer Society, 2002). Most of these deaths occur in people older than 40 years of age, but they occasionally occur in younger people. Men have a higher incidence of gastric cancers than women do. The incidence of gastric cancer is much greater in Japan, which has instituted mass screening programs for earlier diagnosis. Diet appears to be a significant factor. A diet high in smoked foods and low in fruits and vegetables may increase the risk of gastric cancer. Other factors related to the incidence of gastric cancer include chronic inflammation of the stomach, pernicious anemia, achlorhydria, gastric ulcers, H. pylori infection, and genetics. The prognosis is poor, because most patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis (Greenlee, 2001).

\end{figure}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas and can occur in any portion of the stomach. The tumor infiltrates the surrounding mucosa, penetrating the wall of the stomach and adjacent organs and structures. The liver, pancreas, esophagus, and duodenum are often affected at the time of diagnosis. Metastasis through lymph to the peritoneal cavity occurs later in the disease.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

In the early stages of gastric cancer, symptoms may be absent. Early symptoms are seldom definitive because most gastric tumors begin on the lesser curvature, where they cause little disturbance of gastric functions. Some studies show that early symptoms, such as pain relieved with antacids, resemble those of benign ulcers. Symptoms of progressive disease may include anorexia, dyspepsia (indigestion), weight loss, abdominal pain, constipation, anemia, and nausea and vomiting.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Usually the physical examination is not helpful in detecting cancer because most gastric tumors are not palpable. Ascites may be apparent if the cancer cells have metastasized to the liver. Endoscopy for biopsy and cytologic washings is the usual diagnostic study, and a barium x-ray examination of the upper GI tract may also be performed. Because metastasis often occurs before warning signs develop, a computed tomography (CT) scan, bone scan, and liver scan are valuable in determining the extent of metastasis. A complete x-ray examination of the GI tract should be performed when any person older than 40 years of age has had indigestion (dyspepsia) of more than 4 weeks' duration.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is no successful treatment for gastric carcinoma except removal of the tumor. If the tumor can be removed while it is still localized to the stomach, the patient can be cured. If the tumor has spread beyond the area that can be excised, cure is impossible. Palliative rather than radical surgery is performed if there is metastasis to other vital organs, such as the liver. In many of these patients, effective palliation to prevent discomfort caused by obstruction or dysphagia may be obtained by resection of the tumor (see Gastric Surgery).

If a radical subtotal gastrectomy is performed, the stump of the stomach is anastomosed to the jejunum, as in the gastrectomy for ulcer. When a total gastrectomy is performed, GI continuity is restored by means of an anastomosis between the ends of the esophagus and the jejunum.

If surgical treatment does not offer cure, treatment with chemotherapy may offer further control of the disease or palliation. Commonly used chemotherapeutic medications include cisplatin, irinotecan, or a combination of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and mitomycin-C. Some studies are being conducted on the use of chemotherapy before surgery. Radiation therapy also may be used for palliation. Assessment of tumor markers (blood analysis for antigens indicative of colon cancer) such as carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, and CA 50 may help determine the effectiveness of treatment. If these values were elevated before treatment, they should decrease if the tumor is responding to the treatment (Bobbio-Pallavicini et al., 2001; Kerby \& Heslin, 1999).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH GASTRIC CANCER}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse elicits a dietary history from the patient, focusing on recent nutritional intake and status. Has the patient lost weight? If so, how much and over what period of time? Can the patient tolerate a full diet? If not, what foods can he or she eat? What other changes in eating habits have occurred? Does the patient have an appetite? Is the patient in pain? Do foods, antacids, or medications relieve the pain, make no difference, or worsen the pain? Is there a history of infection with H. pylori bacteria? Other health information to obtain includes the patient's smoking and alcohol history and the family history (any first- or second-degree relatives with gastric or other cancer). A psychosocial assessment, including questions about social support, individual and family coping skills, and financial resources, will help the nurse plan for care in acute and community settings.

After the interview, the nurse performs a complete physical examination, carefully assesses the patient's abdomen for tenderness or masses, and also palpates and percusses to detect ascites.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Anxiety related to the disease and anticipated treatment
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to anorexia
- Pain related to tumor mass
- Anticipatory grieving related to the diagnosis of cancer
- Deficient knowledge regarding self-care activities

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include reduced anxiety, optimal nutrition, relief of pain, and adjustment to the diagnosis and anticipated lifestyle changes.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

A relaxed, nonthreatening atmosphere is provided so that patient can express fears, concerns, and possibly anger about the diagnosis and prognosis. The nurse encourages the family in their efforts to support the patient, offering reassurance and supporting positive coping measures. The nurse advises the patient about any procedures and treatments so that the patient knows what to expect. The nurse also may suggest talking with a support person (eg, spiritual advisor), if the patient desires.

\section*{PROMOTING OPTIMAL NUTRITION}

The nurse encourages the patient to eat small, frequent portions of nonirritating foods to decrease gastric irritation. Food supplements should be high in calories, as well as vitamins A and C and iron, to enhance tissue repair. If the patient is unable to eat adequately to meet nutritional requirements, parenteral nutrition may be necessary. Because the patient may develop dumping syndrome when enteral feeding resumes after gastric resection, the nurse explains ways to prevent and manage it (six small feedings daily that are low in carbohydrates and sugar; fluids between meals rather than with meals) and informs the patient that symptoms often resolve after
several months. If a total gastrectomy is performed, parenteral vitamin $B_{12}$ will be required indefinitely, because dietary vitamin $B_{12}$ is absorbed in the stomach. The nurse monitors the IV therapy and nutritional status and records intake, output, and daily weights to ensure that the patient is maintaining or gaining weight. The nurse assesses for signs of dehydration (thirst, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, tachycardia, decreased urine output) and reviews the results of daily laboratory studies to note any metabolic abnormalities (sodium, potassium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen). Antiemetics are administered as prescribed.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The nurse administers analgesics as prescribed. A continuous infusion of an opioid may be necessary for severe pain. The nurse assesses the frequency, intensity, and duration of the pain to determine the effectiveness of the analgesic being administered. The nurse works with the patient to manage pain by suggesting nonpharmacologic methods for pain relief, such as position changes, imagery, distraction, relaxation exercises (using relaxation audiotapes), backrubs, massage, and periods of rest and relaxation.

\section*{PROVIDING PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT}

The nurse helps the patient express fears, concerns, and grief about the diagnosis. It is important to answer the patient's questions honestly and to encourage the patient to participate in treatment decisions. Some patients mourn the loss of a body part and perceive their surgery as a type of mutilation. Some express disbelief and need time and support to accept the diagnosis.

The nurse offers emotional support and involves family members and significant others whenever possible. This includes recognizing mood swings and defense mechanisms (eg, denial, rationalization, displacement, regression) and reassuring the patient and family members that emotional responses are normal and expected. The services of clergy, psychiatric clinical nurse specialists, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists are made available, if needed. The nurse projects an empathetic attitude and spends time with the patient. Most patients will begin to participate in self-care activities after they have acknowledged their loss.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Self-care activities will depend on the mode of treatment usedsurgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or palliative care. Patient and family teaching will include information about diet and nutrition, treatment regimens, activity and lifestyle changes, pain management, and possible complications (Chart 37-3). Consul-
tation with a dietitian is essential to determine how the patient's nutritional needs can best be met at home. The nurse teaches the patient or care provider about administration of enteral or parenteral nutrition. If chemotherapy or radiation is prescribed, the nurse provides explanations to the patient and family about what to expect, including the length of treatments, the expected side effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, neutropenia), and the need for transportation to appointments for treatment. Psychological counseling may also be helpful.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The need for ongoing care in the home will depend on the patient's condition and treatment. The home care nurse reinforces nutritional counseling and supervises the administration of any enteral or parenteral feedings; the patient or family member must become skillful in administering the feedings and in detecting and preventing untoward effects or complications related to the feedings (see Chapter 36 to review management of enteral and parenteral feedings). The nurse teaches the patient or a family member to record the patient's daily intake, output, and weight and explains strategies to manage pain, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms. The nurse also teaches the patient or caregiver to recognize and report signs and symptoms of complications that require medical attention, such as bleeding, obstruction, perforation, or any symptoms that become progressively worse. It is important to explain the chemotherapy or radiation therapy regimen. The patient and family need to know about the care that will be needed during and after treatments (see Chapter 16). Because the prognosis for gastric cancer is so poor, the nurse may need to assist the patient and family with decisions regarding end-of-life care. Referral to hospice may be warranted.

\section*{Gastric Surgery}

Gastric surgery may be performed on patients with peptic ulcers who have life-threatening hemorrhage, obstruction, perforation, or penetration or whose condition does not respond to medication. It also may be indicated for patients with gastric cancer or trauma. Surgical procedures include a vagotomy and pyloroplasty (disconnecting nerves that stimulate acid secretion and opening the pylorus), a partial gastrectomy, and a total gastrectomy (removal of the stomach) with either an end-to-end or an end-to-side esophagojejunal anastomosis (see Table 37-3).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING GASTRIC SURGERY}

\section*{Assessment}

Before surgery, the nurse assesses the patient's and family's knowledge of preoperative and postoperative surgical routines and the rationale for surgery. The nurse also assesses the patient's nutritional status: Has the patient lost weight? How much? Over how much time? Does the patient have nausea and vomiting? Has the patient had hematemesis? The nurse assesses for the presence of bowel sounds and palpates the abdomen to detect masses or tenderness.

After surgery, the nurse assesses the patient for complications secondary to the surgical intervention, such as hemorrhage, infection, abdominal distention, or decreased nutritional status. (See Chapters 20 and 25.)

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Anxiety related to surgical intervention
- Acute pain related to surgical incision
- Deficient knowledge about surgical procedures and postoperative course
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to poor nutrition before surgery and altered GI system after surgery

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

In addition to the complications to which all postoperative patients are subject, the patient undergoing gastric surgery is at increased risk for:
- Hemorrhage
- Dietary deficiencies
- Bile reflux
- Dumping syndrome

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient undergoing gastric surgery may include reduced anxiety, increased knowledge and understanding about the surgical procedure and postoperative course, optimal nutrition and management of the complications that can interfere with nutrition, relief of pain, avoidance of hemorrhage and steatorrhea, and enhanced self-care skills at home. General postoperative care for the patient who has received general anesthesia, as discussed in Chapter 20, should be followed.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

An important part of the preoperative nursing care involves allaying the patient's fears and anxieties about the impending surgery and its implications. The nurse encourages the patient to express feelings and answers the patient's and family's questions. If the patient has an acute obstruction, a perforated bowel, or an active GI hemorrhage, adequate psychological preparation may not be possible. In this event, the nurse caring for the patient after surgery should anticipate the concerns, fears, and questions that are likely to surface and should be available for support and further explanations.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

After surgery, analgesics may be administered as prescribed to relieve pain and discomfort. It is important to avoid sedating the patient so as not to impair his or her ability to perform pulmonary care activities (deep breathing and coughing) and to ambulate. The nurse assesses the effectiveness of analgesic intervention. Positioning the patient in a Fowler's position promotes comfort and allows emptying of the stomach after a partial gastrectomy.

The nurse maintains functioning of the NG tube to prevent distention and resultant pain and damage to the suture line. Normally, the amount of NG drainage after a total gastrectomy is small.

\section*{INCREASING KNOWLEDGE}

The nurse explains routine preoperative and postoperative activities to the patient, which include preoperative medications, NG intubation, IV fluids, abdominal dressings, and pulmonary care. These explanations need to be reinforced after surgery, especially if the patient had emergency surgery.

\section*{RESUMING ENTERAL INTAKE}

The patient's nutritional status is evaluated before surgery, because many patients with gastric cancer are malnourished and may require preoperative enteral or, more often, parenteral nutrition (see Chapter 36). After surgery, parenteral nutrition may be continued to meet caloric needs, to replace fluids lost through drainage and vomitus, and to support the patient metabolically until oral intake is adequate.

After the return of bowel sounds and removal of the NG tube, the nurse may give fluids, followed by food in small portions. The nurse adds foods gradually until the patient is able to eat six small meals a day and drink 120 mL of fluid between meals. The key to increasing the dietary content is to offer food and fluids gradually as tolerated and to recognize that each patient's tolerance is different.

\section*{RECOGNIZING OBSTACLES TO ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

\section*{Dysphagia and Gastric Retention}

Dysphagia may occur in patients who have had truncal vagotomy, a surgical procedure that can result in trauma to the lower esophagus. Gastric retention may be evidenced by abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting. Regurgitation may also occur if the patient has eaten too much or too quickly. It also may indicate that edema along the suture line is preventing fluids and food from moving into the intestinal tract. If gastric retention occurs, it may be necessary to reinstate NG suction; pressure must be low to avoid disrupting the suture line.

\section*{Bile Reflux}

Bile reflux gastritis and esophagitis may occur with the removal of the pylorus, which acts as a barrier to the reflux of duodenal contents. Burning epigastric pain and vomiting of bilious material manifest this condition. Eating or vomiting does not relieve the
situation. Agents that bind with bile acid, such as cholestyramine (Questran), may be helpful. Aluminum hydroxide gel (an antacid) and metoclopramide hydrochloride (Reglan) have been used with some success.

\section*{Dumping Syndrome}

The term dumping syndrome refers to an unpleasant set of vasomotor and GI symptoms that sometimes occur in patients who have had gastric surgery or a form of vagotomy. It may be the mechanical result of surgery in which a small gastric remnant is connected to the jejunum through a large opening. Foods high in carbohydrates and electrolytes must be diluted in the jejunum before absorption can take place, but the passage of food from the stomach remnant into the jejunum is too rapid to allow this to happen. The symptoms that occur are probably a result of rapid distention of the jejunal loop anastomosed to the stomach. The hypertonic intestinal contents draw extracellular fluid from the circulating blood volume into the jejunum to dilute the high concentration of electrolytes and sugars. The ingestion of fluid at mealtime is another factor that causes the stomach contents to empty rapidly into the jejunum.

Early symptoms include a sensation of fullness, weakness, faintness, dizziness, palpitations, diaphoresis, cramping pains, and diarrhea. Later, there is a rapid elevation of blood glucose, followed by increased insulin secretion. This results in a reactive hypoglycemia, which also is unpleasant for the patient. Vasomotor symptoms that occur 10 to 90 minutes after eating are pallor, perspiration, palpitations, headache, and feelings of warmth, dizziness, and even drowsiness. Anorexia may also be a result of the dumping syndrome.

Steatorrhea also may occur in the patient with gastric surgery. It is partially the result of rapid gastric emptying, which prevents adequate mixing with pancreatic and biliary secretions. In mild cases, reducing the intake of fat and administering an antimotility medication can control steatorrhea.

\section*{Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies}

Other dietary deficiencies the nurse should be aware of include malabsorption of organic iron, which may require supplementation with oral or parenteral iron, and a low serum level of vitamin $B_{12}$, which may require supplementation by the intramuscular route. Total gastrectomy results in lack of intrinsic factor, a gastric secretion required for the absorption of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ from the GI tract. Unless this vitamin is supplied by parenteral injection after gastrectomy, the patient inevitably will suffer vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency, which eventually leads to a condition identical to pernicious anemia. All manifestations of pernicious anemia, including macrocytic anemia and combined system disease, may be expected to develop within a period of 5 years or less; they progress in severity thereafter and, in the absence of therapy, are fatal. This complication is avoided by the regular monthly intramuscular injection of 100 to $1000 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ (usual dose is $300 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ ) of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

This regimen should be started without delay after gastrectomy. Weight loss is a common long-term problem because the patient experiences early fullness, which suppresses the appetite.

\section*{TEACHING DIETARY SELF-MANAGEMENT}

Because the patient may experience any of the described conditions affecting nutrition, nursing intervention includes proper dietary instruction. The following teaching points are emphasized:
- To delay stomach emptying, the patient should assume a low Fowler's position during mealtime, and after the meal the patient should lie down for 20 to 30 minutes.
- Antispasmodics, as prescribed, also may aid in delaying the emptying of the stomach.
- Fluid intake with meals is discouraged; instead, fluids may be consumed up to 1 hour before or 1 hour after mealtime.
- Meals should contain more dry items than liquid items.
- The patient can eat fat as tolerated but should keep carbohydrate intake low and avoid concentrated sources of carbohydrates.
- The patient should eat smaller but more frequent meals.
- Dietary supplements of vitamins and medium-chain triglycerides and injections of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and iron may be prescribed.
The nurse also gives instructions regarding enteral or parenteral supplementation if it is needed.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Occasionally hemorrhage complicates gastric surgery. The patient has the usual signs of rapid blood loss and shock (see Chapter 15) and may vomit considerable amounts of bright red blood. The nurse assesses NG drainage for type and amount; some bloody drainage for the first 12 hours is expected, but excessive bleeding should be reported. The nurse also assesses the abdominal dressing for bleeding. Because this situation is upsetting to the patient and family, the nurse should remain calm. The nurse performs emergency measures, such as NG lavage and administration of blood and blood products.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Nurse-patient teaching stems from the assessment of the patient's physical and psychological readiness to participate in self-care. The nurse provides information about nutrition, enteral or parenteral nutrition if required, nutritional supplements, pain management, and the symptoms of dumping syndrome and measures to use to prevent or minimize these symptoms (Chart 37-4). It is important to emphasize the continued need for vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ injections.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Both the patient and the family can benefit from a team approach to discharge planning. The team members include the home care nurse, physician, dietitian, social worker, patient and family; written instructions about meals, activities, medications, and follow-up care are helpful. The home care nurse supervises the administration of any enteral or parenteral feedings, emphasizing information about detection and prevention of untoward effects or complications related to the feedings. Information about community support groups is provided to the patient and family.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are working in the office of a gastroenterologist. You have a patient coming in today with symptoms of a peptic ulcer. What questions will you ask the patient, and what types of teaching regimen do you anticipate you will need to review with this patient?
2. You are caring for a patient who is to have a gastrectomy to treat gastric cancer. What nutritional needs do you anticipate for this patient preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and after discharge from the hospital?
3. Your 45 -year-old patient who weighs 375 pounds has had gastric bypass to treat morbid obesity. Describe the preoperative interventions for this patient. How would you modify your interventions if the patient had diabetes? If he had angina?

Diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract account for about $10 \%$ of the total burden of illness in the United States. They account for more than 50 million office visits annually and nearly 10 million hospital admissions. GI diseases probably cost the American public up to $\$ 100$ billion yearly and account for $10 \%$ of all deaths each year (Goldman \& Bennett, 2000). The types of diseases and disorders that affect the lower GI tract are many and varied.

In all age groups, a fast-paced lifestyle, high levels of stress, irregular eating habits, insufficient intake of fiber and water, and lack of daily exercise contribute to GI problems. Nurses can have an impact on these chronic problems by identifying behavior patterns that put patients at risk, by educating the public about prevention and management, and by helping those affected to improve their condition and prevent complications.

\section*{Abnormalities of Fecal Elimination}

Changes in patterns of fecal elimination are symptoms of functional disorders or disease of the GI tract. The most common changes seen are constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence. The nurse should be aware of the possible causes and therapeutic management of these problems and of nursing management techniques. Education is important for patients with these abnormalities.

\section*{CONSTIPATION}

Constipation is a term used to describe an abnormal infrequency or irregularity of defecation, abnormal hardening of stools that makes their passage difficult and sometimes painful, a decrease in stool volume, or retention of stool in the rectum for a prolonged period. Any variation from normal habits may be considered a problem.

Constipation can be caused by certain medications (ie, tranquilizers, anticholinergics, antidepressants, antihypertensives, opioids, antacids with aluminum, and iron); rectal or anal disorders (eg, hemorrhoids, fissures); obstruction (eg, cancer of the bowel); metabolic, neurologic, and neuromuscular conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, Hirschsprung's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis); endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism, pheochromocytoma); lead poisoning; and connective tissue disorders (eg, scleroderma, lupus erythematosus). Constipation is a major problem for patients taking opioids for chronic pain. Diseases of the colon commonly associated with constipa-
tion are irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and diverticular disease. Constipation can also occur with an acute disease process in the abdomen (eg, appendicitis).

Other causes include weakness, immobility, debility, fatigue, and an inability to increase intra-abdominal pressure to facilitate the passage of stools, as occurs with emphysema. Many people develop constipation because they do not take the time to defecte or they ignore the urge to defecate. In the United States, constipation is also a result of dietary habits (ie, low consumption of fiber and inadequate fluid intake), lack of regular exercise, and a stress-filled life.

Perceived constipation can also be a problem. This subjective problem occurs when an individual's bowel elimination pattern is not consistent with what he or she perceives as normal. Chronic laxative use is attributed to this problem and is a major health concern in the United States, especially among the elderly population.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The pathophysiology of constipation is poorly understood, but it is thought to include interference with one of three major functions of the colon: mucosal transport (ie, mucosal secretions facilitate the movement of colon contents), myoelectric activity (ie, mixing of the rectal mass and propulsive actions), or the processes of defection. Any of the causative factors previously identified can interfere with any of these three processes.

The urge to defecte is stimulated normally by rectal distention, which initiates a series of four actions: stimulation of the inhibitory rectoanal reflex, relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle, relaxation of the external sphincter muscle and muscles in the pelvic region, and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Interference with any of these processes can lead to constipation.

If all organic causes are eliminated, idiopathic constipation is diagnosed. If the urge to defecate is ignored, the rectal mucous membrane and musculature become insensitive to the presence of fecal masses, and consequently, a stronger stimulus is required to produce the necessary peristaltic rush for defection. The initial effect of fecal retention is to produce irritability of the colon, which at this stage frequently goes into spasm, especially after meals, giving rise to colicky midabdominal or low abdominal pains. After several years of this process, the colon loses muscular tone and becomes essentially unresponsive to normal stimuli. Atony or decreased muscle tone occurs with aging. This also leads to constipation because the stool is retained for longer periods.
appendicitis: infectious and inflammatory process of the appendix creating acute abdominal pain and nausea
azotorrhea: excess of nitrogenous matter in the feces or urine
colostomy: surgical opening into the colon by means of a stoma to allow drainage of bowel contents; one type of fecal diversion
diverticulitis: inflammation of a diverticulum from obstruction (by fecal matter), resulting in abscess formation
diverticulosis: presence of a number of diverticula in the intestine; common in middle age
diverticulum: saclike outpouching of the lining of the bowel protruding through the muscle of the intestinal wall, usually caused by high intraluminal pressure
hemorrhoids: dilated portions of the anal veins; can occur internal or external to the anal sphincter
ileostomy: surgical opening into the ileum by means of a stoma to allow drainage of bowel contents; one type of fecal diversion
inflammatory bowel disease: group of chronic disorders (most common are ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis [Crohn's disease]) that result in inflamma-
tion or ulceration (or both) of the bowel lining, associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and weight loss
irritable bowel syndrome: functional disorder that affects frequency of defection and consistency of stool; associated with crampy abdominal pain and bloating
malabsorption: impaired transport across the mucosa
peritonitis: inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity, usually as a result of a bacterial infection of an area in the GI tract with leakage of contents into the abdominal cavity

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations include abdominal distention, borborygmus (ie, gurgling or rumbling sound caused by passage of gas through the intestine), pain and pressure, decreased appetite, headache, fatigue, indigestion, a sensation of incomplete emptying, straining at stool, and the elimination of small-volume, hard, dry stools.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Chronic constipation is usually considered idiopathic, but secondary causes should be excluded. In patients with severe, intractable constipation, further diagnostic testing is needed (Wong, 1999). The diagnosis of constipation is based on results of the patient's history, physical examination, possibly a barium enema or sigmoidoscopy, and stool testing for occult blood. These tests are completed to determine whether this symptom results from spasm or narrowing of the bowel. Anorectal manometry (ie, pressure studies) may be performed to determine malfunction of the muscle and sphincter. Defecography and bowel transit studies can also assist in the diagnosis (see Chap. 34).

\section*{Complications}

Complications of constipation include hypertension, fecal impaction, hemorrhoids and fissures, and megacolon. Increased arterial pressure can occur with defecation. Straining at stool, which results in the Valsalva maneuver (ie, forcibly exhaling with the glottis closed), has a striking effect on arterial blood pressure. During active straining, the flow of venous blood in the chest is temporarily impeded because of increased intrathoracic pressure. This pressure tends to collapse the large veins in the chest. The atria and the ventricles receive less blood, and consequently less is delivered by the systolic contractions of the left ventricle. The cardiac output is decreased, and there is a transient drop in arterial pressure. Almost immediately after this period of hypotension, a rise in arterial pressure occurs; the pressure is elevated momentarily to a point far exceeding the original level (ie, rebound phenomenon). In patients with hypertension, this compensatory reaction may be exaggerated greatly, and the peaks of pressure attained may be dangerously high-sufficient to rupture a major artery in the brain or elsewhere.

Fecal impaction occurs when an accumulated mass of dry feces cannot be expelled. The mass may be palpable on digital examination, may produce pressure on the colonic mucosa that results in ulcer formation, and frequently may cause seepage of liquid stools.

Hemorrhoids and anal fissures can develop as a result of constipation. Hemorrhoids develop as a result of perianal vascular congestion caused by straining. Anal fissures may result from the passage of the hard stool through the anus, tearing the lining of the anal canal.

Megacolon is a dilated and atonic colon caused by a fecal mass that obstructs the passage of colon contents. Symptoms include constipation, liquid fecal incontinence, and abdominal distention. Megacolon can lead to perforation of the bowel.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Physician visits for constipation are more frequent by individuals 65 years of age or older (Yamada et al., 1999). Elderly people report problems with constipation five times more frequently than younger people. A number of factors contribute to this increased frequency. People who have loose-fitting dentures or have lost their teeth have difficulty chewing and frequently choose soft, processed foods that are low in fiber. Convenience foods, also low
in fiber, are widely used by those who have lost interest in eating. Some older people reduce their fluid intake if they are not eating regular meals. Lack of exercise and prolonged bed rest also contribute to constipation by decreasing abdominal muscle tone and intestinal motility as well as anal sphincter tone. Nerve impulses are dulled, and there is decreased sensation to defecate. Many older people who overuse laxatives in an attempt to have a daily bowel movement become dependent on them.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause of constipation and includes education, bowel habit training, increased fiber and fluid intake, and judicious use of laxatives. Management may also include discontinuing laxative abuse. Routine exercise to strengthen abdominal muscles is encouraged. Biofeedback is a technique that can be used to help patients learn to relax the sphincter mechanism to expel stool. Daily addition to the diet of 6 to 12 teaspoonfuls of unprocessed bran is recommended, especially for the treatment of constipation in the elderly. If laxative use is necessary, one of the following may be prescribed: bulk-forming agents, saline and osmotic agents, lubricants, stimulants, or fecal softeners. The physiologic action and patient education information related to these laxatives are identified in Table 38-1. Enemas and rectal suppositories are generally not recommended for constipation and should be reserved for the treatment of impaction or for preparing the bowel for surgery or diagnostic procedures. If longterm laxative use is necessary, a bulk-forming agent may be prescribed in combination with an osmotic laxative.

Doctors prescribe the use of specific medications to enhance colonic transit by increasing propulsive motor activity. Further studies are being carried out on cholinergic agents (eg, bethanechol), cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine), and prokinetic agents (eg, metoclopramide) to determine the role these agents can play in treating constipation (Yamada et al., 1999).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse elicits information about the onset and duration of constipation, current and past elimination patterns, the patient's expectation of normal bowel elimination, and lifestyle information (eg, exercise and activity level, occupation, food and fluid intake, and stress level) during the health history interview. Past medical and surgical history, current medications, and laxative and enema use are important, as is information about the sensation of rectal pressure or fullness, abdominal pain, excessive straining at defecation, and flatulence.

Patient education and health promotion are important functions of the nurse (Chart 38-1). After the health history is obtained, the nurse sets specific goals for teaching. Goals for the patient include restoring or maintaining a regular pattern of elimination, ensuring adequate intake of fluids and high-fiber foods, learning about methods to avoid constipation, relieving anxiety about bowel elimination patterns, and avoiding complications.

\section*{DIARRHEA}

Diarrhea is increased frequency of bowel movements (more than three per day), increased amount of stool (more than 200 g per day), and altered consistency (ie, looseness) of stool. It is usually associated with urgency, perianal discomfort, incontinence, or a combination of these factors. Any condition that causes increased intestinal secretions, decreased mucosal absorption, or altered

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline CLASSIFICATION & SAMPLE AGENT & ACTION & PATIENT EDUCATION \\
\hline Bulk forming & Psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (Metamucil) & Polysaccharides and cellulose derivatives mix with intestinal fluids, swell, and stimulate peristalsis. & Take with 8 oz water and follow with 8 oz water; do not take dry. Report abdominal distention or unusual amount of flatulence. \\
\hline Saline agent & Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia) & Nonabsorbable magnesium ions alter stool consistency by drawing water into the intestines by osmosis; peristalsis is stimulated. Action occurs within 2 h . & The liquid preparation is more effective than the tablet form. Only short-term use is recommended because of toxicity (CNS or neuromuscular depression, electrolyte imbalance). Magnesium laxatives should not be taken by patients with renal insufficiency. \\
\hline Lubricant & Mineral oil & Nonabsorbable hydrocarbons soften fecal matter by lubricating the intestinal mucosa; the passage of stool is facilitated. Action occurs within $6-8 \mathrm{~h}$. & Do not take with meals, because mineral oils can impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and delay gastric emptying. Swallow carefully, because drops of oil that gain access to the pharynx can produce a lipid pneumonia. \\
\hline Stimulant & Bisacodyl (Dulcolax) & Irritates the colon epithelium by stimulating sensory nerve endings and increasing mucosal secretions. Action occurs within 6-8 h. & Catharsis may cause fluid and electrolyte imbalance, especially in the elderly. Tablets should be swallowed, not crushed or chewed. Avoid milk or antacids within 1 hour of taking the medication, because the enteric coating may dissolve prematurely. \\

motility can produce diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and lactose intolerance are frequently the underlying disease processes that cause diarrhea (Stone et al., 1999).

Diarrhea can be acute or chronic. Acute diarrhea is most often associated with infection and is usually self-limiting; chronic diar-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-044.jpg?height=768&width=864&top_left_y=1842&top_left_x=202)
rhea persists for a longer period and may return sporadically. Diarrhea can be caused by certain medications (eg, thyroid hormone replacement, stool softeners and laxatives, antibiotics, chemotherapy, antacids), certain tube feeding formulas, metabolic and endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes, Addison's disease, thyrotoxicosis), and viral or bacterial infectious processes (eg, dysentery, shigellosis, food poisoning). Other disease processes associated with diarrhea are nutritional and malabsorptive disorders (eg, celiac disease), anal sphincter defect, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, paralytic ileus, intestinal obstruction, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Types of diarrhea include secretory, osmotic, and mixed diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea is usually high-volume diarrhea and is caused by increased production and secretion of water and electrolytes by the intestinal mucosa into the intestinal lumen. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when water is pulled into the intestines by the osmotic pressure of unabsorbed particles, slowing the reabsorption of water. Mixed diarrhea is caused by increased peristalsis (usually from IBD) and a combination of increased secretion and decreased absorption in the bowel. The physiology of diarrhea related to infection is discussed in Chapter 70.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

In addition to the increased frequency and fluid content of stools, the patient usually has abdominal cramps, distention, intestinal rumbling (ie, borborygmus), anorexia, and thirst. Painful spasmodic
contractions of the anus and ineffectual straining (ie, tenesmus) may occur with defection. Other symptoms depend on the cause and severity of the diarrhea but are related to dehydration and to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

Watery stools are characteristic of small bowel disease, whereas loose, semisolid stools are associated more often with disorders of the colon. Voluminous, greasy stools suggest intestinal malabsorption, and the presence of mucus and pus in the stools suggests inflammatory enteritis or colitis. Oil droplets on the toilet water are almost always diagnostic of pancreatic insufficiency. Nocturnal diarrhea may be a manifestation of diabetic neuropathy.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

When the cause of the diarrhea is not obvious, the following diagnostic tests may be performed: complete blood cell count, chemical profile, urinalysis, routine stool examination, and stool examinations for infectious or parasitic organisms, bacterial toxins, blood, fat, and electrolytes. Endoscopy or barium enema may assist in identifying the cause.

\section*{Complications}

Complications of diarrhea include the potential for cardiac dysrhythmias because of significant fluid and electrolyte loss (especially loss of potassium). Urinary output of less than 30 mL per hour for 2 to 3 consecutive hours, muscle weakness, paresthesia, hypotension, anorexia, and drowsiness with a potassium level of less than $3.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ must be reported. Decreased potassium levels cause cardiac dysrhythmias (ie, atrial and ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions) that can lead to death.

\section*{Medical Management}

Primary management is directed at controlling symptoms, preventing complications, and eliminating or treating the underlying disease. Certain medications (eg, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents) may reduce the severity of the diarrhea and treat the underlying disease.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse's role includes assessing and monitoring the characteristics and pattern of diarrhea. A health history addresses the patient's medication therapy, medical and surgical history, and dietary patterns and intake. Reports of recent exposure to an acute illness or recent travel to another geographic area are important. Assessment includes abdominal auscultation and palpation for abdominal tenderness. Inspection of the abdomen and mucous membranes and skin is important to determine hydration status. Stool samples are obtained for testing.

During an episode of acute diarrhea, the nurse encourages bed rest and intake of liquids and foods low in bulk until the acute attack subsides. When food intake is tolerated, the nurse recommends a bland diet of semisolid and solid foods. The patient should avoid caffeine, carbonated beverages, and very hot and very cold foods, because they stimulate intestinal motility. It may be necessary to restrict milk products, fat, whole-grain products, fresh fruits, and vegetables for several days. The nurse administers antidiarrheal medications such as diphenoxylate (Lomotil) and loperamide (Imodium) as prescribed. Intravenous fluid therapy may be necessary for rapid rehydration, especially for the el-
derly and those with preexisting GI conditions (eg, IBD). It is important to closely monitor serum electrolyte levels. The nurse immediately reports evidence of dysrhythmias or a change in the level of consciousness.

> NURSING ALERT Elderly persons can become dehydrated quickly and develop low potassium levels (ie, hypokalemia) as a result of diarrhea. The older person taking digitalis must be aware of how quickly dehydration and hypokalemia can occur with diarrhea. The nurse instructs this person to recognize the signs of hypokalemia, because low levels of potassium intensify the action of digitalis, which can lead to digitalis toxicity.

The perianal area may become excoriated because diarrheal stool contains digestive enzymes that can irritate the skin. The patient should follow a perianal skin care routine to decrease irritation and excoriation. It is important to use skin sealants and moisture barriers as needed. The older person's skin is very sensitive because of decreased turgor and reduced subcutaneous fat layers.

\section*{FECAL INCONTINENCE}

The term fecal incontinence describes the involuntary passage of stool from the rectum. Several factors influence fecal continencethe ability of the rectum to sense and accommodate stool, the amount and consistency of stool, the integrity of the anal sphincters and musculature, and rectal motility.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Fecal incontinence can result from trauma (eg, after surgical procedures involving the rectum), a neurologic disorder (eg, stroke, multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, dementia), inflammation, infection, radiation treatment, fecal impaction, pelvic floor relaxation, laxative abuse, medications, or advancing age (ie, weakness or loss of anal or rectal muscle tone). It is an embarrassing and socially incapacitating problem that requires a many-tiered approach to treatment and much adaptation on the patient's part.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients may have minor soiling, occasional urgency and loss of control, or complete incontinence. Patients may also experience poor control of flatus, diarrhea, or constipation.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic studies are necessary because the treatment of fecal incontinence depends on the cause. A rectal examination and other endoscopic examinations such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy are performed to rule out tumors, inflammation, or fissures. X-ray studies such as barium enema, computed tomography (CT) scans, anorectal manometry, and transit studies may be helpful in identifying alterations in intestinal mucosa and muscle tone or in detecting other structural or functional problems.

\section*{Medical Management}

Although there is no known cause or cure for fecal incontinence, specific management techniques can help the patient achieve a better quality of life. If fecal incontinence is related to diarrhea,
the incontinence may disappear when diarrhea is successfully treated. Fecal incontinence is frequently a symptom of a fecal impaction. After the impaction is removed and the rectum is cleansed, normal functioning of the anorectal area can resume. If the fecal incontinence is related to a more permanent condition, other treatments are initiated. Biofeedback therapy can be of assistance if the problem is decreased sensory awareness or sphincter control. Bowel training programs can also be effective. Surgical procedures include surgical reconstruction, sphincter repair, or fecal diversion.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse takes a thorough health history, including information about previous surgical procedures, chronic illnesses, bowel habits and problems, and current medication regimen. The nurse also completes an examination of the rectal area.

The nurse initiates a bowel-training program that involves setting a schedule to establish bowel regularity. The goal is to assist the patient to achieve fecal continence. If this is not possible, the goal should be to manage the problem so the person can have predictable, planned elimination (Stone et al., 1999). Sometimes, it is necessary to use suppositories to stimulate the anal reflex. After the patient has achieved a regular schedule, the suppository can be discontinued. Biofeedback can be used in conjunction with these therapies to help the patient improve sphincter contractility and rectal sensitivity.

Fecal incontinence can also cause problems with perineal skin integrity. Maintaining skin integrity is a priority, especially in the debilitated or elderly patient. Incontinence briefs, although helpful in containing the fecal material, allow for increased skin contact with the feces and may cause excoriation of the skin. The nurse encourages and teaches meticulous skin hygiene.

Continence sometimes cannot be achieved, and the nurse assists the patient and family to accept and cope with this chronic situation. The patient can use fecal incontinence devices, which include external collection devices and internal drainage systems. External devices are special pouches that are drainable. They are attached to a synthetic adhesive skin barrier specially designed to conform to the buttocks. Internal drainage systems can be used to eliminate fecal skin contact and are especially useful when there is extensive excoriation or skin breakdown. A large catheter is inserted into the rectum and is connected to a drainage system.

\section*{IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME}

IBS is one of the most common GI problems. Approximately one in six otherwise healthy persons report classic symptoms of IBS (Wolfe, 2000). It occurs more commonly in women than in men, and the cause is still unknown. Although no anatomic or biochemical abnormalities have been found that explain the common symptoms, various factors are associated with the syndrome: heredity, psychological stress or conditions such as depression and anxiety, a diet high in fat and stimulating or irritating foods, alcohol consumption, and smoking. The small intestine has become a focus of investigation as an additional site of dysmotility in IBS, and cluster contractions in the jejunum and ileum are being studied (Wolfe, 2000). The diagnosis is made only after tests have been completed that prove the absence of structural or other disorders.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

IBS results from a functional disorder of intestinal motility. The change in motility may be related to the neurologic regulatory system, infection or irritation, or a vascular or metabolic disturbance. The peristaltic waves are affected at specific segments of the intestine and in the intensity with which they propel the fecal matter forward. There is no evidence of inflammation or tissue changes in the intestinal mucosa.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

There is a wide variability in symptom presentation. Symptoms range in intensity and duration from mild and infrequent to severe and continuous. The primary symptom is an alteration in bowel patterns-constipation, diarrhea, or a combination of both. Pain, bloating, and abdominal distention often accompany this change in bowel pattern. The abdominal pain is sometimes precipitated by eating and is frequently relieved by defectation.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A definite diagnosis of IBS requires tests that prove the absence of structural or other disorders. Stool studies, contrast x-ray studies, and proctoscopy may be performed to rule out other colon diseases. Barium enema and colonoscopy may reveal spasm, distention, or mucus accumulation in the intestine (Fig. 38-1). Manometry and electromyography are used to study intraluminal pressure changes generated by spasticity.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of treatment are aimed at relieving abdominal pain, controlling the diarrhea or constipation, and reducing stress. Restriction and then gradual reintroduction of foods that are possibly irritating may help determine what types of food are acting as irritants (eg, beans, caffeinated products, fried foods, alcohol, spicy foods). A healthy, high-fiber diet is prescribed to help control the diarrhea and constipation. Exercise can assist in reducing anxiety and increasing intestinal motility. Patients often find it helpful to participate in a stress reduction or behavior-modification program.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 38-1 In IBS, the spastic contractions of the bowel can be seen in x-ray contrast studies.}
\end{figure}

Hydrophilic colloids (ie, bulk) and antidiarrheal agents (eg, loperamide) may be given to control the diarrhea and fecal urgency. Antidepressants can assist in treating underlying anxiety and depression. Anticholinergics and calcium channel blockers decrease smooth muscle spasm, decreasing cramping and constipation.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse's role is to provide patient and family education. The nurse emphasizes teaching and reinforces good dietary habits. The patient is encouraged to eat at regular times and to chew food slowly and thoroughly. The patient should understand that, although adequate fluid intake is necessary, fluid should not be taken with meals because this results in abdominal distention. Alcohol use and cigarette smoking are discouraged.

\section*{CONDITIONS OF MALABSORPTION}

Malabsorption is the inability of the digestive system to absorb one or more of the major vitamins (especially vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ ), minerals (ie, iron and calcium), and nutrients (ie, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins). Interruptions in the complex digestive process may occur anywhere in the digestive system and cause decreased absorption. Diseases of the small intestine are the most common cause of malabsorption.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The conditions that cause malabsorption can be grouped into the following categories:
- Mucosal (transport) disorders causing generalized malabsorption (eg, celiac sprue, regional enteritis, radiation enteritis)
- Infectious diseases causing generalized malabsorption (eg, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, tropical sprue, Whipple's disease)
- Luminal problems causing malabsorption (eg, bile acid deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pancreatic insufficiency)
- Postoperative malabsorption (eg, after gastric or intestinal resection)
- Disorders that cause malabsorption of specific nutrients (eg, disaccharidase deficiency leading to lactose intolerance)
Table 38-2 lists the clinical and pathologic aspects of malabsorptive diseases.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The hallmarks of malabsorption syndrome from any cause are diarrhea or frequent, loose, bulky, foul-smelling stools that have increased fat content and are often grayish. Patients often have associated abdominal distention, pain, increased flatus, weakness, weight loss, and a decreased sense of well-being. The chief result of malabsorption is malnutrition, manifested by weight loss and other signs of vitamin and mineral deficiency (eg, easy bruising, osteoporosis, anemia). Patients with a malabsorption syndrome, if untreated, become weak and emaciated because of starvation and dehydration. Failure to absorb the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K causes a corresponding avitaminosis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Several diagnostic tests may be prescribed, including stool studies for quantitative and qualitative fat analysis, lactose tolerance tests, D-xylose absorption tests, and Schilling tests. The hydrogen breath
test that is used to evaluate carbohydrate absorption (see Chap. 34) is performed if carbohydrate malabsorption is suspected. Endoscopy with biopsy of the mucosa is the best diagnostic tool. Biopsy of the small intestine is performed to assay enzyme activity or to identify infection or destruction of mucosa. Ultrasound studies, CT scans, and x-ray findings can reveal pancreatic or intestinal tumors that may be the cause. A complete blood cell count is used to detect anemia. Pancreatic function tests can assist in the diagnosis of specific disorders.

\section*{Medical Management}

Intervention is aimed at avoiding dietary substances that aggravate malabsorption and at supplementing nutrients that have been lost. Common supplements are water-soluble vitamins (eg, $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, folic acid), fat-soluble vitamins (ie, A, D, and K), and minerals (eg, calcium, iron). Primary disease states may be managed surgically or nonsurgically. Dietary therapy is aimed at reducing gluten intake in patients with celiac sprue. Folic acid supplements are prescribed for patients with tropical sprue. Antibiotics (eg, tetracycline, ampicillin) are sometimes needed in the treatment of tropical sprue and bacterial overgrowth syndromes. Antidiarrheal agents may be used to decrease intestinal spasms. Parenteral fluids may be necessary to treat dehydration.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse provides patient and family education regarding diet and the use of nutritional supplements (Chart 38-2). It is important to monitor patients with diarrhea for fluid and electrolyte imbalances. The nurse conducts ongoing assessments to determine if the clinical manifestations related to the nutritional deficits have abated. Patient education includes information about the risk of osteoporosis related to malabsorption of calcium.

\section*{Acute Inflammatory Intestinal Disorders}

Any part of the lower GI tract is susceptible to acute inflammation caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Two such situations are appendicitis and diverticulitis. These two conditions can lead to peritonitis, an inflammatory process within the abdomen.

\section*{APPENDICITIS}

The appendix is a small, finger-like appendage about 10 cm (4 in) long that is attached to the cecum just below the ileocecal valve. The appendix fills with food and empties regularly into the cecum. Because it empties inefficiently and its lumen is small, the appendix is prone to obstruction and is particularly vulnerable to infection (ie, appendicitis).

Appendicitis, the most common cause of acute abdomen in the United States, is the most common reason for emergency abdominal surgery. About $7 \%$ of the population will have appendicitis at some time in their lives; males are affected more than females, and teenagers more than adults. Although it can occur at any age, it occurs most frequently between the ages of 10 and 30 years (Yamada et al., 1999).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The appendix becomes inflamed and edematous as a result of either becoming kinked or occluded by a fecalith (ie, hardened mass of stool), tumor, or foreign body. The inflammatory process

increases intraluminal pressure, initiating a progressively severe, generalized or upper abdominal pain that becomes localized in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen within a few hours. Eventually, the inflamed appendix fills with pus.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Vague epigastric or periumbilical pain progresses to right lower quadrant pain and is usually accompanied by a low-grade fever and nausea and sometimes by vomiting. Loss of appetite is common. Local tenderness is elicited at McBurney's point when pressure is applied (Fig. 38-2). Rebound tenderness (ie, production or intensification of pain when pressure is released) may be present. The extent of tenderness and muscle spasm and the existence of constipation or diarrhea depend not so much on the severity of the appendiceal infection as on the location of the appendix. If the appendix curls around behind the cecum, pain and tenderness may be felt in the lumbar region. If its tip is in the pelvis, these signs may be elicited only on rectal examination. Pain on
defecation suggests that the tip of the appendix is resting against the rectum; pain on urination suggests that the tip is near the bladder or impinges on the ureter. Some rigidity of the lower portion of the right rectus muscle may occur. Rovsing's sign may be elicited by palpating the left lower quadrant; this paradoxically causes pain to be felt in the right lower quadrant (see Fig. 38-2). If the appendix has ruptured, the pain becomes more diffuse; abdominal distention develops as a result of paralytic ileus, and the patient's condition worsens.

Constipation can also occur with an acute process such as appendicitis. Laxatives administered in this instance may produce perforation of the inflamed appendix. In general, a laxative or cathartic should never be given while the person has fever, nausea, or pain.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is based on results of a complete physical examination and on laboratory and x-ray findings. The complete blood cell count demonstrates an elevated white blood cell count. The leukocyte

Managing Lactose Intolerance
The following information may be helpful for patients who cannot tolerate lactose:
- Deficiency of lactase, a digestive enzyme essential for the absorption of lactose from the intestines, results in an intolerance to milk.
- Elimination of milk and milk substances can abolish symptoms.
- Many processed foods have fillers, such as dried milk, added to them.
- Pretreatment of foods with lactase preparations (eg, LactAid drops) before ingestion can reduce symptoms.
- Most people can tolerate 1 to 2 cups of milk or milk products daily without major problems; they are best tolerated if ingested in small amounts during the day.
- Lactase activity of yogurt with "active cultures" helps the digestion of lactose within the intestine better than lactase preparations do.
- Milk and milk products are rich sources of calcium and vitamin D; elimination of milk from the diet may result in calcium and vitamin D deficiencies; decreased intake without supplements can lead to osteoporosis.
count may exceed 10,000 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, and the neutrophil count may exceed $75 \%$. Abdominal x-ray films, ultrasound studies, and CT scans may reveal a right lower quadrant density or localized distention of the bowel.

\section*{Complications}

The major complication of appendicitis is perforation of the appendix, which can lead to peritonitis or an abscess. The incidence of perforation is $10 \%$ to $32 \%$. The incidence is higher in young

children and the elderly. Perforation generally occurs 24 hours after the onset of pain. Symptoms include a fever of $37.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ or higher, a toxic appearance, and continued abdominal pain or tenderness.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Acute appendicitis does not occur frequently in the elderly population. Classic signs and symptoms are altered and may vary greatly. Pain may be absent or minimal. Symptoms may be vague, suggesting bowel obstruction or another process. Fever and leukocytosis may not be present. As a result, diagnosis and prompt treatment may be delayed, causing potential complications and mortality. The patient may have no symptoms until the appendix ruptures. The incidence of perforated appendix is higher in the elderly population because many of these patients do not seek health care as quickly as younger patients.

\section*{Medical Management}

Surgery is indicated if appendicitis is diagnosed. To correct or prevent fluid and electrolyte imbalance and dehydration, antibiotics and intravenous fluids are administered until surgery is performed. Analgesics can be administered after the diagnosis is made. Appendectomy (ie, surgical removal of the appendix) is performed as soon as possible to decrease the risk of perforation. It may be performed under a general or spinal anesthetic with a low abdominal incision or by laparoscopy.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Goals include relieving pain, preventing fluid volume deficit, reducing anxiety, eliminating infection from the potential or actual disruption of the GI tract, maintaining skin integrity, and attaining optimal nutrition.

The nurse prepares the patient for surgery, which includes an intravenous infusion to replace fluid loss and promote adequate renal function and antibiotic therapy to prevent infection. If there is evidence or likelihood of paralytic ileus, a nasogastric tube is inserted. An enema is not administered because it can lead to perforation.

After surgery, the nurse places the patient in a semi-Fowler position. This position reduces the tension on the incision and abdominal organs, helping to reduce pain. An opioid, usually morphine sulfate, is prescribed to relieve pain. When tolerated, oral fluids are administered. Any patient who was dehydrated before surgery receives intravenous fluids. Food is provided as desired and tolerated on the day of surgery.

The patient may be discharged on the day of surgery if the temperature is within normal limits, there is no undue discomfort in the operative area, and the appendectomy was uncomplicated. Discharge teaching for the patient and family is imperative. The nurse instructs the patient to make an appointment to have the surgeon remove the sutures between the fifth and seventh days after surgery. Incision care and activity guidelines are discussed; normal activity can usually be resumed within 2 to 4 weeks.

If there is a possibility of peritonitis, a drain is left in place at the area of the incision. Patients at risk for this complication may be kept in the hospital for several days and are monitored carefully for signs of intestinal obstruction or secondary hemorrhage. Secondary abscesses may form in the pelvis, under the diaphragm, or
in the liver, elevating the temperature and pulse rate and increasing the leukocyte count.

When the patient is ready for discharge, the nurse teaches the patient and family to care for the incision and perform dressing changes and irrigations as prescribed. A home care nurse may be needed to assist with this care and to monitor the patient for complications and wound healing. Other potential complications of appendectomy are listed in Table 38-3.

\section*{DIVERTICULAR DISEASE}

A diverticulum is a saclike outpouching of the lining of the bowel that extends through a defect in the muscle layer. Diverticula may occur anywhere along the GI tract. Diverticulosis exists when multiple diverticula are present without inflammation or symptoms. Diverticular disease of the colon is very common in developed countries, and its prevalence increases with age. More than $35 \%$ of Americans older than 60 years of age have diverticulosis. The incidence increases to 50\% among those in the ninth decade of life (Keighley, 1999). Diverticulitis results when food and bacteria retained in a diverticulum produce infection and inflammation that can impede drainage and lead to perforation or abscess formation. Diverticulitis is most common ( $95 \%$ ) in the sigmoid colon. Approximately $20 \%$ of patients with diverticulosis have diverticulitis at some point. A congenital predisposition is suspected when the disorder occurs in those younger than 40 years of age. A low intake of dietary fiber is considered a predisposing factor, but the exact cause is unknown. Diverticulitis may occur in acute attacks or may persist as a continuing, smoldering infection. Most patients remain entirely asymptomatic. The symptoms manifested generally result from its potential complications-abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, and hemorrhage.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A diverticulum forms when the mucosa and submucosal layers of the colon herniate through the muscular wall because of high intraluminal pressure, low volume in the colon (ie, fiber-deficient contents), and decreased muscle strength in the colon wall (ie, muscular hypertrophy from hardened fecal masses). Bowel con-
tents can accumulate in the diverticulum and decompose, causing inflammation and infection. A diverticulum can become obstructed and then inflamed if the obstruction continues. The inflammation tends to spread to the surrounding bowel wall, giving rise to irritability and spasticity of the colon (ie, diverticulitis). Abscesses develop and may eventually perforate, leading to peritonitis and erosion of the blood vessels (arterial) with bleeding.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Chronic constipation often precedes the development of diverticulosis by many years. Frequently, no problematic symptoms occur with diverticulosis. Signs of acute diverticulosis are bowel irregularity and intervals of diarrhea, abrupt onset of crampy pain in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, and a low-grade fever. The patient may have nausea and anorexia, and some bloating or abdominal distention may occur. With repeated local inflammation of the diverticula, the large bowel may narrow with fibrotic strictures, leading to cramps, narrow stools, and increased constipation. Weakness, fatigue, and anorexia are common symptoms. With acute diverticulosis, the patient reports mild to severe pain in the lower left quadrant. The condition, if untreated, can lead to septicemia.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A CT scan is the procedure of choice and can reveal abscesses. Abdominal x-ray findings may demonstrate free air under the diaphragm if a perforation has occurred from the diverticulitis. Diverticulosis may be diagnosed using barium enema, which shows narrowing of the colon and thickened muscle layers. If there are symptoms of peritoneal irritation and when the diagnosis is diverticulitis, barium enema is contraindicated because of the potential for perforation.

A colonoscopy may be performed if there is no acute diverticulitis or after resolution of an acute episode to visualize the colon, determine the extent of the disease, and rule out other conditions. Laboratory tests that assist in diagnosis include a complete blood cell count, revealing an elevated leukocyte count, and elevated sedimentation rate.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Complications}

Complications of diverticulitis include peritonitis, abscess formation, and bleeding. If an abscess develops, the associated findings are tenderness, a palpable mass, fever, and leukocytosis. An inflamed diverticulum that perforates results in abdominal pain localized over the involved segment, usually the sigmoid; local abscess or peritonitis follows. Abdominal pain, a rigid boardlike abdomen, loss of bowel sounds, and signs and symptoms of shock occur with peritonitis. Noninflamed or slightly inflamed diverticula may erode areas adjacent to arterial branches, causing massive rectal bleeding.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The incidence of diverticular disease increases with age because of degeneration and structural changes in the circular muscle layers of the colon and because of cellular hypertrophy. The symptoms are less pronounced in the elderly than in other adults. The elderly may not have abdominal pain until infection occurs. They may delay reporting symptoms because they fear surgery or are afraid that they may have cancer. Blood in the stool is overlooked frequently, especially in the elderly, because of a failure to examine the stool or the inability to see changes because of diminished vision.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{DIETARY AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT}

Diverticulitis can usually be treated on an outpatient basis with diet and medicine therapy. When symptoms occur, rest, analgesics, and antispasmodics are recommended. Initially, the diet is clear liquid until the inflammation subsides; then, a high-fiber, low-fat diet is recommended. This type of diet helps to increase stool volume, decrease colonic transit time, and reduce intraluminal pressure. Antibiotics are prescribed for 7 to 10 days. A bulkforming laxative also is prescribed.

In acute cases of diverticulitis with significant symptoms, hospitalization is required. Hospitalization is often indicated for those who are elderly, immunocompromised, or taking corticosteroids. Withholding oral intake, administering intravenous fluids, and instituting nasogastric suctioning if vomiting or distention occurs rests the bowel. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed for 7 to 10 days. An opioid is prescribed for pain relief; morphine is not used because it increases segmentation and intraluminal pressures. Oral intake is increased as symptoms subside. A low-fiber diet may be necessary until signs of infection decrease.

Antispasmodics such as propantheline bromide (Pro-Banthine) and oxyphencyclimine (Daricon) may be prescribed. Normal stools can be achieved by using bulk preparations (Metamucil) or stool softeners (Colace), by instilling warm oil into the rectum, or by inserting an evacuant suppository (Dulcolax). Such a prophylactic plan can reduce the bacterial flora of the bowel, diminish the bulk of the stool, and soften the fecal mass so that it moves more easily through the area of inflammatory obstruction.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Although acute diverticulitis usually subsides with medical management, immediate surgical intervention is necessary if complications (eg, perforation, peritonitis, abscess formation, hemorrhage, obstruction) occur. Alternatively, when the acute episode of diverticulitis resolves, surgery may be recommended to prevent repeated episodes. Two types of surgery are considered:
- One-stage resection in which the inflamed area is removed and a primary end-to-end anastomosis is completed
- Multiple-staged procedures for complications such as obstruction or perforation (Fig. 38-3)

The type of surgery performed depends on the extent of complications found during surgery. When possible, the area of diverticulitis is resected and the remaining bowel is joined end to end (ie, primary resection and end-to-end anastomosis). This is performed through traditional surgical or laparoscopically assisted colectomy. A two-stage resection may be performed in which the diseased colon is resected (as in a one-stage procedure) but no anastomosis is performed; both ends of the bowel are brought out onto the abdomen as stomas. This "double-barrel" colostomy is then reanastomosed in a later procedure. Fecal diversion procedures are discussed later in this chapter.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH DIVERTICULITIS}

\section*{Assessment}

During the health history, the nurse asks the patient about the onset and duration of pain and about past and present elimination patterns. The nurse reviews dietary habits to determine fiber intake and asks the patient about straining at stool, history of constipation with periods of diarrhea, tenesmus (ie, spasms of the anal sphincter with pain and persistent urge to defecate), abdominal bloating, and distention.

Assessment includes auscultation for the presence and character of bowel sounds and palpation for lower left quadrant pain, tenderness, or firm mass. The stool is inspected for pus, mucus, or blood. It is important to monitor temperature, pulse, and blood pressure for abnormal variations.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Constipation related to narrowing of the colon from thickened muscular segments and strictures
- Acute pain related to inflammation and infection

\end{figure}

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Peritonitis
- Abscess formation
- Bleeding

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include attainment and maintenance of normal elimination patterns, pain relief, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING NORMAL ELIMINATION PATTERNS}

The nurse recommends a fluid intake of 2 L per day (within limits of the patient's cardiac and renal reserve) and suggests foods that are soft but have increased fiber to increase the bulk of the stool and facilitate peristalsis, thereby promoting defecation. An individualized exercise program is encouraged to improve abdominal muscle tone. It is important to review the patient's daily routine to establish a schedule for meals and a set time for defecation and to assist in identifying habits that may have suppressed the urge to defecate. The nurse encourages daily intake of bulk laxatives such as Metamucil, which helps to propel feces through the colon. Stool softeners are administered as prescribed to decrease straining at stool, which decreases intestinal pressure. Oil retention enemas may be prescribed to soften the stool, making it easier to pass.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Analgesics (eg, meperidine) to relieve the pain of diverticulitis and antispasmodic agents to decrease intestinal spasm are administered as prescribed. The nurse records the intensity, duration, and location of pain to determine if the inflammatory process worsens or subsides.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The major nursing focus is to prevent complications by identifying patients at risk and managing their symptoms as needed. The nurse assesses for the following signs of perforation:
- Increased abdominal pain and tenderness accompanied by abdominal rigidity
- Elevated white blood cell count
- Elevated sedimentation rate
- Increased temperature
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension

Perforation is a surgical emergency. The clinical manifestations of perforation and peritonitis and the care of the patient with peritonitis are presented in the next section. The nurse monitors vital signs and urine output and administers intravenous fluids to replace volume loss as needed.

\section*{HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Because patients and their family members and health care providers tend to focus on the most obvious needs and issues, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of continuing health promotion and screening practices. The nurse educates patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past about their importance and refers the patients to appropriate health care providers.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include the following:
1. Attains a normal pattern of elimination
a. Reports less abdominal cramping and pain
b. Reports the passage of soft, formed stool without pain
c. Adds unprocessed bran to foods
d. Drinks at least 10 glasses of fluid each day (if fluid intake is tolerated)
e. Exercises daily
2. Reports decreased pain
a. Requests analgesics as needed
b. Adheres to a low-fiber diet during acute episodes
3. Recovers without complications
a. Is afebrile
b. Has normal blood pressure
c. Has a soft, nontender abdomen with normal bowel sounds
d. Maintains adequate urine output
e. Has no blood in the stool

\section*{PERITONITIS}

Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, the serous membrane lining the abdominal cavity and covering the viscera. Usually, it is a result of bacterial infection; the organisms come from diseases of the GI tract or, in women, from the internal reproductive organs. Peritonitis can also result from external sources such as injury or trauma (eg, gunshot wound, stab wound) or an inflammation that extends from an organ outside the peritoneal area, such as the kidney. The most common bacteria implicated are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. Inflammation and paralytic ileus are the direct effects of the infection. Other common causes of peritonitis are appendicitis, perforated ulcer, diverticulitis, and bowel perforation (Fig. 38-4). Peritonitis may also be associated with abdominal surgical procedures and peritoneal dialysis.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-052.jpg?height=868&width=877&top_left_y=1686&top_left_x=1117}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 38-4 Common gastrointestinal causes of peritonitis.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Peritonitis is caused by leakage of contents from abdominal organs into the abdominal cavity, usually as a result of inflammation, infection, ischemia, trauma, or tumor perforation. Bacterial proliferation occurs. Edema of the tissues results, and exudation of fluid develops in a short time. Fluid in the peritoneal cavity becomes turbid with increasing amounts of protein, white blood cells, cellular debris, and blood. The immediate response of the intestinal tract is hypermotility, soon followed by paralytic ileus with an accumulation of air and fluid in the bowel.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the inflammation. The early clinical manifestations of peritonitis frequently are the symptoms of the disorder causing the condition. At first, a diffuse type of pain is felt. The pain tends to become constant, localized, and more intense near the site of the inflammation. Movement usually aggravates it. The affected area of the abdomen becomes extremely tender and distended, and the muscles become rigid. Rebound tenderness and paralytic ileus may be present. Usually, nausea and vomiting occur and peristalsis is diminished. The temperature and pulse rate increase, and there is almost always an elevation of the leukocyte count.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The leukocyte count is elevated. The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels may be low if blood loss has occurred. Serum electrolyte studies may reveal altered levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride.

An abdominal x-ray is obtained, and findings may show air and fluid levels as well as distended bowel loops. A CT scan of the abdomen may show abscess formation. Peritoneal aspiration and culture and sensitivity studies of the aspirated fluid may reveal infection and identify the causative organisms.

\section*{Complications}

Frequently, the inflammation is not localized and the whole abdominal cavity becomes involved in a generalized sepsis. Sepsis is the major cause of death from peritonitis. Shock may result from septicemia or hypovolemia. The inflammatory process may cause intestinal obstruction, primarily from the development of bowel adhesions.

The two most common postoperative complications are wound evisceration and abscess formation. Any suggestion from the patient that an area of the abdomen is tender or painful or "feels as if something just gave way" must be reported. The sudden occurrence of serosanguineous wound drainage strongly suggests wound dehiscence (see Chap. 20).

\section*{Medical Management}

Fluid, colloid, and electrolyte replacement is the major focus of medical management. The administration of several liters of an isotonic solution is prescribed. Hypovolemia occurs because massive amounts of fluid and electrolytes move from the intestinal lumen into the peritoneal cavity and deplete the fluid in the vascular space.

Analgesics are prescribed for pain. Antiemetics are administered as prescribed for nausea and vomiting. Intestinal intubation and suction assist in relieving abdominal distention and in promoting intestinal function. Fluid in the abdominal cavity can
cause pressure that restricts expansion of the lungs and causes respiratory distress. Oxygen therapy by nasal cannula or mask can promote adequate oxygenation, but airway intubation and ventilatory assistance occasionally are required.

Massive antibiotic therapy is usually initiated early in the treatment of peritonitis. Large doses of a broad-spectrum antibiotic are administered intravenously until the specific organism causing the infection is identified and the appropriate antibiotic therapy can be initiated.

Surgical objectives include removing the infected material and correcting the cause. Surgical treatment is directed toward excision (ie, appendix), resection with or without anastomosis (ie, intestine), repair (ie, perforation), and drainage (ie, abscess). With extensive sepsis, a fecal diversion may need to be created.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Ongoing assessment of pain, vital signs, GI function, and fluid and electrolyte balance is important. The nurse reports the nature of the pain, its location in the abdomen, and any shifts in location. Administering analgesic medication and positioning the patient for comfort are helpful in decreasing pain. The patient is placed on the side with knees flexed; this position decreases tension on the abdominal organs. Accurate recording of all intake and output and central venous pressure assists in calculating fluid replacement. The nurse administers and monitors closely intravenous fluids.

Signs that indicate that peritonitis is subsiding include a decrease in temperature and pulse rate, softening of the abdomen, return of peristaltic sounds, passing of flatus, and bowel movements. The nurse increases fluid and food intake gradually and reduces parenteral fluids as prescribed. A worsening clinical condition may indicate a complication, and the nurse must prepare the patient for emergency surgery.

Drains are frequently inserted during the surgical procedure, and the nurse must observe and record the character of the drainage postoperatively. Care must be taken when moving and turning the patient to prevent the drains from being dislodged. It is also important for the nurse to prepare the patient and family for discharge by teaching the patient to care for the incision and drains if the patient will be sent home with the drains still in place.

\section*{Inflammatory Bowel Disease}

The term inflammatory bowel disease refers to two chronic inflammatory GI disorders: regional enteritis (ie, Crohn's disease or granulomatous colitis) and ulcerative colitis. Both disorders have striking similarities but also several differences. Table 38-4 compares regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis.

The incidence of IBD in the United States has increased in the past century; 10,000 to 15,000 new cases occur annually (Yamada et al., 1999). In the past, a higher rate was observed among Caucasians in general and the Jewish population in particular. Data now indicate a higher risk for African Americans and a lower risk for Jewish people, and women appear to be at higher risk than before. People between the ages of 10 and 30 are at greatest risk.

Despite vast amounts of research, the cause of IBD is still unknown. Researchers think it is triggered by environmental agents such as pesticides, food additives, tobacco, and radiation (Kirsner \& Shorter, 2000). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been found to exacerbate IBD. Allergies and immune disorders have also been suggested as causes. Abnormal response to dietary

or bacterial antigens has been studied extensively, and genetic factors also are being studied. There is a high prevalence of coexistent IBS, which complicates the overall symptom presentation.

\section*{REGIONAL ENTERITIS (CROHN'S DISEASE)}

Regional enteritis commonly occurs in adolescents or young adults but can appear at any time of life. It is more common in women, and it occurs frequently in the older population (between the ages of 50 and 80). It can occur anywhere along the GI tract, but the most common areas are the distal ileum and colon. The incidence of Crohn's disease has risen over the past 30 years. Crohn's disease is seen two times more often in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers (Rose, 1998).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Regional enteritis is a subacute and chronic inflammation that extends through all layers (ie, transmural lesion) of the bowel wall from the intestinal mucosa. It is characterized by periods of remissions and exacerbations. The disease process begins with edema and thickening of the mucosa. Ulcers begin to appear on the inflamed mucosa. These lesions are not in continuous contact with one another and are separated by normal tissue. Fistulas, fissures, and abscesses form as the inflammation extends into the peritoneum. Granulomas occur in one half of patients. In advanced cases, the intestinal mucosa has a cobblestone appearance. As the disease advances, the bowel wall thickens and becomes fibrotic, and the intestinal lumen narrows. Diseased bowel loops sometimes adhere to other loops surrounding them.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

In regional enteritis, the onset of symptoms is usually insidious, with prominent lower right quadrant abdominal pain and diarrhea unrelieved by defection. Scar tissue and the formation of granulomas interfere with the ability of the intestine to transport products of the upper intestinal digestion through the constricted lumen, resulting in crampy abdominal pains. There is abdominal tenderness and spasm. Because eating stimulates intestinal peristalsis, the crampy pains occur after meals. To avoid these bouts of crampy pain, the patient tends to limit food intake, reducing the amounts and types of food to such a degree that normal nutritional requirements are not met. The result is weight loss, malnutrition, and secondary anemia. Ulcers in the membranous lining of the intestine and other inflammatory changes result in a weeping, swollen intestine that continually empties an irritating discharge into the colon. Disrupted absorption causes chronic diarrhea and nutritional deficits. The result is a person who is thin and emaciated from inadequate food intake and constant fluid loss. In some patients, the inflamed intestine may perforate, leading to intra-abdominal and anal abscesses. Fever and leukocytosis occur. Chronic symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, steatorrhea, anorexia, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies.

Abscesses, fistulas, and fissures are common. Symptoms extend beyond the GI tract and commonly include joint involvement (eg, arthritis), skin lesions (eg, erythema nodosum), ocular disorders (eg, conjunctivitis), and oral ulcers. The clinical course and symptoms can vary; in some patients, periods of remission and exacerbation occur, but in others, the disease follows a fulminating course.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A proctosigmoidoscopic examination is usually performed initially to determine whether the rectosigmoid area is inflamed. A stool examination is also performed; the result may be positive for occult blood and steatorrhea (ie, excessive fat in the feces). The most conclusive diagnostic aid for regional enteritis is a barium study of the upper GI tract that shows the classic "string sign" on an x-ray film of the terminal ileum, indicating the constriction of a segment of intestine. Endoscopy and intestinal biopsy may be used for confirmation of the diagnosis. A barium enema may show ulcerations (the cobblestone appearance described earlier), fissures, and fistulas. A CT scan may show bowel wall thickening and fistula tracts.

A complete blood cell count is performed to assess hematocrit and hemoglobin levels (usually decreased) and the white blood cell count (may be elevated). The sedimentation rate is usually elevated. Albumin and protein levels may be decreased, indicating malnutrition.

\section*{Complications}

Complications of regional enteritis include intestinal obstruction or stricture formation, perianal disease, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition from malabsorption, and fistula and abscess formation. A fistula is an abnormal communication between two body structures, either internal (ie, between two structures) or external (ie, between an internal structure and the outside surface of the body). The most common type of small bowel fistula that results from regional enteritis is the enterocutaneous fistula (ie, between the small bowel and the skin). Abscesses can be the result of an internal fistula tract into an area that results in fluid accumulation and infection. Patients with regional enteritis are also at increased risk for colon cancer.

\section*{ULCERATIVE COLITIS}

Ulcerative colitis is a recurrent ulcerative and inflammatory disease of the mucosal and submucosal layers of the colon and rectum. The incidence of ulcerative colitis is highest in Caucasians and people of Jewish heritage (Yamada et al., 1999). The peak incidence is between 30 and 50 years of age. It is a serious disease, accompanied by systemic complications and a high mortality rate. Eventually, $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the patients develop carcinoma of the colon.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Ulcerative colitis affects the superficial mucosa of the colon and is characterized by multiple ulcerations, diffuse inflammations, and desquamation or shedding of the colonic epithelium. Bleeding occurs as a result of the ulcerations. The mucosa becomes edematous and inflamed. The lesions are contiguous, occurring one after the other. Abscesses form, and infiltrate is seen in the mucosa and submucosa with clumps of neutrophils in the crypt lumens (ie, crypt abscesses). The disease process usually begins in the rectum and spreads proximally to involve the entire colon. Eventually, the bowel narrows, shortens, and thickens because of muscular hypertrophy and fat deposits.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical course is usually one of exacerbations and remissions. The predominant symptoms of ulcerative colitis are diarrhea, lower left quadrant abdominal pain, intermittent tenesmus, and rectal bleeding. The bleeding may be mild or severe, and pallor results. The patient may have anorexia, weight loss, fever, vomiting, and dehydration, as well as cramping, the feeling of an urgent need to defecate, and the passage of 10 to 20 liquid stools each day. The disease is classified as mild, severe, or fulminant, depending on the severity of the symptoms. Hypocalcemia and anemia frequently develop. Rebound tenderness may occur in the right lower quadrant. Extraintestinal symptoms include skin lesions (eg, erythema nodosum), eye lesions (eg, uveitis), joint abnormalities (eg, arthritis), and liver disease.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient should be assessed for tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, fever, and pallor. Other assessments include the level of hydration and nutritional status. The abdomen should be examined for characteristics of bowel sounds, distention, and tenderness. These findings assist in determining the severity of the disease.

The stool is positive for blood, and laboratory test results reveal a low hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration in addition to an elevated white blood cell count, low albumin levels, and an electrolyte imbalance. Abdominal x-ray studies are useful for determining the cause of symptoms. Free air in the peritoneum and bowel dilation or obstruction should be excluded as a source of the presenting symptoms. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and barium enema are valuable in distinguishing this condition from other diseases of the colon with similar symptoms. A barium enema may show mucosal irregularities, focal strictures or fistulas, shortening of the colon, and dilation of bowel loops. Endoscopy may reveal friable, inflamed mucosa with exudate and ulcerations. This procedure assists in defining the extent and severity of the disease. CT scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound can identify abscesses and perirectal in-
volvement. Leukocyte scanning (see Chap. 34) is useful when severe colitis prohibits the use of endoscopy to determine the extent of inflammation.

> NURSING ALERT In acute ulcerative colitis, cathartics are contraindicated when the patient is being prepared for barium enema or endoscopy because they may exacerbate the condition, which can lead to megacolon (ie, excessive dilation of the colon), perforation, and death. If the patient needs to have these diagnostic tests, a liquid diet for a few days before radiography and a gentle tapwater enema on the day of the examination may be prescribed. Colonoscopy is contraindicated in severe disease because of the risk of perforation.

Careful stool examination for parasites and other microbes is performed to rule out dysentery caused by common intestinal organisms, especially Entamoeba histolytica and Clostridium difficile.

\section*{Complications}

Complications of ulcerative colitis include toxic megacolon, perforation, and bleeding as a result of ulceration, vascular engorgement, and highly vascular granulation tissue. In toxic megacolon, the inflammatory process extends into the muscularis, inhibiting its ability to contract and resulting in colonic distention. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain and distention, vomiting, and fatigue. Colonic perforation from toxic megacolon is associated with a high mortality rate ( $15 \%$ to $50 \%$ ) (Grendell et al., 1998). If the patient with toxic megacolon does not respond within 24 to 48 hours to medical management with nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids with electrolytes, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, surgery is required. Total colectomy is indicated. For many patients, surgery becomes necessary to relieve the effects of the disease and to treat these serious complications; an ileostomy usually is performed. The surgical procedures involved and the care of patients with this type of fecal diversion are discussed later in this chapter.

Patients with IBD also have a significantly increased risk of osteoporotic fractures due to decreased bone mineral density. Corticosteroid therapy may also contribute to the diminished bone mass.

\section*{Medical Management of Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease}

Medical treatment for regional enteritis and ulcerative colitis is aimed at reducing inflammation, suppressing inappropriate immune responses, providing rest for a diseased bowel so that healing may take place, improving quality of life, and preventing or minimizing complications.

Most patients maintain long-term well-being interspersed with short intervals of illness (Hanauer, 2001). Management depends on the disease location, severity, and complications.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

Oral fluids and a low-residue, high-protein, high-calorie diet with supplemental vitamin therapy and iron replacement are prescribed to meet nutritional needs, reduce inflammation, and control pain and diarrhea. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances from dehydration caused by diarrhea are corrected by intravenous therapy as necessary if the patient is hospitalized or by oral supplementation if the patient can be managed at home. Any foods that exacerbate diarrhea are avoided. Milk may contribute to diarrhea in those with lactose intolerance. Cold foods and smoking are avoided because
both increase intestinal motility. Parenteral nutrition may be indicated.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Sedatives and antidiarrheal and antiperistaltic medications are used to minimize peristalsis to rest the inflamed bowel. They are continued until the patient's stools approach normal frequency and consistency.

Aminosalicylate formulations such as sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) are often effective for mild or moderate inflammation and are used to prevent or reduce recurrences in long-term maintenance regimens. Newer sulfa-free aminosalicylates (eg, mesalamine [Asacol, Pentasa]) have been developed and shown effective in preventing and treating recurrence of inflammation (Wolfe, 2000). Antibiotics are used for secondary infections, particularly for purulent complications such as abscesses, perforation, and peritonitis.

Corticosteroids are used to treat severe and fulminant disease. These corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) can be administered orally in outpatient treatment or parenterally in hospitalized patients. Topical (ie, rectal administration) corticosteroids are also widely used in the treatment of distal colon disease. When the dosage of corticosteroids is reduced or stopped, the symptoms of disease may return. If corticosteroids are continued, adverse sequelae such as hypertension, fluid retention, cataracts, hirsutism (ie, abnormal hair growth), adrenal suppression, and loss of bone density may develop.

Immunomodulators (eg, azathioprene [Imuran], 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporin) have been used to alter the immune response (Wolfe, 2000). The exact mechanism of action of these medications in treating IBD is unknown. They are used for patients with severe disease who have failed other therapies. These medications are useful in maintenance regimens to prevent relapses. Newer biologic therapies are being studied, and it is hoped that they will lead to improvement in the treatment of patients with chronically active disease (Yamada et al., 1999).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

When nonsurgical measures fail to relieve the severe symptoms of IBD, surgery may be recommended. The most common indications for surgery are medically intractable disease, poor quality of life, or complications from the disease or medical therapy (Wolfe, 2000).

More than one half of all patients with regional enteritis require surgery at some point. Recurrence of inflammation and disease after surgery in regional enteritis is inevitable. The rate of recurrence after surgery is $20 \%$ to $40 \%$ in the first 5 years. Patients younger than 25 years of age have the highest recurrence rate. Surgery for regional enteritis is indicated for refractory disease or complications (Wolfe, 2000). The procedure of choice is a total colectomy and ileostomy.

A newer surgical procedure developed for patients with severe regional enteritis is intestinal transplant. This technique is now available to children and to young and middle-age adults who have lost intestinal function from disease. Although not a cure, this procedure may eventually provide improvement in quality of life for some who are terminally ill. The technical and immunologic problems with this procedure remain formidable, and the costs and mortality rates remain high (Wolfe, 2000).

Approximately $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of patients with ulcerative colitis require surgical intervention (Tierney et al., 2000). Indications for surgery include lack of improvement and continued deterioration, profuse bleeding, perforation, stricture formation, and cancer. Surgical excision usually improves quality of life.

Proctocolectomy with ileostomy (ie, complete excision of colon, rectum, and anus) is recommended when the rectum is severely involved.

One type of surgical technique that can be helpful is strictureplasty, in which the blocked or narrowed section of the bowel is widened, leaving the bowel intact. If a lesion can be delineated in regional enteritis or if a complication has occurred, the lesion is resected, and the remaining portions of the bowel are anastomosed. Surgical removal of up to $50 \%$ of the small bowel usually can be tolerated. Other types of surgical procedures, known as fecal diversions, are discussed later in this chapter.

Total Colectomy With lleostomy. An ileostomy, the surgical creation of an opening into the ileum or small intestine (usually by means of an ileal stoma on the abdominal wall), is commonly performed after a total colectomy (ie, excision of the entire colon). It allows for drainage of fecal matter (ie, effluent) from the ileum to the outside of the body. The drainage is very mushy and occurs at frequent intervals. Nursing management of the patient with an ileostomy is discussed in a later section of this chapter.

Total Colectomy With Continent lleostomy. Another procedure involves the removal of the entire colon and creation of the continent ileal reservoir (ie, Kock pouch). This procedure eliminates the need for an external fecal collection bag. Approximately 30 cm of the distal ileum is reconstructed to form a reservoir with a nipple valve that is created by pulling a portion of the terminal ileal loop back into the ileum. GI effluent can accumulate in the pouch for several hours and then be removed by means of a catheter inserted through the nipple valve. The major problem with the Kock pouch is malfunction of the nipple valve, which occurs in about $20 \%$ of the patients (Yamada et al., 1999).

Total Colectomy With lleoanal Anastomosis. A total colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis is another surgical procedure that eliminates the need for a permanent ileostomy. It establishes an ileal reservoir, and anal sphincter control of elimination is retained. The procedure involves connecting a portion of the ileum to the anus (ie, ileoanal anastomosis) in conjunction with removal of the colon and the rectal mucosa (ie, total abdominal colectomy and mucosal proctectomy) (Fig. 38-5). A temporary diverting loop ileostomy is constructed at the time of surgery and closed about 3 months later.

With ileoanal anastomosis, the diseased colon and rectum are removed, voluntary defecation is maintained, and anal continence is preserved. The ileal reservoir decreases the number of bowel movements by 50\%, from approximately 14 to 20 per day to 7 to 10 per day. Nighttime elimination is gradually reduced to one bowel movement. Complications of ileoanal anastomosis include irritation of the perianal skin from leakage of fecal contents, stricture formation at the anastomosis site, and small bowel obstruction.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of patients with IBD may be medical, surgical, or both. Patients in the community setting or those recently diagnosed may primarily require education about diet and medications and referral to support groups. Hospitalized patients with long-standing or severe disease also require careful monitoring, parenteral nutrition, fluid replacement, and possibly emergent surgery. The surgical procedures may involve a fecal diversion,

with attendant needs for physical care, emotional support, and extensive teaching about management of the ostomy.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse takes a health history to identify the onset, duration, and characteristics of abdominal pain; the presence of diarrhea or fecal urgency, straining at stool (tenesmus), nausea, anorexia, or weight loss; and family history of IBD. It is important to discuss dietary patterns, including the amounts of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine containing products used daily and weekly. The nurse asks about patterns of bowel elimination, including character, frequency, and presence of blood, pus, fat, or mucus. It is important to note allergies and food intolerance, especially milk (lactose) intolerance. The patient may identify sleep disturbances if diarrhea or pain occurs at night.

Assessment includes auscultating the abdomen for bowel sounds and their characteristics; palpating the abdomen for distention, tenderness, or pain; and inspecting the skin for evidence of fistula tracts or symptoms of dehydration. The stool is inspected for blood and mucus.

With regional enteritis, pain is usually localized in the right lower quadrant, where hyperactive bowel sounds can be heard because of borborygmus and increased peristalsis. Abdominal tenderness is noticed on palpation. The most prominent symptom is intermittent pain that occurs with diarrhea but does not decrease after defection. Pain in the periumbilical region usually indicates involvement of the terminal ileum. With ulcerative col-
itis, the abdomen may be distended, and rebound tenderness may be present. Rectal bleeding is a significant sign.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Diarrhea related to the inflammatory process
- Acute pain related to increased peristalsis and GI inflammation
- Deficient fluid volume deficit related to anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to dietary restrictions, nausea, and malabsorption
- Activity intolerance related to fatigue
- Anxiety related to impending surgery
- Ineffective coping related to repeated episodes of diarrhea
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to malnutrition and diarrhea
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management related to insufficient knowledge concerning the process and management of the disease

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Cardiac dysrhythmia related to electrolyte depletion
- GI bleeding with fluid volume loss
- Perforation of the bowel

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include attainment of normal bowel elimination patterns, relief of abdominal pain and cramping, prevention of fluid volume deficit, maintenance of optimal nutrition and weight, avoidance of fatigue, reducing anxiety, promoting effective coping, absence of skin breakdown, learning about the disease process and therapeutic regimen, and avoidance of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING NORMAL ELIMINATION PATTERNS}

The nurse determines if there is a relationship between diarrhea and certain foods, activity, or emotional stress. Identifying precipitating factors, the frequency of bowel movements, and the character, consistency, and amount of stool passed is important. The nurse provides ready access to a bathroom, commode, or bedpan and keeps the environment clean and odor free. It is important to administer antidiarrheal medications as prescribed, to record the frequency and consistency of stools after therapy is initiated, and to encourage bed rest to decrease peristalsis.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The character of the pain is described as dull, burning, or crampy. Asking about its onset is relevant. Does it occur before or after meals, during the night, or before elimination? Is the pattern constant or intermittent? Is it relieved with medications? The nurse
administers anticholinergic medications as prescribed 30 minutes before a meal to decrease intestinal motility and administers analgesics as prescribed for pain. Position changes, local application of heat (as prescribed), diversional activities, and the prevention of fatigue also are helpful for reducing pain.

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID INTAKE}

To detect fluid volume deficit, the nurse keeps an accurate record of oral and intravenous fluids and maintains a record of output (ie, urine, liquid stool, vomitus, and wound or fistula drainage). The nurse monitors daily weights for fluid gains or losses and assesses the patient for signs of fluid volume deficit (ie, dry skin and mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, oliguria, exhaustion, decreased temperature, increased hematocrit, elevated urine specific gravity, and hypotension). It is important to encourage oral intake of fluids and to monitor the intravenous flow rate. The nurse initiates measures to decrease diarrhea (eg, dietary restrictions, stress reduction, antidiarrheal agents).

\section*{MAINTAINING OPTIMAL NUTRITION}

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is used when the symptoms of IBD are severe. With PN, the nurse maintains an accurate record of fluid intake and output as well as the patient's daily weight. The patient should gain 0.5 kg daily during PN therapy. Because PN is very high in glucose and can cause hyperglycemia, blood glucose levels are monitored every 6 hours. Elemental feedings high in protein and low in fat and residue are instituted after PN therapy because they are digested primarily in the jejunum, do not stimulate intestinal secretions, and allow the bowel to rest. The nurse notes intolerance if the patient exhibits nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal distention.

If oral foods are tolerated, small, frequent, low-residue feedings are given to avoid overdistending the stomach and stimulating peristalsis. It is important for the patient to restrict activity to conserve energy, reduce peristalsis, and reduce calorie requirements.

\section*{PROMOTING REST}

The nurse recommends intermittent rest periods during the day and schedules or restricts activities to conserve energy and reduce the metabolic rate. It is important to encourage activity within the limits of the patient's capacity. The nurse suggests bed rest for a patient who is febrile, has frequent diarrheal stools, or is bleeding. The patient on bed rest should perform active exercises to maintain muscle tone and prevent thromboembolic complications. If the patient is unable to perform these active exercises, the nurse performs passive exercises and joint range of motion. Activity restrictions are modified as needed on a day-to-day basis.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Rapport can be established by being attentive and displaying a calm, confident manner. The nurse allows time for the patient to ask questions and express feelings. Careful listening and sensitivity to nonverbal indicators of anxiety (eg, restlessness, tense facial expressions) are helpful. The patient may be emotionally labile because of the consequences of the disease; the nurse tailors information about possible impending surgery to the patient's level of understanding and desire for detail. If surgery is planned, pictures and illustrations help to explain the surgical procedure and help the patient to visualize what a stoma looks like.

\section*{ENHANCING COPING MEASURES}

Because the patient may feel isolated, helpless, and out of control, understanding and emotional support are essential. The patient may respond to stress in a variety of ways that may alienate others, including anger, denial, and social self-isolation.

The nurse needs to recognize that the patient's behavior may be affected by a number of factors unrelated to inherent emotional characteristics. Any patient suffering the discomforts of frequent bowel movements and rectal soreness is anxious, discouraged, and depressed. It is important to develop a relationship with the patient that supports all attempts to cope with these stresses. It is also important to communicate that the patient's feelings are understood by encouraging the patient to talk and express his or her feelings and to discuss any concerns. Stress reduction measures that may be used include relaxation techniques, visualization, breathing exercises, and biofeedback. Professional counseling may be needed to help the patient and family manage issues associated with chronic illness.

\section*{PREVENTING SKIN BREAKDOWN}

The nurse examines the patient's skin frequently, especially the perianal skin. Perianal care, including the use of a skin barrier, is important after each bowel movement. The nurse gives immediate attention to reddened or irritated areas over a bony prominence and uses pressure-relieving devices to prevent skin breakdown. Consultation with a wound care specialist or enterostomal therapist is often helpful.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Serum electrolyte levels are monitored daily, and electrolyte replacements are administered as prescribed. It is important to report evidence of dysrhythmias or change in level of consciousness immediately.

The nurse closely monitors rectal bleeding and administers blood component therapy and volume expanders as prescribed to prevent hypovolemia. It is important to monitor the blood pressure for hypotension and to obtain coagulation and hematocrit and hemoglobin profiles frequently. Vitamin K may be prescribed to increase clotting factors.

The nurse closely monitors the patient for indications of perforation (ie, acute increase in abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, vomiting, or hypotension) and obstruction and toxic megacolon (ie, abdominal distention, decreased or absent bowel sounds, change in mental status, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse assesses the patient's understanding of the disease process and his or her need for additional information about medical management (eg, medications, diet) and surgical interventions. The nurse provides information about nutritional management; a bland, low-residue, high-protein, high-calorie, and high-vitamin diet relieves symptoms and decreases diarrhea. It is important to provide the rationale for the use of corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antidiarrheal, and antispasmodic medications. The nurse emphasizes the importance of taking medications as prescribed and not abruptly discontinuing them (especially corticosteroids) to avoid development of serious medical problems (Chart 38-3). The nurse reviews ileostomy care as necessary (see Nursing Management of the Patient with an Ileostomy). Patient education information can be obtained from the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Patients with chronic inflammatory disease are managed at home with follow-up care by their physician or through an outpatient clinic. Those whose nutritional status is compromised and who are receiving PN need home care nursing to ensure that their nutritional requirements are being met and that they or their caregivers can follow through with the instructions for PN. Patients who are medically managed need to understand that their disease can be controlled and that they can lead a healthy life between exacerbations. Control implies management based on an understanding of the disease and its treatment. Patients in the home setting need information about their medications (ie, name, dose, side effects, and frequency of administration) and need to take medications on schedule. Medication reminders such as containers that separate pills according to day and time or daily checklists are helpful.

During a flare-up, the nurse encourages patients to rest as needed and to modify activities according to their energy levels. Patients should limit tasks that impose strain on the lower abdominal muscles. They should sleep in a room close to the bathroom because of the frequent diarrhea ( 10 to 20 times per day); quick access to a toilet helps alleviate the worry of embarrassment if an accident occurs. Room deodorizers help control odors.

Dietary modifications can control but not cure the disease; the nurse recommends a low-residue, high-protein, high-calorie diet, especially during an acute phase. It is important to encourage patients to keep a record of the foods that irritate the bowel and to eliminate them from the diet and to remind patients to drink at least eight glasses of water each day.

The prolonged nature of the disease has an impact on the patient and often strains his or her family life and financial resources as well. Family support is vital; however, some family members may be resentful, guilty, and tired and feel unable to continue coping with the emotional demands of the illness and the physical demands of caring for another. Some patients with IBD do not socialize for fear of being embarrassed. Many prefer to eat alone. Because they have lost control over elimination, they may fear losing control over other aspects of their lives. They need time to express their fears and frustrations. Individual and family counseling may be helpful.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENT REQUIRING AN ILEOSTOMY}

Some patients with IBD eventually require permanent fecal diversion with creation of an ileostomy to manage symptoms and to treat or prevent complications. The Plan of Nursing Care 38-1 summarizes care for the patient requiring an ostomy.

\section*{Providing Preoperative Care}

A period of preparation with intensive replacement of fluid, blood, and protein is necessary before surgery is performed. Antibiotics may be prescribed. If the patient has been taking corticosteroids, they will be continued during the surgical phase to prevent steroid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Usually, the patient is given a low-residue diet, provided in frequent, small feedings. All other preoperative measures are similar to those for general
abdominal surgery. The abdomen is marked for the proper placement of the stoma by the surgeon or the enterostomal therapist. Care is taken to ensure that the ostomy stoma is conveniently placed-usually in the right lower quadrant about 2 inches below the waist, in an area away from previous scars, bony prominence, skin folds, or fistulas.

The patient must have a thorough understanding of the surgery to be performed and what to expect after surgery. Information about an ileostomy is presented to the patient by means of written materials, models, and discussion. Preoperative teaching includes management of drainage from the stoma, the nature of drainage, and the need for nasogastric intubation, parenteral fluids, and possibly perineal packing.

\section*{Providing Postoperative Care}

General abdominal surgery wound care is required. The nurse observes the stoma for color and size. It should be pink to bright red and shiny. For the traditional ileostomy, a temporary plastic bag with adhesive facing is placed over the ileostomy and firmly pressed onto surrounding skin. The nurse monitors the ileostomy for fecal drainage, which should begin about 72 hours after surgery. The drainage is a continuous liquid from the small intestine because the stoma does not have a controlling sphincter. The contents drain into the plastic bag and are thus kept from coming into contact with the skin. They are collected and measured when the bag becomes full. If a continent ileal reservoir was created, as described for the Kock pouch, continuous drainage is provided by an indwelling reservoir catheter for 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. This allows the suture lines to heal.

As with other patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the nurse encourages those with an ileostomy to engage in early ambulation. It is important to administer prescribed pain medications as required.

Because these patients lose much fluid in the early postoperative period, an accurate record of fluid intake, urinary output, and fecal discharge is necessary to help gauge the fluid needs of the patient. There may be 1000 to 2000 mL of fluid lost each day in addition to expected fluid loss through urine, perspiration, respiration, and other sources. With this loss, sodium and potassium are depleted. The nurse monitors laboratory values and administers electrolyte replacements as prescribed. Intravenous fluids are administered to replace fluid losses for 4 to 5 days.

Nasogastric suction is also a part of immediate postoperative care, with the tube requiring frequent irrigation, as prescribed. The purpose of nasogastric suction is to prevent a buildup of gastric contents. After the tube is removed, the nurse offers sips of clear liquids and gradually progresses the diet. It is important to immediately report nausea and abdominal distention, which may indicate obstruction.

By the end of the first week, rectal packing is removed. Because this procedure may be uncomfortable, the nurse may administer an analgesic an hour before it is performed. After the packing is removed, the perineum is irrigated two or three times daily until full healing takes place.

\section*{PROVIDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT}

The patient understandably may think that everyone is aware of the ileostomy and may view the stoma as a mutilation compared with other abdominal incisions that heal and are hidden. Because

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

Nursing Diagnosis: Deficient knowledge about the surgical procedure and preoperative preparation
Goal: Understands the surgical process and the necessary preoperative preparations

\section*{Preoperative Care}
1. Ascertain whether the patient has had a previous surgical experience and ask for recollections of positive and negative impressions.
2. Determine what information the surgeon gave the patient and family and whether it was understood. Clarify and elaborate as necessary. Determine whether the stoma is permanent or temporary. Be aware of the patient's prognosis if carcinoma exists.
3. Use pictures or drawings to illustrate the location and appearance of the surgical wounds (abdominal, perineal) and the stoma if the patient is receptive.
4. Explain that oral/parenteral antimicrobials will be administered to cleanse the bowel preoperatively. Mechanical cleansing may also be required.
5. Assist the patient during nasogastric/ nasoenteric intubation. Measure drainage from the tube.
1. Fear of a repeated negative experience increases anxiety. Talking about the experience with a nurse helps clarify misconceptions and helps the patient ventilate any repressed emotions. Positive experiences are reinforced.
2. Clarification prevents misunderstandings and alleviates anxiety. A positive affect may be more difficult to project if the ostomy is permanent or the prognosis poor.
3. Knowledge, for some, alleviates anxiety because fear of the unknown is decreased. Others choose not to know because it makes them more anxious.
4. Antimicrobials and mechanical cleansing reduce intestinal bacterial flora.
5. Nasoenteral intubation is used for decompression and drainage of gastrointestinal contents before surgery.

there is loss of a body part and a major change in anatomy, the patient often goes through the various phases of grieving-shock, disbelief, denial, rejection, anger, and restitution. Nursing support through these phases is important, and understanding of the patient's emotional outlook in each instance should determine the approach taken. For example, teaching may be ineffective until the patient is ready to learn. Concern about body image may
lead to questions related to family relationships, sexual function, and for women, the ability to become pregnant and to deliver a baby normally. Patients need to know that someone understands and cares about them. A calm, nonjudgmental attitude exhibited by the nurse aids in gaining the patient's confidence. It is important to recognize the dependency needs of these patients. Their prolonged illness can make them irritable, anxious, and de-
pressed. The nurse can coordinate patient care through meetings attended by consultants such as the physician, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, enterostomal therapist, and dietitian. The team approach is important in facilitating the often complex care of this patient.

Conversely, a surgical procedure to create an ileostomy can produce dramatic positive changes in patients who have suffered from IBD for several years. After the continuous discomfort of the disease has decreased and patients learn how to take care of the ileostomy, they often develop a more positive outlook. Until they progress to this phase, an empathetic and tolerant approach by the nurse plays an important part in recovery. The sooner the patient masters the physical care of the ileostomy, the sooner he or she will psychologically accept it.

The support of other ostomates is also helpful. The United Ostomy Association is dedicated to the rehabilitation of ostomates. This organization gives patients useful information about living with an ostomy through an educational program of literature, lectures, and exhibits. Local associations offer visiting services by qualified members who provide hope and rehabilitation services to new ostomy patients. Hospitals and other health care agencies may have an enterostomal therapy nurse on staff who can serve as a valuable resource person for the ileostomy patient.

\section*{MANAGING SKIN AND STOMA CARE}

The patient with a traditional ileostomy cannot establish regular bowel habits because the contents of the ileum are fluid and are discharged continuously. The patient must wear a pouch at all times. Stomal size and pouch size vary initially; the stoma should be rechecked 3 weeks after surgery, when the edema has subsided. The final size and type of appliance is selected in 3 months, after the patient's weight has stabilized, and the stoma shrinks to a stable shape.

The location and length of the stoma are significant in the management of the ileostomy by the patient. The surgeon positions the stoma as close to the midline as possible and at a location where even an obese patient with a protruding abdomen can care for it easily. Usually, the ileostomy stoma is about 2.5 cm ( 1 in ) long, which makes it convenient for the attachment of an appliance.

Skin excoriation around the stoma can be a persistent problem. Peristomal skin integrity may be compromised by several factors, such as an allergic reaction to the ostomy appliance, skin barrier, or paste; chemical irritation from the effluent; mechanical injury from the removal of the appliance; and possible infection. If irritation and yeast growth occur, nystatin powder (Mycostatin) is dusted lightly on the peristomal skin.

\section*{CHANGING AN APPLIANCE}

A regular schedule for changing the pouch before leakage occurs must be established for those with a traditional ileostomy. The patient can be taught to change the pouch in a manner similar to that described in Chart 38-4.

The amount of time a person can keep the appliance sealed to the body surface depends on the location of the stoma and on body structure. The usual wearing time is 5 to 7 days. The appliance is emptied every 4 to 6 hours or at the same time the patient empties the bladder. An emptying spout at the bottom of the appliance is closed with a special clip made for this purpose.

Most pouches are disposable and odor-proof. Foods such as spinach and parsley act as deodorizers in the intestinal tract; foods that cause odors include cabbage, onions, and fish. Bismuth subcarbonate tablets, which may be prescribed and taken by mouth three or four times each day, are effective in reducing odor. A stool
thickener, such as diphenoxylate (Lomotil), can also be prescribed and taken orally to assist in odor control.

\section*{IRRIGATING A CONTINENT ILEOSTOMY}

For a continent ileostomy (ie, Kock pouch), the nurse teaches the patient to drain the pouch, as described in Chart 38-5. A catheter is inserted into the reservoir to drain the fluid. The length of time between drainage periods is gradually increased until the reservoir needs to be drained only every 4 to 6 hours and irrigated once each day. A pouch is not necessary; instead, most patients wear a small dressing over the opening.

When the fecal discharge is thick, water can be injected through the catheter to loosen and soften it. The consistency of the effluent is affected by food intake. At first, drainage is only 60 to 80 mL , but as time goes on, the amount increases significantly. The internal Kock pouch stretches, eventually accommodating 500 to 1000 mL . The patient learns to use the sensation of pressure in the pouch as a gauge to determine how often the pouch should be drained.

\section*{MANAGING DIETARY AND FLUID NEEDS}

A low-residue diet is followed for the first 6 to 8 weeks. Strained fruits and vegetables are given. These foods are important sources of vitamins A and C. Later, there are few dietary restrictions, except for avoiding foods that are high in fiber or hard-to-digest kernels, such as celery, popcorn, corn, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, and coconut. Foods are reintroduced one at a time. The nurse assesses the patient's tolerance for these foods and reminds him or her to chew food thoroughly.

Fluids may be a problem during the summer, when fluid lost through perspiration adds to the fluid loss through the ileostomy. Fluids such as Gatorade are helpful in maintaining the electrolyte balance. If the fecal discharge is too watery, fibrous foods (eg, whole-grain cereals, fresh fruit skins, beans, corn, nuts) are restricted. If the effluent is excessively dry, salt intake is increased. Increased intake of water or fluid does not increase the effluent, because excess water is excreted in the urine.

\section*{PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS}

Monitoring for complications is an ongoing activity for the patient with an ileostomy. Minor complications occur in about $40 \%$ of patients who have an ileostomy; less than $20 \%$ of the complications require surgical intervention (Kirsner \& Shorter, 2000).

Common complications include skin irritation, diarrhea, stomal stenosis, urinary calculi, and cholelithiasis. Peristomal skin irritation, the most common complication of an ileostomy, results from leakage of effluent. A pouch that does not fit well is often the cause. The nurse or an enterostomal therapist adjusts the pouch and skin barriers are applied. Diarrhea, manifested by very irritating effluent that rapidly fills the pouch (every hour or sooner), can quickly lead to dehydration and electrolyte losses. Supplemental water, sodium, and potassium are administered to prevent hypovolemia and hypokalemia. Antidiarrheal agents are administered. Stenosis is caused by circular scar tissue that forms at the stoma site. The scar tissue must be surgically released. Urinary calculi occur in about $10 \%$ of ileostomy patients because of dehydration from decreased fluid intake. Intense lower abdominal pain that radiates to the legs, hematuria, and signs of dehydration indicate that the urine should be strained. Fluid intake is encouraged. Sometimes, small stones are passed during urination; otherwise, treatment is necessary to crush or remove the calculi (see Chap. 45).

Cholelithiasis (ie, gallstones) occurs three times more commonly in patients with an ileostomy than in the general population

\section*{Chart 38-4}

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Changing an Ostomy Appliance}

Changing an ileostomy appliance is necessary to prevent leakage (the bag is usually changed every 5 to 7 days), to allow for examination of the skin around the stoma, and to assist in controlling odor if this becomes a problem. The appliance should be changed at any time that the patient complains of burning or itching under the disk or pain in the area of the stoma; routine changes should be performed early in the morning before breakfast or 2 to 4 hours after a meal, when the bowel is least active.

\section*{NURSING ACTION}
1. Promote patient comfort and involvement in the procedure.
a. Have the patient assume a relaxed position.
b. Provide privacy.
c. Explain details of the procedure.
d. Expose the ileostomy area; remove the ileostomy belt (if worn).
2. Remove the appliance.
a. Have the patient sit on the toilet or on a chair facing the toilet. A patient who prefers to stand should face the toilet.
b. The appliance (pouch) can be removed by gently pushing the skin away from the adhesive.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. Providing a relaxed atmosphere and adequate explanations help the patient to become an active participant in the procedure.
2. These positions facilitate disposal or drainage.

3. Cleanse the skin:
a. Wash the skin gently with a soft cloth moistened with tepid water and mild soap; the patient may prefer to bathe before putting on a clean appliance.
b. Rinse and dry the skin thoroughly after cleansing.
4. Apply appliance (when there is no skin irritation):
a. An appropriate skin barrier is applied to the peristomal skin before the appliance is applied.
b. Remove cover from adherent surface of disk of disposable plastic appliance and apply directly to the skin.
c. Press firmly in place for 30 s to ensure adherence.
5. Apply appliance (when there is skin irritation):
a. Cleanse the skin thoroughly but gently; pat dry.
b. Apply Kenalog spray; blot excess moisture with a cotton pledget and dust lightly with nystatin (Mycostatin) powder.

\section*{OR}

Apply as an alternative a wafer of Stomahesive (Squibb), which is commercially available. The stomal opening should be cut the same size as the stoma; use a cutting guide (supplied with Stomahesive). The wafer is applied directly to the skin.
c. Another alternative is to moisten a karaya gum washer and apply when it is tacky. If the skin is moist, karaya powder may be applied first and any excess dusted off gently.
d. The pouch is then applied to the treated skin.
6. Check the pouch bottom for closure; use the rubber band or clip provided.

\section*{RATIONALE}
3. The patient may shower with or without the pouch.
a. Micropore or waterproof tape applied to the sides of the faceplate will keep it secure during bathing.
b. Moisture or soap residue will interfere with appliance adhesion.
4. Many appliances have a built-in skin barrier. The skin should be thoroughly dried before applying the appliance.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The spouse and family should be familiar with the adjustment that will be necessary when the patient returns home. They need to know why it is necessary for the patient to occupy the bathroom for 10 minutes or more at certain times of the day and why certain equipment is needed. Their understanding is necessary to re-
duce tension; a relaxed patient tends to have fewer problems. Visits from an enterostomal therapy nurse may be arranged to ensure that the patient is progressing as expected and to provide additional guidance and teaching as needed.

The patient needs to know the commercial name of the pouch to be used so that he or she can obtain a ready supply and should have information about obtaining other supplies. The names and contact information of the local enterostomal therapy nurse and local self-help groups are often helpful. Any special restrictions on driving or working also need to be reviewed. The nurse teaches the patient about common postoperative complications and how to recognize and report them (Chart 38-6).

A continent ileostomy is the surgical creation of a pouch of small intestine that can serve as an internal receptacle for fecal discharge; a nipple valve is constructed at the outlet. Postoperatively, a catheter extends from the stoma and is attached to a closed drainage suction system. To ensure patency of the catheter, usually every 3 hours 10 to 20 mL of normal saline is instilled gently into the pouch; return flow is not aspirated but is allowed to drain by gravity.

After approximately 2 weeks, when the healing process has progressed to the point at which the catheter is removed from the stoma, the patient is taught to drain the pouch. The equipment required includes a catheter, tissues, water-soluble lubricant, gauze squares, a syringe, irrigating solution in a bowl, and an emesis or receiving basin.

The following procedure is used to drain the pouch; the patient is helped to participate in this procedure to learn to perform it unassisted.

\section*{NURSING ACTION}
1. Lubricate the catheter and gently insert it about $5 \mathrm{~cm}(2 \mathrm{in})$, at which point some resistance may be felt at the valve or nipple.
2. If there is much resistance, fill a syringe with 20 mL of air or water and inject it through the catheter, while still exerting some pressure on the catheter.
3. Place the other end of the catheter in a drainage basin held below the level of the stoma. Later this process can be carried out at the toilet with drainage delivered into the toilet bowl.
4. After drainage, the catheter is removed and the area around the stoma is gently washed with warm water. Pat dry and apply an absorbent pad over the stoma. Fasten the pad with hypoallergenic tape.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. When gentle pressure is used, the catheter usually will enter the pouch.
2. This will permit the catheter to enter the pouch.
3. Gravity facilitates drainage. Drainage may include flatus as well as effluent.
4. The entire procedure requires about 5 to 10 min ; at first it is performed every 3 h . The time between procedures is gradually lengthened to three times daily.

\section*{Intestinal Obstruction}

Intestinal obstruction exists when blockage prevents the normal flow of intestinal contents through the intestinal tract. Two types of processes can impede this flow.
- Mechanical obstruction: An intraluminal obstruction or a mural obstruction from pressure on the intestinal walls occurs. Examples are intussusception, polypoid tumors and neoplasms, stenosis, strictures, adhesions, hernias, and abscesses.
- Functional obstruction: The intestinal musculature cannot propel the contents along the bowel. Examples are amyloidosis, muscular dystrophy, endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus, or neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's
disease. The blockage also can be temporary and the result of the manipulation of the bowel during surgery.

The obstruction can be partial or complete. Its severity depends on the region of bowel affected, the degree to which the lumen is occluded, and especially the degree to which the vascular supply to the bowel wall is disturbed.

Most bowel obstructions occur in the small intestine. Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction, followed by hernias and neoplasms. Other causes include intussusception, volvulus (ie, twisting of the bowel), and paralytic ileus. About 15\% of intestinal obstructions occur in the large bowel; most of these are found in the sigmoid colon (Wolfe, 2000). The most common causes are carcinoma, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disorders, and benign tumors. Table 38-5 and Figure 38-6 list mechanical causes of obstruction and describe how they occur.

\section*{SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Intestinal contents, fluid, and gas accumulate above the intestinal obstruction. The abdominal distention and retention of fluid reduce the absorption of fluids and stimulate more gastric secretion. With increasing distention, pressure within the intestinal lumen increases, causing a decrease in venous and arteriolar capillary pressure. This causes edema, congestion, necrosis, and eventual rupture or perforation of the intestinal wall, with resultant peritonitis.

Reflux vomiting may be caused by abdominal distention. Vomiting results in a loss of hydrogen ions and potassium from
the stomach, leading to a reduction of chlorides and potassium in the blood and to metabolic alkalosis. Dehydration and acidosis develop from loss of water and sodium. With acute fluid losses, hypovolemic shock may occur.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The initial symptom is usually crampy pain that is wavelike and colicky. The patient may pass blood and mucus, but no fecal matter and no flatus. Vomiting occurs. If the obstruction is complete, the peristaltic waves initially become extremely vigorous and eventually assume a reverse direction, with the intestinal contents propelled toward the mouth instead of toward the rectum. If the

\end{figure}
obstruction is in the ileum, fecal vomiting takes place. First, the patient vomits the stomach contents, then the bile-stained contents of the duodenum and the jejunum, and finally, with each paroxysm of pain, the darker, fecal-like contents of the ileum. The unmistakable signs of dehydration become evident: intense thirst, drowsiness, generalized malaise, aching, and a parched tongue and mucous membranes. The abdomen becomes distended. The lower the obstruction is in the GI tract, the more marked the abdominal distention. If the obstruction continues uncorrected, hypovolemic shock occurs from dehydration and loss of plasma volume.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is based on the symptoms described previously and on x-ray findings. Abdominal x-ray studies show abnormal quantities of gas, fluid, or both in the bowel. Laboratory studies (ie, electrolyte studies and a complete blood cell count) reveal a picture of dehydration, loss of plasma volume, and possible infection.

\section*{Medical Management}

Decompression of the bowel through a nasogastric or small bowel tube (see Chap. 36) is successful in most cases. When the bowel is completely obstructed, the possibility of strangulation warrants surgical intervention. Before surgery, intravenous therapy is necessary to replace the depleted water, sodium, chloride, and potassium.

The surgical treatment of intestinal obstruction depends largely on the cause of the obstruction. In the most common causes of obstruction, such as hernia and adhesions, the surgical procedure involves repairing the hernia or dividing the adhesion to which the intestine is attached. In some instances, the portion of affected bowel may be removed and an anastomosis performed. The complexity of the surgical procedure for intestinal obstruction depends on the duration of the obstruction and the condition of the intestine.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the nonsurgical patient with a small bowel obstruction includes maintaining the function of the nasogastric tube, assessing and measuring the nasogastric output, assessing for fluid and electrolyte imbalance, monitoring nutritional status, and assessing improvement (eg, return of normal bowel sounds, decreased abdominal distention, subjective improvement in abdominal pain and tenderness, passage of flatus or stool). The nurse reports discrepancies in intake and output, worsening of pain or abdominal distention, and increased nasogastric output. If the patient's condition does not improve, the nurse prepares him or her for surgery. The exact nature of the surgery depends on the cause of the obstruction. Nursing care of the patient after surgical repair of a small bowel obstruction is similar to that for other abdominal surgeries (see Chap. 20).

\section*{LARGE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

As in small bowel obstruction, large bowel obstruction results in an accumulation of intestinal contents, fluid, and gas proximal to the obstruction. Obstruction in the large bowel can lead to severe distention and perforation unless some gas and fluid can flow back through the ileal valve. Large bowel obstruction, even if complete, may be undramatic if the blood supply to the colon is not disturbed.

If the blood supply is cut off, however, intestinal strangulation and necrosis (ie, tissue death) occur; this condition is life threatening. In the large intestine, dehydration occurs more slowly than in the small intestine because the colon can absorb its fluid contents and can distend to a size considerably beyond its normal full capacity.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Large bowel obstruction differs clinically from small bowel obstruction in that the symptoms develop and progress relatively slowly. In patients with obstruction in the sigmoid colon or the rectum, constipation may be the only symptom for days. Eventually, the abdomen becomes markedly distended, loops of large bowel become visibly outlined through the abdominal wall, and the patient has crampy lower abdominal pain. Finally, fecal vomiting develops. Symptoms of shock may occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is based on symptoms and on x-ray studies. Abdominal x-ray studies (flat and upright) show a distended colon. Barium studies are contraindicated.

\section*{Medical Management}

A colonoscopy may be performed to untwist and decompress the bowel. A cecostomy, in which a surgical opening is made into the cecum, may be performed for patients who are poor surgical risks and urgently need relief from the obstruction. The procedure provides an outlet for releasing gas and a small amount of drainage. A rectal tube may be used to decompress an area that is lower in the bowel. The usual treatment, however, is surgical resection to remove the obstructing lesion. A temporary or permanent colostomy may be necessary. An ileoanal anastomosis may be performed if it is necessary to remove the entire large colon.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse's role is to monitor the patient for symptoms that indicate that the intestinal obstruction is worsening and to provide emotional support and comfort. The nurse administers intravenous fluids and electrolytes as prescribed. If the patient's condition does not respond to nonsurgical treatment, the nurse prepares the patient for surgery. This preparation includes preoperative teaching as the patient's condition indicates. After surgery, general abdominal wound care and routine postoperative nursing care are provided.

\section*{COLORECTAL CANCER}

Tumors of the colon and rectum are relatively common; the colorectal area (the colon and rectum combined) is now the third most common site of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States. Colorectal cancer is a disease of Western cultures; there were an estimated 148,300 new cases and 56,000 deaths from the disease in 2002 (American Cancer Society, 2002).

The incidence increases with age (the incidence is highest for people older than 85 years of age) and is higher for people with a family history of colon cancer and those with IBD or polyps. The exact cause of colon and rectal cancer is still unknown, but risk factors have been identified (Chart 38-7).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-070.jpg?height=391&width=864&top_left_y=194&top_left_x=202)

The distribution of cancer sites throughout the colon is shown in Figure 38-7 (Goldman, \& Bennett, 2000). Changes in this distribution have occurred in recent years. The incidence of cancer in the sigmoid and rectal areas has decreased, whereas the incidence of cancer in the cecum, ascending, and descending colon has increased.

Improved screening strategies have helped to reduce the number of deaths in recent years. Of the more than 148,000 people diagnosed each year, fewer than half that number die annually (Beyers et al., 2001). Early diagnosis and prompt treatment could save almost three of every four people with colorectal cancer. If the disease is detected and treated at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is $90 \%$, but only $34 \%$ of colorectal cancers are found at an early stage. Survival rates after late diagnosis are very low. Most people are asymptomatic for long periods and seek health care only when they notice a change in bowel habits or rectal bleeding. Prevention and early screening are key to detection and reduction of mortality rates.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Cancer of the colon and rectum is predominantly (95\%) adenocarcinoma (ie, arising from the epithelial lining of the intestine). It may start as a benign polyp but may become malignant, invade and destroy normal tissues, and extend into surrounding structures. Cancer cells may break away from the primary

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
tumor and spread to other parts of the body (most often to the liver).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms are greatly determined by the location of the cancer, the stage of the disease, and the function of the intestinal segment in which it is located. The most common presenting symptom is a change in bowel habits. The passage of blood in the stools is the second most common symptom. Symptoms may also include unexplained anemia, anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue.

The symptoms most commonly associated with right-sided lesions are dull abdominal pain and melena (ie, black, tarry stools). The symptoms most commonly associated with left-sided lesions are those associated with obstruction (ie, abdominal pain and cramping, narrowing stools, constipation, and distention), as well as bright red blood in the stool. Symptoms associated with rectal lesions are tenesmus (ie, ineffective, painful straining at stool), rectal pain, the feeling of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement, alternating constipation and diarrhea, and bloody stool.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Along with an abdominal and rectal examination, the most important diagnostic procedures for cancer of the colon are fecal occult blood testing, barium enema, proctosigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy (see Chap. 34). As many as $60 \%$ of colorectal cancer cases can be identified by sigmoidoscopy with biopsy or cytology smears (Yamada et al., 1999).

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) studies may also be performed. Although CEA may not be a highly reliable indicator in diagnosing colon cancer because not all lesions secrete CEA, studies show that CEA levels are reliable in predicting prognosis. With complete excision of the tumor, the elevated levels of CEA should return to normal within 48 hours. Elevations of CEA at a later date suggest recurrence (Yamada et al., 1999).

\section*{Complications}

Tumor growth may cause partial or complete bowel obstruction. Extension of the tumor and ulceration into the surrounding blood vessels results in hemorrhage. Perforation, abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, and shock may occur.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The incidence of carcinoma of the colon and rectum increases with age. These cancers are considered common malignancies in advanced age. Only prostate cancer and lung cancer in men exceed colorectal cancer. Among women, only breast cancer exceeds the incidence of colorectal cancer (Lueckenotte, 2000). Symptoms are often insidious. Cancer patients usually report fatigue, which is caused primarily by iron-deficiency anemia. In early stages, minor changes in bowel patterns and occasional bleeding may occur. The later symptoms most commonly reported by the elderly are abdominal pain, obstruction, tenesmus, and rectal bleeding.

Colon cancer in the elderly has been closely associated with dietary carcinogens. Lack of fiber is a major causative factor because the passage of feces through the intestinal tract is prolonged, which extends exposure to possible carcinogens. Excess fat is believed to alter bacterial flora and convert steroids into compounds that have carcinogenic properties.

\section*{Medical Management}

The patient with symptoms of intestinal obstruction is treated with intravenous fluids and nasogastric suction. If there has been significant bleeding, blood component therapy may be required.

Treatment for colorectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease (Chart 38-8) and consists of surgery to remove the tumor, supportive therapy, and adjuvant therapy. Data demonstrate delays in tumor recurrence and increases in survival time for patients who receive some form of adjuvant therapy-chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or multimodality therapy.

\section*{ADJUVANT THERAPY}

The standard adjuvant therapy administered to patients with Dukes' class C colon cancer is the 5-fluorouracil plus levamisole regimen (Wolfe, 2000). Patients with Dukes' class B or C rectal cancer are given 5-fluorouracil and high doses of pelvic irradiation. Mitomycin is also used. Radiation therapy is used before, during, and after surgery to shrink the tumor, to achieve better results from surgery, and to reduce the risk of recurrence. For inoperative or unresectable tumors, irradiation is used to provide significant relief from symptoms. Intracavity and implantable devices are used to deliver radiation to the site. The response to adjuvant therapy varies.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgery is the primary treatment for most colon and rectal cancers. It may be curative or palliative. Advances in surgical techniques can enable the patient with cancer to have sphincter-saving devices that restore continuity of the GI tract (Tierney et al., 2000). The type of surgery recommended depends on the location and size of the tumor. Cancers limited to one site can be removed through the colonoscope. Laparoscopic colotomy with polypectomy minimizes the extent of surgery needed in some cases. A laparoscope is used as a guide in making an incision into the colon; the tumor mass is then excised. Use of the neodymium/yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser has proved effective with some lesions as well. Bowel resection is indicated for most class $A$ lesions and all class B and C lesions. Surgery is sometimes recommended for class D colon cancer, but the goal of surgery in this instance is

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
palliative; if the tumor has spread and involves surrounding vital structures, it is considered nonresectable.

Surgical procedures include the following:
- Segmental resection with anastomosis (ie, removal of the tumor and portions of the bowel on either side of the growth, as well as the blood vessels and lymphatic nodes) (Fig. 38-8).
- Abdominoperineal resection with permanent sigmoid colostomy (ie, removal of the tumor and a portion of the sigmoid and all of the rectum and anal sphincter) (Fig. 38-9).
- Temporary colostomy followed by segmental resection and anastomosis and subsequent reanastomosis of the colostomy, allowing initial bowel decompression and bowel preparation before resection
- Permanent colostomy or ileostomy for palliation of unresectable obstructing lesions
- Construction of a coloanal reservoir called a colonic J pouch is performed in two steps. A temporary loop ileostomy is constructed to divert intestinal flow, and the newly constructed J pouch (made from 6 to 10 cm of colon) is reattached to the anal stump. About 3 months after the initial stage, the ileostomy is reversed, and intestinal continuity is restored. The anal sphincter and therefore continence are preserved.

A colostomy is the surgical creation of an opening (ie, stoma) into the colon. It can be created as a temporary or permanent fecal diversion. It allows the drainage or evacuation of colon contents to the outside of the body. The consistency of the drainage is related to the placement of the colostomy, which is dictated by the location of the tumor and the extent of invasion into surrounding tissues (Fig. 38-10). With improved surgical techniques, colostomies are performed on fewer than one third of patients with colorectal cancer.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The elderly are at increased risk for complications after surgery and may have difficulty managing colostomy care. They may have decreased vision, impaired hearing, and difficulty with fine motor coordination. It may be helpful for the patient to handle ostomy equipment and simulate cleaning the peristomal skin and irrigating the stoma before surgery. Skin care is a major concern in the elderly ostomate because of the skin changes that occur with aging-the epithelial and subcutaneous fatty layers become thin, and the skin is irritated easily. To prevent skin breakdown, special attention is paid to skin cleansing and the proper fit of an appliance. Arteriosclerosis causes decreased blood flow to the wound and stoma site. As a result, transport of nutrients is delayed, and healing time may be prolonged. Some patients have delayed elimination after irrigation because of decreased peristalsis and mucus production. Most patients require 6 months before they feel comfortable with their ostomy care.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH COLORECTAL CANCER}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse completes a health history to obtain information about fatigue, abdominal or rectal pain (eg, location, frequency, duration, association with eating or defecation), past and present elimination patterns, and characteristics of stool (eg, color, odor,

\begin{figure}

consistency, presence of blood or mucus). Additional information includes a history of IBD or colorectal polyps, a family history of colorectal disease, and current medication therapy. The nurse identifies dietary habits, including fat and fiber intake, as well as amounts of alcohol consumed. The nurse describes and documents a history of weight loss.

Assessment includes auscultating the abdomen for bowel sounds and palpating the abdomen for areas of tenderness, distention, and solid masses. Stool specimens are inspected for character and presence of blood.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to nausea and anorexia
- Risk for deficient fluid volume related to vomiting and dehydration
- Anxiety related to impending surgery and the diagnosis of cancer
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management related to knowledge deficit concerning the diagnosis, the surgical procedure, and self-care after discharge
- Impaired skin integrity related to the surgical incisions (abdominal and perianal), the formation of a stoma, and frequent fecal contamination of peristomal skin
- Disturbed body image related to colostomy
- Ineffective sexuality patterns related to presence of ostomy and changes in body image and self-concept

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Intraperitoneal infection
- Complete large bowel obstruction
- GI bleeding
- Bowel perforation
- Peritonitis, abscess, and sepsis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include attainment of optimal level of nutrition; maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance; reduction of anxiety; learning about the diagnosis, surgical procedure, and self-care after discharge; maintenance of optimal tissue healing; protection of peristomal skin; learning how to irrigate the colostomy and change the appliance; expressing feelings and concerns about the colostomy and the impact on himself or herself; and avoidance of complications.

\section*{PREPARING THE PATIENT FOR SURGERY}

The patient anticipating surgery for colorectal cancer has many concerns, needs, and fears. He or she may be physically debilitated and emotionally distraught with concern about lifestyle changes after surgery, prognosis, ability to perform in established roles, and finances. Priorities for nursing care include preparing

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-073.jpg?height=1473&width=1593&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=197}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 38-9 Abdominoperineal resection for carcinoma of the rectum.}
\end{figure}
the patient physically for surgery, providing information about postoperative care, including stoma care if a colostomy is to be created, and supporting the patient and family emotionally.

Physical preparation for surgery involves building the patient's stamina in the days preceding surgery and cleansing and sterilizing the bowel the day before surgery. If the patient's condition permits, the nurse recommends a diet high in calories, protein, and carbohydrates and low in residue for several days before surgery to provide adequate nutrition and minimize cramping by decreasing excessive peristalsis. A full-liquid diet may be prescribed 24 to 48 hours before surgery to decrease bulk. If the patient is hospitalized in the days preceding surgery, PN may be required to replace depleted nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. In some instances, PN may be given at home before surgery. Antibiotics such as sulfonamides, neomycin, and cephalexin are administered the day before surgery to reduce intestinal bacteria. The bowel is cleansed with laxatives, enemas, or colonic irrigations the evening before and the morning of surgery.

For the patient who is very ill and hospitalized, the nurse measures and records intake and output, including vomitus, to provide an accurate record of fluid balance. The patient's intake of oral food and fluids may be restricted to prevent vomiting. The
nurse administers antiemetics as prescribed. Full or clear liquids may be tolerated, or the patient may be allowed nothing by mouth. A nasogastric tube may be inserted to drain accumulated fluids and prevent abdominal distention. The nurse monitors the abdomen for increasing distention, loss of bowel sounds, and pain or rigidity, which may indicate obstruction or perforation. It also is important to monitor intravenous fluids and electrolytes. Monitoring serum electrolyte levels can detect the hypokalemia and hyponatremia that occur with GI fluid loss. The nurse observes for signs of hypovolemia (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, decreased pulse volume), assesses hydration status, and reports decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and concentrated urine.

The nurse assesses the patient's knowledge about the diagnosis, prognosis, surgical procedure, and expected level of functioning after surgery. It is important to include information about the physical preparation for surgery, the expected appearance and care of the wound, the technique of ostomy care (if applicable), dietary restrictions, pain control, and medication management in the teaching plan (see Plan of Nursing Care 38-1). If the patient will be admitted the day of surgery, the physician's office may arrange for the patient to be seen by an enterostomal therapist in the days preceding surgery. The ther-

apist helps determine the optimal site for the stoma and provides teaching about care. If the patient is hospitalized before the day of surgery, the staff enterostomal therapist is involved in the preoperative teaching. All procedures are explained in language the patient understands.

\section*{PROVIDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT}

Patients anticipating bowel surgery for colorectal cancer may be very anxious. They may grieve about the diagnosis, the impending surgery, and possible permanent colostomy. Patients undergoing surgery for a temporary colostomy may express fears and concerns similar to those of a person with a permanent stoma. All members of the health care team, including the enterostomal therapy nurse, should be available for assistance and support. The nurse's role is to assess the patient's anxiety level and coping mechanisms and suggest methods for reducing anxiety such as deep-breathing exercises and visualizing a successful recovery from surgery and cancer. Other supportive measures include providing privacy and teaching relaxation techniques to the patient. Time is set aside to listen to the patient who wishes to talk, cry, or ask questions. The nurse can arrange a meeting with a spiritual advisor if the patient desires or with the physicians if the patient wishes to discuss the treatment or prognosis. To promote patient comfort, the nurse projects a relaxed, professional, and empathetic attitude. See Nursing Research Profile 38-1 about the importance of spiritual well-being for patients with colorectal cancer.

The patient undergoing a colostomy may find the anticipated changes in body image and lifestyle profoundly disturbing. Because the stoma is located on the abdomen, the patient may think that everyone will be aware of the ostomy. The nurse helps reduce this fear by presenting facts about the surgical procedure and the creation and management of the ostomy. If the patient is receptive, the nurse can use diagrams, photographs, and appliances to explain and clarify. Because the patient is experiencing emotional stress, the nurse may need to repeat some of the information. The nurse provides time for the patient and family to ask questions; the nurse's acceptance and understanding of the patient's concerns and feelings convey a caring, competent attitude that promotes confidence and cooperation. Consultation with an enterostomal therapist during the preoperative period can be extremely helpful, as can speaking with a person who is successfully managing a colostomy. The United Ostomy Association provides useful information about living with an ostomy through literature, lectures, and exhibits. Visiting services by qualified members and rehabilitation services for new ostomy patients are provided.

Fernsler, J., Klemm, P., \& Miller, M. (1999). Spiritual well-being and demands of illness in people with colorectal cancer. Cancer Nursing, 22(2), 134-140.

\section*{Purpose}

Patients with colorectal cancer must be assisted in coping with the demands of the illness and its treatment. Using the Demands of Illness Inventory (DOI) and the Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS), the authors of this descriptive study looked closely at the events that individuals experience in response to a cancer diagnosis and attempted to determine whether those events relate to spiritual well-being. The purpose of the study was to identify the demands of the illness and determine their relationship to spiritual well-being.

\section*{Study Sample and Findings}

The sample for this study consisted of 121 respondents to questionnaires who were at least 21 years old and had been treated for colon, rectal, or anal cancer. Two thirds of the respondents reported a Christian affiliation. Results showed that the illness exerted the greatest demands (highest DOI scores) on those in the youngest age group
(21-45 years) and on those with terminal illness. These respondents also reported lower levels of spiritual well-being.

Subjects who reported significantly lower ( $p<.05$ ) DOI levels related to their physical symptoms, monitoring symptoms, and treatment issues also reported higher levels of spiritual well-being.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses who care for cancer patients must be aware of the intense illness-related demands placed on their patients, especially on those in the younger age range and those with a terminal diagnosis. Nurses should explore interventions to assist patients in coping with these demands, especially interventions to enhance the patients' spiritual resources.

This study had several limitations. All responses were self-reported, and measures were taken at only one point in time. Other studies need to be conducted to determine whether the findings can be generalized.

\section*{PROVIDING POSTOPERATIVE CARE}

Postoperative nursing care for patients undergoing colon resection or colostomy is similar to nursing care for any abdominal surgery patient (see Chap. 20), including pain management during the immediate postoperative period. The nurse also monitors the patient for complications such as leakage from the site of the anastomosis, prolapse of the stoma, perforation, stoma retraction, fecal impaction, skin irritation, and pulmonary complications associated with abdominal surgery. The nurse assesses the abdomen for returning peristalsis and assesses the initial stool characteristics. It is important to help patients with a colostomy out of bed on the first postoperative day and encourage them to begin participating in managing the colostomy.

\section*{MAINTAINING OPTIMAL NUTRITION}

The nurse teaches all patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer about the health benefits to be derived from consuming a healthy diet. The diet is individualized as long as it is well balanced and does not cause diarrhea or constipation. The return to normal diet is rapid.

A complete nutritional assessment is important for patients with a colostomy. The patient avoids foods that cause excessive odor and gas, including foods in the cabbage family, eggs, fish, beans, and high-cellulose products such as peanuts. It is important to determine whether the elimination of specific foods is causing any nutritional deficiency. Nonirritating foods are substituted for those that are restricted so that deficiencies are corrected. The nurse advises the patient to experiment with an irritating food several times before restricting it, because an initial sensitivity may decrease with time. The nurse can help the patient identify any foods or fluids that may be causing diarrhea, such as fruits, high-fiber foods, soda, coffee, tea, or carbonated beverages. Paregoric, bismuth subgallate, bismuth subcarbonate, or diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil) help control the diarrhea. For constipation, prune or apple juice or a mild laxative is effective. The nurse suggests fluid intake of at least 2 L of fluid per day.

\section*{PROVIDING WOUND CARE}

The nurse frequently examines the abdominal dressing during the first 24 hours after surgery to detect signs of hemorrhage. It is important to help the patient splint the abdominal incision during coughing and deep breathing to lessen tension on the edges of the incision. The nurse monitors temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate for elevations, which may indicate an infectious process. If the patient has a colostomy, the stoma is examined for swelling (slight edema from surgical manipulation is normal), color (a healthy stoma is pink or red), discharge (a small amount of oozing is normal), and bleeding (an abnormal sign).

If the malignancy has been removed using the perineal route, the perineal wound is observed for signs of hemorrhage. This wound may contain a drain or packing, which is removed gradually. Bits of tissue may slough off for a week. This process is hastened by mechanical irrigation of the wound or with sitz baths performed two or three times each day initially. The condition of the perineal wound and any bleeding, infection, or necrosis are documented.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING COMPLICATIONS}

The patient is observed for signs and symptoms of complications. It is important to frequently assess the abdomen, including decreasing or changing bowel sounds and increasing abdominal girth, to detect bowel obstruction. The nurse monitors vital signs for increased temperature, pulse, and respirations and for de-
creased blood pressure, which may indicate an intra-abdominal infectious process. It is important to report rectal bleeding immediately because it indicates hemorrhage. The nurse monitors hematocrit and hemoglobin levels and administers blood component therapy as prescribed. Any abrupt change in abdominal pain is reported promptly. Elevated white blood cell counts and temperature or symptoms of shock are reported because they may indicate sepsis. The nurse administers antibiotics as prescribed.

Pulmonary complications are always a concern with abdominal surgery; patients older than 50 years of age are at risk, especially if they are or have been receiving sedatives or are being maintained on bed rest for a prolonged period. Two primary pulmonary complications are pneumonia and atelectasis. Frequent activity (eg, turning the patient from side to side every 2 hours), deep breathing, coughing, and early ambulation can reduce the risks for these complications. Table 38-6 lists possible postoperative complications.

The incidence of complications related to the colostomy is about one half that seen with an ileostomy. Some common complications are prolapse of the stoma (usually from obesity), perforation (from improper stoma irrigation), stoma retraction, fecal impaction, and skin irritation. Leakage from an anastomotic site can occur if the remaining bowel segments are diseased or weakened. Leakage from an intestinal anastomosis causes abdominal distention and rigidity, temperature elevation, and signs of shock. Surgical repair is necessary.

\section*{REMOVING AND APPLYING THE COLOSTOMY APPLIANCE}

The colostomy begins to function 3 to 6 days after surgery. The nurse manages the colostomy and teaches the patient about its care until the patient can take over. The nurse teaches skin care and how to apply and remove the drainage pouch. Care of the peristomal skin is an ongoing concern because excoriation or ulceration can develop quickly. The presence of such irritation makes adhering the ostomy appliance difficult, and adhering the ostomy appliance to irritated skin can worsen the skin condition. The effluent discharge and the degree to which it is irritating vary with the type of ostomy. With a transverse colostomy, the stool is soft and mushy and irritating to the skin. With a descending or sigmoid colostomy, the stool is fairly solid and less irritating to the skin. Other skin problems include yeast infections and allergic dermatitis.

If the patient wants to bathe or shower before putting on the clean appliance, micropore tape applied to the sides of the pouch will keep it secure during bathing. To remove the appliance, the patient assumes a comfortable sitting or standing position and gently pushes the skin down from the faceplate while pulling the pouch up and away from the stoma. Gentle pressure prevents the skin from being traumatized and any liquid fecal contents from spilling out. The nurse advises the patient to protect the peristomal skin by then washing the area gently with a moist, soft cloth and a mild soap. Soap acts as a mild abrasive agent to remove enzyme residue from fecal spillage. The patient should remove any excess skin barrier. While the skin is being cleansed, a gauze dressing can cover the stoma, or a vaginal tampon can be inserted gently to absorb excess drainage. After cleansing, the patient pats the skin completely dry with a gauze pad, taking care not to rub the area. The patient can lightly dust nystatin (Mycostatin) powder on the peristomal skin if irritation or yeast growth is present.

Smoothly applying the drainage appliance for a secure fit requires practice and a well-fitting appliance. Patients can choose from a wide variety of appliances, depending on their individual

needs. The stoma is measured to determine the correct size for the pouch; the pouch opening should be about 0.3 cm ( $1 / 8 \mathrm{in}$ ) larger than the stoma. After the skin is cleansed according to the previously described procedure, the patient applies the peristomal skin barrier (ie, wafer, paste, or powder). Mild skin irritation may require dusting the skin with karaya or Stomahesive powder before attaching the pouch. The patient removes the backing from the adherent surface of the appliance, and places the bag down over the stoma for 30 seconds. The patient empties or changes the drainage appliance when it is one-third to one-fourth full so that the weight of its contents does not cause the appliance to separate from the adhesive disk and spill the contents. Most appliances are disposable and odor resistant; commercially prepared deodorizers are available.

For some patients, colostomy appliances are not always necessary. As soon as the patient has learned a routine for evacuation, bags may be dispensed with, and a closed ostomy appliance or a simple dressing of disposable tissue (often covered with plastic wrap) is used, held in place by an elastic belt. Except for gas and a slight amount of mucus, nothing escapes from the colostomy opening between irrigations. Colostomy plugs that expand on insertion to prevent passage of flatus and feces are available.

\section*{IRRIGATING THE COLOSTOMY}

The purpose of irrigating a colostomy is to empty the colon of gas, mucus, and feces so that the patient can go about social and business activities without fear of fecal drainage. A stoma does not have voluntary muscular control and may empty at irregular intervals. Regulating the passage of fecal material is achieved by irrigating the colostomy or allowing the bowel to evacuate naturally without irrigations. The choice often depends on the individual and the type of the colostomy. By irrigating the stoma at a regular time, there is less gas and retention of the irrigant. The time for irrigating the colostomy should be consistent with the schedule the person will follow after leaving the hospital. Chart 38-9 delineates the irrigating procedure.

\section*{SUPPORTING A POSITIVE BODY IMAGE}

The patient is encouraged to verbalize feelings and concerns about altered body image and to discuss the surgery and the stoma (if one was created). A supportive environment and a supportive attitude on the nurse's part are crucial in promoting the patient's adaptation to the changes brought about by the surgery. If applicable, the patient must learn colostomy care and begin to plan for incorporating stoma care into daily life. The nurse helps the patient overcome aversion to the stoma or fear

\section*{Chart 38-9}

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Irrigating a Colostomy}

A colostomy is irrigated to empty the colon of feces, gas, or mucus, cleanse the lower intestinal tract, and establish a regular pattern of evacuation so that normal life activities may be pursued. A suitable time for the irrigation is selected that is compatible with the patient's posthospital pattern of activity (preferably after a meal). Irrigation should be performed at the same time each day.

Before the procedure, the patient sits on a chair in front of the toilet or on the toilet itself. An irrigating reservoir containing 500 to 1500 mL of lukewarm tapwater is hung 45 to 50 cm ( 18 to 20 in ) above the stoma (shoulder height when the patient is seated). The dressing or pouch is removed. The following procedure is used; the patient is helped to participate in the procedure to learn to perform it unassisted.

\section*{NURSING ACTION}
1. Apply an irrigating sleeve or sheath to the stoma. Place the end in the commode.

3. Lubricate the catheter/cone and gently insert it into the stoma. Insert the catheter no more than 8 cm ( 3 in ). Hold the shield/cone gently, but firmly, against the stoma to prevent backflow of water.
4. If the catheter does not advance easily, allow water to flow slowly while advancing catheter. Never force the catheter!
5. Allow tepid fluid to enter the colon slowly. If cramping occurs, clamp off the tubing and allow the patient to rest before progressing. Water should flow in over a 5 - to 10 -minute period.
6. Hold the shield/cone in place 10 seconds after the water has been instilled; then gently remove it.
7. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for most of the return; then dry the bottom of the sleeve/sheath and attach it to the top, or apply the appropriate clamp to the bottom of the sleeve.
8. Leave the sleeve/sheath in place for 30 to 45 minutes while the patient gets up and moves around.
9. Cleanse the area with a mild soap and water; pat the area dry.
10. Replace the colostomy dressing or appliance.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. This helps to control odor and splashing and allows feces and water to flow directly into the commode.

Colostomy irrigation. (A) Irrigating catheter has a cone attachment to prevent injury to stomal tissue. (B) Irrigating fluid is instilled with sleeve in place. Drainage contents empty into toilet. (C) The bulb syringe method can be used to stimulate fecal drainage. Note that a portion of the hard nozzle is removed and a catheter attached to minimize stomal irritation.
2. Air bubbles in the setup are released so that air is not introduced into the colon, which would cause crampy pain.
3. Lubrication permits ease of insertion of the catheter/cone.
4. A slow rate of flow helps to relax the bowel and facilitates passage of the catheter.
5. Painful cramps usually are caused by too rapid a flow or by too much solution; 300 mL of fluid may be all that is needed to stimulate evacuation. Volume may be increased with subsequent irrigations to 500,1000 , or 1500 mL as needed by the patient for effective results.
7. Most of the water, feces, and flatus will be expelled in 10 to 15 minutes.
8. Ambulation stimulates peristalsis and completion of the irrigation return.
9. Cleanliness and dryness will provide the patient with hours of comfort.
10. The patient should use an appliance until the colostomy is sufficiently controlled. A dressing may be all that is needed.
of self-injury by providing care and teaching in an open, accepting manner and by encouraging the patient to talk about his or her feelings about the stoma.

\section*{DISCUSSING SEXUALITY ISSUES}

The nurse encourages the patient to discuss feelings about sexuality and sexual function. Some patients may initiate questions about sexual activity directly or give indirect clues about their fears. Some may view the surgery as mutilating and a threat to their sexuality; some fear impotence. Others may express worry about odor or leakage from the pouch during sexual activity. Although the appliance presents no deterrent to sexual activity, some patients wear silk or cotton covers and smaller pouches during sex. Alternative sexual positions are recommended, as well as alternative methods of stimulation to satisfy sexual drives. The nurse assesses the patient's needs and attempts to identify specific concerns. If the nurse is uncomfortable with this or if the patient's concerns seem complex, it is appropriate for the nurse to seek assistance from an enterostomal therapy nurse, sex counselor or therapist, or advanced practice nurse.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patient education and discharge planning require the combined efforts of the physician, nurse, enterostomal therapist, social worker, and dietitian. Patients are given specific information, individualized to their needs, about ostomy care and signs and symptoms of potential complications. Dietary instructions are essential to help patients identify and eliminate irritating foods that can cause diarrhea or constipation. It is important to teach patients about their prescribed medications (ie, action, purpose, and possible side effects).

The nurse reviews treatments (eg, irrigations, wound cleansing) and dressing changes and encourages the family to participate. Because the hospital stay is short, the patient may not be able to become proficient in stoma care techniques before discharge. Many patients need referral to a home care agency and the telephone number of the local chapter of the American Cancer Society. The home care nurse goes to the home to provide further care and teaching and to assess how well the patient and family are adjusting to the colostomy. The home environment is assessed for adequacy of resources that allow the patient to accomplish self-care. A family member may assume responsibility for purchasing the equipment and supplies needed at home.

Patients need very specific directions about when to call the physician. They need to know which complications require prompt attention (ie, bleeding, abdominal distention and rigidity, diarrhea, fever, wound drainage, and disruption of suture line). If radiation therapy is planned, the possible side effects (ie, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and exhaustion) are reviewed.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Ongoing care of the patient with cancer and a colostomy often extends well beyond the initial hospital stay. Home care nurses manage ostomy follow-up care, manage the assessment and care of the debilitated patient, and coordinate adjuvant therapy. The home care visits also provide the nurse with opportunities to assess the patient's physical and emotional status and the patient's and family's ability to carry out recommended management strategies. Visits from an enterostomal therapy nurse are available to the patient and family as they learn to care for the ostomy and work through their feelings about it, the diagnosis of cancer, and the
future. Some patients are interested in and can benefit from involvement in an ostomy support group.

\section*{POLYPS OF THE COLON AND RECTUM}

A polyp is a mass of tissue that protrudes into the lumen of the bowel. Polyps can occur anywhere in the intestinal tract and rectum. They can be classified as neoplastic (ie, adenomas and carcinomas) or non-neoplastic (ie, mucosal and hyperplastic). Non-neoplastic polyps, which are benign epithelial growths, are common in the Western world. They occur more commonly in the large intestine than in the small intestine. Although most polyps do not develop into invasive neoplasms, they must be identified and followed closely. Adenomatous polyps are more common in men. The proportion of these polyps arising in the proximal part of the colon increases with age (after 40 years of age). Prevalence rates vary from $25 \%$ to $60 \%$, depending on age. Non-neoplastic polyps occur in $80 \%$ of the population, and their frequency increases with age (Wolfe, 2000).

Clinical manifestations depend on the size of the polyp and the amount of pressure it exerts on intestinal tissue. The most common symptom is rectal bleeding. Lower abdominal pain may also occur. If the polyp is large enough, symptoms of obstruction occur. The diagnosis is based on history and digital rectal examination, barium enema studies, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy.

After a polyp is identified, it should be removed. There are several methods: colonoscopy with the use of special equipment (ie, biopsy forceps and snares), laparoscopy, or colonoscopic excision with laparoscopic visualization. The latter technique enables immediate detection of potential problems and allows laparoscopic
resection and repair of the major complications of perforation and bleeding that may occur with polypectomy. Microscopic examination of the polyp then identifies the type of polyp and indicates what further surgery is required.

\section*{Diseases of the Anorectum}

Anorectal disorders are common, and more than one half of the population will experience one at some time during their lives (Yamada et al., 1999). Patients with anorectal disorders seek medical care primarily because of pain, rectal bleeding, or change in bowel habits. Other common complaints are protrusion of hemorrhoids, anal discharge, perianal itching, swelling, anal tenderness, stenosis, and ulceration. Constipation results from delaying defectation because of anorectal pain.

There has been a steady increase in the frequency of sexually transmitted diseases in recent decades, leading to the identification of new anorectal syndromes. The prevalence of these conditions is increasing. These syndromes include venereal infections such as syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, and candidiasis, and they are most commonly seen in male homosexuals who practice anorectal intercourse (Wolfe, 2000).

\section*{ANORECTAL ABSCESS}

An anorectal abscess is caused by obstruction of an anal gland, resulting in retrograde infection. People with regional enteritis or immunosuppressive conditions such as AIDS are particularly susceptible to these infections. Many of these abscesses result in fistulas.

An abscess may occur in a variety of spaces in and around the rectum. It often contains a quantity of foul-smelling pus and is painful. If the abscess is superficial, swelling, redness, and tenderness are observed. A deeper abscess may result in toxic symptoms, lower abdominal pain, and fever.

Palliative therapy consists of sitz baths and analgesics. However, prompt surgical treatment to incise and drain the abscess is the treatment of choice. When a deeper infection exists with the possibility of a fistula, the fistulous tract must be excised. If possible, the fistula is excised when the abscess is incised and drained, or a second procedure to do so may be necessary. The wound may be packed with gauze and allowed to heal by granulation.

\section*{ANAL FISTULA}

An anal fistula is a tiny, tubular, fibrous tract that extends into the anal canal from an opening located beside the anus (Fig. 38-11A). Fistulas usually result from an infection. They may also develop from trauma, fissures, or regional enteritis. Pus or stool may leak constantly from the cutaneous opening. Other symptoms may be the passage of flatus or feces from the vagina or bladder, depending on the fistula tract. Untreated fistulas may cause systemic infection with related symptoms.

Surgery is always recommended, because few fistulas heal spontaneously. A fistulectomy (ie, excision of the fistulous tract) is the recommended surgical procedure. The lower bowel is evacuated thoroughly with several prescribed enemas. During surgery, the sinus tract is identified by inserting a probe into it or by injecting the tract with methylene blue solution. The fistula is dissected out or laid open by an incision from its rectal opening to its outlet. The wound is packed with gauze.

\section*{ANAL FISSURE}

An anal fissure is a longitudinal tear or ulceration in the lining of the anal canal (see Fig. 38-11B). Fissures are usually caused by the trauma of passing a large, firm stool or from persistent tightening of the anal canal because of stress and anxiety (leading to constipation). Other causes include childbirth, trauma, and overuse of laxatives.

Extremely painful defecation, burning, and bleeding characterize fissures. Most of these fissures heal if treated by conservative measures, which include stool softeners and bulk agents, an increase in water intake, sitz baths, and emollient suppositories. A suppository combining an anesthetic with a corticosteroid helps relieve the discomfort. Anal dilation under anesthesia may be required.

If fissures do not respond to conservative treatment, surgery is indicated. The procedure considered by most surgeons to be the procedure of choice is the lateral internal sphincterotomy with excision of the fissure; the success rate is $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ (Rieghley, 1999).

\section*{HEMORRHOIDS}

Hemorrhoids are dilated portions of veins in the anal canal. They are very common. By the age of 50, about 50\% of people have hemorrhoids to some extent (Corman, 1998). Shearing of the

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 38-11 Various types of anal lesions. (A) Fistula. (B) Fissure. (C) External and internal hemorrhoids.}
\end{figure}
mucosa during defecation results in the sliding of the structures in the wall of the anal canal, including the hemorrhoidal and vascular tissues. Increased pressure in the hemorrhoidal tissue due to pregnancy may initiate hemorrhoids or aggravate existing ones. Hemorrhoids are classified as one of two types. Those above the internal sphincter are called internal hemorrhoids, and those appearing outside the external sphincter are called external hemorrhoids (see Fig. 38-11C).

Hemorrhoids cause itching and pain and are the most common cause of bright red bleeding with defecation. External hemorrhoids are associated with severe pain from the inflammation and edema caused by thrombosis (ie, clotting of blood within the hemorrhoid). This may lead to ischemia of the area and eventual necrosis. Internal hemorrhoids are not usually painful until they bleed or prolapse when they become enlarged.

Hemorrhoid symptoms and discomfort can be relieved by good personal hygiene and by avoiding excessive straining during defecation. A high-residue diet that contains fruit and bran along with an increased fluid intake may be all the treatment that is necessary to promote the passage of soft, bulky stools to prevent straining. If this treatment is not successful, the addition of hydrophilic bulk-forming agents such as psyllium and mucilloid may help. Warm compresses, sitz baths, analgesic ointments and suppositories, astringents (eg, witch hazel), and bed rest allow the engorgement to subside.

There are several types of nonsurgical treatments for hemorrhoids. Infrared photocoagulation, bipolar diathermy, and laser therapy are newer techniques that are used to affix the mucosa to the underlying muscle. Injecting sclerosing solutions is also effective for small, bleeding hemorrhoids. These procedures help prevent prolapse.

A conservative surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids is the rubber-band ligation procedure. The hemorrhoid is visualized through the anoscope, and its proximal portion above the mucocutaneous lines is grasped with an instrument. A small rubber band is then slipped over the hemorrhoid. Tissue distal to the rubber band becomes necrotic after several days and sloughs off. Fibrosis occurs; the result is that the lower anal mucosa is drawn up and adheres to the underlying muscle. Although this treatment has been satisfactory for some patients, it has proven painful for others and may cause secondary hemorrhage. It has been known to cause perianal infection.

Cryosurgical hemorrhoidectomy, another method for removing hemorrhoids, involves freezing the hemorrhoid for a sufficient time to cause necrosis. Although it is relatively painless, this procedure is not widely used because the discharge is very foul smelling and wound healing is prolonged. The Nd:YAG laser is useful in excising hemorrhoids, particularly external hemorrhoidal tags. The treatment is quick and relatively painless. Hemorrhage and abscess are rare postoperative complications.

The previously described methods of treating hemorrhoids are not effective for advanced thrombosed veins, which must be treated by more extensive surgery. Hemorrhoidectomy, or surgical excision, can be performed to remove all the redundant tissue involved in the process. During surgery, the rectal sphincter is usually dilated digitally and the hemorrhoids are removed with a clamp and cautery or are ligated and then excised. After the operative procedures are completed, a small tube may be inserted through the sphincter to permit the escape of flatus and blood; pieces of Gelfoam or Oxycel gauze may be placed over the anal wounds.

\section*{SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED ANORECTAL DISEASES}

Three infectious syndromes that are related to sexually transmitted diseases have been identified. Proctitis involves the rectum. It is commonly associated with recent anal-receptive intercourse with an infected partner. Symptoms include a mucopurulent discharge or bleeding, pain in the area, and diarrhea. The pathogens most frequently involved are Neisseria gonorrheae (53\%), Chlamydia (20\%), herpes simplex virus ( $18 \%$ ), and Treponema pallidium ( $9 \%$ ) (Yamada et al., 1999). Proctocolitis involves the rectum and lowest portion of the descending colon. Symptoms are similar to proctitis but may also include watery or bloody diarrhea, cramps, pain, and bloating. Enteritis involves more of the descending colon, and symptoms include watery, bloody diarrhea; abdominal pain; and weight loss. The most common pathogens causing enteritis are E. histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Shigella, and Campylobacter (Wolfe, 2000).

Sigmoidoscopy is performed to identify portions of the anorectum involved. Samples are taken with rectal swabs, and cultures are obtained to identify the pathogens involved. The treatment of choice for bacterial infections is antibiotics (ie, cefixime, doxycycline, and penicillin). Acyclovir is given to those with viral infections. Infections from E. histolytica and G. lamblia are treated with antiamebic therapy (ie, metronidazole). Ciprofloxacin is an effective treatment for Shigella. Antibiotics of choice for Campylobacter infection are erythromycin and ciprofloxacin.

\section*{PILONIDAL SINUS OR CYST}

A pilonidal sinus or cyst is found in the intergluteal cleft on the posterior surface of the lower sacrum (Fig. 38-12). Current theories suggest that it results from local trauma that causes the pen-

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-080.jpg?height=955&width=765&top_left_y=1495&top_left_x=1167}

\caption{EIGURE 38-12 (A) Pilonidal sinus on lower sacrum about 5 cm (2 in) above the anus in the intergluteal cleft. (B) Note: Hair particles emerge from the sinus tract and localized indentations (pits) can appear on the skin near the sinus openings.}
\end{figure}
etration of hairs into the epithelium and subcutaneous tissue (Yamada et al., 1999). It may also be formed congenitally by an infolding of epithelial tissue beneath the skin, which may communicate with the skin surface through one or several small sinus openings. Hair frequently is seen protruding from these openings, and this gives the cyst its name, pilonidal (ie, a nest of hair). The cysts rarely cause symptoms until adolescence or early adult life, when infection produces an irritating drainage or an abscess. Perspiration and friction easily irritate this area.

In the early stages of the inflammation, the infection may be controlled by antibiotic therapy, but after an abscess has formed, surgery is indicated. The abscess is incised and drained under local anesthesia. After the acute process resolves, further surgery is performed to excise the cyst and the secondary sinus tracts. The wound is allowed to heal by granulation. Gauze dressings are placed in the wound to keep its edges separated while healing occurs.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH AN ANORECTAL CONDITION}

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse takes a health history to determine the presence and characteristics of itching, burning, or pain. Does it occur during bowel movements? How long does it last? Is any abdominal pain associated with it? Does any bleeding occur from the rectum? How much? How frequently? Is it bright red? Is there any other discharge, such as mucus or pus? Other questions relate to elimination patterns and laxative use, diet history (including fiber intake), the amount of exercise, activity levels, and occupation (especially one that involves prolonged sitting or standing). Assessment also includes inspection of the stool for blood or mucus and the perianal area for hemorrhoids, fissures, irritation, or pus.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Constipation related to ignoring the urge to defecate because of pain during elimination
- Anxiety related to impending surgery and embarrassment
- Acute pain related to irritation, pressure, and sensitivity in the anorectal area from anorectal disease and sphincter spasms after surgery
- Urinary retention related to postoperative reflex spasm and fear of pain
- Risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}
- Hemorrhage

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include adequate elimination patterns, reduction of anxiety, pain relief, promotion of urinary elimination, managing the therapeutic regimen, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING CONSTIPATION}

The nurse encourages intake of at least 2 L of water daily to provide adequate hydration and recommends high-fiber foods to promote bulk in the stool and to make it easier to pass fecal matter through the rectum. Bulk laxatives such as Metamucil and stool softeners are administered as prescribed. The patient is advised to set aside a time for moving the bowels and to heed the urge to defecate as promptly as possible. It may be helpful to have the patient perform relaxation exercises before defecating to relax the abdominal and perineal muscles, which may be constricted or in spasm. Administering an analgesic before a bowel movement is beneficial.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Patients facing rectal surgery may be upset and irritable because of discomfort, pain, and embarrassment. The nurse identifies specific psychosocial needs and individualizes the plan of care. The nurse maintains the patient's privacy while providing care and by limiting visitors, if the patient desires. Soiled dressings are removed from the room promptly to prevent unpleasant odors; room deodorizers may be needed if dressings are foul smelling.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

During the first 24 hours after rectal surgery, painful spasms of the sphincter and perineal muscles may occur. Control of pain is a prime consideration. The patient is encouraged to assume a comfortable position. Flotation pads under the buttocks when sitting help to decrease the pain, as may ice and analgesic ointments. Warm compresses may promote circulation and soothe irritated tissues. Sitz baths taken three or four times each day can relieve soreness and pain by relaxing sphincter spasm. Twentyfour hours after surgery, topical anesthetic agents may be beneficial in relieving local irritation and soreness. Medications may include topical anesthetics (ie, suppositories), astringents, antiseptics, tranquilizers, and antiemetics. Patients are more compliant and less apprehensive if they are free of pain.

Wet dressings saturated with equal parts of cold water and witch hazel help relieve edema. When wet compresses are being used continuously, the petrolatum is applied around the anal area to prevent skin maceration. The patient is instructed to assume a prone position at intervals because this position promotes dependent drainage of edematous fluid.

\section*{PROMOTING URINARY ELIMINATION}

Voiding may be a problem after surgery because of a reflex spasm of the sphincter at the outlet of the bladder and a certain amount of muscle guarding from apprehension and pain. The nurse tries all methods to encourage voluntary voiding (ie, increasing fluid intake, listening to running water, and dripping water over the urinary meatus) before resorting to catheterization. After rectal surgery, urinary output is closely monitored.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING COMPLICATIONS}

The operative site is examined frequently for rectal bleeding. The nurse assesses the patient for systemic indicators of excessive bleeding (ie, tachycardia, hypotension, restlessness, and thirst). After hemorrhoidectomy, hemorrhage may occur from the veins that were cut. If a tube has been inserted through the sphincter after surgery, evidence of bleeding may be visible on the dressings. If bleeding is obvious, direct pressure is applied to the area, and the physician is notified. It is important to avoid using moist heat because it encourages vessel dilation and bleeding.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Most patients with anorectal conditions are not hospitalized. Those who have surgical procedures to correct the condition often are discharged directly from the outpatient surgical center. If they are hospitalized, it is for a short time, usually only 24 hours. Patient teaching is essential to facilitate recovery at home.

The nurse instructs the patient to keep the perianal area as clean as possible by gently cleansing with warm water and then drying with absorbent cotton wipes. The patient avoids rubbing the area with toilet tissue. Instructions are provided about how to take a sitz bath and how to test the temperature of the water. Sitz baths may be given in the bathtub or plastic sitz bath unit three or four times each day. Sitz baths should follow each bowel movement for 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. The nurse encourages the patient to respond quickly to the urge to defecate to prevent constipation. The diet is modified to increase fluids and fiber. Moderate exercise is encouraged, and the patient is taught about the prescribed diet, the significance of proper eating habits and exercise, and the laxatives that can be taken safely.

1. You are caring for an elderly man who was just admitted to the hospital. He complains that he has had pain throughout his abdomen for the past 2 days. He states that his bowel patterns have changed recently and that he has not had a bowel movement in 4 days. He has not eaten since yesterday. He states he has no appetite and that he is concerned
because he has type 2 diabetes mellitus. When you complete your initial nursing assessment, you notice that his abdomen is distended and rigid and that bowel sounds are absent throughout all fields. Analyze these findings, indicate what you think the possible causes may be, and explain the actions you would take and why. Explain how this man's diagnosis of diabetes mellitus affects his plan of nursing care and his medical management.
2. During a conversation with a neighbor, you learn that she has recently seen her doctor and that she has been diagnosed with IBS. She asks you to help her understand this process and to explain the reason for the dietary restrictions her doctor has given her. Her doctor also prescribed a laxative and an antidepressant. She explains the amount of stress she has been under at work. Identify the facts that you know about this process and how the actions of the doctor would help in this situation. What will you tell your neighbor?
3. You are caring for a patient who has been diagnosed with colon cancer. He recently underwent a colonoscopy where the growth was detected in the lower portion of the descending colon. The patient is scheduled for a colon resection. You know that he will return from surgery with a sigmoid colostomy. What will you need to do during the preoperative period to prepare your patient for this surgery? What will be the nursing diagnoses and related interventions that are a priority during the immediate postoperative period? Explain how you would meet the postoperative emotional and health education needs of the patient with a colostomy.
4. You are assigned to a general medical clinic. Two patients with inflammatory bowel disease arrive for their appointments. One of the patients, a 52 -year-old woman, has recently been diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The other patient, a 21-year-old woman, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at 15 years of age and has had an ileostomy since the age of 19 years. Compare the two disease processes in terms of their pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course of the illness, and therapeutic management. What similarities and differences would you expect to find in the nutritional and pharmacologic therapies for these two patients? What assessment parameters would you use to identify the psychosocial needs of each of these patients.

Liver disorders are common and may result from a virus or exposure to toxic substances such as alcohol. Another liver disorder is cancer: hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly malignant tumor that is difficult to treat and often fatal. In the United States, hepatocellular cancer accounts for less than $1 \%$ of all cancers, but in other parts of the world, it accounts for up to $50 \%$ of cancer cases. The difference is thought to be due to the percentage of the population who are carriers of the hepatitis B virus, which predisposes individuals to hepatocellular cancer. Liver cancer can originate in the liver or can metastasize to the liver from other sites.

Liver function is complex, and liver dysfunction affects all body systems. For this reason, the nurse must understand how the liver functions and must have expert assessment and clinical management skills to care for patients undergoing complex diagnostic and treatment procedures. The nurse also must understand technological advances in the management of liver disorders.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The liver, the largest gland of the body, can be considered a chemical factory that manufactures, stores, alters, and excretes a large number of substances involved in metabolism. The location of the liver is essential in this function, because it receives nutrient-rich blood directly from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and then either stores or transforms these nutrients into chemicals that are used elsewhere in the body for metabolic needs. The liver is especially important in the regulation of glucose and protein metabolism. The liver manufactures and secretes bile, which has a major role in the digestion and absorption of fats in the GI tract. It removes waste products from the bloodstream and secretes them into the bile. The bile produced by the liver is stored temporarily in the gallbladder until it is needed for digestion, at which time the gallbladder empties and bile enters the intestine (Fig. 39-1).

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE LIVER}

The liver is located behind the ribs in the upper right portion of the abdominal cavity. It weighs about $1,500 \mathrm{~g}$ and is divided into four lobes. A thin layer of connective tissue surrounds each lobe,

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-086.jpg?height=581&width=794&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=1156}

\end{figure}
extending into the lobe itself and dividing the liver mass into small units called lobules (O'Grady, Lake \& Howdle, 2000).

The circulation of the blood into and out of the liver is of major importance in its function. The blood that perfuses the liver comes from two sources. Approximately $75 \%$ of the blood supply comes from the portal vein, which drains the GI tract and is rich in nutrients. The remainder of the blood supply enters by way of the hepatic artery and is rich in oxygen. Terminal branches of these two blood supplies join to form common capillary beds, which constitute the sinusoids of the liver (Fig. 39-2). Thus, a mixture of venous and arterial blood bathes the liver cells (hepatocytes). The sinusoids empty into a venule that occupies the center of each liver lobule and is called the central vein. The central veins join to form the hepatic vein, which constitutes the venous drainage from the liver and empties into the inferior vena cava, close to the diaphragm. Thus, there are two sources of blood flowing into the liver and only one exit pathway (O'Grady et al., 2000).

In addition to hepatocytes, phagocytic cells belonging to the reticuloendothelial system are present in the liver. Other organs that contain reticuloendothelial cells are the spleen, bone marrow,
asterixis: involuntary flapping movements of the hands associated with metabolic liver dysfunction
balloon tamponade: use of balloons placed within the esophagus and proximal portion of the stomach and inflated to compress bleeding vessels (esophageal and gastric varices)
Budd-Chiari syndrome: hepatic vein thrombosis resulting in noncirrhotic portal hypertension
cirrhosis: a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrotic changes and the formation of dense connective tissue within the liver, subsequent degenerative changes, and loss of functioning cells
constructional apraxia: inability to draw figures in two or three dimensions
cryoablation: method of treating malignant hepatic lesions that involves exposing the
tumor to temperatures below $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and subsequent thawing. This surgical intervention is performed via a probe through which liquid nitrogen flows.
hepatic encephalopathy: central nervous system dysfunction resulting from liver disease; frequently associated with elevated ammonia levels that produce changes in mental status, altered level of consciousness, and coma
fetor hepaticus: sweet, slightly fecal odor to the breath, presumed to be of intestinal origin; prevalent with the extensive collateral portal circulation in chronic liver disease
fulminant hepatic failure: sudden, severe onset of acute liver failure that occurs within 8 weeks of the first symptoms of jaundice
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT): grafting of a donor liver into the normal
anatomic location, with removal of the diseased native liver
portal hypertension: elevated pressure in the portal circulation resulting from obstruction of venous flow into and through the liver
sclerotherapy: the injection of substances into or around esophagogastric varices to cause constriction, thickening, and hardening of the vessel and thus to stop bleeding
variceal banding: procedure that involves the endoscopic placement of a rubber band-like device over esophageal varices to ligate the area and stop bleeding
xenograft: transplantation of organs from one species to another

\end{figure}
lymph nodes, and lungs. In the liver, these cells are called Kupffer cells. Their main function is to engulf particulate matter (such as bacteria) that enters the liver through the portal blood.

The smallest bile ducts, called canaliculi, are located between the lobules of the liver. The canaliculi receive secretions from the hepatocytes and carry them to larger bile ducts, which eventually form the hepatic duct. The hepatic duct from the liver and the cystic duct from the gallbladder join to form the common bile duct, which empties into the small intestine. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction where the common bile duct enters the duodenum, controls the flow of bile into the intestine. Disorders of the gallbladder are described in Chapter 40.

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF THE LIVER}

\section*{Glucose Metabolism}

The liver plays a major role in the metabolism of glucose and the regulation of blood glucose concentration. After a meal, glucose is taken up from the portal venous blood by the liver and converted into glycogen, which is stored in the hepatocytes. Subsequently, the glycogen is converted back to glucose and released as needed into the bloodstream to maintain normal levels of blood glucose. Additional glucose can be synthesized by the liver through a process called gluconeogenesis. For this process, the liver uses amino acids from protein breakdown or lactate produced by exercising muscles (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

\section*{Ammonia Conversion}

Use of amino acids from protein for gluconeogenesis results in the formation of ammonia as a byproduct. The liver converts this metabolically generated ammonia into urea. Ammonia produced by bacteria in the intestines is also removed from portal blood for
urea synthesis. In this way, the liver converts ammonia, a potential toxin, into urea, a compound that can be excreted in the urine.

\section*{Protein Metabolism}

The liver also plays an important role in protein metabolism. It synthesizes almost all of the plasma proteins (except gamma globulin), including albumin, alpha and beta globulins, blood clotting factors, specific transport proteins, and most of the plasma lipoproteins. Vitamin K is required by the liver for synthesis of prothrombin and some of the other clotting factors. Amino acids serve as the building blocks for protein synthesis.

\section*{Fat Metabolism}

The liver is also active in fat metabolism. Fatty acids can be broken down for the production of energy and the production of ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone). Ketone bodies are small compounds that can enter the bloodstream and provide a source of energy for muscles and other tissues. Breakdown of fatty acids into ketone bodies occurs primarily when the availability of glucose for metabolism is limited, as during starvation or in uncontrolled diabetes. Fatty acids and their metabolic products are also used for the synthesis of cholesterol, lecithin, lipoproteins, and other complex lipids. Under some conditions, lipids may accumulate in the hepatocytes, resulting in the abnormal condition called fatty liver.

\section*{Vitamin and Iron Storage}

Vitamins A, B, and D and several of the B-complex vitamins are stored in large amounts in the liver. Certain substances, such as iron and copper, are also stored in the liver. Because the liver is rich in these substances, liver extracts have been used for therapy for a wide range of nutritional disorders.

\section*{Drug Metabolism}

The liver metabolizes many medications, such as barbiturates, opioids, sedative agents, anesthetics, and amphetamines. Metabolism generally results in loss of activity of the medication, although in some cases activation of the medication may occur. One of the important pathways for medication metabolism involves conjugation (binding) of the medication with a variety of compounds, such as glucuronic or acetic acid, to form more soluble substances. The conjugated products may be excreted in the feces or urine, similar to bilirubin excretion. If an oral medication (absorbed from the GI tract) is metabolized by the liver to a great extent before it reaches the systemic circulation (first-pass effect), the amount of medication actually reaching the systemic circulation (oral bioavailability) will be decreased. Bioavailability is the fraction of the administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation. Some medications have such a large first-pass effect that their use is essentially limited to the parenteral route, or oral doses must be substantially larger than parenteral doses to achieve the same effect.

\section*{Bile Formation}

Bile is continuously formed by the hepatocytes and collected in the canaliculi and bile ducts. It is composed mainly of water and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate, and it also contains significant amounts of lecithin, fatty acids, cholesterol, bilirubin, and bile salts. Bile is collected
and stored in the gallbladder and is emptied into the intestine when needed for digestion. The functions of bile are excretory, as in the excretion of bilirubin; bile also serves as an aid to digestion through the emulsification of fats by bile salts.

Bile salts are synthesized by the hepatocytes from cholesterol. After conjugation or binding with amino acids (taurine and glycine), they are excreted into the bile. The bile salts, together with cholesterol and lecithin, are required for emulsification of fats in the intestine, which is necessary for efficient digestion and absorption. Bile salts are then reabsorbed, primarily in the distal ileum, into portal blood for return to the liver and are again excreted into the bile. This pathway from hepatocytes to bile to intestine and back to the hepatocytes is called the enterohepatic circulation. Because of the enterohepatic circulation, only a small fraction of the bile salts that enter the intestine are excreted in the feces. This decreases the need for active synthesis of bile salts by the liver cells.

\section*{Bilirubin Excretion}

Bilirubin is a pigment derived from the breakdown of hemoglobin by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, including the Kupffer cells of the liver. Hepatocytes remove bilirubin from the blood and chemically modify it through conjugation to glucuronic acid, which makes the bilirubin more soluble in aqueous solutions. The conjugated bilirubin is secreted by the hepatocytes into the adjacent bile canaliculi and is eventually carried in the bile into the duodenum.

In the small intestine, bilirubin is converted into urobilinogen, which is in part excreted in the feces and in part absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the portal blood. Much of this reabsorbed urobilinogen is removed by the hepatocytes and is secreted into the bile once again (enterohepatic circulation). Some of the urobilinogen enters the systemic circulation and is excreted by the kidneys in the urine. Elimination of bilirubin in the bile represents the major route of excretion for this compound.

The bilirubin concentration in the blood may be increased in the presence of liver disease, when the flow of bile is impeded (ie, with gallstones in the bile ducts), or with excessive destruction of red blood cells. With bile duct obstruction, bilirubin does not enter the intestine; as a consequence, urobilinogen is absent from the urine and decreased in the stool. Biliary tract disorders are discussed in Chapter 40.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The Gerontologic Considerations Box outlines age-related changes in the liver. The most common change in the liver in the elderly is a decrease in its size and weight, accompanied by a decrease in total hepatic blood flow. In general, however, these decreases are proportional to the decreases in body size and weight seen in normal aging. Results of liver function tests do not normally change in the elderly; abnormal results in an elderly patient indicate abnormal liver function and are not the result of the aging process itself.

The immune system is altered in the aged, and a less responsive immune system may be responsible for the increased incidence and severity of hepatitis B in the elderly and the increased incidence of liver abscesses secondary to decreased phagocytosis by the Kupffer cells. With the advent of hepatitis B vaccine as the standard for prevention, the incidence of hepatic diseases may decrease in the future.

Metabolism of medications by the liver appears to decrease in the elderly, but such changes are usually accompanied by changes

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Age-Related Changes of the Hepatobiliary System
- Steady decrease in size and weight of the liver, particularly in women
- Decrease in blood flow
- Decrease in replacement/repair of liver cells after injury
- Reduced drug metabolism
- Slow clearance of hepatitis B surface antigen
- Decline in drug clearance capability
- Increased prevalence of gallstones due to the increase in cholesterol secretion in bile
- Decreased gallbladder contraction after a meal
- Atypical clinical presentation of biliary disease
- More severe complications of biliary tract disease
in intestinal absorption, renal excretion, and altered body distribution of some medications secondary to changes in fat deposition. These alterations necessitate careful medication administration and monitoring; if appropriate, reduced dosages may be needed to prevent medication toxicity.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

If liver function test results are abnormal, the patient may need to be evaluated for liver disease. In such cases, the health history will focus on exposure of the patient to hepatotoxic substances or infectious agents. The patient's occupational, recreational, and travel history may assist in identifying exposure to hepatotoxins (eg, industrial chemicals, other toxins) responsible for illness. The patient's history of alcohol and drug use, including but not limited to the use of injectable drugs, provides additional information about exposure to toxins and infectious agents. Many medications (including acetaminophen, ketoconazole, and valproic acid) are responsible for hepatic dysfunction and disease. A careful medication history to assess hepatic dysfunction should address all prescribed and over-the counter medications, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements used by the patient currently and in the past.

Lifestyle behaviors that increase the risk for exposure to infectious agents are identified. Injectable drug use, sexual practices, and a history of foreign travel are all potential risk factors for liver disease. The amount and type of alcohol consumption are identified using screening tools (questionnaires) that have been developed for this purpose (see Chap. 5).

The history also includes an evaluation of the patient's past medical history to identify risk factors for the development of liver disease. Current and past medical conditions, including those of a psychological or psychiatric nature, are identified. The family history includes questions about familial liver disorders that may have their etiology in alcohol abuse or gallstone disease, as well as other familial or genetic diseases, such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1 antitrypsin disease (see "Genetics in Nursing Practice" in Chap. 42).

The history also includes reviewing symptoms that suggest liver disease. Symptoms that may have their etiology in liver disease but are not specific to hepatic dysfunction include jaundice, malaise, weakness, fatigue, pruritus, abdominal pain, fever, anorexia,
weight gain, edema, increasing abdominal girth, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia (passage of bloody stools), easy bruising, decreased libido in men and secondary amenorrhea in women, changes in mental acuity, personality changes, and sleep disturbances.

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

The nurse assesses the patient for physical signs that may occur with liver dysfunction, including pallor of chronic illness and jaundice. The skin, mucosa, and sclerae are inspected for jaundice, and the extremities are assessed for muscle atrophy, edema, and skin excoriation secondary to scratching. The nurse observes the skin for petechiae or ecchymotic areas (bruises), spider angiomas, and palmar erythema. The male patient is assessed for unilateral or bilateral gynecomastia and testicular atrophy due to endocrine changes. The patient's cognitive status (recall, memory, abstract thinking) and neurologic status are assessed. The nurse observes for general tremor, asterixis, weakness, and slurred speech. These symptoms are discussed later.

The nurse assesses the abdomen for dilated abdominal wall veins, ascites, and a fluid wave (discussed later). The abdomen is palpated to assess liver size and to detect any tenderness over the liver. The liver may be palpable in the right upper quadrant. A palpable liver presents as a firm, sharp ridge with a smooth surface (Fig. 39-3). The nurse estimates liver size by percussing its upper and lower borders. When the liver is not palpable but tenderness is suspected, tapping the lower right thorax briskly may elicit tenderness. For comparison, the nurse then performs a similar maneuver on the left lower thorax.

If the liver is palpable, the examiner notes and records its size and consistency, whether it is tender, and whether its outline is regular or irregular. If the liver is enlarged, the degree to which it descends below the right costal margin is recorded to provide some indication of its size. The examiner determines whether the liver's edge is sharp and smooth or blunt, and whether the enlarged liver is nodular or smooth. The liver of a patient with cir-

\end{figure}
rhosis is small and hard, whereas the liver of a patient with acute hepatitis is soft, and the hand easily moves the edge.

Tenderness of the liver implies recent acute enlargement with consequent stretching of the liver capsule. The absence of tenderness may imply that the enlargement is of long-standing duration. The liver of a patient with viral hepatitis is tender, whereas that of a patient with alcoholic hepatitis is not. Enlargement of the liver is an abnormal finding requiring evaluation.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

\section*{LIVER FUNCTION TESTS}

More than $70 \%$ of the parenchyma of the liver may be damaged before liver function test results become abnormal. Function is generally measured in terms of serum enzyme activity (ie, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, serum aminotransferases) and serum concentrations of proteins (albumin and globulins), bilirubin, ammonia, clotting factors, and lipids. Several of these tests may be helpful for assessing patients with liver disease. However, the nature and extent of hepatic dysfunction cannot be determined by these tests alone, as many other disorders can affect their results.

Serum aminotransferases (also called transaminases) are sensitive indicators of injury to the liver cells and are useful in detecting acute liver disease such as hepatitis. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (formerly called serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (formerly called serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (also called G-glutamyl transpeptidase) are the most frequently used tests of liver damage. ALT levels increase primarily in liver disorders and may be used to monitor the course of hepatitis or cirrhosis or the effects of treatments that may be toxic to the liver. AST is present in tissues that have high metabolic activity; thus, the level may be increased if there is damage to or death of tissues of organs such as the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Although not specific to liver disease, levels of AST may be increased in cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver cancer. Increased GGT levels are associated with cholestasis but can also be due to alcoholic liver disease. Although the kidney has the highest level of the enzyme, the liver is considered the source of normal serum activity. The test determines liver cell dysfunction and is a sensitive indicator of cholestasis. Its main value in liver disease is confirming the hepatic origin of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. Common liver function tests are listed in Table 39-1.

\section*{LIVER BIOPSY}

Liver biopsy is the removal of a small amount of liver tissue, usually through needle aspiration. It permits examination of liver cells. The most common indication is to evaluate diffuse disorders of the parenchyma and to diagnose space-occupying lesions. Liver biopsy is especially useful when clinical findings and laboratory tests are not diagnostic. Bleeding and bile peritonitis after liver biopsy are the major complications; therefore, coagulation studies are obtained, their values are noted, and abnormal results are treated before liver biopsy is performed. Other techniques for liver biopsy are preferred if ascites or coagulation abnormalities exist. A liver biopsy can be performed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance or transvenously through the right internal jugular vein to right hepatic vein under fluoroscopic control. Liver biopsy can also be performed laparoscopically. Nursing responsibilities related to percutaneous liver biopsy are summarized in Chart 39-1.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Assisting With Percutaneous Liver Biopsy}

\section*{NURSING ACTIVITIES}

\section*{PREPROCEDURE}
1. Ascertain that results of coagulation tests (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count) are available and that compatible donor blood is available.
2. Check for signed consent; confirm that informed consent has been provided.
3. Measure and record the patient's pulse, respirations, and blood pressure immediately before biopsy.
4. Describe to the patient in advance: steps of the procedure; sensations expected; after-effects anticipated; restrictions of activity and monitoring procedures to follow.

\section*{DURING PROCEDURE}
5. Support the patient during the procedure.
6. Expose the right side of the patient's upper abdomen (right hypochondriac).
7. Instruct the patient to inhale and exhale deeply several times, finally to exhale, and to hold breath at the end of expiration. The physician promptly introduces the biopsy needle by way of the transthoracic (intercostal) or transabdominal (subcostal) route, penetrates the liver, aspirates, and withdraws.
8. Instruct the patient to resume breathing.

\section*{RATIONALE}

Many patients with liver disease have clotting defects and are at risk for bleeding.

Prebiopsy values provide a basis on which to compare the patient's vital signs and evaluate status after the procedure.
Explanations allay fears and ensure cooperation.

Encouragement and support of the nurse enhance comfort and promote a sense of security.
The skin at the site of penetration will be cleansed and a local anesthetic will be infiltrated.
Holding the breath immobilizes the chest wall and the diaphragm; penetration of the diaphragm thereby is avoided, and the risk of lacerating the liver is minimized.

\section*{POSTPROCEDURE}
9. Immediately after the biopsy, assist the patient to turn onto the right side; place a pillow under the costal margin, and caution the patient to remain in this position, recumbent and immobile, for several hours. Instruct the patient to avoid coughing or straining.
10. Measure and record the patient's pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure at 10 - to 15 -minute intervals for the first hour, then every 30 minutes for the next 1 to 2 hours or until the patient's condition stabilizes.
11. If the patient is discharged after the procedure, instruct the patient to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for 1 week.

In this position, the liver capsule at the site of penetration is compressed against the chest wall, and the escape of blood or bile through the perforation is prevented.

Changes in vital signs may indicate bleeding, severe hemorrhage, or bile peritonitis, the most frequent complications of liver biopsy.

Activity restriction reduces the risk of bleeding at the biopsy puncture site.

\section*{OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS}

Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to identify normal structures and abnormalities of the liver and biliary tree. A radioisotope liver scan may be performed to assess liver size and hepatic blood flow and obstruction.

Laparoscopy (insertion of a fiber-optic endoscope through a small abdominal incision) is used to examine the liver and other pelvic structures. It is also used to perform guided liver biopsy, to determine the etiology of ascites, and to diagnose and stage tumors of the liver and other abdominal organs.

\section*{Hepatic Dysfunction}

Hepatic dysfunction results from damage to the liver's parenchymal cells, either directly from primary liver diseases or indirectly from obstruction of bile flow or derangements of hepatic circulation. Liver dysfunction may be acute or chronic; chronic dysfunction is far more common than acute.

Chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, is the seventh most common cause of death in the United States among young and middle-aged adults. More than $40 \%$ of those deaths are associated with alcohol. The rate of chronic liver disease for men is twice that for women, and chronic liver disease is more common among African Americans than Caucasians.

Disease processes that lead to hepatocellular dysfunction may be caused by infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses and by anoxia, metabolic disorders, toxins and medications, nutritional deficiencies, and hypersensitivity states. The most common cause of parenchymal damage is malnutrition, especially that related to alcoholism.

The parenchymal cells respond to most noxious agents by replacing glycogen with lipids, producing fatty infiltration with or without cell death or necrosis. This is commonly associated with inflammatory cell infiltration and growth of fibrous tissue. Cell regeneration can occur if the disease process is not too toxic to the cells. The result of chronic parenchymal disease is the shrunken, fibrotic liver seen in cirrhosis.

The consequences of liver disease are numerous and varied. Their ultimate effects are often incapacitating or life-threatening, and their presence is ominous. Treatment often is difficult. Among the most common and significant symptoms of liver disease are the following:
- Jaundice, resulting from increased bilirubin concentration in the blood
- Portal hypertension, ascites, and varices, resulting from circulatory changes within the diseased liver and producing severe GI hemorrhages and marked sodium and fluid retention
- Nutritional deficiencies, which result from the inability of the damaged liver cells to metabolize certain vitamins; responsible for impaired functioning of the central and peripheral nervous systems and for abnormal bleeding tendencies
- Hepatic encephalopathy or coma, reflecting accumulation of ammonia in the serum due to impaired protein metabolism by the diseased liver

\section*{JAUNDICE}

When the bilirubin concentration in the blood is abnormally elevated, all the body tissues, including the sclerae and the skin, become yellow-tinged or greenish-yellow, a condition called jaun-
dice. Jaundice becomes clinically evident when the serum bilirubin level exceeds $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $43 \mathrm{fmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Increased serum bilirubin levels and jaundice may result from impairment of hepatic uptake, conjugation of bilirubin, or excretion of bilirubin into the biliary system. There are several types of jaundice: hemolytic, hepatocellular, obstructive, or jaundice due to hereditary hyperbilirubinemia. Hepatocellular and obstructive jaundice are the two types commonly associated with liver disease.

\section*{Hemolytic Jaundice}

Hemolytic jaundice is the result of an increased destruction of the red blood cells, the effect of which is to flood the plasma with bilirubin so rapidly that the liver, although functioning normally, cannot excrete the bilirubin as quickly as it is formed. This type of jaundice is encountered in patients with hemolytic transfusion reactions and other hemolytic disorders. The bilirubin in the blood of these patients is predominantly of the unconjugated, or free, type. Fecal and urine urobilinogen levels are increased, but the urine is free of bilirubin. Patients with this type of jaundice, unless their hyperbilirubinemia is extreme, do not experience symptoms or complications as a result of the jaundice per se. Prolonged jaundice, however, even if mild, predisposes to the formation of pigment stones in the gallbladder, and extremely severe jaundice (levels of free bilirubin exceeding 20 to $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) poses a risk for brain stem damage.

\section*{Hepatocellular Jaundice}

Hepatocellular jaundice is caused by the inability of damaged liver cells to clear normal amounts of bilirubin from the blood. The cellular damage may be from infection, such as in viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$, or E ) or other viruses that affect the liver (eg, yellow fever virus, Epstein-Barr virus), from medication or chemical toxicity (eg, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, phosphorus, arsenicals, certain medications), or from alcohol. Cirrhosis of the liver is a form of hepatocellular disease that may produce jaundice. It is usually associated with excessive alcohol intake, but it may also be a late result of liver cell necrosis caused by viral infection. In prolonged obstructive jaundice, cell damage eventually develops, so that both types appear together.

Patients with hepatocellular jaundice may be mildly or severely ill, with lack of appetite, nausea, malaise, fatigue, weakness, and possible weight loss. In some cases of hepatocellular disease, jaundice may not be obvious. The serum bilirubin concentration and urine urobilinogen level may be elevated. In addition, AST and ALT levels may be increased, indicating cellular necrosis. The patient may report headache, chills, and fever if the cause is infectious. Depending on the cause and extent of the liver cell damage, hepatocellular jaundice may or may not be completely reversible.

\section*{Obstructive Jaundice}

Obstructive jaundice of the extrahepatic type may be caused by occlusion of the bile duct by a gallstone, an inflammatory process, a tumor, or pressure from an enlarged organ. The obstruction may also involve the small bile ducts within the liver (ie, intrahepatic obstruction), caused, for example, by pressure on these channels from inflammatory swelling of the liver or by an inflammatory exudate within the ducts themselves. Intrahepatic obstruction resulting from stasis and inspissation (thickening) of bile within the canaliculi may occur after the ingestion of certain medications,
which are referred to as cholestatic agents. These include phenothiazines, antithyroid medications, sulfonylureas, tricyclic antidepressant agents, nitrofurantoin, androgens, and estrogens.

Whether the obstruction is intrahepatic or extrahepatic, and whatever its cause may be, bile cannot flow normally into the intestine but is backed up into the liver substance. It is then reabsorbed into the blood and carried throughout the entire body, staining the skin, mucous membranes, and sclerae. It is excreted in the urine, which becomes deep orange and foamy. Because of the decreased amount of bile in the intestinal tract, the stools become light or clay-colored. The skin may itch intensely, requiring repeated soothing baths. Dyspepsia and intolerance to fatty foods may develop because of impaired fat digestion in the absence of intestinal bile. AST, ALT, and GGT levels generally rise only moderately, but bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated.

\section*{Hereditary Hyperbilirubinemia}

Increased serum bilirubin levels (hyperbilirubinemia) resulting from several inherited disorders can also produce jaundice. Gilbert's syndrome is a familial disorder characterized by an increased level of unconjugated bilirubin that causes jaundice. Although serum bilirubin levels are increased, liver histology and liver function test results are normal, and there is no hemolysis. This syndrome affects $2 \%$ to $5 \%$ of the population.

Other conditions that are probably caused by inborn errors of biliary metabolism include Dubin-Johnson syndrome (chronic idiopathic jaundice, with pigment in the liver) and Rotor's syndrome (chronic familial conjugated hyperbilirubinemia without pigment in the liver); "benign" cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy, with retention of conjugated bilirubin, probably secondary to unusual sensitivity to the hormones of pregnancy; and probably also benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis.

\section*{PORTAL HYPERTENSION}

Obstructed blood flow through the damaged liver results in increased blood pressure (portal hypertension) throughout the portal venous system. Although portal hypertension is commonly associated with hepatic cirrhosis, it can also occur with noncirrhotic liver disease. While splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) with possible hypersplenism is a common manifestation of portal hypertension, two major consequences of portal hypertension are ascites and varices.

In ascites, fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity. Although ascites is often a result of liver damage, it may also occur with disorders such as cancer, kidney disease, and heart failure. Varices are varicosities that develop from elevated pressures transmitted to all of the veins that drain into the portal system. They are prone to rupture and often are the source of massive hemorrhages from the upper GI tract and the rectum. In addition, blood clotting abnormalities, often seen in patients with severe liver disease, increase the likelihood of bleeding.

\section*{ASCITES}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The mechanisms responsible for the development of ascites are not completely understood. Portal hypertension and the resulting increase in capillary pressure and obstruction of venous blood flow through the damaged liver are contributing factors. The failure of the liver to metabolize aldosterone increases sodium and water retention by the kidney. Sodium and water retention, in-
creased intravascular fluid volume, and decreased synthesis of albumin by the damaged liver all contribute to fluid moving from the vascular system into the peritoneal space. Loss of fluid into the peritoneal space causes further sodium and water retention by the kidney in an effort to maintain the vascular fluid volume, and the process becomes self-perpetuating.

As a result of liver damage, large amounts of albumin-rich fluid, 15 L or more, may accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. With the movement of albumin from the serum to the peritoneal cavity, the osmotic pressure of the serum decreases. This, combined with increased portal pressure, results in movement of fluid into the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 39-4).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Increased abdominal girth and rapid weight gain are common presenting symptoms of ascites. The patient may be short of breath and uncomfortable from the enlarged abdomen, and striae and distended veins may be visible over the abdominal wall. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances are common.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation}

The presence and extent of ascites are assessed by percussion of the abdomen. When fluid has accumulated in the peritoneal cavity, the flanks bulge when the patient assumes a supine position. The presence of fluid can be confirmed either by percussing for shifting dullness or by detecting a fluid wave (Fig. 39-5). A fluid wave is likely to be found only when a large amount of fluid is present.

\end{figure}

Daily measurement and recording of abdominal girth and body weight are essential to assess the progression of ascites and its response to treatment.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{DIETARY MODIFICATION}

The goal of treatment for the patient with ascites is a negative sodium balance to reduce fluid retention. Table salt, salty foods, salted butter and margarine, and all ordinary canned and frozen foods (foods that are not specifically prepared for low-sodium diets) should be avoided. It may take 2 to 3 months for the patient's taste buds to adjust to unsalted foods. In the meantime, the taste of unsalted foods can be improved by using salt substitutes such as lemon juice, oregano, and thyme. Commercial salt substitutes need to be approved by the physician because those containing ammonia could precipitate hepatic coma. Most salt substitutes contain potassium and should be avoided if the patient has impaired renal function. The patient should make liberal use of powdered, low-sodium milk and milk products. If fluid accumulation is not controlled with this regimen, the daily sodium allowance may be reduced further to 500 mg , and diuretics may be administered.

Dietary control of ascites via strict sodium restriction is difficult to achieve at home. The likelihood that the patient will follow even a 2-g sodium diet increases if the patient and the person preparing meals understand the rationale for the diet and receive periodic guidance about selecting and preparing appropriate foods. Approximately $10 \%$ of patients with ascites respond to these measures alone. Nonresponders and those who find sodium restriction difficult require diuretic therapy.

\section*{DIURETICS}

Use of diuretics along with sodium restriction is successful in $90 \%$ of patients with ascites. Spironolactone (Aldactone), an aldosterone-
blocking agent, is most often the first-line therapy in patients with ascites from cirrhosis. When used with other diuretics, spironolactone helps prevent potassium loss. Oral diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) may be added but should be used cautiously because with long-term use they may also induce severe sodium depletion (hyponatremia).

Ammonium chloride and acetazolamide (Diamox) are contraindicated because of the possibility of precipitating hepatic coma. Daily weight loss should not exceed 1 to 2 kg ( 2.2 to 4.4 lb ) in patients with ascites and peripheral edema or 0.5 to 0.75 kg ( 1.1 to 1.65 lb ) in patients without edema. Fluid restriction is not attempted unless the serum sodium concentration is very low.

Possible complications of diuretic therapy include fluid and electrolyte disturbances (including hypovolemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremic alkalosis) and encephalopathy. Encephalopathy may be precipitated by dehydration and hypovolemia. Also, when potassium stores are depleted, the amount of ammonia in the systemic circulation increases, which may cause impaired cerebral functioning and encephalopathy.

\section*{BED REST}

In patients with ascites, an upright posture is associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system (Porth, 2002). This results in reduced renal glomerular filtration and sodium excretion and a decreased response to loop diuretics. Bed rest may be a useful therapy, especially for patients whose condition is refractory to diuretics.

\section*{PARACENTESIS}

Paracentesis is the removal of fluid (ascites) from the peritoneal cavity through a small surgical incision or puncture made through the abdominal wall under sterile conditions. Ultrasound guidance may be indicated in some patients at high risk for bleeding because of an abnormal coagulation profile or in those who have had previous abdominal surgery and who may have adhesions. Paracentesis was once considered a routine form of treatment for ascites but is now performed primarily for diagnostic examination of ascitic fluid, for treatment of massive ascites that is resistant to nutritional and diuretic therapy and that is causing severe problems to the patient, and as a prelude to diagnostic imaging studies, peritoneal dialysis, or surgery. A sample of the ascitic fluid may be sent to the laboratory for analysis. Cell count, albumin and total protein levels, culture, and occasionally other tests are performed.

Use of large-volume ( 5 to 6 liters) paracentesis has been shown to be a safe method for treating patients with severe ascites. This technique, in combination with the intravenous infusion of saltpoor albumin or other colloid, has become the standard treatment for refractory, massive ascites (Krige \& Beckingham, 2001; Menon \& Kamath, 2000). The salt-poor albumin helps reduce edema by causing the ascitic fluid to be drawn back into the bloodstream and ultimately eliminated by the kidneys. The procedure provides only temporary removal of fluid; it rapidly recurs, necessitating repeated removal. Nursing care of the patient undergoing paracentesis is presented in Chart 39-2.

\section*{OTHER METHODS OF TREATMENT}

Insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt to redirect ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the systemic circulation is a treatment modality for ascites, but this procedure is seldom used because of the high complication rate and high incidence of shunt failure. The shunt is reserved for those who are resistant to diuretic therapy, are not candidates for liver transplantation, have abdominal adhesions, or are ineligible for other procedures because of severe medical conditions, such as cardiac disease.

\section*{Assisting With a Paracentesis}

\section*{Preprocedure}
1. Prepare the patient by providing the necessary information and instructions about the procedure and by offering reassurance.
2. Instruct the patient to void.
3. Gather appropriate sterile equipment and collection receptacles.
4. Place patient in upright position on edge of bed with feet supported on stool, or place in chair. Fowler's position should be used for the patient confined to bed.
5. Place sphygmomanometer cuff around patient's arm to allow monitoring of blood pressure during the procedure.

\section*{Procedure}
1. The physician, using aseptic technique, inserts the trocar through a puncture wound below the umbilicus. The fluid drains from the abdomen through a drainage tube into a container.
2. Help the patient maintain position throughout procedure.
3. Measure and record blood pressure at frequent intervals from the beginning of the procedure.
4. Monitor the patient closely for signs of vascular collapse: pallor, increased pulse rate, or decreased blood pressure.

\section*{Postprocedure}
1. Return patient to bed or to a comfortable sitting position.
2. Measure, describe, and record the fluid collected.
3. Label samples of fluid and send to laboratory.
4. Continue to monitor vital signs every 15 minutes for 1 hour, every 30 minutes over 2 hours, then every hour over 2 hours and then every 4 hours. Monitor temperature after procedure and every 4 hours.
5. Assess for hypovolemia, electrolyte loss, changes in mental status, and encephalopathy.
6. Check puncture site when taking vital signs for bleeding and leakage.
7. Provide patient education (especially if patient is discharged after procedure) regarding monitoring for bleeding or excess drainage from puncture site, avoiding heavy lifting or straining, changing position slowly, and monitoring for fever.

\end{figure}

\section*{Nursing Management}

If a patient with ascites from liver dysfunction is hospitalized, nursing measures include assessment and documentation of intake and output, abdominal girth, and daily weight to assess fluid status. The nurse monitors serum ammonia and electrolyte levels to assess electrolyte balance, response to therapy, and indicators of encephalopathy.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient treated for ascites is likely to be discharged with some ascites still present. Before hospital discharge, the nurse teaches the patient and family about the treatment plan, including the need to avoid all alcohol intake, adhere to a low-sodium diet, take medications as prescribed, and
check with the physician before taking any new medications (Chart 39-3). Additional patient and family teaching addresses skin care and the need to weigh the patient daily and to watch for and report signs and symptoms of complications.

Continuing Care. A referral for home care may be warranted, especially if the patient lives alone or cannot provide self-care. The home visit enables the nurse to assess changes in the patient's condition and weight, abdominal girth, skin, and cognitive and emotional status. The home care nurse assesses the home environment and the availability of resources needed to adhere to the treatment plan (eg, a scale to obtain daily weights, facilities to prepare and store appropriate foods, resources to purchase needed medications). It is important to assess the patient's adherence to the treatment plan and the ability to buy, prepare, and eat

\section*{Home Care Checklist Management of Ascites}

At the completion of the home care instruction, the patient or caregiver will be able to:
- Make appropriate dietary choices consistent with dietary prescription and recommendations.
- State the importance of weighing self daily and keeping a daily record of weight.
- Maintain record of weight daily and identify daily weight-loss goals.
- List weight changes (loss or gain) that should be reported to the primary health care provider.

\section*{ESOPHAGEAL VARICES}

Bleeding or hemorrhage from esophageal varices occurs in approximately one third of patients with cirrhosis and varices. The mortality rate resulting from the first bleeding episode is $45 \%$ to $50 \%$; it is one of the major causes of death in patients with cirrhosis (Pomier-Layrargues, Villeneuve, Deschenes et al., 2001). The mortality rate increases with each subsequent bleeding episode.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Esophageal varices are dilated, tortuous veins usually found in the submucosa of the lower esophagus, but they may develop higher in the esophagus or extend into the stomach. This condition nearly always is caused by portal hypertension, which in turn is due to obstruction of the portal venous circulation within the damaged liver.

Because of increased obstruction of the portal vein, venous blood from the intestinal tract and spleen seeks an outlet through collateral circulation (new pathways of return to the right atrium). The effect is increased pressure, particularly in the vessels in the submucosal layer of the lower esophagus and upper part of the stomach. These collateral vessels are not very elastic but rather are tortuous and fragile and bleed easily (Fig. 39-6). Less common causes of varices are abnormalities of the circulation in the splenic vein or superior vena cava and hepatic venothrombosis.

Bleeding esophageal varices are life-threatening and can result in hemorrhagic shock, producing decreased cerebral, hepatic, and renal perfusion. In turn, there is an increased nitrogen load from bleeding into the GI tract and an increased serum ammonia level, increasing the risk for encephalopathy. Usually the dilated veins cause no symptoms unless the portal pressure increases sharply and the mucosa or supporting structures become thin. Then massive hemorrhage takes place.

Factors that contribute to hemorrhage are muscular exertion from lifting heavy objects; straining at stool; sneezing, coughing, or
vomiting; esophagitis; irritation of vessels by poorly chewed foods or irritating fluids; or reflux of stomach contents (especially alcohol). Salicylates and any medication that erodes the esophageal mucosa or interferes with cell replication also may contribute to bleeding.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient with bleeding esophageal varices may present with hematemesis, melena, or general deterioration in mental or physical status and often has a history of alcohol abuse. Signs and

\end{figure}
symptoms of shock (cool clammy skin, hypotension, tachycardia) may be present.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Endoscopy is used to identify the bleeding site, along with barium swallow, ultrasonography, CT, and angiography.

\section*{ENDOSCOPY}

Immediate endoscopy (see Chap. 34) is indicated to identify the cause and the site of bleeding; at least $30 \%$ of patients suspected of bleeding from esophageal varices bleed from other sources (gastritis, ulcers). Nursing support can be effective in relieving anxiety during this often-stressful experience. Careful monitoring can detect early signs of cardiac dysrhythmias, perforation, and hemorrhage.

After the examination, fluids are not given until the gag reflex returns. Lozenges and gargles may be used to relieve throat discomfort if the patient's physical condition and mental status permit. If the patient is actively bleeding, oral intake will not be permitted and the patient will be prepared for further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

\section*{PORTAL HYPERTENSION MEASUREMENTS}

Portal hypertension may be suspected if dilated abdominal veins and hemorrhoids are detected. A palpable enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and ascites may also be present. Portal venous pressure can be measured directly or indirectly. Indirect measurement of the hepatic vein pressure gradient is the most common procedure; it requires insertion of a fluid-filled balloon catheter into the antecubital or femoral vein. The catheter is advanced under fluoroscopy to a hepatic vein. A "wedged" pressure (similar to pulmonary artery wedge pressure) is obtained by occluding the blood flow in the blood vessel; pressure in the unoccluded vessel is also measured. Although the values obtained may underestimate portal pressure, this measurement may be obtained several times to evaluate the results of therapy.

Direct measurement of portal vein pressure can be obtained by several methods. During laparotomy, a needle may be introduced into the spleen; a manometer reading of more than 20 mL saline is abnormal. Another direct measurement requires insertion of a catheter into the portal vein or one of its branches. Endoscopic measurement of pressure within varices is used only in conjunction with endoscopic sclerotherapy.

\section*{LABORATORY TESTS}

Laboratory tests may include various liver function tests, such as serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum proteins. Splenoportography, which involves serial or segmental x-rays, is used to detect extensive collateral circulation in esophageal vessels, which would indicate varices. Other tests are hepatoportography and celiac angiography. These are usually performed in the operating room or radiology department.

\section*{Medical Management}

Bleeding from esophageal varices can quickly lead to hemorrhagic shock and is an emergency. This patient is critically ill, requiring aggressive medical care and expert nursing care, and is usually transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and management. See Chapter 15 for a discussion of care of the patient in shock.

The extent of bleeding is evaluated and vital signs are monitored continuously when hematemesis and melena are present. Signs of
potential hypovolemia are noted, such as cold clammy skin, tachycardia, a drop in blood pressure, decreased urine output, restlessness, and weak peripheral pulses. Blood volume is monitored by a central venous pressure or arterial catheter. Oxygen is administered to prevent hypoxia and to maintain adequate blood oxygenation.

Because patients with bleeding esophageal varices have intravascular volume depletion and are subject to electrolyte imbalance, intravenous fluids with electrolytes and volume expanders are provided to restore fluid volume and replace electrolytes. Transfusion of blood components also may be required. An indwelling urinary catheter is usually inserted to permit frequent monitoring of urine output.

A variety of pharmacologic, endoscopic, and surgical approaches are used to treat bleeding esophageal varices, but none is ideal and most are associated with considerable risk to the patient. Nonsurgical treatment of bleeding esophageal varices is preferable because of the high mortality rate of emergency surgery for control of bleeding esophageal varices and because of the poor physical condition of the patient with severe liver dysfunction.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

In an actively bleeding patient, medications are administered initially because they can be obtained and administered quickly; other therapies take longer to initiate. Vasopressin (Pitressin) may be the initial mode of therapy because it produces constriction of the splanchnic arterial bed and a resulting decrease in portal pressure. It may be administered intravenously or by intra-arterial infusion (Menon \& Kamath, 2000). Either method requires close monitoring by the nurse. Vital signs and the presence or absence of blood in the gastric aspirate indicate the effectiveness of vasopressin. Monitoring of fluid intake and output and electrolyte levels is necessary because hyponatremia may occur and vasopressin may have an antidiuretic effect. Coronary artery disease is a contraindication to the use of vasopressin, because coronary vasoconstriction is a side effect that may precipitate myocardial infarction.

The combination of vasopressin and nitroglycerin (administered by the intravenous, sublingual, or transdermal route) has been effective in reducing or preventing the side effects (constriction of coronary vessels and angina) caused by vasopressin alone.

Somatostatin and octreotide (Sandostatin) have been reported to be more effective than vasopressin in decreasing bleeding from esophageal varices without the vasoconstrictive effects of vasopressin. These medications cause selective splanchnic vasoconstriction. Propranolol (Inderal) and nadolol (Corgard), beta-blocking agents that decrease portal pressure, have been shown to prevent bleeding from esophageal varices in some patients; however, it is recommended that they be used only in combination with other treatment modalities such as sclerotherapy, variceal banding, or balloon tamponade. Nitrates such as isosorbide (Isordil) lower portal pressure by venodilation and decreased cardiac output. Further studies of these and other medications are necessary to evaluate their use in the treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes.

\section*{BALLOON TAMPONADE}

To control hemorrhage in certain patients, balloon tamponade may be used. In this procedure, pressure is exerted on the cardia (upper orifice of the stomach) and against the bleeding varices by a double-balloon tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore tube) (Fig. 39-7). The tube has four openings, each with a specific purpose: gastric aspiration, esophageal aspiration, inflation of the gastric balloon, and inflation of the esophageal balloon.

The balloon in the stomach is inflated with 100 to 200 mL of air. An x-ray confirms proper positioning of the gastric balloon. Then the tube is pulled gently to exert a force against the gastric

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
cardia. Traction may be applied with weights or by attachment to a football helmet. Irrigation of the tubing is performed to detect bleeding; if returns are clear, the esophageal balloon is not inflated. If bleeding continues, the esophageal balloon is inflated. The desired pressure in the esophageal and gastric balloons is 25 to 40 mm Hg , as measured by the manometer. There is a possibility of injury or rupture of the esophagus with inflation of the esophageal balloon, so constant nursing surveillance is necessary.

Gastric suction is provided by connecting the gastric catheter outlet to suction. The tubing is irrigated hourly, and drainage will indicate whether bleeding has been controlled. Room-temperature lavage or irrigation may be used in the gastric balloon. The pressure within the esophageal balloon is measured and recorded every 2 to 4 hours via the manometer to detect underinflation or overinflation with potential for esophageal injury. When it appears that bleeding has stopped, the balloons are carefully and sequentially deflated. The esophageal balloon is deflated first and the patient is monitored for recurrent bleeding. After several hours without bleeding, the gastric balloon may be deflated safely. If there is still no bleeding, the tamponade tube is removed. The therapy is used for as short a time as possible to control bleeding while emergency treatment is completed and definitive therapies are instituted (no longer than 24 hours).

Although balloon tamponade has been fairly successful, there are some inherent dangers. Displacement of the tube and the inflated balloon into the oropharynx can cause life-threatening obstruction of the airway and asphyxiation. This may occur if a patient pulls on the tube because of confusion or discomfort. It may also result from rupture of the gastric balloon, allowing the esophageal balloon to move into the oropharynx. Sudden rupture of the balloon causes airway obstruction and aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs. The tube is tested before insertion to minimize this risk. Aspiration of blood and secretions into the lungs is frequently associated with balloon tamponade, especially in the stuporous or comatose patient. Endotracheal intubation before insertion of the tube protects the airway and minimizes the risk of aspiration. Ulceration and necrosis of the nose, the mucosa of the stomach, or the esophagus may occur if the tube is left in place or inflated too long or at too high a pressure.

> NURSING ALERT The patient being treated with balloon tamponade must never be left alone because of the risk for serious complications. The patient must be monitored closely and continuously. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the patient does not pull on or inadvertently displace the tube.

These potential complications necessitate intensive and expert care. A confused or restless patient with this tube in place and balloons inflated requires close monitoring to prevent its displacement. Nursing measures include frequent mouth and nasal care. For secretions that accumulate in the mouth, tissues should be within easy reach of the patient. Oral suction may be necessary to remove oral secretions. Because of the many potential complications, balloon tamponade tubes are used only as a temporary measure.

The patient with esophageal hemorrhage is usually extremely anxious and frightened. Knowing that the nurse is nearby and will respond immediately can help alleviate some of this anxiety. Tube insertion is uncomfortable and never pleasant. Explanations during the procedure and while the tube is in place may be reassuring to the patient.

Although the use of balloon tamponade stops the bleeding in $90 \%$ of patients, bleeding recurs in $60 \%$ to $70 \%$, necessitating other treatment modalities (eg, sclerotherapy or banding) (Menon \& Kamath, 2000). Once the balloons are deflated or the tube is removed, the patient must be assessed frequently because of the high risk for recurrent bleeding.

\section*{ENDOSCOPIC SCLEROTHERAPY}

In endoscopic sclerotherapy (Fig. 39-8) (also referred to as injection sclerotherapy), a sclerosing agent is injected through a fiberoptic endoscope into the bleeding esophageal varices to promote thrombosis and eventual sclerosis. The procedure has been used successfully to treat acute GI hemorrhage (Menon \& Kamath, 2000; O'Grady et al., 2000). Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy has been used in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, but the results are poorer than those of pharmacotherapy (Sarin, Lamba, Kumar et al., 1999).

After treatment, the patient must be observed for bleeding, perforation of the esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, and esophageal stricture. Antacids may be administered after the procedure to counteract the effects of peptic reflux.

\section*{ESOPHAGEAL BANDING THERAPY (VARICEAL BAND LIGATION)}

In variceal banding (Fig. 39-9), a modified endoscope loaded with an elastic rubber band is passed through an overtube directly onto the varix (or varices) to be banded. After suctioning the bleeding varix into the tip of the endoscope, the rubber band is slipped over the tissue, causing necrosis, ulceration, and eventual sloughing of the varix.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-099.jpg?height=583&width=872&top_left_y=1907&top_left_x=106}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 39-8 Endoscopic or injection sclerotherapy. Injection of sclerosing agent into esophageal varices through an endoscope promotes thrombosis and eventual sclerosis, thereby obliterating the varices.}
\end{figure}

Variceal banding is comparable to endoscopic sclerotherapy in the effective control of bleeding. Compared with sclerotherapy, variceal banding also significantly reduces rebleeding rates, mortality, procedure-related complications, and the number of sessions needed to eradicate varices. Complications include superficial ulceration and dysphagia, transient chest discomfort, and rarely esophageal strictures (Menon \& Kamath, 2000). Recently, endoscopic variceal band ligation has been shown to be safe and more effective than propanolol for preventing a first bleeding episode (Sarin et al., 1999).

\section*{TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNTING}

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is a method of treating esophageal varices in which a cannula is threaded into the portal vein by the transjugular route. An expandable stent is inserted and serves as an intrahepatic shunt between the portal circulation and the hepatic vein (Fig. 39-10), reducing portal hypertension.

Creation of a TIPS is indicated for the treatment of recurrent variceal bleeding refractory to pharmacologic or endoscopic therapy. It has also been indicated for the control of refractory ascites. This technique is also used as a bridge to liver transplantation. Complications may include bleeding, sepsis, heart failure, organ perforation, shunt thrombosis, and progressive liver failure (PomierLayrargues et al., 2001).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Several surgical procedures have been developed to treat esophageal varices and to minimize rebleeding, but they are often accompanied by significant risk. Procedures that may be used for esophageal varices are direct surgical ligation of varices; splenorenal, mesocaval, and portacaval venous shunts to relieve portal pressure; and esophageal transection with devascularization. Use of these procedures is controversial, and studies regarding their effectiveness and outcomes are ongoing (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

Surgical Bypass Procedures. Surgical decompression of the portal circulation can prevent variceal bleeding if the shunt remains patent (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000). One of the various surgical shunting procedures (Fig. 39-11) is the distal splenorenal shunt made between the splenic vein and the left renal vein after splenectomy. A mesocaval shunt is created by anastomosing the superior mesenteric vein to the proximal end of the vena cava or to the side of the vena cava using grafting material. The goal of distal splenorenal and mesocaval shunts is to drain only a portion of venous blood from the portal bed to decrease portal pressure; thus, they are considered selective shunts. The liver continues to receive some portal flow, and the incidence of encephalopathy may be reduced. Portacaval shunts divert all portal flow to the vena cava via end-to-side or side-to-side approaches, so they are considered nonselective shunts.

These procedures are extensive and are not always successful because of secondary thrombosis in the veins used for the shunt as well as complications (eg, encephalopathy, accelerated liver failure). The efficacy of these procedures has been studied extensively. The most recent studies have found that all shunts are equally effective in preventing recurrent variceal bleeding but may cause further impairment of liver function and encephalopathy. Partial portacaval shunts with interposition grafts are as effective as other shunts but are associated with a lower rate of encephalopathy (de Franchis, 2000; Krige \& Beckingham, 2001; Orozco \& Mercado, 2000). The severity of the disease (by Child's classification) and the

potential for future liver transplantation guide the physician's choice of intervention. If the cause of portal hypertension is the rare Budd-Chiari syndrome or other venous obstructive disease, a portacaval or a mesoatrial shunt may be performed (see Fig. 39-11). The mesoatrial shunt is required when the infrahepatic vena cava is thrombosed and must be bypassed.

Devascularization and Transection. Devascularization and staplegun transection procedures to separate the bleeding site from the high-pressure portal system have been used in the emergency management of variceal bleeding. The lower end of the esophagus is reached through a small gastrostomy incision; a staple gun permits anastomosis of the transected ends of the esophagus. Rebleeding is a risk, and the outcomes of these procedures vary among patient populations.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Overall nursing assessment includes monitoring the patient's physical condition and evaluating emotional responses and cognitive status. The nurse monitors and records vital signs and assesses the patient's nutritional and neurologic status. This assessment will assist in identifying hepatic encephalopathy resulting from the breakdown of blood in the GI tract and a rising serum ammonia level. Manifestations range from drowsiness to encephalopathy and coma.

Complete rest of the esophagus may be indicated with bleeding, so parenteral nutrition is initiated. Gastric suction usually is

initiated to keep the stomach as empty as possible and to prevent straining and vomiting. The patient often complains of severe thirst, which may be relieved by frequent oral hygiene and moist sponges to the lips. The nurse closely monitors the blood pressure. Vitamin K therapy and multiple blood transfusions often are indicated because of blood loss. A quiet environment and calm reassurance may help to relieve the patient's anxiety and reduce agitation.

Bleeding anywhere in the body is anxiety-provoking, resulting in a crisis for the patient and family. If the patient has been a heavy user of alcohol, delirium secondary to alcohol withdrawal can complicate the situation. The nurse provides support and explanations regarding medical and nursing interventions. Monitoring the patient closely will help in detecting and managing complications.

Management modalities and nursing care of the patient with bleeding esophageal varices are summarized in Table 39-2.

\section*{HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY AND COMA}

Hepatic encephalopathy, a life-threatening complication of liver disease, occurs with profound liver failure and may result from the accumulation of ammonia and other toxic metabolites in the blood. Hepatic coma represents the most advanced stage of hepatic encephalopathy. Some researchers describe a false or weak neurotransmitter as a cause, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood. These false neurotransmitters may be generated from an intestinal source and result in the precipitation of encephalopathy. Many other theories exist about the causes of encephalopathy, including excess tryptophan and its metabolites,

and endogenous benzodiazepines or opiates. Benzodiazepine-like chemicals (compounds) have been detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

Portal-systemic encephalopathy, the most common type of hepatic encephalopathy, occurs primarily in patients with cirrhosis with portal hypertension and portal-systemic shunting.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Ammonia accumulates because damaged liver cells fail to detoxify and convert to urea the ammonia that is constantly entering the bloodstream. Ammonia enters the bloodstream as a result of its absorption from the GI tract and its liberation from kidney and muscle cells. The increased ammonia concentration in the blood causes brain dysfunction and damage, resulting in hepatic encephalopathy.

Circumstances that increase serum ammonia levels tend to aggravate or precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. The largest source of ammonia is the enzymatic and bacterial digestion of dietary and blood proteins in the GI tract. Ammonia from these sources is increased as a result of GI bleeding (ie, bleeding esophageal varices or chronic GI bleeding), a high-protein diet, bacterial infections, and uremia. The ingestion of ammonium salts also increases the blood ammonia level. In the presence of alkalosis or hypokalemia, increased amounts of ammonia are absorbed from the GI tract and from the renal tubular fluid. Conversely, serum ammonia is decreased by elimination of protein from the diet and by the administration of antibiotic agents, such as neomycin sulfate, that reduce the number of intestinal bacteria capable of converting urea to ammonia (Dudek, 2001).

Other factors unrelated to increased serum ammonia levels that may cause hepatic encephalopathy in susceptible patients include excessive diuresis, dehydration, infections, surgery, fever, and some medications (sedative agents, tranquilizers, analgesic agents, and diuretic medications that cause potassium loss). Table 39-3 presents the stages of hepatic encephalopathy, common signs and symptoms, and potential nursing diagnoses for each stage.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The earliest symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include minor mental changes and motor disturbances. The patient appears slightly confused, has alterations in mood, becomes unkempt, and has altered sleep patterns. The patient tends to sleep during the day and have restlessness and insomnia at night. As hepatic encephalopathy progresses, the patient may be difficult to awaken.

Asterixis (flapping tremor of the hands) may occur (Fig. 39-12). Simple tasks, such as handwriting, become difficult. A handwriting or drawing sample (eg, star figure), taken daily, may provide graphic evidence of progression or reversal of hepatic encephalopathy. Inability to reproduce a simple figure (Fig. 39-13) is referred to as constructional apraxia. In the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy, the deep tendon reflexes are hyperactive; with worsening of hepatic encephalopathy, these reflexes disappear and the extremities may become flaccid.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The electroencephalogram (EEG) shows generalized slowing, an increase in the amplitude of brain waves, and characteristic triphasic waves. Occasionally, fetor hepaticus, a sweet, slightly fecal odor to the breath presumed to be of intestinal origin may be noticed. The odor has also been described as similar to that of freshly mowed grass, acetone, or old wine. Fetor hepaticus is prevalent with extensive collateral portal circulation in chronic liver disease. In a more advanced stage, there are gross disturbances of consciousness and the patient is completely disoriented with respect to time and place. With further progression of the disorder, the patient lapses into frank coma and may have seizures. Approximately $35 \%$ of all patients with cirrhosis of the liver die in hepatic coma.

\section*{Medical Management}

Lactulose (Cephulac) is administered to reduce serum ammonia levels. It acts by several mechanisms that promote the excretion of ammonia in the stool: (1) ammonia is kept in the ionized state, resulting in a fall in colon pH , reversing the normal passage of ammonia from the colon to the blood; (2) evacuation of the bowel takes place, which decreases the ammonia

absorbed from the colon; and (3) the fecal flora are changed to organisms that do not produce ammonia from urea. Two or three soft stools per day are desirable; this indicates that lactulose is performing as intended.

NURSING ALERT The patient receiving lactulose is monitored closely for the development of watery diarrheal stools, because they indicate a medication overdose.

Possible side effects include intestinal bloating and cramps, which usually disappear within a week. To mask the sweet taste,
to which some patients object, lactulose can be diluted with fruit juice. The patient is closely monitored for hypokalemia and dehydration. Other laxatives are not prescribed during lactulose administration because their effects would disturb dosage regulation. Lactulose can be administered by nasogastric tube or enema for patients who are comatose or in whom oral administration is contraindicated or impossible.

Other aspects of management include intravenous administration of glucose to minimize protein breakdown, administration of vitamins to correct deficiencies, and correction of electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium). Additional principles of management of hepatic encephalopathy include the following:
- Therapy is directed toward treating or removing the cause.
- Neurologic status is assessed frequently. A daily record is kept of handwriting and performance in arithmetic to monitor mental status.
- Fluid intake and output and body weight are recorded each day.
- Vital signs are measured and recorded every 4 hours.
- Potential sites of infection (peritoneum, lungs) are assessed frequently, and abnormal findings are reported promptly.
- Serum ammonia level is monitored daily.
- Protein intake is restricted in patients who are comatose or who have encephalopathy that is refractory to lactulose and antibiotic therapy (Chart 39-4).
- Reduction in the absorption of ammonia from the GI tract is accomplished by the use of gastric suction, enemas, or oral antibiotics.
- Electrolyte status is monitored and corrected if abnormal.
- Sedatives, tranquilizers, and analgesic medications are discontinued.
- Benzodiazepine antagonists (flumazenil [Romazicon]) may be administered to improve encephalopathy whether or not the patient has previously taken benzodiazepines.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse is responsible for maintaining a safe environment to prevent injury, bleeding, and infection. The nurse administers the prescribed treatments and monitors the patient for the many potential complications. The nurse also communicates with the pa-

\end{figure}
tient's family to keep them informed about the patient's status, and supports them by explaining the procedures and treatments that are part of the patient's care. If the patient recovers from hepatic encephalopathy and coma, rehabilitation is likely to be prolonged. Thus, the patient and family will require assistance to understand the causes of this severe complication and to recognize that it may recur.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. If the patient has recovered from hepatic encephalopathy and is to be discharged home, the nurse instructs the family to watch for subtle signs of recurrent encephalopathy. In the acute phase of hepatic encephalopathy, dietary protein may be reduced to 0.8 to $1.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day. During recovery, and in the home situation, it is important to instruct the patient in maintenance of a low-protein, high-calorie diet. Protein may then be added in 10-g increments every 3 to 5 days. Any relapse is treated by a return to the previous level. The limits of tolerance are usually 40 to $60 \mathrm{~g} /$ day $(1.0$ to $1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day). Continued use of lactulose in the home environment is not uncommon, and the patient and family should monitor its efficacy and side effects closely. Use of vegetable rather than animal protein may be indicated in patients whose total daily protein tolerance is less than $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$. Vegetable protein intake may result in improved nitrogen balance without precipitating or advancing hepatic encephalopathy (Menon \& Kamath, 2000; Seymour \& Whelan, 1999).

Continuing Care. Referral for home care is warranted for the patient who returns home after recovery from hepatic encephalopathy. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical and mental status and collaborates closely with the physician. The home visit also provides an opportunity for the nurse to assess the home environment and the ability of the patient and family to monitor signs and symptoms and to follow the treatment regimen. Home care visits are particularly important if the patient lives alone, because encephalopathy may affect the patient's ability to remember or follow the treatment regimen. The nurse reinforces previous teaching and reminds the patient and family about the importance of dietary restrictions, close monitoring, and follow-up.

\section*{OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF LIVER DYSFUNCTION}

\section*{Edema and Bleeding}

Many patients with liver dysfunction develop generalized edema from hypoalbuminemia that results from decreased hepatic production of albumin. The production of blood clotting factors by the liver is also reduced, leading to an increased incidence of bruising, epistaxis, bleeding from wounds, and, as described above, GI bleeding.

\section*{Vitamin Deficiency}

Decreased production of several clotting factors may be due, in part, to deficient absorption of vitamin K from the GI tract. This probably is caused by the inability of liver cells to use vitamin K to make prothrombin. Absorption of the other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, and E) as well as dietary fats may also be impaired because of decreased secretion of bile salts into the intestine.

Another group of problems common to patients with severe chronic liver dysfunction results from inadequate intake of sufficient vitamins. Among the specific deficiency states that occur on this basis are:
- Vitamin A deficiency, resulting in night blindness and eye and skin changes
- Thiamine deficiency, leading to beriberi, polyneuritis, and Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis
- Riboflavin deficiency, resulting in characteristic skin and mucous membrane lesions
- Pyridoxine deficiency, resulting in skin and mucous membrane lesions and neurologic changes
- Vitamin C deficiency, resulting in the hemorrhagic lesions of scurvy
- Vitamin K deficiency, resulting in hypoprothrombinemia, characterized by spontaneous bleeding and ecchymoses
- Folic acid deficiency, resulting in macrocytic anemia

The threat of these avitaminoses provides the rationale for supplementing the diet of every patient with chronic liver disease (especially if alcohol-related) with ample quantities of vitamins $A, B$ complex, $C$, and $K$ and folic acid.

\section*{Metabolic Abnormalities}

Abnormalities of glucose metabolism also occur; the blood glucose level may be abnormally high shortly after a meal (a diabetictype glucose tolerance test result), but hypoglycemia may occur during fasting because of decreased hepatic glycogen reserves and decreased gluconeogenesis. Because the ability to metabolize medications is decreased, medications must be used cautiously and usual medication dosages must be reduced for the patient with liver failure.

Many endocrine abnormalities also occur with liver dysfunction because the liver cannot metabolize hormones normally, including androgens or sex hormones. Gynecomastia, amenorrhea, testicular atrophy, loss of pubic hair in the male, and menstrual irregularities in the female and other disturbances of sexual function and sex characteristics are thought to result from failure of the damaged liver to inactivate estrogens normally.

\section*{Pruritus and Other Skin Changes}

Patients with liver dysfunction resulting from biliary obstruction commonly develop severe itching (pruritus) due to retention of bile salts. Patients may develop vascular (or arterial) spider angiomas (Fig. 39-14) on the skin, generally above the waistline. These are numerous small vessels resembling a spider's legs. These are most frequently associated with cirrhosis, especially in alcoholic liver disease. Patients may also develop reddened palms ("liver palms" or palmar erythema).

\section*{Management of Patients WithViral Hepatic Disorders}

\section*{VIRAL HEPATITIS}

Viral hepatitis is a systemic, viral infection in which necrosis and inflammation of liver cells produce a characteristic cluster of clinical, biochemical, and cellular changes. To date, five definitive

\caption{FIGURE 39-14 Spider angioma. This vascular (arterial) spider appears on the skin. Beneath the elevated center and radiating branches, the blood vessels are looped and tortuous.}
\end{figure}
types of viral hepatitis have been identified: hepatitis $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$, and E . Hepatitis A and E are similar in mode of transmission (fecal-oral route), whereas hepatitis $\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}$, and D share many characteristics. Terms associated with viral hepatitis are listed in Chart 39-5. The increasing incidence of viral hepatitis is a pub-
lic health concern. The disease is important because it is easy to transmit, has high morbidity, and causes prolonged loss of time from school or employment.

It is estimated that $60 \%$ to $90 \%$ of cases of viral hepatitis go unreported. The occurrence of subclinical cases, failure to recognize mild cases, and misdiagnosis are thought to contribute to the underreporting. Although approximately $40 \%$ of all persons in the United States have antibodies against hepatitis A virus, many cannot recall an earlier episode or the occurrence of the symptoms of hepatitis (O'Grady et al., 2000). Table 39-4 compares the major forms of viral hepatitis.

\section*{HEPATITIS A VIRUS (HAV)}

HAV accounts for $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of cases of clinical hepatitis in the developed world. Hepatitis A, formerly called infectious hepatitis, is caused by an RNA virus of the Enterovirus family. The mode of transmission of this disease is the fecal-oral route, primarily through the ingestion of food or liquids infected by the virus. The virus has been found in the stool of infected patients before the onset of symptoms and during the first few days of illness. Typically, a child or a young adult acquires the infection at school by poor hygiene, hand-to-mouth contact, or close contact at play. The virus is carried home, where haphazard sanitary habits spread it through the family. It is more prevalent in developing countries or in areas with overcrowding and poor sanitation. An infected food handler can spread the disease, and people can contract it by consuming water or shellfish from sewage-contaminated waters. Outbreaks have occurred in day care centers and institutions for the developmentally delayed because of lapses in hygiene. It is rarely, if ever, transmitted by blood transfusions. Hepatitis A can be transmitted during sexual activity; this is more likely with

oral-anal contact, anal intercourse, and a greater number of sex partners (CDC, 2002).

The incubation period is estimated to be 15 to 50 days, with an average of 30 days (O'Grady et al., 2000). The illness may be prolonged, lasting 4 to 8 weeks. It generally lasts longer and is more severe in those older than 40 years of age. Recovery is the rule; hepatitis A rarely progresses to acute liver necrosis or fulminant hepatitis, terminating in cirrhosis of the liver or death. Hepatitis A confers immunity against itself, but the person may contract other forms of hepatitis. The mortality rate of hepatitis A is approximately $0.5 \%$ for those under 40 years of age and increases to $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ for those over 40 . No carrier state exists, and no chronic hepatitis is associated with hepatitis A. The virus is present only briefly in the serum; by the time jaun-
dice occurs, the patient is likely to be noninfectious (O'Grady et al., 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many patients are anicteric (without jaundice) and symptomless. When symptoms appear, they are of a mild, flu-like upper respiratory tract infection, with low-grade fever. Anorexia, an early symptom, is often severe. It is thought to result from release of a toxin by the damaged liver or by failure of the damaged liver cells to detoxify an abnormal product. Later, jaundice and dark urine may become apparent. Indigestion is present in varying degrees, marked by vague epigastric distress, nausea, heartburn, and flatulence. The patient may also develop a strong aversion to the taste
of cigarettes or the presence of cigarette smoke and other strong odors. These symptoms tend to clear as soon as the jaundice reaches its peak, perhaps 10 days after its initial appearance. Symptoms may be mild in children; in adults, the symptoms may be more severe and the course of the disease prolonged.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The liver and spleen are often moderately enlarged for a few days after onset; otherwise, apart from jaundice, there are few physical signs. Hepatitis A antigen may be found in the stool a week to 10 days before illness and for 2 to 3 weeks after symptoms appear. HAV antibodies are detectable in the serum, but usually not until symptoms appear. Analysis of subclasses of immunoglobulins can help determine whether the antibody represents acute or past infection.

\section*{Prevention}

A number of strategies exist to prevent transmission of HAV. Patients and their families need to be made aware of these and encouraged to consider them if recommended by their primary health care provider.

In February 1995, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccine against hepatitis A for use in the United States. Effective and safe HAV vaccines include Havrix and Vagta (Koff, 2001). It is recommended that the two-dose vaccine be given to adults 18 years of age or older, with the second dose 6 to 12 months after the first. Protection against hepatitis A develops within several weeks after the first dose of the vaccine. Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age receive three doses, with the second dose 1 month after the first and the third dose 6 to 12 months later. It is estimated that protection against hepatitis A may last for at least 20 years (CDC, 1999). No country has as yet recommended universal vaccination against hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for travelers to locations where sanitation and hygiene are unsatisfactory. Vaccination is also recommended for those from other high-risk groups (homosexual men, injection/intravenous drug users, staff of day care centers, and health care personnel) (CDC, 2002). The vaccine has also been used to interrupt community-wide outbreaks. As with other vaccinations, precautions must be taken to ensure prevention, detection, and treatment of hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine.

Type A hepatitis can be prevented in those not previously vaccinated by the intramuscular administration of globulin during the incubation period, if given within 2 weeks of exposure. This bolsters the person's antibody production and provides 6 to 8 weeks of passive immunity. Immune globulin may suppress overt symptoms of the disease; the resulting subclinical case of hepatitis A would produce active immunity to subsequent episodes of the virus.

Immune globulin is also recommended for household members and sexual contacts of people with hepatitis A. Susceptible people in the same household as the patient are usually also infected by the time the diagnosis is made and should receive immune globulin. Day care center and restaurant workers with exposure to or infected with hepatitis A should also receive immune globulin to provide passive immunity (CDC, 1999). Although rare, systemic reactions to immune globulin may occur. Caution is required when anyone who has previously had angioedema, hives, or other allergic reactions is treated with any human immune globulin. Epinephrine should be available in case a systemic, anaphylactic reaction occurs.

\section*{Community Prevention of Hepatitis A}
- Proper community and home sanitation
- Conscientious individual hygiene
- Safe practices for preparing and dispensing food
- Effective health supervision of schools, dormitories, extended care facilities, barracks, and camps
- Community health education programs
- Mandatory reporting of viral hepatitis to local health departments
- Vaccination for travelers to developing countries, illegal drug users (injection and noninjection drug users), men who have sex with men, and persons with chronic liver disease
- Vaccination to interrupt community-wide outbreaks

Preexposure prophylaxis is recommended for those traveling to developing countries and settings with poor or uncertain sanitation conditions but who do not have sufficient time to acquire protection by administration of hepatitis A vaccine (CDC, 1999). Community interventions for preventing hepatitis A are outlined in Chart 39-6.

\section*{Medical Management}

Bed rest during the acute stage and a diet that is both acceptable to the patient and nutritious are part of the treatment and nursing care. During the period of anorexia, the patient should receive frequent small feedings, supplemented, if necessary, by IV fluids with glucose. Because this patient often has an aversion to food, gentle persistence and creativity may be required to stimulate the appetite. Optimal food and fluid levels are necessary to counteract weight loss and slow recovery. Even before the icteric phase, however, many patients recover their appetites (Chart 39-7).

The patient's sense of well-being as well as laboratory test results are generally appropriate guides to bed rest and restriction of physical activity. Gradual but progressive ambulation seems to hasten recovery, provided the patient rests after activity and does not participate in activities to the point of fatigue.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient is usually managed at home unless symptoms are severe. Therefore, the nurse assists the patient and family in coping with the temporary disability and fatigue that are common in hepatitis and instructs them to seek additional health care if the

\section*{Dietary Management of Viral or Drug-Related Hepatitis}
- Recommend small, frequent meals.
- Provide intake of 2,000 to $3,000 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day during acute illness.
- Although early studies indicate that a high-protein, high-calorie diet may be beneficial, advise patient not to force food and to restrict fat intake.
- Carefully monitor fluid balance.
- If anorexia and nausea and vomiting persist, enteral feedings may be necessary.
- Instruct patient to abstain from alcohol during acute illness and for 6 months after recovery.
- Advise patient to avoid substances (medication, herbs, illicit drugs, and toxins) that may affect liver function.
symptoms persist or worsen. The patient and family also need specific guidelines about diet, rest, follow-up blood work, and the importance of avoiding alcohol, as well as sanitation and hygiene measures (particularly hand washing) to prevent spread of the disease to other family members.

Specific teaching to patients and families about reducing the risk of contracting hepatitis A includes good personal hygiene, stressing careful hand washing (after bowel movements and before eating), and environmental sanitation (safe food and water supply, as well as effective sewage disposal).

> NURSING ALERT The Food and Drug Administration (CDC, 2001) has approved a combined hepatitis $A$ and $B$ vaccine (Twinrix) for vaccination of persons 18 years of age and older with indications for both hepatitis $A$ and $B$ vaccination. Vaccination consists of three doses, on the same schedule as that used for singleantigen hepatitis $B$ vaccine.

\section*{HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV)}

Unlike hepatitis A, which is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route, hepatitis B is transmitted primarily through blood (percutaneous and permucosal routes). HBV has been found in blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions and can be transmitted through mucous membranes and breaks in the skin. HBV is also transferred from carrier mothers to their babies, especially in areas with a high incidence (ie, Southeast Asia). The infection is usually not via the umbilical vein, but from the mother at the time of birth and during close contact afterward.

HBV has a long incubation period. It replicates in the liver and remains in the serum for relatively long periods, allowing transmission of the virus. Those at risk for developing hepatitis B include surgeons, clinical laboratory workers, dentists, nurses, and respiratory therapists. Staff and patients in hemodialysis and oncology units and sexually active homosexual and bisexual men and injection drug users are also at increased risk. Screening of blood donors has greatly reduced the occurrence of hepatitis B after blood transfusion.

Most people ( $>90 \%$ ) who contract hepatitis B infections will develop antibodies and recover spontaneously in 6 months. The mortality rate from hepatitis $B$ has been reported to be as high as $10 \%$. Another $10 \%$ of patients who have hepatitis B progress to a carrier state or develop chronic hepatitis with persistent HBV infection and hepatocellular injury and inflammation. It remains a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (Chart 39-8).

\section*{Risk Factors for Hepatitis B}
- Frequent exposure to blood, blood products, or other body fluids
- Health care workers: hemodialysis staff, oncology and chemotherapy nurses, personnel at risk for needlesticks, operating room staff, respiratory therapists, surgeons, dentists
- Hemodialysis
- Male homosexual and bisexual activity
- IV/injection drug use
- Close contact with carrier of HBV
- Travel to or residence in area with uncertain sanitary conditions
- Multiple sexual partners
- Recent history of sexually transmitted disease
- Receipt of blood or blood products (eg, clotting factor concentrate)

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinically, the disease closely resembles hepatitis A, but the incubation period is much longer ( 1 to 6 months). Signs and symptoms of hepatitis B may be insidious and variable. Fever and respiratory symptoms are rare; some patients have arthralgias and rashes. The patient may have loss of appetite, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, generalized aching, malaise, and weakness. Jaundice may or may not be evident. If jaundice occurs, light-colored stools and dark urine accompany it. The liver may be tender and enlarged to 12 to 14 cm vertically. The spleen is enlarged and palpable in a few patients; the posterior cervical lymph nodes may also be enlarged. Subclinical episodes also occur frequently.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

HBV is a DNA virus composed of the following antigenic particles:
- HBcAg-hepatitis B core antigen (antigenic material in an inner core)
- HBsAg-hepatitis B surface antigen (antigenic material on surface of HBV)
- HBeAg-an independent protein circulating in the blood
- HBxAg-gene product of X gene of HBV/DNA

Each antigen elicits its specific antibody and is a marker for different stages of the disease process:
- anti-HBc-antibody to core antigen or HBV; persists during the acute phase of illness; may indicate continuing HBV in the liver
- anti-HBs-antibody to surface determinants on HBV; detected during late convalescence; usually indicates recovery and development of immunity
- anti-HBe-antibody to hepatitis B e-antigen; usually signifies reduced infectivity
- anti-HBxAg-antibody to the hepatitis B x-antigen; may indicate ongoing replication of HBV

HBsAg appears in the circulation in $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of infected patients 1 to 10 weeks after exposure to HBV and 2 to 8 weeks before the onset of symptoms or an increase in transferase (transaminase) levels. Patients with HBsAg that persists for 6 or more months after acute infection are considered HBsAg carriers (Befeler \& Di Bisceglie, 2000). HBeAg is the next antigen of HBV to appear in the serum. It usually appears within a week of the appearance of HBsAg and before changes in aminotransferase levels, disappearing from the serum within 2 weeks. HBV DNA, detected by polymerase chain reaction testing, appears in the serum at about the same time as HBeAg . HBcAg is not always detected in the serum in HBV infection.

About $15 \%$ of American adults are positive for anti-HBs, which indicates that they have had hepatitis B. Anti-HBs may be positive in as many as two thirds of IV/injection drug users.

\section*{Prevention}

The goals of prevention are to interrupt the chain of transmission, to protect people at high risk with active immunization through the use of hepatitis B vaccine, and to use passive immunization for unprotected people exposed to HBV.

\section*{PREVENTING TRANSMISSION}

Continued screening of blood donors for the presence of hepatitis $B$ antigens will further decrease the risk of transmission by
blood transfusion. The use of disposable syringes, needles, and lancets and the introduction of needleless IV administration systems reduce the risk of spreading this infection from one patient to another or to health care personnel during the collection of blood samples or the administration of parenteral therapy. Good personal hygiene is fundamental to infection control. In the clinical laboratory, work areas should be disinfected daily. Gloves are worn when handling all blood and body fluids as well as HBAg positive specimens, or when there is potential exposure to blood (blood drawing) or to patients' secretions. Eating and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory and in other areas exposed to secretions, blood, or blood products. Patient education regarding the nature of the disease, its infectiousness, and prognosis is a critical factor in preventing transmission and protecting contacts.

\section*{ACTIVE IMMUNIZATION: HEPATITIS B VACCINE}

Active immunization is recommended for individuals at high risk for hepatitis B (eg, health care personnel and hemodialysis patients). In addition, individuals with hepatitis C and other chronic liver diseases should receive the vaccine (CDC, 1999). A yeast-recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax HB) is used to provide active immunity. Long-term studies of healthy adults and children indicate that immunologic memory remains intact for at least 5 to 10 years, although antibody levels may become low or undetectable. Measurable levels of antibodies may not be essential for protection. In those with normal immune systems, booster doses are not generally required. The CDC (2002) does not recommend booster doses at this time except for hemodialysis patients. The need for booster doses may be revisited if reports of hepatitis $B$ increase or an increased prevalence of the carrier state develops, indicating that protection is declining.

A hepatitis B vaccine prepared from plasma of humans chronically infected with HBV is used only rarely and in patients who are immunodeficient or allergic to recombinant yeast-derived vaccines.

Both forms of the hepatitis B vaccine are administered intramuscularly in three doses, the second and third doses 1 and 6 months after the first dose. The third dose is very important in producing prolonged immunity. Hepatitis B vaccination should be administered to adults in the deltoid muscle. Antibody response may be measured by anti-HBs levels 1 to 3 months after completing the basic course of vaccine, but this testing is not routine and not currently recommended. Individuals who fail to respond may benefit from one to three additional doses (Koff, 2001).

People at high risk, including nurses and other health care personnel exposed to blood or blood products, should receive active immunization. Health care workers who have had frequent contact with blood are screened for anti-HBs to determine whether immunity is already present from previous exposure. The vaccine produces active immunity to HBV in $90 \%$ of healthy people (Koff, 2001). It does not provide protection to those already exposed to HBV and provides no protection against other types of viral hepatitis. Side effects of immunization are infrequent; soreness and redness at the injection site are the most common complaints.

Because hepatitis B infection is frequently transmitted sexually, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated persons being evaluated for a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It is also recommended for those with a history of an STD, persons with multiple sex partners, those who have sex with injection drug users, and sexually active men who have sex with other men (CDC, 2002).

Universal childhood vaccination for hepatitis B prevention has been instituted in the United States. Vaccination was initially targeted for select high-risk populations, but the U.S. Public

Health Service and the CDC (1999) have endorsed universal vaccination of all infants. Catch-up vaccination is also recommended for all children and adolescents up to the age of 19 who were not previously immunized. Studies (Chang, 2000; Wu et al., 1999) show that universal vaccination of all newborns in endemic areas has dramatically reduced the carrier rate among children and the incidence of childhood hepatocellular carcinoma. In the United States, studies regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine are ongoing, but it is known that clinical infection is rarely observed during long-term follow-up of known responders (ie, health care workers) who seroconverted within 3 months of the third dose of vaccine (Bircher et al., 1999). Development of chronic carrier states has not been reported in adult responders to the vaccine.

\section*{PASSIVE IMMUNITY: HEPATITIS B IMMUNE GLOBULIN}

Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) provides passive immunity to hepatitis B and is indicated for people exposed to HBV who have never had hepatitis $B$ and have never received hepatitis $B$ vaccine. Specific indications for postexposure vaccine with HBIG include: (1) inadvertent exposure to HBAg -positive blood through percutaneous (needlestick) or transmucosal (splashes in contact with mucous membrane) routes, (2) sexual contact with people positive for HBAg, and (3) perinatal exposure (babies born to HBV-infected mothers should receive HBIG within 12 hours of delivery). HBIG, which provides passive immunity, is prepared from plasma selected for high titers of anti-HBs. Prompt immunization with HBIG (within hours to a few days after exposure to hepatitis B ) increases the likelihood of protection. Both active and passive immunization are recommended for people exposed to hepatitis B through sexual contact or through percutaneous or transmucosal routes. If HBIG and hepatitis $B$ vaccine are administered at the same time, separate sites and separate syringes should be used. Prophylaxis with high doses of HBIG started at the time of liver transplantation and continued indefinitely improves survival by thwarting recurrence of hepatitis B (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000). There has been no evidence that HIV infection can be transmitted by HBIG.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The elderly patient who contracts hepatitis B has a serious risk of severe liver cell necrosis or fulminant hepatic failure, particularly if other illnesses are present. The patient is seriously ill and the prognosis is poor, so efforts should be undertaken to eliminate other factors (eg, medications, alcohol) that may affect liver function.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of treatment are to minimize infectivity, normalize liver inflammation, and decrease symptoms. Of all the agents that have been used to treat chronic type B viral hepatitis, alpha interferon as the single modality of therapy offers the most promise. This regimen of 5 million units daily or 10 million units three times weekly for 4 to 6 months results in remission of disease in approximately one third of patients (Befeler \& Di Bisceglie, 2000). The long-term benefits of this treatment are being assessed. Interferon must be administered by injection and has significant side effects, including fever, chills, anorexia, nausea, myalgias, and fatigue. Late side effects are more serious and may necessitate dosage reduction or discontinuation. These include bone marrow suppression, thyroid dysfunction, alopecia, and bacterial infections.

Two antiviral agents (lamivudine [Epvir] and adefovir [Hepsera]) oral nucleoside analogs, have been approved for use in
chronic hepatitis B in the United States. Viral resistance may be an issue with these agents, and studies of their effectiveness alone and in combination with other therapies are ongoing (Befeler \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

Bed rest may be recommended, regardless of other treatment, until the symptoms of hepatitis have subsided. Activities are restricted until the hepatic enlargement and elevated levels of serum bilirubin and liver enzymes have disappeared. Gradually increased activity is then allowed.

Adequate nutrition should be maintained; proteins are restricted when the liver's ability to metabolize protein byproducts is impaired, as demonstrated by symptoms. Measures to control the dyspeptic symptoms and general malaise include the use of antacids and antiemetics, but all medications should be avoided if vomiting occurs. If vomiting persists, the patient may require hospitalization and fluid therapy. Because of the mode of transmission, the patient is evaluated for other bloodborne diseases (eg, HIV infection).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Convalescence may be prolonged, with complete symptomatic recovery sometimes requiring 3 to 4 months or longer. During this stage, gradual resumption of physical activity is encouraged after the jaundice has resolved.

The nurse identifies psychosocial issues and concerns, particularly the effects of separation from family and friends if the patient is hospitalized during the acute and infective stages. Even if not hospitalized, the patient will be unable to work and must avoid sexual contact. Planning is required to minimize alterations in sensory perception. Planning that includes the family helps to decrease their fears and anxieties about the spread of the disease.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Because of the prolonged period of convalescence, the patient and family must be prepared for home care. Provision for adequate rest and nutrition must be ensured. The nurse informs family members and friends who have had intimate contact with the patient about the risks of contracting hepatitis $B$ and makes arrangements for them to receive hepatitis $B$ vaccine or hepatitis $B$ immune globulin as prescribed. Those at risk must be aware of the early signs of hepatitis $B$ and of ways to reduce risk to themselves by avoiding all modes of transmission. Patients with all forms of hepatitis should avoid drinking alcohol.

Continuing Care. Follow-up visits by a home care nurse may be needed to assess the patient's progress and answer family members' questions about disease transmission. A home visit also permits assessment of the patient's physical and psychological status and the patient and family's understanding of the importance of adequate rest and nutrition. The nurse also reinforces previous instructions. Because of the risk of transmission through sexual intercourse, strategies to prevent exchange of body fluids are advised, such as abstinence or the use of condoms. The nurse emphasizes the importance of keeping follow-up appointments and participating in other health promotion activities and recommended health screenings.

\section*{HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV)}

A significant proportion of cases of viral hepatitis are neither hepatitis $A$, hepatitis $B$, nor hepatitis $D$; as a result, they are classified as hepatitis C (formerly referred to as non- A , non- B hepatitis, or

NANB hepatitis). Whereas blood transfusions and sexual contact once accounted for most cases of hepatitis C in the United States, other parenteral means, such as sharing contaminated needles by IV/injection drug users and unintentional needlesticks and other injuries in health care workers, now account for a significant number of cases. There are approximately 35,000 new cases of hepatitis C in the United States each year. About 4 million persons ( $1.8 \%$ of the U.S. population) have been infected with HCV, making it the most common chronic blood-borne infection nationally. A fourfold increase in the number of adults diagnosed with HCV is projected from 1990 to 2015 . The highest prevalence of hepatitis C is in adults 40 to 59 years of age, and in this age group its prevalance is highest in African Americans. There are 10,000 to 12,000 deaths each year in the United States due to hepatitis C; it has been suggested that these are underestimates. HCV is the underlying cause of about one-third of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, and it is the most common reason for liver transplantation (NIH Consensus Conference, 2002).

Individuals at special risk for hepatitis C include IV/injection drug users, sexually active people with multiple partners, patients receiving frequent transfusions or those who require large volumes of blood, and health care personnel. The incubation period is variable and may range from 15 to 160 days. The clinical course of acute hepatitis C is similar to that of hepatitis B ; symptoms are usually mild. A chronic carrier state occurs frequently, however, and there is an increased risk of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or liver cancer, after hepatitis C. Small amounts of alcohol taken regularly appear to encourage progression of the disease. Therefore, alcohol and medications that may affect the liver should be avoided (Chart 39-9).

There is no benefit from rest, diet, or vitamin supplements. Recent studies have demonstrated that a combination of interferon (Intron-A) and ribavirin (Rebetol), two antiviral agents, is effective in producing improvement in patients with hepatitis C and in treating relapses. Some patients experience complete remission with combination therapy, which is the treatment of choice according to the FDA (Cheney, Chopra \& Graham, 2000). Hemolytic anemia, the most frequent side effect, may be severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. Ribavirin must be used with caution in women of childbearing age. A molecule (polyethylene glycol moiety [PEG]) added to the interferon keeps it in the body longer without reducing its efficacy and extends the dosing interval to once a week. Pegylated interferon (Pegasys) is now available (Lauer \& Walker, 2001; Sheffield et al., 2001).

Screening of blood has reduced the incidence of hepatitis associated with blood transfusions, and public health programs are helping to reduce the number of cases associated with shared needles in illicit drug use.

\section*{Risk Factors for Hepatitis C}
- Recipient of blood products or organ transplant prior to 1992 or clotting factor concentrates before 1987
- Health care and public safety workers after needlestick injuries or mucosal exposure to blood
- Children born to women infected with hepatitis C virus
- Past/current illicit IV/injection drug use
- Past treatment with chronic hemodialysis
- Sex with infected partner, having multiple sex partners, history of STD, unprotected sex

\section*{HEPATITIS D VIRUS (HDV)}

Hepatitis D (delta agent) occurs in some cases of hepatitis B. Because the virus requires hepatitis $B$ surface antigen for its replication, only individuals with hepatitis $B$ are at risk for hepatitis $D$. Anti-delta antibodies in the presence of HBAg on testing confirm the diagnosis. It is also common among IV/injection drug users, hemodialysis patients, and recipients of multiple blood transfusions. Sexual contact with those with hepatitis B is considered to be an important mode of transmission of hepatitis B and D . The incubation period varies between 21 and 140 days (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

The symptoms of hepatitis D are similar to those of hepatitis B , except that patients are more likely to develop fulminant hepatitis and to progress to chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. Treatment is similar to that of other forms of hepatitis; interferon as a specific treatment for hepatitis D is under investigation.

\section*{HEPATITIS E VIRUS (HEV)}

Hepatitis E is believed to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route, principally through contaminated water in areas with poor sanitation. The incubation period is variable, estimated to range between 15 and 65 days. In general, hepatitis E resembles hepatitis A . It has a self-limiting course with an abrupt onset. Jaundice is nearly always present. Chronic forms do not develop.

Avoiding contact with the virus through good hygiene, including hand washing, is the major method of prevention of hepatitis E. The effectiveness of immune globulin in protecting against hepatitis E virus is uncertain.

\section*{HEPATITIS G (HGV) AND GB VIRUS-C}

It has long been believed that there is another non-A, non-B, nonC agent causing hepatitis in humans. The incubation period for post-transfusion hepatitis is 14 to 145 days, too long for hepatitis B or C. In the United States, about 5\% of chronic liver disease remains cryptogenic (does not appear to be autoimmune or viral in origin), and half the patients have previously received transfusions. Thus, a new form of hepatitis (hepatitis G or GBV-C) has been described. They are two different isolates of the same virus. Autoantibodies are absent.

The clinical significance of this virus remains uncertain. Risk factors are similar to those for hepatitis C . There is no clear relationship between GBV-C/HGV infection and progressive liver disease. Persistent infection does occur but does not affect the clinical course.

\section*{Management of Patients With Nonviral Hepatic Disorders}

Certain chemicals have toxic effects on the liver and when taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected parenterally produce acute liver cell necrosis, or toxic hepatitis. The chemicals most commonly implicated in this disease are carbon tetrachloride, phosphorus, chloroform, and gold compounds. These substances are true hepatotoxins. Many medications may induce hepatitis but are sensitizing rather than toxic. The result, drug-induced hepatitis, is similar to acute viral hepatitis, but parenchymal destruction tends to be more extensive. Some medications that can lead to hepatitis are isoniazid, halothane, acetaminophen, and certain antibiotics, antimetabolites, and anesthetic agents.

\section*{TOXIC HEPATITIS}

Toxic hepatitis resembles viral hepatitis in onset. Obtaining a history of exposure to hepatotoxic chemicals, medications, or other agents assists in early treatment and removal of the offending agent. Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are the usual symptoms; jaundice and hepatomegaly are noted on physical assessment. Symptoms are more intense for the more severely toxic patient.

Recovery from acute toxic hepatitis is rapid if the hepatotoxin is identified early and removed or if exposure to the agent has been limited. Recovery is unlikely if there is a prolonged period between exposure and onset of symptoms. There are no effective antidotes. The fever rises; the patient becomes toxic and prostrated. Vomiting may be persistent, with the emesis containing blood. Clotting abnormalities may be severe, and hemorrhages may appear under the skin. The severe GI symptoms may lead to vascular collapse. Delirium, coma, and seizures develop, and within a few days the patient may die of fulminant hepatic failure (discussed below) unless he or she receives a liver transplant.

Short of liver transplantation, few treatment options are available. Therapy is directed toward restoring and maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, blood replacement, and comfort and supportive measures. A few patients recover from acute toxic hepatitis only to develop chronic liver disease. If the liver heals, there may be scarring, followed by postnecrotic cirrhosis.

\section*{DRUG-INDUCED HEPATITIS}

Drug-induced hepatitis is responsible for 20\% to 25\% of cases of acute hepatic failure in the United States (Maddrey, Schiff \& Sorrell, 2001). Manifestations of sensitivity to a medication may occur on the first day of its use or not until several months later, depending on the medication. Usually the onset is abrupt, with chills, fever, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, anorexia, and nausea. Later, there may be jaundice and dark urine and an enlarged and tender liver. When the offending medication is withdrawn, symptoms may gradually subside. However, reactions may be severe and even fatal, even though the medication is stopped. If fever, rash, or pruritus occurs from any medication, its use should be stopped immediately.

Although any medication can affect liver function, use of acetaminophen (found in many over-the counter medications used to treat fever and pain) has been identified as the leading cause of acute liver failure (Ostapowicz, Fontana, Schiodt, et al., 2002). Others commonly associated with liver injury include but are not limited to anesthetic agents, medications used to treat rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease, antidepressants, psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, and anti-tuberculosis agents.

Inhalational agents of the halothane family (halokanes) are metabolized by the liver and excreted in bile. These volatile anesthetics may also decrease hepatic blood flow. Halothane hepatitis is a dreaded but rare complication of halothane administration. Sevoflurane and desflurane may have less hepatotoxic effects than halokanes. Nitrous oxide, an adjunct to halokanes, is not hepatotoxic. Because it undergoes little hepatic metabolism, isoflurane is considered the anesthetic agent of choice in patients with liver disease (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

Although its efficacy is uncertain, a short course of high-dose corticosteroids may be used in patients with severe hypersensitivity. Liver transplantation is an option for drug-induced hepatitis, but outcomes may not be as successful as with other causes of liver failure.

\section*{FULMINANT HEPATIC FAILURE}

Fulminant hepatic failure is the clinical syndrome of sudden and severely impaired liver function in a previously healthy person. According to the original and generally accepted definition, fulminant hepatic failure develops within 8 weeks of the first symptoms of jaundice (Maddrey et al., 2001). Patterns of the progression from jaundice to encephalopathy have been identified and have led to proposals of time-based classifications, but no agreement as to these classifications has been reached. However, three categories are frequently cited: hyperacute, acute, and subacute liver failure. In hyperacute liver failure, the duration of jaundice before the onset of encephalopathy is 0 to 7 days; in acute liver failure, it is 8 to 28 days; and in subacute liver failure, it is 28 to 72 days. The prognosis for fulminant hepatic failure is much worse than for chronic liver failure. However, in fulminant failure, the hepatic lesion is potentially reversible, with survival rates of approximately $50 \%$ to $85 \%$ (survival rates depend greatly on the etiology of liver failure). Those who do not survive die of massive hepatocellular injury and necrosis (Maddrey et al., 2001).

Viral hepatitis is a common cause of fulminant hepatic failure; other causes include toxic medications (eg, acetaminophen) and chemicals (eg, carbon tetrachloride), metabolic disturbances (Wilson's disease, a hereditary syndrome with deposition of copper in the liver), and structural changes (Budd-Chiari syndrome, an obstruction to outflow in major hepatic veins).

Jaundice and profound anorexia may be the initial reasons the patient seeks health care. Fulminant hepatic failure is often accompanied by coagulation defects, renal failure and electrolyte disturbances, infection, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy, and cerebral edema.

\section*{Management}

The key to optimizing treatment is rapid recognition of acute liver failure and intensive interventions. Treatment modalities may include plasma exchanges (plasmapheresis) or charcoal hemoperfusion for the removal (theoretically) of potentially harmful metabolites (Kaptanoglu \& Blei, 2000); however, more clinical trials are needed to determine their effects or outcomes. Hepatocytes within synthetic fiber columns have been tested as liver support systems (liver assist devices) and a bridge to transplantation.

Research into interventions for acute liver failure has begun to focus on techniques that combine the efficacy of a whole liver with the convenience and biocompatibility of hemodialysis. The acronyms ELAD (extracorporeal liver assist devices) and BAL (bioartificial liver) have been used to describe these hybrid devices. These temporary devices help patients to survive until transplantation is possible. The BAL exposes separated plasma to a cartridge containing porcine liver cells after the plasma has flowed through a charcoal column that removes substances toxic to hepatocytes. The ELAD device exposes whole blood to cartridges containing human hepatoblastoma cells, resulting in removal of toxic substances. Similar extracorporeal circuits using xenografts will likely be studied in the near future (Maddrey et al., 2001). Although these approaches appear promising, controlled studies are required.

There is a high risk for cerebral edema, a life-threatening complication, in patients with fulminant liver failure with stage 4 encephalopathy. The cause is not fully understood, although disruption of the blood-brain barrier and plasma leaking into the cerebrospinal fluid has been proposed as one theory (Sherlock \& Dooley, 2002). These patients require intracranial pressure monitoring. Measures to promote adequate cerebral perfusion include
careful fluid balance and hemodynamic assessments, a quiet environment, and diuresis with mannitol, an osmotic diuretic.

To prevent surges in intracranial pressure related to agitation, barbiturate anesthesia or pharmacologic paralysis and sedation are indicated. Other support measures include monitoring for and treating hypoglycemia, coagulopathies, and infection. Despite these treatment modalities, the mortality rate remains high. Consequently, liver transplantation (discussed later in this chapter) has become the treatment of choice for fulminant hepatic failure.

\section*{HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS}

Cirrhosis is a chronic disease characterized by replacement of normal liver tissue with diffuse fibrosis that disrupts the structure and function of the liver. There are three types of cirrhosis or scarring of the liver:
- Alcoholic cirrhosis, in which the scar tissue characteristically surrounds the portal areas. This is most frequently due to chronic alcoholism and is the most common type of cirrhosis.
- Postnecrotic cirrhosis, in which there are broad bands of scar tissue as a late result of a previous bout of acute viral hepatitis.
- Biliary cirrhosis, in which scarring occurs in the liver around the bile ducts. This type usually is the result of chronic biliary obstruction and infection (cholangitis); it is much less common than the other two types.

The portion of the liver chiefly involved in cirrhosis consists of the portal and the periportal spaces, where the bile canaliculi of each lobule communicate to form the liver bile ducts. These areas become the sites of inflammation, and the bile ducts become occluded with inspissated (thickened) bile and pus. The liver attempts to form new bile channels; hence, there is an overgrowth of tissue made up largely of disconnected, newly formed bile ducts and surrounded by scar tissue.

Clinical manifestations include intermittent jaundice and fever. Initially the liver is enlarged, hard, and irregular, but eventually it atrophies.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Although several factors have been implicated in the etiology of cirrhosis, alcohol consumption is considered the major causative factor. Cirrhosis occurs with greatest frequency among alcoholics. Although nutritional deficiency with reduced protein intake contributes to liver destruction in cirrhosis, excessive alcohol intake is the major causative factor in fatty liver and its consequences. Cirrhosis, however, has also occurred in people who do not consume alcohol and in those who consume a normal diet and have a high alcohol intake.

Some people appear to be more susceptible than others to this disease, whether or not they are alcoholics or malnourished. Other factors may play a role, including exposure to certain chemicals (carbon tetrachloride, chlorinated naphthalene, arsenic, or phosphorus) or infectious schistosomiasis. Twice as many men as women are affected, although women are at greater risk of developing alcohol-induced liver disease for an as yet undiscovered reason. Most patients are between 40 and 60 years of age. Each year more than 25,000 people die of chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis in the United States (NIDDK, 2000).

Alcoholic cirrhosis is characterized by episodes of necrosis involving the liver cells, sometimes occurring repeatedly throughout
the course of the disease. The destroyed liver cells are replaced gradually by scar tissue; eventually the amount of scar tissue exceeds that of the functioning liver tissue. Islands of residual normal tissue and regenerating liver tissue may project from the constricted areas, giving the cirrhotic liver its characteristic hobnail appearance. The disease usually has an insidious onset and a protracted course, occasionally proceeding over a period of 30 or more years.

The prognosis of different forms of cirrhosis caused by various liver diseases has been investigated in several studies. Of the many prognostic indicators, the Child's classification seems most useful in predicting the outcome of patients with liver disease (Table 39-5). It is also used in choosing management approaches.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Signs and symptoms of cirrhosis increase in severity as the disease progresses. The severity of the manifestations helps to categorize the disorder into two main presentations (Chart 39-10).

Compensated cirrhosis, with its less severe, often vague symptoms, may be discovered secondarily at a routine physical examination. The hallmarks of decompensated cirrhosis result from failure of the liver to synthesize proteins, clotting factors, and other substances and manifestations of portal hypertension (see the "Hepatic Dysfunction" section of this chapter for clinical manifestations and management of portal hypertension, ascites, varices, and hepatic encephalopathy).

\section*{LIVER ENLARGEMENT}

Early in the course of cirrhosis, the liver tends to be large and its cells loaded with fat. The liver is firm and has a sharp edge noticeable on palpation. Abdominal pain may be present because of recent, rapid enlargement of the liver, producing tension on the fibrous covering of the liver (Glisson's capsule). Later in the disease, the liver decreases in size as scar tissue contracts the liver tissue. The liver edge, if palpable, is nodular.

\section*{PORTAL OBSTRUCTION AND ASCITES}

These late manifestations are due partly to chronic failure of liver function and partly to obstruction of the portal circulation. Practically all the blood from the digestive organs is collected in the portal veins and carried to the liver. Because a cirrhotic liver does not allow the blood free passage, it backs up into the spleen and the GI tract and these organs become the seat of chronic passive congestion; that is, they are stagnant with blood and thus cannot function properly. Indigestion and altered bowel function result. Fluid rich in protein may accumulate in the peritoneal cavity, producing ascites. This can be demonstrated through percussion for shifting dullness or a fluid wave (see Fig. 39-5).

\section*{Chart 39-10 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Clinical Manifestations of Cirrhosis}

\section*{Compensated}

Intermittent mild fever
Vascular spiders
Palmar erythema (reddened palms)
Unexplained epistaxis
Ankle edema
Vague morning indigestion
Flatulent dyspepsia
Abdominal pain
Firm, enlarged liver
Splenomegaly

Weight loss
Continuous mild fever
Clubbing of fingers
Purpura (due to decreased platelet count)

\section*{INFECTION AND PERITONITIS}

Bacterial peritonitis may develop in cirrhotic patients with ascites in the absence of an intra-abdominal source of infection or an abscess. This condition is referred to as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Bacteremia is believed to be the most likely route of infection. Clinical signs may be absent; paracentesis may be necessary for diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy is effective in the treatment and prevention of recurrent episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

\section*{GASTROINTESTINAL VARICES}

The obstruction to blood flow through the liver resulting from the fibrotic changes also results in the formation of collateral blood vessels in the GI system and shunting of blood from the portal vessels into blood vessels with lower pressures. As a result, the patient with cirrhosis often has prominent, distended abdominal blood vessels, which are visible on abdominal inspection (caput medusae), and
distended blood vessels throughout the GI tract. The esophagus, stomach, and lower rectum are common sites of collateral blood vessels. These distended blood vessels form varices or hemorrhoids, depending on their location (see Fig. 39-6).

Because these vessels were not intended to carry the high pressure and volume of blood imposed by cirrhosis, they may rupture and bleed. Therefore, assessment must include observation for occult and frank bleeding from the GI tract. Approximately $25 \%$ of patients develop minor hematemesis; others have profuse hemorrhage from gastric and esophageal varices (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

\section*{EDEMA}

Another late symptom of cirrhosis is edema, which is attributed to chronic liver failure. A reduced plasma albumin concentration predisposes the patient to the formation of edema. Edema is generalized but often affects lower extremities, upper extremities, and the presacral area. Facial edema is not typical. Overproduction of aldosterone occurs, causing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion.

\section*{VITAMIN DEFICIENCY AND ANEMIA}

Because of inadequate formation, use, and storage of certain vitamins (notably vitamins $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and K ), signs of their deficiency are common, particularly hemorrhagic phenomena associated with vitamin K deficiency. Chronic gastritis and impaired GI function, together with inadequate dietary intake and impaired liver function, account for the anemia often associated with cirrhosis. The anemia and the patient's poor nutritional status and poor state of health result in severe fatigue, which interferes with the ability to carry out routine daily activities.

\section*{MENTAL DETERIORATION}

Additional clinical manifestations include deterioration of mental function with impending hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic coma. Neurologic assessment is indicated and includes the patient's general behavior, cognitive abilities, orientation to time and place, and speech patterns.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The extent of liver disease and the type of treatment are determined after reviewing the laboratory findings. Because the functions of the liver are complex, there are many diagnostic tests that may provide information about liver function (see Table 39-1). The patient needs to know why these tests are being performed and ways to cooperate.

In severe parenchymal liver dysfunction, the serum albumin level tends to decrease and the serum globulin level rises. Enzyme tests indicate liver cell damage: serum alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, and GGT levels increase, and the serum cholinesterase level may decrease. Bilirubin tests are performed to measure bile excretion or bile retention; elevated levels can occur with cirrhosis and other liver disorders. Prothrombin time is prolonged.

Ultrasound scanning is used to measure the difference in density of parenchymal cells and scar tissue. CT, MRI, and radioisotope liver scans give information about liver size and hepatic blood flow and obstruction. Diagnosis is confirmed by liver biopsy. Arterial blood gas analysis may reveal a ventilationperfusion imbalance and hypoxia.

\section*{Medical Management}

The management of the patient with cirrhosis is usually based on the presenting symptoms. For example, antacids are prescribed to decrease gastric distress and minimize the possibility of GI bleeding. Vitamins and nutritional supplements promote healing of damaged liver cells and improve the general nutritional status. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone [Aldactone], triamterene [Dyrenium]) may be indicated to decrease ascites, if present; these diuretics are preferable to other diuretic agents because they minimize the fluid and electrolyte changes common with other agents. An adequate diet and avoidance of alcohol are essential. Although the fibrosis of the cirrhotic liver cannot be reversed, its progression may be halted or slowed by such measures.

Preliminary studies indicate that colchicine, an antiinflammatory agent used to treat the symptoms of gout, may increase the length of survival in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis. Improved survival has been observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Colchicine is believed to reverse the fibrotic processes in cirrhosis, and this has improved survival (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS}

\section*{Assessment}

Nursing assessment focuses on the onset of symptoms and the history of precipitating factors, particularly long-term alcohol abuse, as well as dietary intake and changes in the patient's physical and mental status. The patient's past and current patterns of alcohol use (duration and amount) are assessed and documented. It is also important to document any exposure to toxic agents encountered in the workplace or during recreational activities. The nurse documents and reports exposure to potentially hepatotoxic substances (medications, illicit IV/injection drugs, inhalants) or general anesthetic agents.

The nurse assesses the patient's mental status through the interview and other interactions with the patient; orientation to person, place, and time is noted. The patient's ability to carry out a job or household activities provides some information about physical and mental status. The patient's relationships with family, friends, and coworkers may give some indication about incapacitation secondary to alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Abdominal distention and bloating, GI bleeding, bruising, and weight changes are noted.

The nurse assesses nutritional status, which is of major importance in cirrhosis, by daily weights and monitoring of plasma proteins, transferrin, and creatinine levels.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Activity intolerance related to fatigue, general debility, muscle wasting, and discomfort
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to chronic gastritis, decreased GI motility, and anorexia
- Impaired skin integrity related to compromised immunologic status, edema, and poor nutrition
- Risk for injury and bleeding related to altered clotting mechanisms

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Bleeding and hemorrhage
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Fluid volume excess

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may include increased participation in activities, improvement of nutritional status, improvement of skin integrity, decreased potential for injury, improvement of mental status, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING REST}

The patient with active liver disease requires rest and other supportive measures to permit the liver to reestablish its functional ability. If the patient is hospitalized, weight and fluid intake and output are measured and recorded daily. The nurse adjusts the patient's position in bed for maximal respiratory efficiency, which is especially important if ascites is marked because it interferes with adequate thoracic excursion. Oxygen therapy may be required in liver failure to oxygenate the damaged cells and prevent further cell destruction.

Rest reduces the demands on the liver and increases the liver's blood supply. Because the patient is susceptible to the hazards of immobility, efforts to prevent respiratory, circulatory, and vascular disturbances are initiated. These measures may help prevent such problems as pneumonia, thrombophlebitis, and pressure ulcers. When nutritional status improves and strength increases, the nurse encourages the patient to increase activity gradually. Activity and mild exercise, as well as rest, are planned.

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

The patient with cirrhosis who has no ascites or edema and exhibits no signs of impending hepatic coma should receive a nutritious, high-protein diet if tolerated, supplemented by vitamins of the B complex and others as indicated (including vitamins A, C, K and folic acid). Because proper nutrition is so important, the nurse makes every effort to encourage the patient to eat. This is as important as any medication. Often small, frequent meals are tolerated better than three large meals because of the abdominal pressure exerted by ascites. Protein supplements may also be indicated.

Patient preferences are considered. Patients with prolonged or severe anorexia, or those who are vomiting or eating poorly for any reason, may receive nutrients enterally or parenteral nutrition.

Patients with fatty stools (steatorrhea) should receive watersoluble forms of fat-soluble vitamins-A, D, and E (Aquasol A, D, and E ). Folic acid and iron are prescribed to prevent anemia. If the patient shows signs of impending or advancing coma, the amount of protein in the diet is decreased temporarily. In the absence of hepatic encephalopathy, a moderate-protein, high-calorie intake is provided, with protein foods of high biologic value. A diet containing 1 to 1.5 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is required unless the patient is malnourished. Protein is restricted
if encephalopathy develops. Incorporating vegetable protein to meet protein needs may decrease the risk of encephalopathy. Sodium restriction is also indicated to prevent ascites.

A high-calorie intake should be maintained, and supplemental vitamins and minerals should be provided (eg, oral potassium if the serum potassium level is normal or low and if renal function is normal).

\section*{PROVIDING SKIN CARE}

Providing careful skin care is important because of subcutaneous edema, the patient's immobility, jaundice, and increased susceptibility to skin breakdown and infection. Frequent position changes are necessary to prevent pressure ulcers. It is important to avoid irritating soaps and the use of adhesive tape to prevent trauma to the skin. Lotion may be soothing to irritated skin; the nurse takes measures to minimize scratching by the patient.

\section*{REDUCING RISK OF INJURY}

The nurse protects the patient with cirrhosis from falls and other injuries. The side rails should be in place and padded with blankets in case the patient becomes agitated or restless. To minimize agitation, the nurse orients the patient to time and place and explains all procedures. The nurse instructs the patient to ask for assistance to get out of bed. The nurse carefully evaluates any injury because of the possibility of internal bleeding.

Because of the risk for bleeding from abnormal clotting, the patient should use an electric rather than a safety razor. A soft-bristled toothbrush will help to minimize bleeding gums, and pressure applied to all venipuncture sites will help to minimize bleeding.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Bleeding and Hemorrhage}

The patient is at increased risk for bleeding and hemorrhage because of decreased production of prothrombin and decreased ability of the diseased liver to synthesize the substances necessary for blood coagulation. Precautionary measures include protecting the patient with padded side rails, applying pressure to injection sites, and avoiding injury from sharp objects. The nurse observes for melena and assesses stools for blood (signs of possible internal bleeding). Vital signs are monitored regularly. Precautions are taken to minimize rupture of esophageal varices by avoiding further increases in portal pressure (discussed previously). Dietary modification and appropriate use of stool softeners may help prevent straining during defecation. The nurse closely monitors the patient for GI bleeding and keeps readily available equipment (Sengstaken-Blakemore tube), IV fluids, and medications needed to treat hemorrhage from esophageal and gastric varices.

If hemorrhage occurs, the nurse assists the physician in initiating measures to halt the bleeding, administering fluid and blood component therapy and medications. The patient with massive hemorrhage from bleeding esophageal or gastric varices may be transferred to the intensive care unit and may require emergency surgery or other treatment modalities. The patient and family require explanations about the event and the necessary treatment.

\section*{Hepatic Encephalopathy}

Hepatic encephalopathy and coma, possible complications of cirrhosis, may present as deteriorating mental status and dementia as well as physical signs such as abnormal voluntary and involuntary movements. Hepatic encephalopathy is mainly caused by the ac-
cumulation of ammonia in the blood and its effect on cerebral metabolism. Many factors predispose the patient with cirrhosis to hepatic encephalopathy; therefore, the patient may require extensive diagnostic testing to identify hidden sources of bleeding and ammonia.

Treatment may include the use of lactulose and nonabsorbable intestinal tract antibiotics to decrease ammonia levels, modification in medications to eliminate those that may precipitate or worsen hepatic encephalopathy, and bed rest to minimize energy expenditure.

Monitoring is an essential nursing function to identify early deterioration in mental status. The nurse monitors the patient's mental status closely and reports changes so that treatment of encephalopathy can be initiated promptly. Because electrolyte disturbances can contribute to encephalopathy, serum electrolyte levels are carefully monitored and corrected if abnormal. Oxygen is administered if oxygen desaturation occurs. The nurse monitors for fever or abdominal pain, which may signal the onset of bacterial peritonitis or other infection (see the discussion of hepatic encephalopathy in the "Hepatic Dysfunction" section of this Chapter).

\section*{Fluid Volume Excess}

Patients with advanced chronic liver disease develop cardiovascular abnormalities. These occur due to an increased cardiac output and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, possibly resulting from the release of vasodilators. A hyperdynamic circulatory state develops in patients with cirrhosis, and plasma volume increases. This increase in circulating plasma volume may be due in part to splanchnic venous congestion (Bircher et al., 1999). The greater the degree of hepatic decompensation, the more severe the hyperdynamic state. Close assessment of the cardiovascular and respiratory status is key for the nurse caring for patients with this disorder. Pulmonary compromise is always a potential complication of endstage liver disease due to plasma volume excess, making prevention of pulmonary complications an important role for the nurse. Administering diuretics, implementing fluid restrictions, and enhancing patient positioning can optimize pulmonary function. Fluid retention may be noted in the development of ascites and lower extremity swelling and dyspnea. Monitoring intake and output, daily weight changes, changes in abdominal girth, and edema formation is part of nursing assessment in the hospital or in the home setting. Patients are also monitored for nocturia and, later, oliguria as these states indicate increasing severity of liver function (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

During the patient's hospital stay, the nurse and other health care providers prepare the patient with cirrhosis for discharge, focusing on dietary instruction. Of greatest importance is the exclusion of alcohol from the diet. The patient may need referral to Alcoholics Anonymous, psychiatric care, or counseling or may benefit from support from a spiritual advisor.

Sodium restriction will continue for a considerable time, if not permanently. The patient will require written instructions, teaching, reinforcement, and support from the staff as well as the family members.

The success of treatment depends on convincing the patient of the need to adhere completely to the therapeutic plan. This includes rest, lifestyle changes, adequate dietary intake, and the elimination of alcohol. The nurse also instructs the patient and family about the symptoms of impending encephalopathy, possible bleeding tendencies, and susceptibility to infection.

Recovery is neither rapid nor easy; there are frequent setbacks and apparent lack of improvement. Many patients find it difficult to refrain from using alcohol for comfort or escape. The nurse has a significant role in offering support and encouragement to this patient.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral of the patient for home care may assist the patient in dealing with the transition from hospital to home, where the use of alcohol may have been an important part of normal home and social life. The home care nurse assesses the patient's progress at home and the manner in which the patient and family cope with the elimination of alcohol and the dietary restrictions. The nurse also reinforces previous teaching and answers questions that may not have occurred to the patient or family until the patient is back home and trying to establish new patterns of eating, drinking, and lifestyle. For an overall view of the nursing management of the patient with impaired liver function, refer to the Plan of Nursing Care.

\section*{Cancer of the Liver}

Hepatic tumors may be malignant or benign. Benign liver tumors were uncommon until the widespread use of oral contraceptives. With the use of oral contraceptives, benign tumors of the liver occur most frequently in women in their reproductive years.

\section*{PRIMARY LIVER TUMORS}

Few cancers originate in the liver. Primary liver tumors usually are associated with chronic liver disease, hepatitis B and C infections, and cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is by far the most common type of primary liver cancer, but it is rare in the United States (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000). HCC is usually nonresectable because of rapid growth and metastasis. Other types of primary liver cancer include cholangiocellular carcinoma and combined hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma. If found early, resection may be possible, but early detection is unlikely. Cirrhosis, chronic infection with hepatitis B and C , and exposure to certain chemical toxins (eg, vinyl chloride, arsenic) have been implicated as causes of HCC. Cigarette smoking has also been identified as a risk factor, especially when combined with alcohol use. Some evidence suggests that aflatoxin, a metabolite of the fungus Aspergillus flavus, may be a risk factor for HCC. This is especially true in areas where HCC is endemic (ie, Asia and Africa). Aflatoxin and other similar toxic molds can contaminate food such as ground nuts and grains and may act as a co-carcinogen with hepatitis B . The risk of contamination is greatest when these foods are stored unrefrigerated in tropical or subtropical climates.

\section*{LIVER METASTASES}

Metastases from other primary sites are found in the liver in about half of all advanced cancer cases (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000). Malignant tumors are likely to reach the liver eventually, by way of the portal system or lymphatic channels, or by direct extension from an abdominal tumor. Moreover, the liver apparently is an ideal place for these malignant cells to thrive. Often the first evidence of cancer in an abdominal organ is the appearance of liver metastases; unless exploratory surgery or an autopsy is performed, the primary tumor may never be identified.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The early manifestations of malignancy of the liver include pain, a continuous dull ache in the right upper quadrant, epigastrium, or back. Weight loss, loss of strength, anorexia, and anemia may also occur. The liver may be enlarged and irregular on palpation. Jaundice is present only if the larger bile ducts are occluded by the pressure of malignant nodules in the hilum of the liver. Ascites develops if such nodules obstruct the portal veins or if tumor tissue is seeded in the peritoneal cavity.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The liver cancer diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, the history and physical examination, and the results of laboratory and x-ray studies. Increased serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, GGT, and lactic dehydrogenase may occur. Leukocytosis (increased white blood cells), erythrocytosis (increased red blood cells), hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia, and hypocholesterolemia may also be seen on laboratory assessment.

The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which serves as a tumor marker, is elevated in $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of patients with primary liver cancer. Levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a marker of advanced cancer of the digestive tract, may be elevated. These two markers together are useful to distinguish between metastatic liver disease and primary liver cancer.

Many patients have metastases from the primary liver tumor to other sites by the time diagnosis is made; metastases occur primarily to the lung but may also occur to regional lymph nodes, adrenals, bone, kidneys, heart, pancreas, and stomach.

X-rays, liver scans, CT scans, ultrasound studies, MRI, arteriography, and laparoscopy may be part of the diagnostic workup and may be performed to determine the extent of the cancer. Positive emission tomograms (PET scans) are used to evaluate a wide range of metastatic tumors of the liver.

Confirmation of a tumor's histology can be made by biopsy under imaging guidance (CT scan or ultrasound) or laparoscopically. Local or systemic dissemination of the tumor by needle biopsy or fine-needle biopsy can occur but is rare. Some clinicians believe that these procedures should not be performed if the tumor is thought to be resectable; rather, for primary HCC diagnosis should be confirmed by frozen section at the time of laparotomy.

\section*{Medical Management}

Although surgical resection of the liver tumor is possible in some patients, the underlying cirrhosis, so prevalent in cancer of the liver, increases the risks associated with surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been used in treating cancer of the liver with varying degrees of success. Although these therapies may prolong survival and improve quality of life by reducing pain and discomfort, their major effect is palliative.

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

The use of external beam radiation for the treatment of liver tumors has been limited by the radiosensitivity of normal hepatocytes. Doses over 2,500 to 3,000 cGy may result in radiation hepatitis (O'Grady et al., 2000). More effective methods of delivering radiation to tumors of the liver include (1) intravenous or intraarterial injection of antibodies that are tagged with radioactive isotopes and specifically attack tumor-associated antigens and (2) percutaneous placement of a high-intensity source for interstitial radiation therapy (delivering radiation directly to the tumor cells).

\section*{CHEMOTHERAPY}

Chemotherapy has been used to improve quality of life and prolong survival; it also may be used as adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of hepatic tumors. Systemic chemotherapy and regional infusion chemotherapy are two methods used to administer antineoplastic agents to patients with primary and metastatic hepatic tumors (O'Grady et al., 2000).

An implantable pump has been used to deliver a high concentration of chemotherapy to the liver through the hepatic artery. This method provides a reliable, controlled, and continuous infusion of medication that can be carried out in the patient's home. Recent studies have begun to show some effective palliation and modestly improved survival rates (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000).

\section*{PERCUTANEOUS BILIARY DRAINAGE}

Percutaneous biliary or transhepatic drainage is used to bypass biliary ducts obstructed by liver, pancreatic, or bile duct tumors
in patients with inoperable tumors or in those considered poor surgical risks. Under fluoroscopy, a catheter is inserted through the abdominal wall and past the obstruction into the duodenum. Such procedures are used to reestablish biliary drainage, relieve pressure and pain from the buildup of bile behind the obstruction, and decrease pruritus and jaundice. As a result, the patient is made more comfortable and quality of life and survival are improved.

For several days after its insertion, the catheter is opened to external drainage. The bile is observed closely for amount, color, and presence of blood and debris. Complications of percutaneous biliary drainage include sepsis, leakage of bile, hemorrhage, and reobstruction of the biliary system by debris in the catheter or from encroaching tumor. Therefore, the patient is observed for fever and chills, bile drainage around the catheter, changes in vital signs, and evidence of biliary obstruction, including increased pain or pressure, pruritus, and recurrence of jaundice.

\section*{OTHER NONSURGICAL TREATMENTS}

Laser hyperthermia has been used to treat hepatic metastases. Heat has been directed to tumors through several methods to cause necrosis of the tumor cells while sparing normal tissue. In radiofrequency thermal ablation, a needle electrode is inserted into the liver tumor under imaging guidance. Radiofrequency energy passes through to the noninsulated needle tip, causing heat and tumor cell death from coagulation necrosis.

Immunotherapy is another treatment modality under investigation. In this therapy, lymphocytes with antitumor reactivity are administered to the patient with hepatic cancer. Regression of the tumor, the desired outcome, has been demonstrated in patients with metastatic cancer in whom standard treatment has failed.

Transcatheter arterial embolization interrupts the arterial blood flow to small tumors by injecting small particulate embolic or chemotherapeutic agents into the artery supplying the tumor. Ischemia and necrosis of the tumor occur as a result.

For multiple small lesions, ultrasound-guided injection of alcohol promotes dehydration of tumor cells and tumor necrosis (Habib, 2000; O'Grady et al., 2000).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical resection is the treatment of choice when HCC is confined to one lobe of the liver and the function of the remaining liver is considered adequate for postoperative recovery. In the case of metastasis, hepatic resection can be performed when the primary site can be completely excised and the metastasis is limited. Metastases to the liver, however, are rarely limited or solitary. Capitalizing on the regenerative capacity of the liver cells, some surgeons have successfully removed $90 \%$ of the liver. However, the presence of cirrhosis limits the ability of the liver to regenerate. Staging of liver tumors aids in predicting the likelihood of surgical cure. A staging system for liver tumors is summarized in Chart 39-11.

In preparation for surgery, the patient's nutritional, fluid, and general physical status is assessed and efforts are undertaken to ensure the best physical condition possible. Support, explanation, and encouragement are provided to help the patient prepare psychologically for the surgery.

Extensive diagnostic studies may be performed. Specific studies may include liver scan, liver biopsy, cholangiography, selective hepatic angiography, percutaneous needle biopsy, peritoneoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, and blood tests, particularly determinations of serum alkaline phosphatase, AST, and GGT and its isoenzymes.

Lobectomy. Removal of a lobe of the liver is the most common surgical procedure for excising a liver tumor. If it is necessary to restrict blood flow from the hepatic artery and portal vein beyond 15 minutes, it is likely that hypothermia will be used. For a rightliver lobectomy or an extended right lobectomy (including the medial left lobe), a thoracoabdominal incision is used. An extensive abdominal incision is made for a left lobectomy.

Cryosurgery. In cryosurgery (cryoablation), tumors are destroyed by liquid nitrogen at $-196^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. To destroy the diseased tissue, two or three freeze-and-thaw cycles are administered via probes during open laparotomy. This technique has been used alone or as an adjunct to hepatic resection in HCC and colorectal metastases not amenable to radical surgical excision. The efficacy of cryosurgery is still being evaluated; indications and outcomes require further investigation.

Liver Transplantation. Removing the liver and replacing it with a healthy donor organ is another way to treat liver cancer. Recurrence of the primary liver malignancy after transplantation, however, has been reported to occur in $70 \%$ to $85 \%$ of cases, and the survival time after recurrence is brief. Metastasis and recurrence may be enhanced by the immunosuppressive therapy needed to prevent rejection. The patient with small tumors may have a good prognosis after transplantation, but recurrence is common with tumors greater than 8 cm in diameter or those that are multifocal or have vascular invasion (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000). See the discussion of liver transplantation that follows.

\section*{Nursing Management}

If the patient has had surgery to treat liver cancer, potential problems related to cardiopulmonary involvement include vascular complications and respiratory and liver dysfunction. Metabolic abnormalities require careful attention. A constant infusion of $10 \%$ glucose may be required in the first 48 hours to prevent a precipitous fall in the blood glucose level resulting from decreased gluconeogenesis. Because extensive blood loss may occur as well, the patient will receive infusions of blood and IV fluids. The patient requires constant, close monitoring and care for the first 2 or 3 days, similar to postsurgical abdominal and thoracic nursing care.

The patient undergoing cryosurgery is monitored closely for hypothermia, hemorrhage, or bile leak; myoglobinuria can occur as a result of tissue necrosis and is minimized by hydration, diuresis, and at times medications (allopurinol) to bind to and aid in the excretion of toxic products.

If the patient will receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy in an effort to relieve symptoms, he or she may be discharged home while still receiving one or both of these therapies. The patient may also go home with a biliary drainage system in place. The need for teaching is great because of the need for the patient to participate in care and the family's role in care at home.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse instructs the patient to recognize and report the complications and side effects of the chemotherapy that may occur and the actions and desired and undesirable effects of the specific chemotherapy regimen. The nurse also emphasizes the importance of follow-up visits to assess the patient and the tumor's response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

If the patient is receiving chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, the nurse explains the patient's and family's role in managing the chemotherapy infusion and in assessing the infusion/insertion site. The nurse encourages the patient to resume routine activities as soon as possible, while cautioning him or her to avoid activities that may damage the infusion pump or site.

The family and the patient at home with a biliary drainage system in place typically fear that the catheter will be dislodged. They need reassurance and instruction to reduce their fear that the catheter will fall out easily. The patient and family also require instruction on catheter care. They need to learn how to keep the catheter site clean and dry and how to assess the catheter and its insertion site. Irrigation of the catheter with sterile normal saline solution or water may be prescribed to keep the catheter patent and free of debris. The patient and caregivers are taught proper technique to avoid introducing bacteria into the biliary system or catheter during irrigation. They are instructed not to aspirate or draw back on the syringe during irrigation to prevent entry of irritating duodenal contents into the biliary tree or catheter. The patient and caregivers are also instructed about the signs of complications and are encouraged to notify the nurse or physician if problems or questions arise.

Continuing Care. In many cases, referral for home care enables the patient with liver cancer to be at home in a familiar environment with family and friends. Because of the poor prognosis associated with liver cancer, the home care nurse serves a vital role in assisting the patient and family to cope with the symptoms that may occur and the prognosis. The home care nurse assesses the
patient's physical and psychological status, the adequacy of pain relief, nutritional status, and the presence of symptoms indicating complications of treatment or progression of disease. During home visits, the nurse assesses the function of the chemotherapy pump, the infusion site, and the biliary drainage system, if indicated. The nurse collaborates with the other members of the health care team, the patient, and the family to ensure effective pain management and to manage other problems that may occur: weakness, pruritus, inadequate dietary intake, jaundice, and symptoms associated with metastasis to other sites. The home care nurse also assists the patient and family in making decisions about hospice care and assists with initiation of referrals. The patient is encouraged to discuss preferences for end-of-life care with family members and health care providers (see Chap. 17).

\section*{LiverTransplantation}

Liver transplantation is used to treat life-threatening, end-stage liver disease for which no other form of treatment is available. The transplantation procedure involves total removal of the diseased liver and its replacement with a healthy liver in the same anatomic location (orthotopic liver transplantation [OLT]). Removal of the liver leaves a space for the new liver and permits anatomic reconstruction of the hepatic vasculature and biliary tract as close to normal as possible.

The success of liver transplantation depends on successful immunosuppression. Immunosuppressants currently in use include cyclosporine (Neoral), corticosteroids, azathioprine (Imuran), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), OKT3 (a monoclonal antibody), tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), sirolimus (formerly known as rapamycin [Rapamune]), and antithymocyte globulin. Studies are underway to find the most effective combination of immunosuppressive agents and to identify new agents with fewer side effects (Hebert et al., 1999; Watson, Friend \& Jamieson, 1999).

Despite the success of immunosuppression in reducing the incidence of rejection of transplanted organs, liver transplantation is not a routine procedure and may be accompanied by complications related to the lengthy surgical procedure, immunosuppressive therapy, infection, and the technical difficulties encountered in reconstructing the blood vessels and biliary tract. Long-standing systemic problems resulting from the primary liver disease may complicate the preoperative and postoperative course. Previous surgery of the abdomen, including procedures to treat complications of advanced liver disease (ie, shunt procedures used to treat portal hypertension and esophageal varices) increase the complexity of the transplantation procedure.

The indications for liver transplantation are not as limited today as they were when the procedure was first introduced, due to advances in immunosuppressive therapy, improvements in biliary tract reconstruction, and in some cases the use of venovenous bypass. General indications for liver transplantation include irreversible advanced chronic liver disease, fulminant hepatic failure, metabolic liver diseases, and some hepatic malignancies. Examples of disorders that are indications for liver transplantation include hepatocellular liver disease (eg, viral hepatitis, drug- and alcohol-induced liver disease, and Wilson's disease) and cholestatic diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, and biliary atresia).

The patient being considered for liver transplantation frequently has many systemic problems that influence preoperative and postoperative care. Because transplantation is more
difficult when the patient has developed severe GI bleeding and hepatic coma, efforts are made to perform the procedure before this stage.

Liver transplantation is now recognized as an established therapeutic modality rather than an experimental procedure to treat these disorders. As a result, the number of centers where liver transplantation is performed is increasing. Patients requiring transplantation are often referred from distant hospitals to these sites. To prepare the patient and family for liver transplantation, nurses in all settings must understand the processes and procedures of liver transplantation.

\section*{SURGICAL PROCEDURE}

The donor liver is freed from other structures, the bile is flushed from the gallbladder to prevent damage to the walls of the biliary tract, and the liver is perfused with a preservative and
cooled. Before the donor liver is placed in the recipient, it is flushed with cold lactated Ringer's solution to remove potassium and air bubbles.

Anastomoses (connections) of the blood vessels and bile duct are performed between the donor liver and the recipient liver. Biliary reconstruction is performed with an end-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient common bile ducts; a stented T -tube is inserted for external drainage of bile. If an end-to-end anastomosis is not possible because of diseased or absent bile ducts, an end-toside anastomosis is made between the common bile duct of the graft and a loop (Roux-en-Y portion) of jejunum (Fig. 39-15A); in this case, bile drainage will be internal and a T -tube will not be inserted (Maddrey et al., 2001). Figure 39-15B and $C$ illustrates the final appearance of the grafted liver and final closure and drain placement.

Liver transplantation is a long surgical procedure, partly because the patient with liver failure often has portal hypertension

\end{figure}
and subsequently many venous collateral vessels that must be ligated. Blood loss during the surgical procedure may be extensive. If the patient has adhesions from previous abdominal surgery, lysis of adhesions is often necessary. If a shunt procedure was performed previously, it must be surgically reversed to permit adequate portal venous blood supply to the new liver. During the lengthy surgery, providing regular updates to the family about the progress of the operation and the patient's status is helpful.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

The postoperative complication rate is high, primarily because of technical complications or infection. Immediate postoperative complications may include bleeding, infection, and rejection. Disruption, infection, or obstruction of the biliary anastomosis and impaired biliary drainage may occur. Vascular thrombosis and stenosis are other potential complications.

\section*{Bleeding}

Bleeding is common in the postoperative period and may result from coagulopathy, portal hypertension, and fibrinolysis caused by ischemic injury to the donor liver. Hypotension may occur in this phase secondary to blood loss. Administration of platelets, fresh-frozen plasma, and other blood products may be necessary. Hypertension is more common, but its cause is uncertain. Blood pressure elevation that is significant or sustained is treated.

\section*{Infection}

Infection is the leading cause of death after liver transplantation. Pulmonary and fungal infections are common; susceptibility to infection is increased by the immunosuppression needed to prevent rejection (Maddrey et al., 2001). Therefore, precautions must be taken to prevent nosocomial infections by strict asepsis when manipulating arterial lines and urine, bile, and other drainage systems; obtaining specimens; and changing dressings. Meticulous hand hygiene is crucial.

\section*{Rejection}

Rejection is a key concern. A transplanted liver is perceived by the immune system as a foreign antigen. This triggers an immune response, leading to the activation of T lymphocytes that attack and destroy the transplanted liver. Immunosuppressive agents are used long term to prevent this response and rejection of the transplanted liver. These agents inhibit the activation of immunocompetent T lymphocytes to prevent the production of effector T cells.

Although the 1 - and 5-year survival rates have increased dramatically with the use of new immunosuppressive therapies, these advances are not without major side effects. A major side effect of cyclosporine, which is widely used in transplantation, is nephrotoxicity; this problem seems to be dose-related, and renal dysfunction can be reversed if the dose of cyclosporine is appropriately decreased or if its use is not initiated immediately. Cyclosporine-related side effects have caused many centers to use tacrolimus as first-line therapy because of its efficacy and lower side effect profile.

Corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rapamycin, antithymocyte globulin, and OKT3 are also elements of the various regimens of immunosuppression and may be used as
the initial therapy to prevent rejection, or later to treat rejection. Liver biopsy and ultrasound may be required to evaluate suspected episodes of rejection.

Retransplantation is usually attempted if the transplanted liver fails, but the success rate of retransplantation does not approach that of initial transplantation.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient considering transplantation and the family have difficult decisions to make about treatment, use of financial resources, and relocation to another area to be closer to the medical center. They also must cope with the patient's long-standing health problems and perhaps social and family problems associated with behaviors that may be responsible for the patient's liver failure. Therefore, the time during which the patient and family are considering liver transplantation and awaiting the news that a liver is available is often stressful. The nurse must be aware of these issues and attuned to the emotional and psychological status of the patient and family. Referral of the patient and family to a psychiatric liaison nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist, or spiritual advisor may be helpful to them as they deal with the stressors associated with end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

If irreversible, severe liver dysfunction has been diagnosed, the patient may be a candidate for transplantation. An extensive diagnostic evaluation will be carried out to determine whether the patient is a candidate. The nurse and other health care team members provide the patient and family with full explanations about the procedure, the chances of success, and the risks, including the side effects of long-term immunosuppression. The need for close follow-up and lifelong compliance with the therapeutic regimen, including immunosuppression, is explained to the patient and family.

Once accepted as a candidate, the patient is placed on a waiting list at the transplant center and patient information is entered into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) computer system so that candidates may be matched with appropriate organs as they become available.

Unless the patient is having a segmental liver transplantation from a living donor (Chart 39-12), a liver becomes available for transplantation only with the death of another individual, who is usually healthy except for severe brain injury and brain death. Thus, the patient and family undergo a stressful waiting period, and the nurse is often the major source of support. The patient must be accessible at all times in case an appropriate liver becomes available. During this time, liver function may deteriorate further and the patient may experience other complications from the primary liver disease. Because of the current shortage of donor organs, many patients die awaiting transplantation.

Malnutrition, massive ascites, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances are treated before surgery to increase the chance of a successful outcome. If the patient's liver dysfunction has a very rapid onset, as in fulminant hepatic failure, there is little time or opportunity for the patient to consider and weigh options and their consequences; often this patient is in a coma, and the decision to proceed with transplantation is made by the family.

The nurse coordinator is an integral member of the transplant team and plays an important role in preparing the patient for liver transplantation. The nurse serves as a patient and family advocate and assumes the important role of link between the patient and the

\section*{Chemet \\ 39-12}

Innovative Strategies in Liver Transplantation
Segmental liver transplantation in adults using part of the liver of a living donor is a relatively new technique (Bacon \& Di Bisceglie, 2000) that poses ethical and medical questions.

\section*{Issues Related to Donation}

There are two key issues in donor selection:
- The living donor of the liver segment must be a volunteer, without coercion and without financial incentives.
- The potential donor must be assessed for medical conditions that would increase his or her risk, since segmental liver transplantation poses serious risks to the donor (Maddrey et al., 2001).
Other issues concern risks, benefits, and education of the donor and recipient. An acceptable level of risk and benefits must exist for the potential recipient. In addition, a satisfactory process for educating both the donor and recipient and the family (or families in the case of unrelated parties) should be in place. Informed consent for the donor must also be ensured (Maddrey et al., 2001).

\section*{Nurse's Role}

During the period of evaluation and planning for the elective procedure, nurses are involved in supporting and educating both parties. Addressing the concerns each may have for the other's welfare requires a multidisciplinary approach of all transplant team members.
other members of the transplant team. The nurse also serves as a resource to other nurses and health care team members involved in evaluating and caring for the patient.

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The patient is maintained in an environment as free from bacteria, viruses, and fungi as possible, because immunosuppressive medications reduce the body's natural defenses. In the immediate postoperative period, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, neurologic, and metabolic functions are monitored continuously. Mean arterial and pulmonary artery pressures are monitored continuously. Cardiac output, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, oxygen saturation, oxygen demand and delivery, urine output, heart rate, and blood pressure are used to evaluate the patient's hemodynamic status and intravascular fluid volume. Liver function tests, electrolyte levels, the coagulation profile, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and fluid output, including urine, bile, and drainage from Jackson-Pratt tubes, are monitored closely. Because the liver is responsible for the storage of glycogen and the synthesis of protein and clotting factors, these substances need to be monitored and replaced in the immediate postoperative period.

Because of the likelihood of atelectasis and an altered ventilation-perfusion ratio as a result of the insult to the diaphragm during the surgical procedure, prolonged anesthesia, immobility, and postoperative pain, the patient will have an endotracheal tube in place and will require mechanical ventilation during the initial postoperative period. Suctioning is performed as required and sterile humidification is provided.

As the vital signs and condition stabilize, efforts are made to assist the patient to recover from the trauma of this complex surgery. After removal of the endotracheal tube, the nurse encourages the patient to use an incentive spirometer to decrease the risk for atelectasis. Once the arterial lines and the urinary catheter are removed, the patient is assisted to get out of bed, to ambulate
as tolerated, and to participate in self-care to prevent the complications associated with immobility. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction and rejection will continue throughout the hospital stay. Plans will be made for close followup after discharge as well. Teaching, initiated during the preoperative period, continues after surgery.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Teaching the patient and family about long-term measures to promote health is crucial for success of the transplant and represents an important role of the nurse. The patient and family must understand why they should adhere continuously to the therapeutic regimen, with special emphasis on the methods of administration, rationale, and side effects of the prescribed immunosuppressive agents. The nurse provides written as well as verbal instructions about how and when to take the medications. To avoid running out of medication or skipping a dose, the patient must make sure that an adequate supply of medication is available. Instructions are also provided about the signs and symptoms that indicate problems that require consultation with the transplant team. The patient with a T-tube in place must be taught how to manage the tube.

Continuing Care. The nurse emphasizes the importance of follow-up blood tests and visits to the transplant team. Trough blood levels of immunosuppressive agents are obtained, along with other blood tests that assess the function of the liver and kidneys. During the first months, the patient is likely to require blood tests two or three times a week. As the patient's condition stabilizes, blood studies and visits to the transplant team are less frequent. The importance of routine ophthalmologic examinations is emphasized because of the increased incidence of cataracts and glaucoma with the long-term corticosteroid therapy used with transplantation. Regular oral hygiene and follow-up dental care, with administration of prophylactic antibiotics before dental treatments, are recommended because of the immunosuppression.

The nurse reminds the patient that although a successful transplantation will not return him or her to normal, it does increase the chances for survival and a more normal life than before transplantation if rejection and infection can be prevented. Many patients have lived successful and productive lives after receiving a liver transplant. In fact, pregnancy can be considered 1 year after transplantation. Successful outcomes have been reported, but these pregnancies are considered high risk for mother and infant (Sherlock \& Dooley, 2002).

\section*{Liver Abscesses}

Two categories of liver abscess have been identified: amebic and pyogenic. Amebic liver abscesses are most commonly caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Most amebic liver abscesses occur in the developing countries of the tropics and subtropics because of poor sanitation and hygiene. Pyogenic liver abscesses are much less common but are more common in developed countries than the amebic type.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Whenever an infection develops anywhere along the biliary or GI tract, infecting organisms may reach the liver through the biliary system, portal venous system, or hepatic arterial or lymphatic

Robertson, G. (1999). Individuals' perception of their quality of life following a liver transplant: An exploratory study. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 30(2), 497-505.

\section*{Purpose}

Although advances in liver transplantation have increased the survival of persons who undergo the procedure, little is known about their quality of life. This study explored individuals' perceptions of the effect a liver transplant had on their quality of life and focused on the progression from dependence to independence physically, socially, and psychologically.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A phenomenologic approach was used; patients were interviewed in the outpatient clinic. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Cluster analysis was used to identify groups of shared issues. The sample included five patients who had undergone liver transplantation for chronic liver disease at least 1 year before the study. Participants were asked about their quality of life before and after transplantation, the meaning of a good quality of life, and the transition from being dependent before transplantation to independent.

\section*{Findings}

Physical problems present before transplantation prevented the subjects from fulfilling personal goals and participating in their usual ac-
tivities. Their physical problems kept them from achieving a good quality of life. Following transplant, the subjects identified their interest in social integration and their desire to be treated normally. The return to independence was identified as the key factor in their quality of life. However, their family and friends restricted their return to independence by overprotecting them. The study participants identified the importance of support from liver transplant unit staff and other patients in their transition during the first 3 months following transplantation.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

It is important to recognize the issues shared by liver transplant patients and to devise strategies to assist them in achieving independence after surgery. Patient and family education regarding factors such as overprotectiveness versus using good judgment in social situations can be explored before the transplant. Educating the patient's family and friends about the need for independence is important in helping to improve the patient's quality of life after liver transplantation.
system. Most bacteria are destroyed promptly, but occasionally some gain a foothold. The bacterial toxins destroy the neighboring liver cells, and the resulting necrotic tissue serves as a protective wall for the organisms.

Meanwhile, leukocytes migrate into the infected area. The result is an abscess cavity full of a liquid containing living and dead leukocytes, liquefied liver cells, and bacteria. Pyogenic abscesses of this type may be either single or multiple and small. Examples of causes of pyogenic liver abscess include cholangitis and abdominal trauma.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical picture is one of sepsis with few or no localizing signs. Fever with chills and diaphoresis, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss may occur. The patient may complain of dull abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Hepatomegaly, jaundice, anemia, and pleural effusion may develop. Sepsis and shock may be severe and life-threatening. In the past, the mortality rate was $100 \%$ because of the vague clinical symptoms, inadequate diagnostic tools, and inadequate surgical drainage of the abscess. With the aid of ultrasound, CT and MRI scans, and liver scans, early diagnosis and surgical drainage of the abscess have greatly reduced the mortality rate.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Blood cultures are obtained but may not identify the organism. Aspiration of the liver abscess, guided by ultrasound, CT, or MRI, may be performed to assist in diagnosis and to obtain cultures of the organism. Percutaneous drainage of pyogenic abscesses is car-
ried out to evacuate the abscess material and promote healing. A catheter may be left in place for continuous drainage; the patient must be instructed about its management.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment includes IV antibiotic therapy; the specific antibiotic used in treatment depends on the organism identified. Continuous supportive care is indicated because of the serious condition of the patient. Open surgical drainage may be required if antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage are ineffective.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Although the manifestations of liver abscess vary with the type of abscess, most patients appear acutely ill. Others appear to be chronically ill and debilitated. The nursing management depends on the patient's physical status and the medical management that is indicated. For patients who undergo evacuation and drainage of the abscess, monitoring of the drainage and skin care are imperative. Strategies must be implemented to contain the drainage and to protect the patient from other sources of infection. Vital signs are monitored to detect changes in the patient's physical status. Deterioration in vital signs or the onset of new symptoms such as increasing pain, which may indicate rupture or extension of the abscess, is reported promptly. The nurse administers IV antibiotic therapy as prescribed. The white blood cell count and other laboratory test results are monitored closely for changes consistent with worsening infection. The nurse prepares the patient for discharge by providing instruction about symptom management, signs and symptoms that should be reported to the physician, management of drainage, and the importance of taking antibiotics as prescribed.

\section*{3 \\ Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 54-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with endstage liver disease due to postnecrotic cirrhosis from hepatitis C, which developed following a blood transfusion 9 years ago. He is on the waiting list for a liver transplant due to incapacitating ascites and until now has been managed at home with diuretics, low sodium intake, daily weights, and fluid restriction. He also requires a weekly ultrasound-guided paracentesis. He has become unresponsive to oral diuretics, and his ascites is quickly reaccumulating after the paracentesis. His serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are also rising. He is admitted to the hospital to receive intravenous diuretics and for closer monitoring as his renal function worsens. His worsening condition has placed him high on the waiting list for a liver transplant. As his nurse, what nursing interventions would you anticipate? What are the educational needs of the patient and his family?
2. A 59-year-old white woman received an orthotopic liver transplant 6 months ago. She did well postoperatively and was discharged on immunosuppressive therapy. She now presents with a low-grade fever ( $99.8^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ), $5-\mathrm{lb}$ weight gain, tenderness over her transplanted liver, and mild jaundice. She also reports that her urine has become dark and has decreased in amount over the past 2 weeks. Her liver function test results are abnormal. Additional laboratory test results reveal that the serum level of tacrolimus (one of her immunosuppressant medications) is subtherapeutic. Describe the relationship of each of her current symptoms to liver dysfunction. What treatment would you anticipate, and what are the nursing measures for her at this time? What explanation would you give to her for her symptoms?
3. A 20-year-old college student has been diagnosed with hepatitis B . What teaching is warranted for this patient to prevent transmission to others and to reduce the risk of complications? What symptomatic treatment would you anticipate, and what are the nursing implications associated with treatment? How would patient teaching, treatment, and nursing implications differ if the patient's diagnosis were hepatitis A ? What instructions about hepatitis B or hepatitis A would you give to the patient's family or roommates?
4. A 66 -year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a tentative diagnosis of bleeding esophageal varices. Describe the monitoring you would initiate. Describe the possible management strategies to prevent bleeding and to treat active bleeding of the esophageal varices. Identify the nursing implications for each of these strategies. How would medical management and nursing care be modified if the patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in addition to esophageal varices?

\title{
Assessment and Management of Patients With Biliary Disorders
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Compare approaches to management of cholelithiasis.
2. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with cholelithiasis and those undergoing laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy.
3. Differentiate between acute and chronic pancreatitis.
4. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients with acute pancreatitis.
5. Describe the nutritional and metabolic effects of surgical treatment of tumors of the pancreas.

Disorders of the biliary tract and pancreas are common and include gallbladder stones and pancreatic dysfunction. An understanding of the structure and function of the biliary tract and pancreas is essential, along with an understanding of the close link of biliary tract disorders with liver disease. Patients with acute or chronic biliary tract or pancreatic disease require care from nurses knowledgeable about the diagnostic procedures and interventions that are used in the management of gallbladder and pancreatic disorders.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE GALLBLADDER}

The gallbladder, a pear-shaped, hollow, saclike organ, 7.5 to 10 cm ( 3 to 4 in) long, lies in a shallow depression on the inferior surface of the liver, to which it is attached by loose connective tissue. The capacity of the gallbladder is 30 to 50 mL of bile. Its wall is composed largely of smooth muscle. The gallbladder is connected to the common bile duct by the cystic duct (Fig. 40-1).

\section*{FUNCTION OF THE GALLBLADDER}

The gallbladder functions as a storage depot for bile. Between meals, when the sphincter of Oddi is closed, bile produced by the hepatocytes enters the gallbladder. During storage, a large portion of the water in bile is absorbed through the walls of the gallbladder, so that gallbladder bile is five to ten times more concentrated than that originally secreted by the liver. When food enters the duodenum, the gallbladder contracts and the sphincter of Oddi (located at the junction where the common bile duct enters the duodenum) relaxes. Relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi allows the bile to enter the intestine. This response is mediated by secretion of the hormone cholecystokinin-pancreozymin (CCK-PZ) from the intestinal wall. Bile is composed of water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate) and significant amounts of lecithin, fatty acids, cholesterol, bilirubin, and bile salts. The bile salts, together with cholesterol, assist in emulsification of fats in the distal ileum. They then are reabsorbed into the portal blood for return to the liver and again excreted into the bile. This pathway from hepa-
tocytes to bile to intestine and back to the hepatocytes is called the enterohepatic circulation. Because of the enterohepatic circulation, only a small fraction of the bile salts that enter the intestine are excreted in the feces. This decreases the need for active synthesis of bile salts by the liver cells.

If the flow of bile is impeded (ie, with gallstones in the bile ducts), bilirubin, a pigment derived from the breakdown of red blood cells, does not enter the intestine. As a result, bilirubin levels in the blood increase. This results, in turn, in increased renal excretion of urobilinogen, which results from conversion of bilirubin in the small intestine, and decreased excretion in the stool. These changes produce many of the signs and symptoms seen in gallbladder disorders.

\section*{THE PANCREAS}

The pancreas, located in the upper abdomen, has endocrine as well as exocrine functions (see Fig. 40-1). The secretion of pancreatic enzymes into the gastrointestinal tract through the pancreatic duct represents its exocrine function. The secretion of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin directly into the bloodstream represents its endocrine function.

\section*{Exocrine Pancreas}

The secretions of the exocrine portion of the pancreas are collected in the pancreatic duct, which joins the common bile duct and enters the duodenum at the ampulla of Vater. Surrounding the ampulla is the sphincter of Oddi, which partially controls the rate at which secretions from the pancreas and the gallbladder enter the duodenum.

The secretions of the exocrine pancreas are digestive enzymes high in protein content and an electrolyte-rich fluid. The secretions are very alkaline because of their high concentration of sodium bicarbonate and are capable of neutralizing the highly acid gastric juice that enters the duodenum. The enzyme secretions include amylase, which aids in the digestion of carbohydrates; trypsin, which aids in the digestion of proteins; and lipase, which aids in the digestion of fats. Other enzymes that promote the breakdown of more complex foodstuffs are also secreted.
amylase: pancreatic enzyme; aids in the digestion of carbohydrates
cholecystitis: inflammation of the gallbladder
cholecystokinin-pancreozymin (CCKPZ): hormone; major stimulus for digestive enzyme secretion; stimulates contraction of the gallbladder
cholecystectomy: removal of the gallbladder
cholecystojejunostomy: anastomosis of the jejunum to the gallbladder to divert bile flow
cholecystostomy: opening and drainage of the gallbladder
choledocholithiasis: stones in the common duct
choledochostomy: opening into the common duct
cholelithiasis: calculi in the gallbladder
dissolution therapy: use of medications to break up/dissolve gallstones
endocrine: secreting internally; hormonal secretion of a ductless gland
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): an endoscopic procedure using fiberoptic technology to visualize the biliary system
exocrine: secreting externally; hormonal secretion from excretory ducts
laparoscopic cholecystectomy: removal of gallbladder through endoscopic procedure
lipase: pancreatic enzyme; aids in the digestion of fats
lithotripsy: disintegration of gallstones by shock waves
pancreaticojejunostomy: joining of the pancreatic duct to the jejunum by side-to-
side anastomosis; allows drainage of the pancreatic secretions into the jejunum
pancreatitis: inflammation of the pancreas; may be acute or chronic
secretin: hormone responsible for stimulating secretion of pancreatic juice; also used as an aid in diagnosing pancreatic exocrine disease and in obtaining desquamated pancreatic cells for cytologic examination
steatorrhea: frothy, foul-smelling stools with a high fat content; results from impaired digestion of proteins and fats due to a lack of pancreatic juice in the intestine
trypsin: pancreatic enzyme; aids in digestion of proteins
Zollinger-Ellison tumor: hypersecretion of gastric acid that produces peptic ulcers as a result of a non-beta cell tumor of the pancreatic islets

\end{figure}

Hormones originating in the gastrointestinal tract stimulate the secretion of these exocrine pancreatic juices. Secretin is the major stimulus for increased bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas, and the major stimulus for digestive enzyme secretion is the hormone CCK-PZ. The vagus nerve also influences exocrine pancreatic secretion.

\section*{Endocrine Pancreas}

The islets of Langerhans, the endocrine part of the pancreas, are collections of cells embedded in the pancreatic tissue. They are composed of alpha, beta, and delta cells. The hormone produced by the beta cells is called insulin; the alpha cells secrete glucagon and the delta cells secrete somatostatin.

\section*{INSULIN}

A major action of insulin is to lower blood glucose by permitting entry of the glucose into the cells of the liver, muscle, and other tissues, where it is either stored as glycogen or used for energy. Insulin also promotes the storage of fat in adipose tissue and the synthesis of proteins in various body tissues. In the absence of insulin, glucose cannot enter the cells and is excreted in the urine. This condition, called diabetes mellitus, can be diagnosed by high levels of glucose in the blood. In diabetes mellitus, stored fats and protein are used for energy instead of glucose, with consequent loss of body mass. (Diabetes mellitus is discussed in detail in Chap. 41.) The level of glucose in the blood normally regulates the rate of insulin secretion from the pancreas.

\section*{GLUCAGON}

The effect of glucagon (opposite to that of insulin) is chiefly to raise the blood glucose by converting glycogen to glucose in the
liver. Glucagon is secreted by the pancreas in response to a decrease in the level of blood glucose.

\section*{SOMATOSTATIN}

Somatostatin exerts a hypoglycemic effect by interfering with release of growth hormone from the pituitary and glucagon from the pancreas, both of which tend to raise blood glucose levels.

\section*{Endocrine Control of Carbohydrate Metabolism}

Glucose for body energy needs is derived by metabolism of ingested carbohydrates and also from proteins by the process of gluconeogenesis. Glucose can be stored temporarily in the liver, muscles, and other tissues in the form of glycogen. The endocrine system controls the level of blood glucose by regulating the rate at which glucose is synthesized, stored, and moved to and from the bloodstream. Through the action of hormones, blood glucose is normally maintained at about $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $5.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Insulin is the primary hormone that lowers the blood glucose level. Hormones that raise the blood glucose level are glucagon, epinephrine, adrenocorticosteroids, growth hormone, and thyroid hormone.

The endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas are interrelated. The major exocrine function is to facilitate digestion through secretion of enzymes into the proximal duodenum. Secretin and CCK-PZ are hormones from the gastrointestinal tract that aid in the digestion of food substances by controlling the secretions of the pancreas. Neural factors also influence pancreatic enzyme secretion. Considerable dysfunction of the pancreas must occur before enzyme secretion decreases and protein and fat digestion becomes impaired. Pancreatic enzyme secretion is normally 1,500 to $2,500 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day .

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

There is little change in the size of the pancreas with age. There is, however, an increase in fibrous material and some fatty deposition in the normal pancreas in patients older than 70 years of age. Some localized arteriosclerotic changes occur with age. There is also a decreased rate of pancreatic secretion (decreased lipase, amylase, and trypsin) and bicarbonate output in older patients. Some impairment of normal fat absorption occurs with increasing age, possibly because of delayed gastric emptying and pancreatic insufficiency. Decreased calcium absorption may also occur. These changes require care in interpreting diagnostic tests in the normal elderly person and in providing dietary counseling.

\section*{Disorders of the Gallbladder}

Several disorders affect the biliary system and interfere with normal drainage of bile into the duodenum. These disorders include inflammation of the biliary system and carcinoma that obstructs the biliary tree. Gallbladder disease with gallstones is the most common disorder of the biliary system. Although not all occurrences of gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis) are related to gallstones (cholelithiasis), more than $90 \%$ of patients with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Most of the 15 million Americans with gallstones have no pain, however, and are unaware of the presence of stones. For a guide to the terminology associated with biliary disorders and procedures, see Chart 40-1.

\section*{CHOLECYSTITIS}

Acute inflammation (cholecystitis) of the gallbladder causes pain, tenderness, and rigidity of the upper right abdomen that may radiate to the midsternal area or right shoulder and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and the usual signs of an acute inflammation. An empyema of the gallbladder develops if the gallbladder becomes filled with purulent fluid.

Calculous cholecystitis is the cause of more than $90 \%$ of cases of acute cholecystitis (Ahmed, Cheung \& Keefe, 2000). In calculous cholecystitis, a gallbladder stone obstructs bile outflow.

\end{tabular}

Bile remaining in the gallbladder initiates a chemical reaction; autolysis and edema occur; and the blood vessels in the gallbladder are compressed, compromising its vascular supply. Gangrene of the gallbladder with perforation may result. Bacteria play a minor role in acute cholecystitis; however, secondary infection of bile with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and other enteric organisms occurs in about $60 \%$ of patients (Schwartz, 1999).

Acalculous cholecystitis describes acute gallbladder inflammation in the absence of obstruction by gallstones. Acalculous cholecystitis occurs after major surgical procedures, severe trauma, or burns. Other factors associated with this type of cholecystitis include torsion, cystic duct obstruction, primary bacterial infections of the gallbladder, and multiple blood transfusions. It is speculated that acalculous cholecystitis results from alterations in fluids and electrolytes and in regional blood flow in the visceral circulation. Bile stasis (lack of gallbladder contraction) and increased viscosity of the bile are also thought to play a role. The occurrence of acalculous cholecystitis with major surgical procedures or trauma makes its diagnosis difficult.

\section*{CHOLELITHIASIS}

Calculi, or gallstones, usually form in the gallbladder from the solid constituents of bile; they vary greatly in size, shape, and composition (Fig. 40-2). They are uncommon in children and young adults but become increasingly prevalent after 40 years of age. The incidence of cholelithiasis increases thereafter to such an extent that up to $50 \%$ of those over the age of 70 and over $50 \%$ of those over 80 will develop stones in the bile tract (Borzellino, deManzoni \& Ricci, 1999). Chart 40-2 identifies common risk factors.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

There are two major types of gallstones: those composed predominantly of pigment and those composed primarily of cholesterol. Pigment stones probably form when unconjugated pigments in the bile precipitate to form stones; these stones account for about one third of cases in the United States (Donovan, 1999). The risk of developing such stones is increased in patients with cirrhosis, hemolysis, and infections of the biliary tract. Pigment stones cannot be dissolved and must be removed surgically.

Cholesterol stones account for most of the remaining cases of gallbladder disease in the United States. Cholesterol, a normal constituent of bile, is insoluble in water. Its solubility depends on bile acids and lecithin (phospholipids) in bile. In gallstone-prone patients, there is decreased bile acid synthesis and increased cholesterol synthesis in the liver, resulting in bile supersaturated with cholesterol, which precipitates out of the bile to form stones. The cholesterol-saturated bile predisposes to the formation of gallstones and acts as an irritant, producing inflammatory changes in the gallbladder.

Four times more women than men develop cholesterol stones and gallbladder disease; the women are usually older than 40 , multiparous, and obese. The incidence of stone formation rises in users of oral contraceptives, estrogens, and clofibrate; these substances are known to increase biliary cholesterol saturation. The incidence of stone formation increases with age as a result of increased hepatic secretion of cholesterol and decreased bile acid synthesis. In addition, there is an increased risk because of malabsorption of bile salts in patients with gastrointestinal disease or

T-tube fistula or in those who have had ileal resection or bypass. The incidence also increases in people with diabetes.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Gallstones may be silent, producing no pain and only mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Such stones may be detected incidentally during surgery or evaluation for unrelated problems.

The patient with gallbladder disease from gallstones may develop two types of symptoms: those due to disease of the gallbladder itself and those due to obstruction of the bile passages by a gallstone. The symptoms may be acute or chronic. Epigastric distress, such as fullness, abdominal distention, and vague pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, may occur. This distress may follow a meal rich in fried or fatty foods.

\section*{Risk Factors for Cholelithiasis}
- Obesity
- Women, especially those who have had multiple pregnancies or who are of Native American or U.S. Southwestern Hispanic ethnicity
- Frequent changes in weight
- Rapid weight loss (leads to rapid development of gallstones and high risk of symptomatic disease)
- Treatment with high-dose estrogen (ie, in prostate cancer)
- Low-dose estrogen therapy-a small increase in the risk of gallstones
- Ileal resection or disease
- Cystic fibrosis
- Diabetes mellitus

\section*{PAIN AND BILIARY COLIC}

If a gallstone obstructs the cystic duct, the gallbladder becomes distended, inflamed, and eventually infected (acute cholecystitis). The patient develops a fever and may have a palpable abdominal mass. The patient may have biliary colic with excruciating upper right abdominal pain that radiates to the back or right shoulder, is usually associated with nausea and vomiting, and is noticeable several hours after a heavy meal. The patient moves about restlessly, unable to find a comfortable position. In some patients the pain is constant rather than colicky.

Such a bout of biliary colic is caused by contraction of the gallbladder, which cannot release bile because of obstruction by the stone. When distended, the fundus of the gallbladder comes in contact with the abdominal wall in the region of the right ninth and tenth costal cartilages. This produces marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant on deep inspiration and prevents full inspiratory excursion.

The pain of acute cholecystitis may be so severe that analgesics are required. Morphine is thought to increase spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and may be avoided in many cases in favor of meperidine (Porth, 2002). This is controversial because morphine is the preferred analgesic agent for management of acute pain, and meperidine has metabolites toxic to the CNS.

If the gallstone is dislodged and no longer obstructs the cystic duct, the gallbladder drains and the inflammatory process subsides after a relatively short time. If the gallstone continues to obstruct the duct, abscess, necrosis, and perforation with generalized peritonitis may result.

\section*{JAUNDICE}

Jaundice occurs in a few patients with gallbladder disease and usually occurs with obstruction of the common bile duct. The bile, which is no longer carried to the duodenum, is absorbed
by the blood and gives the skin and mucous membrane a yellow color. This is frequently accompanied by marked itching of the skin.

\section*{CHANGES IN URINE AND STOOL COLOR}

The excretion of the bile pigments by the kidneys gives the urine a very dark color. The feces, no longer colored with bile pigments, are grayish, like putty, and usually described as clay-colored.

\section*{VITAMIN DEFICIENCY}

Obstruction of bile flow also interferes with absorption of the fatsoluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Therefore, the patient may exhibit deficiencies (eg, bleeding caused by vitamin K deficiency, which interferes with normal blood clotting) of these vitamins if biliary obstruction has been prolonged.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

\section*{ABDOMINAL X-RAY}

An abdominal x-ray may be obtained if gallbladder disease is suggested to exclude other causes of symptoms. However, only 15\% to $20 \%$ of gallstones are calcified sufficiently to be visible on such x-ray studies.

\section*{ULTRASONOGRAPHY}

Ultrasonography has replaced oral cholecystography as the diagnostic procedure of choice because it is rapid and accurate and can be used in patients with liver dysfunction and jaundice. It does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. The procedure is most accurate if the patient fasts overnight so that the gallbladder is distended. The use of ultrasound is based on reflected sound waves. Ultrasonography can detect calculi in the gallbladder or a dilated common bile duct. It is reported to detect gallstones with 95\% accuracy.

\section*{RADIONUCLIDE IMAGING OR CHOLESCINTIGRAPHY}

Cholescintigraphy is used successfully in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. In this procedure, a radioactive agent is administered intravenously. It is taken up by the hepatocytes and excreted rapidly through the biliary tract. The biliary tract is then scanned, and images of the gallbladder and biliary tract are obtained. This test is more expensive than ultrasonography, takes longer to perform, exposes the patient to radiation, and cannot detect gallstones. Its use may be limited to cases in which ultrasonography is not conclusive.

\section*{CHOLECYSTOGRAPHY}

Although it has been replaced by ultrasonography as the test of choice, cholecystography is still used if ultrasound equipment is not available or if the ultrasound results are inconclusive. Oral cholangiography may be performed to detect gallstones and to assess the ability of the gallbladder to fill, concentrate its contents, contract, and empty. An iodide-containing contrast agent excreted by the liver and concentrated in the gallbladder is administered to the patient. The normal gallbladder fills with this radiopaque substance. If gallstones are present, they appear as shadows on the x-ray film.

Contrast agents include iopanoic acid (Telepaque), iodipamide meglumine (Cholografin), and sodium ipodate (Oragrafin). These agents are administered orally 10 to 12 hours before the x-ray study. To prevent contraction and emptying of the gallbladder, the patient is permitted nothing by mouth after the contrast agent is administered.

The patient is asked about allergies to iodine or seafood. If no allergy is identified, the patient receives the oral form of the contrast agent the evening before the x-rays are obtained. An x-ray of the right upper abdomen is obtained. If the gallbladder is found to fill and empty normally and to contain no stones, gallbladder disease is ruled out. If gallbladder disease is present, the gallbladder may not be visualized because of obstruction by gallstones. A repeat of the oral cholecystogram with a second dose of the contrast agent may be necessary if the gallbladder is not visualized on the first attempt.

Cholecystography in the obviously jaundiced patient is not useful because the liver cannot excrete the radiopaque dye into the gallbladder in the presence of jaundice. Oral cholecystography is likely to continue to be used as part of the evaluation of the few patients who have been treated with gallstone dissolution therapy or lithotripsy.

\section*{ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY}

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) permits direct visualization of structures that could once be seen only during laparotomy. The examination of the hepatobiliary system is carried out via a side-viewing flexible fiberoptic endoscope inserted into the esophagus to the descending duodenum (Fig. 40-3). Multiple position changes are required during the procedure, beginning in the left semiprone position to pass the endoscope.

Fluoroscopy and multiple x-rays are used during ERCP to evaluate the presence and location of ductal stones. Careful insertion of a catheter through the endoscope into the common bile duct is the most important step in sphincterotomy (division of the muscles of the biliary sphincter) for gallstone extraction via this technique. This is described later in the chapter.

Nursing Implications. The procedure requires a cooperative patient to permit insertion of the endoscope without damage to the gastrointestinal tract structures, including the biliary tree. Before

\end{figure}
the procedure, the patient is given an explanation of the procedure and his or her role in it. The patient takes nothing by mouth for several hours before the procedure. Moderate sedation is used with this procedure, so the sedated patient must be monitored closely. Most endoscopists use a combination of an opioid and a benzodiazepine. Medications such as glucagon or anticholinergics may also be necessary to eliminate duodenal peristalsis to make cannulation easier. The nurse observes closely for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression, hypotension, oversedation, and vomiting (if glucagon is given). During ERCP, the nurse monitors intravenous fluids, administers medications, and positions the patient.

After the procedure, the nurse monitors the patient's condition, observing vital signs and monitoring for signs of perforation or infection. The nurse also monitors the patient for side effects of any medications received during the procedure and for return of the gag and cough reflexes after the use of local anesthetics.

\section*{PERCUTANEOUS TRANSHEPATIC CHOLANGIOGRAPHY}

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography involves the injection of dye directly into the biliary tract. Because of the relatively large concentration of dye that is introduced into the biliary system, all components of the system, including the hepatic ducts within the liver, the entire length of the common bile duct, the cystic duct, and the gallbladder, are outlined clearly.

This procedure can be carried out even in the presence of liver dysfunction and jaundice. It is useful for distinguishing jaundice caused by liver disease (hepatocellular jaundice) from that caused by biliary obstruction, for investigating the gastrointestinal symptoms of a patient whose gallbladder has been removed, for locating stones within the bile ducts, and for diagnosing cancer involving the biliary system.

This sterile procedure is performed under moderate sedation on a patient who has been fasting; the patient receives local anesthesia and intravenous sedation. Coagulation parameters and platelet count should be normal to minimize the risk for bleeding. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered during the procedure due to the high prevalence of bacterial colonization from obstructed biliary systems. After infiltration with a
local anesthetic agent, a flexible needle is inserted into the liver from the right side in the midclavicular line immediately beneath the right costal margin. Successful entry of a duct is noted when bile is aspirated or upon the injection of a contrast agent. Ultrasound guidance can be used for duct puncture. Bile is aspirated and samples are sent for bacteriology and cytology. A water-soluble contrast agent is injected to fill the biliary system. The fluoroscopy table is tilted and the patient repositioned to allow x-rays to be taken in multiple projections. Delayed x-ray views can identify abnormalities of more distant ducts and determine the length of a stricture or multiple strictures. Before the needle is removed, as much dye and bile as possible are aspirated to forestall subsequent leakage into the needle tract and eventually into the peritoneal cavity, thus minimizing the risk of bile peritonitis.

Table 40-1 identifies various procedures and their diagnostic uses.

> NURSING ALERT Although the complication rate after this procedure is low, the nurse must closely observe the patient for symptoms of bleeding, peritonitis, and septicemia. The nurse should immediately report pain and indicators of these complications. Antibiotic agents are often prescribed to minimize the risk of sepsis and septic shock.

\section*{Medical Management}

The major objectives of medical therapy are to reduce the incidence of acute episodes of gallbladder pain and cholecystitis by supportive and dietary management and, if possible, to remove the cause of cholecystitis by pharmacologic therapy, endoscopic procedures, or surgical intervention.

Although nonsurgical approaches have the advantage of eliminating risks associated with surgery, they are associated with persistent symptoms or recurrent stone formation. Most of the nonsurgical approaches, including lithotripsy and dissolution of gallstones, provide only temporary solutions to the problems associated with gallstones. They are therefore rarely used in the United States. In some instances, other treatment approaches may be indicated; these are described below.

\end{tabular}

Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) through traditional surgical approaches was considered the standard approach to management for more than 100 years. However, dramatic changes have occurred in the surgical management of gallbladder disease. There is now widespread use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder through a small incision through the umbilicus). As a result, surgical risks have decreased, along with the length of hospital stay and the long recovery period associated with the standard surgical cholecystectomy.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE THERAPY}

Approximately $80 \%$ of the patients with acute gallbladder inflammation achieve remission with rest, intravenous fluids, nasogastric suction, analgesia, and antibiotic agents. Unless the patient's condition deteriorates, surgical intervention is delayed until the acute symptoms subside and a complete evaluation can be carried out.

The diet immediately after an episode is usually limited to low-fat liquids. The patient can stir powdered supplements high in protein and carbohydrate into skim milk. Cooked fruits, rice or tapioca, lean meats, mashed potatoes, non-gas-forming vegetables, bread, coffee, or tea may be added as tolerated. The patient should avoid eggs, cream, pork, fried foods, cheese and rich dressings, gas-forming vegetables, and alcohol. It is important to remind the patient that fatty foods may bring on an episode. Dietary management may be the major mode of therapy in patients who have had only dietary intolerance to fatty foods and vague gastrointestinal symptoms (Dudek, 2001).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (chenodiol or CDCA) have been used to dissolve small, radiolucent gallstones composed primarily of cholesterol. UDCA has fewer side effects than chenodiol and can be administered in smaller doses to achieve the same effect. It acts by inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of cholesterol, thereby desaturating bile. Existing stones can be reduced in size, small ones dissolved, and new stones prevented from forming. Six to 12 months of therapy are required in many patients to dissolve stones, and monitoring of the patient is required during this time. The effective dose of medication depends on body weight. This method of treatment is generally indicated for patients who refuse surgery or for whom surgery is considered too risky.

Patients with significant, frequent symptoms, cystic duct occlusion, or pigment stones are not candidates for this therapy. Symptomatic patients with acceptable operative risk are more appropriate for laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy.

\section*{NONSURGICAL REMOVAL OF GALLSTONES}

Dissolving Gallstones. Several methods have been used to dissolve gallstones by infusion of a solvent (mono-octanoin or methyl tertiary butyl ether [MTBE]) into the gallbladder. The solvent can be infused through the following routes: a tube or catheter inserted percutaneously directly into the gallbladder; a tube or drain inserted through a T-tube tract to dissolve stones not removed at the time of surgery; an ERCP endoscope; or a transnasal biliary catheter.

In the last procedure, the catheter is introduced through the mouth and inserted into the common bile duct. The upper end of the tube is then rerouted from the mouth to the nose and left in place. This enables the patient to eat and drink normally while passage of stones is monitored or chemical solvents are infused to dissolve the stones. This method of dissolution of stones is not widely used in patients with gallstone disease.

Stone Removal by Instrumentation. Several nonsurgical methods are used to remove stones that were not removed at the time of cholecystectomy or have become lodged in the common bile duct (Fig. 40-4 $A, B$ ). A catheter and instrument with a basket attached are threaded through the T-tube tract or fistula formed at the time of T -tube insertion; the basket is used to retrieve and remove the stones lodged in the common bile duct.

A second procedure involves the use of the ERCP endoscope (see Fig. 40-4C). After the endoscope is inserted, a cutting instrument is passed through the endoscope into the ampulla of Vater of the common bile duct. It may be used to cut the submucosal fibers, or papilla, of the sphincter of Oddi, enlarging the opening, which may allow the lodged stones to pass spontaneously into the duodenum. Another instrument with a small basket or balloon at its tip may be inserted through the endoscope to retrieve the stones (see Fig. 40-4D-F). Although complications after this procedure are rare, the patient must be observed closely for bleeding, perforation, and the development of pancreatitis or sepsis.

The ERCP procedure is particularly useful in the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have symptoms after biliary tract surgery, for patients with intact gallbladders, and for patients in whom surgery is particularly hazardous.

Extracorporeal Shock-Wave Lithotripsy. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (lithotripsy or ESWL) has been used for nonsurgical fragmentation of gallstones. The word lithotripsy is derived from lithos, meaning stone, and tripsis, meaning rubbing or friction. This noninvasive procedure uses repeated shock waves directed at the gallstones in the gallbladder or common bile duct to fragment the stones. The energy is transmitted to the body through a fluid-filled bag, or it may be transmitted while the patient is immersed in a water bath. The converging shock waves are directed to the stones to be fragmented.

After the stones are gradually broken up, the stone fragments pass from the gallbladder or common bile duct spontaneously, are removed by endoscopy, or are dissolved with oral bile acid or solvents. Because the procedure requires no incision and no hospitalization, patients are usually treated as outpatients, but several sessions are generally necessary.

The advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has reduced the use of this method to treat gallbladder stones. It is used in some centers for a small percentage of suitable patients (those with common bile duct stones who may not be surgical candidates), sometimes in combination with dissolution therapy.

Intracorporeal Lithotripsy. Stones in the gallbladder or common bile duct may be fragmented by means of laser pulse technology. A laser pulse is directed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of devices that can distinguish between stones and tissue. The laser pulse produces rapid expansion and disintegration of plasma on the stone surface, resulting in a mechanical shock wave. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy uses a probe with two electrodes that deliver electric sparks in rapid pulses, creating expansion of the liquid environment surrounding the gallstones. This results in pressure waves that cause stones to fragment. This technique can be employed percutaneously with the use of a basket or balloon catheter system or by direct visualization through an endoscope. Repeated procedures may be necessary due to stone size, local anatomy, bleeding, or technical difficulty. A nasobiliary tube can be inserted to allow for biliary decompression and prevent stone impaction in the common bile duct. This approach allows time for improvement in the patient's clinical condition until gallstones are cleared endoscopically, percutaneously, or surgically.

\end{figure}

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical treatment of gallbladder disease and gallstones is carried out to relieve persistent symptoms, to remove the cause of biliary colic, and to treat acute cholecystitis. Surgery may be delayed until the patient's symptoms have subsided or may be performed as an emergency procedure if the patient's condition necessitates it.

Preoperative Measures. A chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and liver function tests may be performed in addition to x-ray studies of the gallbladder. Vitamin K may be administered if the prothrombin level is low. Blood component therapy may be administered before surgery. Nutritional requirements are considered; if the nutritional status is suboptimal, it may be necessary to provide intravenous glucose with protein hydrolysate supplements to aid wound healing and help prevent liver damage.

Preparation for gallbladder surgery is similar to that for any upper abdominal laparotomy or laparoscopy. Instructions and explanations are given before surgery with regard to turning and deep breathing. Pneumonia and atelectasis are possible postoperative complications that can be avoided by deep-breathing exercises and frequent turning. The patient should be informed that drainage tubes and a nasogastric tube and suction may be required during the immediate postoperative period if an open cholecystectomy is performed.

Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Fig. 40-5) has dramatically changed the approach to the management of cholecystitis. It has become the new standard for therapy of symptomatic gallstones. Approximately 700,000 patients in the United States require surgery each year for removal of the gallbladder, and $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of them are candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Bornman \& Beckingham, 2001). If the
common bile duct is thought to be obstructed by a gallstone, an ERCP with sphincterotomy may be performed to explore the duct before laparoscopy.

Before the procedure, the patient is informed that an open abdominal procedure may be necessary, and general anesthesia is administered. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed through a small incision or puncture made through the abdominal wall in the umbilicus. The abdominal cavity is insufflated with carbon dioxide (pneumoperitoneum) to assist in inserting the laparoscope and to aid the surgeon in visualizing the abdominal structures. The fiberoptic scope is inserted through the small umbilical incision. Several additional punctures or small incisions are made in the abdominal wall to introduce other surgical instruments into the operative field. The surgeon visualizes the biliary system through the laparoscope; a camera attached to the scope permits a view of the intra-abdominal field to be transmitted to a television monitor. After the cystic duct is dissected, the common bile duct is imaged by ultrasound or cholangiography to evaluate the anatomy and identify stones. The cystic artery is dissected free and clipped. The gallbladder is separated away from the hepatic bed and dissected. The gallbladder is then removed from the abdominal cavity after bile and small stones are aspirated. Stone forceps also can be used to remove or crush larger stones.

The advantage of the laparoscopic procedure is that the patient does not experience the paralytic ileus that occurs with open abdominal surgery and has less postoperative abdominal pain. The patient is often discharged from the hospital on the day of surgery or within a day or two and can resume full activity and employment within a week of the surgery.

Conversion to a traditional abdominal surgical procedure may be necessary if problems are encountered during the laparoscopic procedure; this occurs in $2 \%$ to $8 \%$ of reported surgical cases.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-143.jpg?height=984&width=1497&top_left_y=200&top_left_x=248}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 40-5 In (A) laparoscopic cholecystectomy, (B) the surgeon makes four small incisions (less than $1 / 2$ inch each) in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope with a miniature camera through the umbilical incision.

\end{figure}

Conversion is required more often, approximately $20 \%$ of the time, in those with acute cholecystitis (Lai et al., 1998). Careful screening of patients and identification of those at low risk for complications limits the frequency of conversion to an open abdominal procedure. With wider use of laparoscopic procedures, however, there may be an increase in the number of such conversions. The most serious complication after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a bile duct injury.

Because of the short hospital stay, it is important to provide written as well as verbal instructions about managing postoperative pain and reporting signs and symptoms of intra-abdominal complications, including loss of appetite, vomiting, pain, distention of the abdomen, and temperature elevation. Although recovery from laparoscopic cholecystectomy is rapid, patients are drowsy afterward. The nurse must ensure that the patient has assistance at home during the first 24 to 48 hours. If pain occurs in the right shoulder or scapular area (from migration of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ used to insufflate the abdominal cavity during the procedure), the nurse may recommend use of a heating pad for 15 to 20 minutes hourly, walking, and sitting up when in bed.

Cholecystectomy. In this procedure, the gallbladder is removed through an abdominal incision (usually right subcostal) after the cystic duct and artery are ligated. The procedure is performed for acute and chronic cholecystitis. In some patients a drain may be placed close to the gallbladder bed and brought out through a puncture wound if there is a bile leak. The drain type is chosen based on the physician's preference. A small leak should close spontaneously in a few days with the drain preventing accumulation of bile. Usually only a small amount of serosanguinous fluid will drain in the initial 24 hours after surgery, and then the drain will be removed.

The drain is usually maintained if there is excess oozing or bile leakage. Use of a T-tube inserted into the common bile duct during the open procedure is now uncommon; it is used only in the setting of a complication (ie, retained common bile duct stone). Bile duct injury is a serious complication of this procedure but occurs less frequently than with the laparoscopic approach. Once one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, this procedure has largely been replaced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Mini-cholecystectomy. Mini-cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure in which the gallbladder is removed through a small incision. If needed, the surgical incision is extended to remove large gallbladder stones. Drains may or may not be used. The cost savings resulting from the shorter hospital stay have been identified as a major reason for pursuing this type of procedure. Debate exists about this procedure because it limits exposure to all the involved biliary structures.

Choledochostomy. Choledochostomy involves an incision into the common duct, usually for removal of stones. After the stones have been evacuated, a tube usually is inserted into the duct for drainage of bile until edema subsides. This tube is connected to gravity drainage tubing. The gallbladder also contains stones, and as a rule a cholecystectomy is performed at the same time.

Surgical Cholecystostomy. Cholecystostomy is performed when the patient's condition prevents more extensive surgery or when an acute inflammatory reaction is severe. The gallbladder is surgically opened, the stones and the bile or the purulent drainage are removed, and a drainage tube is secured with a purse-string suture. The drainage tube is connected to a drainage system to
prevent bile from leaking around the tube or escaping into the peritoneal cavity. After recovery from the acute episode, the patient may return for cholecystectomy. Despite its lower risk, surgical cholecystostomy has a high mortality rate (reported as high as $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ ) because of the underlying disease process.

Percutaneous Cholecystostomy. Percutaneous cholecystostomy has been used in the treatment and diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in patients who are poor risks for any surgical procedure or for general anesthesia. These may include patients with sepsis or severe cardiac, renal, pulmonary, or liver failure. Under local anesthesia, a fine needle is inserted through the abdominal wall and liver edge into the gallbladder under the guidance of ultrasound or computed tomography. Bile is aspirated to ensure adequate placement of the needle, and a catheter is inserted into the gallbladder to decompress the biliary tract. Almost immediate relief of pain and resolution of signs and symptoms of sepsis and cholecystitis have been reported with this procedure. Antibiotic agents are administered before, during, and after the procedure.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Surgical intervention for disease of the biliary tract is the most common operative procedure performed in the elderly. Cholesterol saturation of bile increases with age due to increased hepatic secretion of cholesterol and decreased bile acid synthesis.

Although the incidence of gallstones increases with age, the elderly patient may not exhibit the typical picture of fever, pain, chills, and jaundice. Symptoms of biliary tract disease in the elderly may be accompanied or preceded by those of septic shock, which include oliguria, hypotension, changes in mental status, tachycardia, and tachypnea.

Although surgery in the elderly presents a risk because of preexisting associated diseases, the mortality rate from serious complications from biliary tract disease itself is also high. The risk of death and complications is increased in the elderly patient who undergoes emergency surgery for life-threatening disease of the biliary tract. Despite chronic illness in many elderly patients, elective cholecystectomy is usually well tolerated and can be carried out with low risk if expert assessment and care are provided before, during, and after the surgical procedure.

Because of recent changes in the health care system, there has been a decrease in the number of elective surgical procedures performed, including cholecystectomies. As a result, patients requiring the procedure are seen in the later stages of disease. Simultaneously, patients undergoing surgery are increasingly older than 60 years of age and have complicated acute cholecystitis. The higher risk of complications and shorter hospital stays make it essential that older patients and their family members receive specific information about signs and symptoms of complications and measures to prevent them.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING SURGERY FOR GALLBLADDER DISEASE}

\section*{Assessment}

The patient who is to undergo surgical treatment of gallbladder disease is often admitted to the hospital or same-day surgery unit on the morning of surgery. Preadmission testing is often completed a week or more before admission; at that time, the nurse instructs the patient about the need to avoid smoking to enhance pulmonary recovery postoperatively and to avoid respiratory
complications. It also is important to instruct the patient to avoid the use of aspirin and other agents (over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies) that can alter coagulation and other biochemical processes.

Assessment should focus on the patient's respiratory status. If a traditional surgical approach is planned, the high abdominal incision required during surgery may interfere with full respiratory excursion. The nurse notes a history of smoking, previous respiratory problems, shallow respirations, a persistent or ineffective cough, and the presence of adventitious breath sounds. Nutritional status is evaluated through a dietary history and general examination performed at the time of preadmission testing. The nurse also reviews previously obtained laboratory results to obtain information about the patient's nutritional status.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, the major postoperative nursing diagnoses for the patient undergoing surgery for gallbladder disease may include the following:
- Acute pain and discomfort related to surgical incision
- Impaired gas exchange related to the high abdominal surgical incision (if traditional surgical cholecystectomy is performed)
- Impaired skin integrity related to altered biliary drainage after surgical intervention (if a T-tube is inserted because of retained stones in the common bile duct or another drainage device is employed)
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inadequate bile secretion
- Deficient knowledge about self-care activities related to incision care, dietary modifications (if needed), medications, reportable signs or symptoms (eg, fever, bleeding, vomiting)

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Bleeding
- Gastrointestinal symptoms (may be related to biliary leak)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient include relief of pain, adequate ventilation, intact skin and improved biliary drainage, optimal nutritional intake, absence of complications, and understanding of self-care routines.

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Interventions}

After recovery from anesthesia, the nurse places the patient in the low Fowler's position. Intravenous fluids may be given, and nasogastric suction (a nasogastric tube was probably inserted immediately before surgery for a nonlaparoscopic procedure) may be instituted to relieve abdominal distention. Water and other fluids are given in about 24 hours, and a soft diet is started when bowel sounds return.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The location of the subcostal incision in nonlaparoscopic gallbladder surgery is likely to cause the patient to avoid turning and moving, to splint the affected site, and to take shallow breaths to prevent pain. Because full aeration of the lungs and gradually increased activity are necessary to prevent postoperative complica-
tions, the nurse should administer analgesic agents as prescribed to relieve the pain and to promote well-being in addition to helping the patient turn, cough, breathe deeply, and ambulate as indicated. Use of a pillow or binder over the incision may reduce pain during these maneuvers.

\section*{IMPROVING RESPIRATORY STATUS}

Patients undergoing biliary tract surgery are especially prone to pulmonary complications, as are all patients with upper abdominal incisions. Thus, the nurse reminds patients to take deep breaths and cough every hour to expand the lungs fully and prevent atelectasis. The early and consistent use of incentive spirometry also helps improve respiratory function. Early ambulation prevents pulmonary complications as well as other complications, such as thrombophlebitis. Pulmonary complications are more likely to occur in the elderly and in obese patients.

\section*{PROMOTING SKIN CARE AND BILIARY DRAINAGE}

In patients who have undergone a cholecystostomy or choledochostomy, the drainage tubes must be connected immediately to a drainage receptacle. The nurse should fasten tubing to the dressings or to the patient's gown, with enough leeway for the patient to move without dislodging or kinking it. Because a drainage system remains attached when the patient is ambulating, the drainage bag may be placed in a bathrobe pocket or fastened so that it is below the waist or common duct level. If a Penrose drain is used, the nurse changes the dressings as required.

After these surgical procedures, the patient is observed for indications of infection, leakage of bile into the peritoneal cavity, and obstruction of bile drainage. If bile is not draining properly, an obstruction is probably causing bile to be forced back into the liver and bloodstream. Because jaundice may result, the nurse should be particularly observant of the color of the sclerae. The nurse should also note and report right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bile drainage around any drainage tube, clay-colored stools, and a change in vital signs.

Bile may continue to drain from the drainage tract in considerable quantities for a time, necessitating frequent changes of the outer dressings and protection of the skin from irritation because bile is corrosive to the skin.

To prevent total loss of bile, the physician may want the drainage tube or collection receptacle elevated above the level of the abdomen so that the bile drains externally only if pressure develops in the duct system. Every 24 hours, the nurse measures the bile collected and records the amount, color, and character of the drainage. After several days of drainage, the tube may be clamped for an hour before and after each meal to deliver bile to the duodenum to aid in digestion. Within 7 to 14 days, the drainage tube is removed. The patient who goes home with a drainage tube in place requires instruction and reassurance about its function and care of the tube.

In all patients with biliary drainage, the nurse observes the stools daily and notes their color. Specimens of both urine and stool may be sent to the laboratory for examination for bile pigments. In this way, it is possible to determine whether the bile pigment is disappearing from the blood and is draining again into the duodenum. Maintaining a careful record of fluid intake and output is important.

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

The nurse encourages the patient to eat a diet low in fats and high in carbohydrates and proteins immediately after surgery. At the time of hospital discharge, there are usually no special dietary instructions other than to maintain a nutritious diet and avoid excessive fats. Fat restriction usually is lifted in 4 to 6 weeks when
the biliary ducts dilate to accommodate the volume of bile once held by the gallbladder and when the ampulla of Vater again functions effectively. After this, when the patient eats fat, adequate bile will be released into the digestive tract to emulsify the fats and allow their digestion. This is in constrast to before surgery, when fats may not be digested completely or adequately, and flatulence may occur. However, one purpose of gallbladder surgery is to allow a normal diet.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Bleeding may occur as a result of inadvertent puncture or nicking of a major blood vessel. Postoperatively, the nurse closely monitors vital signs and inspects the surgical incisions and drains, if in place, for evidence of bleeding. The nurse also periodically assesses the patient for increased tenderness and rigidity of the abdomen. If these signs and symptoms occur, they are reported to the surgeon. The nurse instructs the patient and family to report to the surgeon any change in the color of stools because this may indicate complications. Gastrointestinal symptoms, although not common, may occur with manipulation of the intestines during surgery.

After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the nurse assesses the patient for loss of appetite, vomiting, pain, distention of the abdomen, and temperature elevation. These may indicate infection or disruption of the gastrointestinal tract and should be reported to the surgeon promptly. Because the patient is discharged soon after laparoscopic surgery, the patient and family are instructed verbally and in writing about the importance of reporting these symptoms promptly.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse instructs the patient about the medications that are prescribed (vitamins, anticholinergics, and antispasmodics) and their actions. It also is important to inform the patient and family about symptoms that should be reported to the physician, including jaundice, dark urine, pale-colored stools, pruritus, or signs of inflammation and infection, such as pain or fever.

Some patients report one to three bowel movements a day. This is the result of a continual trickle of bile through the choledochoduodenal junction after cholecystectomy. Usually, such frequency diminishes over a period of a few weeks to several months.

If a patient is discharged from the hospital with a drainage tube still in place, the patient and family may need instructions about its management. The nurse instructs them in proper care of the drainage tube and the importance of reporting to the physician promptly any changes in the amount or characteristics of drainage. Assistance in securing the appropriate dressings will reduce the patient's anxiety about going home with the drain or tube still in place. (See Chart 40-3 for more details.)

\section*{Continuing Care}

With sufficient support at home, most patients recover quickly from cholecystectomy. However, elderly or frail patients and those who live alone may require a referral for home care. During home visits, the nurse assesses the patient's physical status, especially wound healing, and progress toward recovery. Assessing the patient for adequacy of pain relief and pulmonary exercises also is important. If the patient has a drainage system in place, the nurse assesses it for patency and appropriate management by the patient and family. Assessing for signs of infection and teaching the patient about

the signs and symptoms of infection are also important nursing interventions. The patient's understanding of the therapeutic regimen (medications, gradual return to normal activities) is assessed, and previous teaching is reinforced. The nurse emphasizes the importance of keeping follow-up appointments and reminds the patient and family of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

\section*{Disorders of the Pancreas}

Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is a serious disorder. The most basic classification system used to describe or categorize the various stages and forms of pancreatitis divides the disorder into acute or chronic forms. Acute pancreatitis can be a medical emergency associated with a high risk for life-threatening complications and mortality, whereas chronic pancreatitis often goes undetected until $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of the exocrine and endocrine tissue is destroyed. Acute pancreatitis does not usually lead to chronic pancreatitis unless complications develop. However, chronic pancreatitis can be characterized by acute episodes. Typically, patients are men 40 to 45 years of age with a history of alcoholism or women 50 to 55 years of age with a history of biliary disease (Hale et al., 2000).

Although the mechanisms causing pancreatic inflammation are unknown, pancreatitis is commonly described as autodigestion of the pancreas. Generally, it is believed that the pancreatic duct becomes obstructed, accompanied by hypersecretion of the exocrine enzymes of the pancreas. These enzymes enter the bile duct, where they are activated and, together with bile, back up (reflux) into the pancreatic duct, causing pancreatitis.

\section*{ACUTE PANCREATITIS}

Acute pancreatitis ranges from a mild, self-limiting disorder to a severe, rapidly fatal disease that does not respond to any treatment. Mild acute pancreatitis is characterized by edema and inflammation confined to the pancreas. Minimal organ dysfunction is present, and return to normal usually occurs within 6 months. Although this is considered the milder form of pancreatitis, the
patient is acutely ill and at risk for hypovolemic shock, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and sepsis. A more widespread and complete enzymatic digestion of the gland characterizes severe acute pancreatitis. The tissue becomes necrotic, and the damage extends into the retroperitoneal tissues. Local complications consist of pancreatic cysts or abscesses and acute fluid collections in or near the pancreas. Systemic complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and pleural effusion, can increase the mortality rate to $50 \%$ or higher (Aronson, 1999).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Acute pancreatitis affects people of all ages, but the mortality rate associated with acute pancreatitis increases with advancing age. In addition, the pattern of complications changes with age. Younger patients tend to develop local complications; the incidence of multiple organ failure increases with age, possibly as a result of progressive decreases in physiologic function of major organs with increasing age. Close monitoring of major organ function (ie, lungs, kidneys) is essential, and aggressive treatment is necessary to reduce mortality from acute pancreatitis in the elderly.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Self-digestion of the pancreas by its own proteolytic enzymes, principally trypsin, causes acute pancreatitis. Eighty percent of patients with acute pancreatitis have biliary tract disease; however, only $5 \%$ of patients with gallstones develop pancreatitis. Gallstones enter the common bile duct and lodge at the ampulla of Vater, obstructing the flow of pancreatic juice or causing a reflux of bile from the common bile duct into the pancreatic duct, thus activating the powerful enzymes within the pancreas. Normally, these remain in an inactive form until the pancreatic secretions reach the lumen of the duodenum. Activation of the enzymes can lead to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, necrosis, erosion, and hemorrhage (Quillen, 2001).

Long-term use of alcohol is commonly associated with acute episodes of pancreatitis, but the patient usually has had undiagnosed chronic pancreatitis before the first episode of acute pancreatitis occurs. Other less common causes of pancreatitis include bacterial or viral infection, with pancreatitis a complication of mumps virus. Spasm and edema of the ampulla of Vater, resulting from duodenitis, can probably produce pancreatitis. Blunt abdominal trauma, peptic ulcer disease, ischemic vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia, and the use of corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, and oral contraceptives also have been associated with an increased incidence of pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis may follow surgery on or near the pancreas or after instrumentation of the pancreatic duct. Acute idiopathic pancreatitis accounts for up to $20 \%$ of the cases of acute pancreatitis (Hale, Moseley \& Warner, 2000). In addition, there is a small incidence of hereditary pancreatitis.

The mortality rate of patients with acute pancreatitis is high ( $10 \%$ ) because of shock, anoxia, hypotension, or fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Attacks of acute pancreatitis may result in complete recovery, may recur without permanent damage, or may progress to chronic pancreatitis. The patient admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of pancreatitis is acutely ill and needs expert nursing and medical care.

Severity and mortality predictions of acute alcoholic pancreatitis are generally assessed using Ranson's criteria (Tierney,

McPhee \& Papadakis, 2001). The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) grading system may also be used. Predictors of the severity of pancreatitis and its prognosis are listed in Chart 40-4.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Severe abdominal pain is the major symptom of pancreatitis that causes the patient to seek medical care. Abdominal pain and tenderness and back pain result from irritation and edema of the inflamed pancreas that stimulate the nerve endings. Increased tension on the pancreatic capsule and obstruction of the pancreatic ducts also contribute to the pain. Typically, the pain occurs in the midepigastrium. Pain is frequently acute in onset, occurring 24 to 48 hours after a very heavy meal or alcohol ingestion, and it may be diffuse and difficult to localize. It is generally more severe after meals and is unrelieved by antacids. Pain may be accompanied by abdominal distention; a poorly defined, palpable abdominal mass; and decreased peristalsis. Pain caused by pancreatitis is accompanied frequently by vomiting that does not relieve the pain or nausea.

The patient appears acutely ill. Abdominal guarding is present. A rigid or board-like abdomen may develop and is generally an ominous sign; the abdomen may remain soft in the absence of peritonitis. Ecchymosis (bruising) in the flank or around the umbilicus may indicate severe pancreatitis. Nausea and vomiting are common in acute pancreatitis. The emesis is usually gastric in origin but may also be bile-stained. Fever, jaundice, mental confusion, and agitation also may occur.

Hypotension is typical and reflects hypovolemia and shock caused by the loss of large amounts of protein-rich fluid into the tissues and peritoneal cavity. The patient may develop tachycardia, cyanosis, and cold, clammy skin in addition to hypotension. Acute renal failure is common.

Respiratory distress and hypoxia are common, and the patient may develop diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, dyspnea, tachypnea, and abnormal blood gas values. Myocardial depression, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) may also occur with acute pancreatitis.

}

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a history of abdominal pain, the presence of known risk factors, physical examination findings, and diagnostic findings. Serum amylase and lipase levels are used in making the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In $90 \%$ of the cases, serum amylase and lipase levels usually rise in excess of three times their normal upper limit within 24 hours (Tierney, McPhee \& Papadakis, 2001). Serum amylase usually returns to normal within 48 to 72 hours. Serum lipase levels may remain elevated for 7 to 14 days (Braunwald et al., 2001). Urinary amylase levels also become elevated and remain elevated longer than serum amylase levels. The white blood cell count is usually elevated; hypocalcemia is present in many patients and correlates well with the severity of pancreatitis. Transient hyperglycemia and glucosuria and elevated serum bilirubin levels occur in some patients with acute pancreatitis.

X-ray studies of the abdomen and chest may be obtained to differentiate pancreatitis from other disorders that may cause similar symptoms and to detect pleural effusions. Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans are used to identify an increase in the diameter of the pancreas and to detect pancreatic cysts, abscesses, or pseudocysts.

Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are used to monitor the patient for bleeding. Peritoneal fluid, obtained through paracentesis or peritoneal lavage, may contain increased levels of pancreatic enzymes. The stools of patients with pancreatic disease are often bulky, pale, and foul-smelling. Fat content of stools varies between $50 \%$ and $90 \%$ in pancreatic disease; normally, the fat content is $20 \%$. ERCP is rarely used in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis because the patient is acutely ill; however, it may be valuable in the treatment of gallstone pancreatitis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of the patient with acute pancreatitis is directed toward relieving symptoms and preventing or treating complications. All oral intake is withheld to inhibit pancreatic stimulation and secretion of pancreatic enzymes. Parenteral nutrition is usually an important part of therapy, particularly in debilitated patients, because of the extreme metabolic stress associated with acute pancreatitis (Dejong, Greve \& Soeters, 2001). Nasogastric suction may be used to relieve nausea and vomiting, to decrease painful abdominal distention and paralytic ileus, and to remove hydrochloric acid so that it does not enter the duodenum and stimulate the pancreas. Histamine-2 ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ) antagonists (eg, cimetidine [Tagamet] and ranitidine [Zantac]) may be prescribed to decrease pancreatic activity by inhibiting HCl secretion.

\section*{PAIN MANAGEMENT}

Adequate pain medication is essential during the course of acute pancreatitis to provide sufficient pain relief and minimize restlessness, which may stimulate pancreatic secretion further. Morphine and morphine derivatives are often avoided because it has been thought that they cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi; meperidine (Demerol) is often prescribed because it is less likely to cause spasm of the sphincter (Porth, 2002). Antiemetic agents may be prescribed to prevent vomiting.

\section*{INTENSIVE CARE}

Correction of fluid and blood loss and low albumin levels is necessary to maintain fluid volume and prevent renal failure. The patient is usually acutely ill and is monitored in the intensive care
unit, where hemodynamic monitoring and arterial blood gas monitoring are initiated. Antibiotic agents may be prescribed if infection is present; insulin may be required if significant hyperglycemia occurs.

\section*{RESPIRATORY CARE}

Aggressive respiratory care is indicated because of the high risk for elevation of the diaphragm, pulmonary infiltrates and effusion, and atelectasis. Hypoxemia occurs in a significant number of patients with acute pancreatitis even with normal x-ray findings. Respiratory care may range from close monitoring of arterial blood gases to use of humidified oxygen to intubation and mechanical ventilation (see Chap. 25 for further discussion).

\section*{BILIARY DRAINAGE}

Placement of biliary drains (for external drainage) and stents (indwelling tubes) in the pancreatic duct through endoscopy has been performed to reestablish drainage of the pancreas. This has resulted in decreased pain and increased weight gain.

\section*{SURGICAL INTERVENTION}

Although often risky because the acutely ill patient is a poor surgical risk, surgery may be performed to assist in the diagnosis of pancreatitis (diagnostic laparotomy), to establish pancreatic drainage, or to resect or débride a necrotic pancreas. The patient who undergoes pancreatic surgery may have multiple drains in place postoperatively as well as a surgical incision that is left open for irrigation and repacking every 2 to 3 days to remove necrotic debris (Fig. 40-6).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{POSTACUTE MANAGEMENT}

Antacids may be used when acute pancreatitis begins to resolve. Oral feedings low in fat and protein are initiated gradually. Caffeine and alcohol are eliminated from the diet. If the episode of pancreatitis occurred during treatment with thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, or oral contraceptives, these medications are discontinued. Follow-up of the patient may include ultrasound, x-ray studies, or ERCP to determine whether the pancreatitis is resolving and to assess for abscesses and pseudocysts. ERCP may also be used to identify the cause of acute pancreatitis if it is in question and for endoscopic sphincterotomy and removal of gallstones from the common bile duct.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE PANCREATITIS}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history focuses on the presence and character of the abdominal pain and discomfort. The nurse assesses the presence of pain, its location, its relationship to eating and to alcohol consumption, and the effectiveness of pain relief measures. It also is important to assess the patient's nutritional and fluid status and history of gallbladder attacks and alcohol use. A history of gastrointestinal problems, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and passage of fatty stools, is elicited. The nurse assesses the abdomen for pain, tenderness, guarding, and bowel sounds, noting the presence of a board-like or soft abdomen. It also is important to assess respiratory status, respiratory rate and pattern, and breath sounds. Normal and adventitious breath sounds and abnormal findings on chest percussion, including dullness at the bases of the lungs and abnormal tactile fremitus, are documented. The nurse assesses the emotional and psychological status of the patient and family and their coping, because they are often anxious about the severity of the symptoms and the acuity of illness.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses of the patient with acute pancreatitis include the following:
- Acute pain related to inflammation, edema, distention of the pancreas, and peritoneal irritation
- Ineffective breathing pattern related to severe pain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, atelectasis, and elevated diaphragm
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to reduced food intake and increased metabolic demands
- Impaired skin integrity related to poor nutritional status, bed rest, and multiple drains and surgical wound

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications that may occur include the following:
- Fluid and electrolyte disturbances
- Necrosis of the pancreas
- Shock and multiple organ dysfunction

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include relief of pain and discomfort, improved respiratory function, improved nutritional status, maintenance of skin integrity, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Because the pathologic process responsible for pain is autodigestion of the pancreas, the objectives of therapy are to relieve pain and decrease secretion of the enzymes of the pancreas. The pain of acute pancreatitis is often very severe, necessitating the liberal use of analgesic agents. Meperidine (Demerol) is the medication of choice; morphine sulfate is avoided because it causes spasm of the sphincter of Oddi (Porth, 2002). Oral feedings are withheld to decrease the formation and secretion of secretin. The patient is maintained on parenteral fluids and electrolytes to restore and maintain fluid balance. Nasogastric suction is used to remove gastric secretions and to relieve abdominal distention. The nurse provides frequent oral hygiene and care to decrease discomfort from the nasogastric tube and relieve dryness of the mouth.

The acutely ill patient is maintained on bed rest to decrease the metabolic rate and reduce the secretion of pancreatic and gastric enzymes. If the patient experiences increasing severity of pain, the nurse reports this to the physician because the patient may be experiencing hemorrhage of the pancreas, or the dose of analgesic may be inadequate.

The patient with acute pancreatitis often has a clouded sensorium because of severe pain, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and hypoxia. Therefore, the nurse provides frequent and repeated but simple explanations about the need for withholding fluid intake and about maintenance of gastric suction and bed rest.

\section*{IMPROVING BREATHING PATTERN}

The nurse maintains the patient in a semi-Fowler's position to decrease pressure on the diaphragm by a distended abdomen and to increase respiratory expansion. Frequent changes of position are necessary to prevent atelectasis and pooling of respiratory secretions. Pulmonary assessment and monitoring of pulse oximetry or arterial blood gases are essential to detect changes in respiratory status so that early treatment can be initiated. The nurse instructs the patient in techniques of coughing and deep breathing to improve respiratory function and encourages and assists the patient to cough and deep breathe every 2 hours.

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

The patient with acute pancreatitis is not permitted food and oral fluid intake; however, it is important to assess the patient's nutritional status and to note factors that alter the patient's nutritional requirements (eg, temperature elevation, surgery, drainage). Laboratory test results and daily weights are useful in monitoring the nutritional status.

Parenteral nutrition may be prescribed. In addition to administering parenteral nutrition, the nurse monitors serum glucose levels every 4 to 6 hours. As the acute symptoms subside, the nurse gradually reintroduces oral feedings. Between acute attacks, the patient receives a diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat and proteins. The patient should avoid heavy meals and alcoholic beverages.

\section*{IMPROVING SKIN INTEGRITY}

The patient is at risk for skin breakdown because of poor nutritional status, enforced bed rest, and restlessness, which may result in pressure ulcers and breaks in tissue integrity. In addition, the patient who has undergone surgery, has had multiple drains inserted, or has an open surgical incision is at risk for skin breakdown and infection. The nurse carefully assesses the wound,
drainage sites, and skin for signs of infection, inflammation, and breakdown. The nurse carries out wound care as prescribed and takes precautions to protect intact skin from contact with drainage. Consultation with an enterostomal therapist is often helpful in identifying appropriate skin care devices and protocols. It is important to turn the patient every 2 hours; use of specialty beds may be indicated to prevent skin breakdown.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Fluid and electrolyte disturbances are common complications because of nausea, vomiting, movement of fluid from the vascular compartment to the peritoneal cavity, diaphoresis, fever, and the use of gastric suction. The nurse assesses the patient's fluid and electrolyte status by noting skin turgor and moistness of mucous membranes. The nurse weighs the patient daily and carefully measures fluid intake and output, including urine output, nasogastric secretions, and diarrhea. In addition, it is important to assess the patient for other factors that may affect fluid and electrolyte status, including increased body temperature and wound drainage. The nurse assesses the patient for ascites and measures abdominal girth daily if ascites is suspected.

Intravenous fluids are administered and may be accompanied by infusion of blood, blood products, and albumin to maintain the blood volume and to prevent or treat hypovolemic shock. It is important to keep emergency medications readily available because of the risk of circulatory collapse and shock. The nurse promptly reports decreased blood pressure and reduced urine output because they may indicate hypovolemia and shock or renal failure. Low serum calcium and magnesium levels may occur and require prompt treatment.

Pancreatic necrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. The patient who develops necrosis is at risk for hemorrhage, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. The patient may undergo diagnostic procedures to confirm pancreatic necrosis; surgical débridement or insertion of multiple drains may be performed. The patient with pancreatic necrosis is usually critically ill and requires expert medical and nursing management, including hemodynamic monitoring in the intensive care unit.

In addition to carefully monitoring vital signs and other signs and symptoms, the nurse is responsible for administering prescribed fluids, medications, and blood products; assisting with supportive management, such as use of a ventilator; preventing additional complications; and attending to the patient's physical and psychological care.

Shock and multiple organ failure may occur with acute pancreatitis. Hypovolemic shock may occur as a result of hypovolemia and sequestering of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Hemorrhagic shock may occur with hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Septic shock may occur with bacterial infection of the pancreas. Cardiac dysfunction may occur as a result of fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acid-base imbalances, and release of toxic substances into the circulation.

The nurse closely monitors the patient for early signs of neurologic, cardiovascular, renal, and respiratory dysfunction. The nurse must be prepared to respond quickly to rapid changes in the patient's status, treatments, and therapies. In addition, it is important to inform the family about the status and progress of the patient and allow them to spend time with the patient. (Management of the patient in shock is discussed in detail in Chap. 15.)

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient who has survived an episode of acute pancreatitis has been acutely ill. A prolonged period is needed to regain strength and return to previous level of activity. The patient is often still weak and debilitated weeks or months after an acute episode of pancreatitis. Because of the severity of the acute illness, the patient may not recall many of the explanations and instructions given during the acute phase, so these often need to be repeated and reinforced. The nurse instructs the patient about the factors implicated in the onset of acute pancreatitis and about the need to avoid high-fat foods, heavy meals, and alcohol. It is important to give the patient and family verbal and written instructions about signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis and possible complications that should be reported promptly to the physician.

If acute pancreatitis is a result of biliary tract disease, such as gallstones and gallbladder disease, additional explanations are needed about required dietary modifications. If the pancreatitis is a result of alcohol abuse, the nurse reminds the patient of the importance of eliminating all alcohol.

\section*{Continuing Care}

A referral for home care often is indicated; this enables the nurse to assess the patient's physical and psychological status and adherence to the therapeutic regimen. The nurse also assesses the home situation and reinforces instructions about fluid and nutrition intake and avoidance of alcohol.

When the acute attack has subsided, some patients may be inclined to return to their previous drinking habits. The nurse provides specific information about resources and support groups that may be of assistance in avoiding alcohol in the future. Referral to Alcoholics Anonymous or other appropriate support groups is essential. A summary of nursing management of the patient with acute pancreatitis is provided in the Plan of Nursing Care.

\section*{Plan of Nursing Care \\ Care of the Patient With Acute Pancreatitis}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

Nursing Diagnosis: Acute pain and discomfort related to edema, distention of the pancreas, and peritoneal irritation
Goal: Relief of pain and discomfort
1. Administer meperidine (Demerol) frequently, as prescribed, to achieve level of pain acceptable to patient based on patient's level of pain and discomfort.
2. Using a pain scale, assess pain level before and after administration of analgesic.
3. Report unrelieved pain or increasing intensity of pain.
4. Assist the patient to assume positions of comfort; turn and reposition every 2 hours.
5. Use nonpharmacologic interventions for relieving pain (eg, relaxation, focused breathing, diversion).
6. Listen to patient's expression of pain experience.
1. Meperidine acts by depressing the central nervous system and thereby increasing the patient's pain threshold. Morphine is avoided because it produces spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.
2. Assessment and control of pain are important because restlessness increases body metabolism, which stimulates the secretion of pancreatic and gastric enzymes.
3. Pain may increase pancreatic enzymes and may also indicate pancreatic hemorrhage.
4. Frequent turning relieves pressure and assists in preventing pulmonary and vascular complications.
5. Use of nonpharmacologic methods will enhance the effects of analgesics. Gate control theory states that cutaneous stimulation closes the pain pathways.
6. Demonstration of caring can help to decrease anxiety.
- Reports relief of pain
- Moves and turns without increasing pain and discomfort
- Rests comfortably and sleeps for increasing periods
- Reports less frequent episodes of pain, discomfort, and cramping
- Experiences enhanced pain relief
- Reports increased feelings of well-being and security with the health care team

\section*{Goal: Relief of pain related to stimulation of the pancreas}
1. Administer anticholinergic medications as prescribed.
2. Withhold oral intake.
3. Maintain the patient on bed rest.
4. Maintain continuous nasogastric drainage.
a. Measure gastric secretions at specified intervals.
b. Observe and record color and viscosity of gastric secretions.
c. Ensure that the nasogastric tube is patent to permit free drainage.
1. Anticholinergic medications reduce gastric and pancreatic secretion.
2. Pancreatic secretion is increased by food and fluid intake.
3. Bed rest decreases body metabolism and thus reduces pancreatic and gastric secretions.
4. Nasogastric suction removes gastric contents and prevents gastric secretions from entering the duodenum and stimulating the secretin mechanism. Decompression of the intestines (if intestinal intubation is used) also assists in relieving respiratory distress.- Reports relief of pain, discomfort, and abdominal cramping
- Consumes no fluid and food during acute phase
- Maintains bed rest
- Identifies rationale for fluid and dietary restrictions and use of nasogastric drainage
- Cooperates with insertion of nasogastric tube and suction

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Discomfort related to nasogastric tube \\ Goal: Relief of discomfort associated with nasogastric intubation}
1. Use water-soluble lubricant around exter- nal nares.
1. Prevents irritation of nares
2. Relieves pressure of tube on esophageal and gastric mucosa
2. Turn patient at intervals; avoid pressure or tension on nasogastric tube
3. Relieves dryness and irritation of oropharynx
- Exhibits intact skin and tissue of nares at site of nasogastric tube insertion
- Reports no pain or irritation of nares or oropharynx
3. Provide oral hygiene and gargling solutions without alcohol.
4. Explain rationale for use of nasogastric drainage.
4. Assists patient to cooperate with the drainage, nasogastric tube, and suction.
- Exhibits moist, clean mucous membranes of mouth and nasopharynx
- States that thirst is relieved by oral hygiene
- Identifies rationale for nasogastric tube and suction

\section*{Plan of Nursing Cave \\ Care of the Patient With Acute Pancreatitis (Continued)}

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

Nursing Diagnosis: Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to inadequate dietary intake, impaired pancreatic secretions, increased nutritional needs secondary to acute illness, and increased body temperature
Goal: Improvement in nutritional status
1. Assess current nutritional status and increased metabolic requirements.
2. Monitor serum glucose levels and administer insulin as prescribed.
3. Administer intravenous fluid and electrolytes and parenteral nutrition as prescribed.
4. Provide high-carbohydrate, low-protein, low-fat diet when tolerated.
5. Instruct patient to eliminate alcohol and refer to Alcoholics Anonymous if indicated.
6. Counsel patient to avoid excessive use of coffee and spicy foods.
7. Monitor daily weights.

Nursing Diagnosis: Ineffective breathing pattern related to splinting from severe pain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and atelectasis
Goal: Improvement in respiratory function
1. Acute pancreatitis produces retroperitoneal edema, elevation of the diaphragm, pleural effusion, and inadequate lung ventilation. Intra-abdominal infection and labored breathing increase the body's metabolic demands, which further decreases pulmonary reserve and leads to respiratory failure.
2. Decreases pressure on diaphragm and allows greater lung expansion.
3. Taking deep breaths and coughing will clear the airways and reduce atelectasis.
4. Changing position frequently assists aeration and drainage of all lobes of the lungs.
5. Pancreatitis produces a severe peritoneal and retroperitoneal reaction that causes fever, tachycardia, and accelerated respirations. Placing the patient in an airconditioned room and supporting the patient with oxygen therapy decrease the workload of the respiratory system and the tissue utilization of oxygen. Reduction of fever and pulse rate decreases the metabolic demands on the body.
- Demonstrates normal respiratory rate and pattern and full lung expansion
- Demonstrates normal breath sounds and absence of adventitious breath sounds
- Demonstrates normal arterial blood gases and pulse oximetry
- Maintains semi-Fowler's position when in bed
- Changes position in bed frequently
- Coughs and takes deep breaths at least every hour
- Demonstrates normal body temperature
- Exhibits no signs or symptoms of respiratory infection or impairment
- Is alert and responsive to environment

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Rationale}

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

\section*{Collaborative Problem: Fluid and electrolyte disturbances, hypovolemia, shock}

Goal: Improvement in fluid and electrolyte status, prevention of hypovolemia and shock
1. Assess fluid and electrolyte status (skin turgor, mucous membranes, urine output, vital signs, hemodynamic parameters).
2. Assess sources of fluid and electrolyte loss (vomiting, diarrhea, nasogastric drainage, excessive diaphoresis).
3. Combat shock if present.
a. Administer corticosteroids as prescribed if patient does not respond to conventional treatment.
b. Evaluate the amount of urinary output. Attempt to maintain this at $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$.
4. Administer blood products, fluids, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) as prescribed.
5. Administer plasma, albumin, and blood products as prescribed.
6. Keep a supply of intravenous calcium gluconate readily available.
7. Assess abdomen for ascites formation:
a. Measure abdominal girth daily.
b. Weigh patient daily.
c. Palpate abdomen for fluid wave.
8. Monitor for manifestations of multiple organ failure: neurologic, cardiovascular, renal, and respiratory dysfunction.
1. The amount and type of fluid and electrolyte replacement are determined by the status of the blood pressure, the laboratory evaluations of serum electrolyte and blood urea nitrogen levels, the urinary volume, and the assessment of the patient's condition.
2. Electrolyte losses occur from nasogastric suctioning, severe diaphoresis, emesis, and as a result of the patient's being in a fasting state.
3. Extensive acute pancreatitis may cause peripheral vascular collapse and shock. Blood and plasma may be lost into the abdominal cavity, and, therefore, there is a decreased blood and plasma volume. The toxins from the bacteria of a necrotic pancreas may cause shock.
4. Patients with hemorrhagic pancreatitis lose large amounts of blood and plasma, which decreases effective circulation and blood volume.
5. Replacement with blood, plasma or albumin assists in ensuring effective circulating blood volume.
6. Calcium may be prescribed to prevent or treat tetany.
7. During acute pancreatitis, plasma may be lost into the abdominal cavity, which diminishes the blood volume.
8. All body systems may fail if pancreatitis is severe and treatment is ineffective.

\section*{CHRONIC PANCREATITIS}

Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by progressive anatomic and functional destruction of the pancreas. As cells are replaced by fibrous tissue with repeated attacks of pancreatitis, pressure within the pancreas increases. The end result is mechanical obstruction of the pancreatic and common bile ducts and the duodenum. Additionally, there is atrophy of the epithe-
lium of the ducts, inflammation, and destruction of the secreting cells of the pancreas.

Alcohol consumption in Western societies and malnutrition worldwide are the major causes of chronic pancreatitis. Excessive and prolonged consumption of alcohol accounts for approximately $70 \%$ of the cases (Clain \& Pearson, 1999). The incidence of pancreatitis is 50 times greater in alcoholics than in the nondrinking population. Long-term alcohol consumption causes hypersecretion of protein in pancreatic secretions, resulting in protein plugs and calculi within the pancreatic ducts. Alcohol also has a direct toxic effect on the cells of the pancreas. Damage to these cells is more likely to occur and to be more severe in patients whose diets are poor in protein content and either very high or very low in fat.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by recurring attacks of severe upper abdominal and back pain, accompanied by vomiting. Attacks are often so painful that opioids, even in large doses, do
not provide relief. As the disease progresses, recurring attacks of pain are more severe, more frequent, and of longer duration. Some patients experience continuous severe pain; others have a dull, nagging constant pain. The risk of dependence on opioids is increased in pancreatitis because of the chronic nature and severity of the pain.

Weight loss is a major problem in chronic pancreatitis: more than $75 \%$ of patients experience significant weight loss, usually caused by decreased dietary intake secondary to anorexia or fear that eating will precipitate another attack. Malabsorption occurs late in the disease, when as little as $10 \%$ of pancreatic function remains. As a result, digestion, especially of proteins and fats, is impaired. The stools become frequent, frothy, and foul-smelling because of impaired fat digestion, which results in stools with a high fat content. This is referred to as steatorrhea. As the disease progresses, calcification of the gland may occur, and calcium stones may form within the ducts.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

ERCP is the most useful study in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. It provides detail about the anatomy of the pancreas and the pancreatic and biliary ducts. It is also helpful in obtaining tissue for analysis and differentiating pancreatitis from other conditions, such as carcinoma. Various imaging procedures, including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasound, have been useful in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic disorders. Computed tomography scanning or ultrasound is helpful to detect pancreatic cysts.

A glucose tolerance test evaluates pancreatic islet cell function, information necessary for making decisions about surgical resection of the pancreas. An abnormal glucose tolerance test indicative of diabetes may be present. In contrast to the patient with acute pancreatitis, serum amylase levels and the white blood cell count may not be elevated significantly.

\section*{Medical Management}

The management of chronic pancreatitis depends on its probable cause in each patient. Treatment is directed toward preventing and managing acute attacks, relieving pain and discomfort, and managing exocrine and endocrine insufficiency of pancreatitis.

\section*{NONSURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Nonsurgical approaches may be indicated for the patient who refuses surgery, who is a poor surgical risk, or whose disease and symptoms do not warrant surgical intervention. Endoscopy to remove pancreatic duct stones and stent strictures may be effective in selected patients to manage pain and relieve obstruction. However, such therapy is available only in special centers and is suitable for few patients (Bornman \& Beckingham, 2001).

Management of abdominal pain and discomfort is similar to that of acute pancreatitis; however, the focus is usually on the use of nonopioid methods to manage pain. Persistent, unrelieved pain is often the most difficult aspect of management (Bornman \& Beckingham, 2001). The physician, nurse, and dietitian emphasize to the patient and family the importance of avoiding alcohol and other foods that the patient has found tend to produce abdominal pain and discomfort. The fact that no other treatment is likely to relieve pain if the patient continues to consume alcohol is stressed to the patient.

Diabetes mellitus resulting from dysfunction of the pancreatic islet cells is treated with diet, insulin, or oral antidiabetic agents.

The hazard of severe hypoglycemia with alcohol use is stressed to the patient and family. Pancreatic enzyme replacement is indicated in the patient with malabsorption and steatorrhea (Trolli, Conwell \& Zuccaro, 2001).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgery is generally carried out to relieve abdominal pain and discomfort, restore drainage of pancreatic secretions, and reduce the frequency of acute attacks of pancreatitis. The surgery performed depends on the anatomic and functional abnormalities of the pancreas, including the location of disease within the pancreas, diabetes, exocrine insufficiency, biliary stenosis, and pseudocysts of the pancreas. Other factors taken into consideration in determining whether surgery is to be performed and what procedure is indicated include the patient's continued use of alcohol and the likelihood that the patient will be able to manage the endocrine or exocrine changes that are expected after surgery.

Pancreaticojejunostomy (also referred to as Roux-en-Y) with a side-to-side anastomosis or joining of the pancreatic duct to the jejunum allows drainage of the pancreatic secretions into the jejunum. Pain relief occurs by 6 months in more than $80 \%$ of the patients who undergo this procedure, but pain returns in a substantial number of patients as the disease itself progresses (Tierney et al., 2001).

Other surgical procedures may be performed for different degrees and types of disease, ranging from revision of the sphincter of the ampulla of Vater, to internal drainage of a pancreatic cyst into the stomach (see Pancreatic Cyst discussion), to insertion of a stent, to wide resection or removal of the pancreas. A Whipple resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) has been carried out to relieve the pain of chronic pancreatitis.

Autotransplantation or implantation of the patient's pancreatic islet cells has been attempted to preserve the endocrine function of the pancreas in patients who have undergone total pancreatectomy. Testing and refinement of this procedure continue in an effort to improve outcomes.

When chronic pancreatitis develops as a result of gallbladder disease, the obstruction is treated by surgery to explore the common duct and remove the stones; usually, the gallbladder is removed at the same time. In addition, an attempt is made to improve the drainage of the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct by dividing the sphincter of Oddi, a muscle that is located at the ampulla of Vater (this surgical procedure is known as a sphincterotomy). A T-tube usually is placed in the common bile duct, requiring a drainage system to collect the bile postoperatively. Nursing care after such surgery is similar to that indicated after other biliary tract surgery.

Patients who undergo surgery for chronic pancreatitis may experience weight gain and improved nutritional status; this may result from reduction in pain associated with eating rather than from correction of malabsorption. However, morbidity and mortality after these surgical procedures are high because of the poor physical condition of the patient before surgery and the concomitant occurrence of cirrhosis. Even after undergoing these surgical procedures, the patient is likely to continue to have pain and impaired digestion secondary to pancreatitis unless alcohol is avoided completely.

\section*{PANCREATIC CYSTS}

As a result of the local necrosis that occurs at the time of acute pancreatitis, collections of fluid may form in the vicinity of the pancreas. These become walled off by fibrous tissue and are called
pancreatic pseudocysts. They are the most common type of pancreatic cysts. Less common cysts occur as a result of congenital anomalies or are secondary to chronic pancreatitis or trauma to the pancreas.

Diagnosis of pancreatic cysts and pseudocysts is made by ultrasound, computed tomography, and ERCP. ERCP may be used to define the anatomy of the pancreas and evaluate the patency of pancreatic drainage. Pancreatic pseudocysts may be of considerable size. Because of their location behind the posterior peritoneum, when they enlarge they impinge on and displace the stomach or the colon, which are adjacent. Eventually, through pressure or secondary infection, they produce symptoms and require drainage.

Drainage into the gastrointestinal tract or through the skin and abdominal wall may be established. In the latter instance, the drainage is likely to be profuse and destructive to tissue because of the enzyme contents. Hence, steps must be taken to protect the skin near the drainage site from excoriation. Ointments protect the skin if they are applied before excoriation takes place. Another method involves the constant aspiration of digestive secretions from the drainage tract by means of a suction apparatus, so that skin contact with the digestive enzymes is avoided. This method requires expert nursing attention to ensure that the suction tube does not become dislodged and suction is not interrupted. Consultation with an enterostomal therapist is indicated to identify appropriate strategies to maintain drainage and protect the skin.

\section*{CANCER OF THE PANCREAS}

The incidence of pancreatic cancer has decreased slightly over the past 25 years in non-Caucasian men. It is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and occurs most frequently in the fifth to seventh decades of life (American Cancer Society, 2002). Cigarette smoking, exposure to industrial chemicals or toxins in the environment, and a diet high in fat, meat, or both are associated with pancreatic cancer, although their role is not completely clear. The risk for pancreatic cancer increases as the extent of cigarette smoking increases. Diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis, and hereditary pancreatitis are also associated with pancreatic cancer. The pancreas can also be the site of metastasis from other tumors.

Cancer may arise in any portion of the pancreas (in the head, the body, or the tail); clinical manifestations vary depending on the location of the lesion and whether functioning, insulinsecreting pancreatic islet cells are involved. Approximately $75 \%$ of pancreatic cancers originate in the head of the pancreas and give rise to a distinctive clinical picture. Functioning islet cell tumors, whether benign (adenoma) or malignant (carcinoma), are responsible for the syndrome of hyperinsulinism. With these exceptions, the symptoms are nonspecific, and patients usually do not seek medical attention until late in the disease; $80 \%$ to $85 \%$ of patients have advanced, unresectable tumor when first detected. In fact, pancreatic carcinoma has only a $2 \%$ to $5 \%$ survival rate at 5 years regardless of the stage of disease at diagnosis or treatment (Tierney et al., 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Pain, jaundice, or both are present in more than $90 \%$ of patients and, along with weight loss, are considered classic signs of pancreatic carcinoma. However, they often do not appear until the disease is far advanced. Other signs include rapid, profound, and
progressive weight loss as well as vague upper or midabdominal pain or discomfort that is unrelated to any gastrointestinal function and is often difficult to describe. Such discomfort radiates as a boring pain in the midback and is unrelated to posture or activity. It is often progressive and severe, requiring the use of opioids. It is often more severe at night. Relief may be obtained by sitting up and leaning forward, or accentuated when lying supine.

Malignant cells from pancreatic cancer are often shed into the peritoneal cavity, increasing the likelihood of metastasis. The formation of ascites is common. An important sign, when present, is the onset of symptoms of insulin deficiency: glucosuria, hyperglycemia, and abnormal glucose tolerance. Thus, diabetes may be an early sign of carcinoma of the pancreas. Meals often aggravate epigastric pain, which usually occurs before the appearance of jaundice and pruritus.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are used to identify the presence of pancreatic tumors. ERCP is also used in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. Cells obtained during ERCP are sent to the laboratory for examination. Gastrointestinal x-ray findings may demonstrate deformities in adjacent viscera caused by the impinging pancreatic mass.

Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas is used to diagnose pancreatic tumors and confirm the diagnosis in patients whose tumors are not resectable, eliminating the stress and postoperative pain of ineffective surgery. In this procedure, a needle is inserted through the anterior abdominal wall into the pancreatic mass, guided by computed tomography, ultrasound, ERCP, or other imaging techniques. The aspirated material is examined for malignant cells. Although percutaneous biopsy is a valuable diagnostic tool, it has some potential drawbacks: a falsenegative result if small tumors are missed and seeding of cancer cells along the needle track. Low-dose radiation to the site may be used before the biopsy to reduce the risk of seeding.

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is another procedure that may be performed to identify obstructions of the biliary tract by a pancreatic tumor. Several tumor markers (eg, CA 19-9, CEA, DU-PAN-2) may be used in the diagnostic workup, but they are nonspecific for pancreatic carcinoma. These tumor markers are useful as indicators of disease progression.

Angiography, computed tomography, and laparoscopy may be performed to determine whether the tumor can be removed surgically. Intraoperative ultrasonography has been used to determine if there is metastatic disease to other organs.

\section*{Medical Management}

If the tumor is resectable and localized (typically tumors in the head of the pancreas), the surgical procedure to remove it is usually extensive (see Medical Management in Tumors of the Head of the Pancreas). However, definitive surgical treatment (ie, total excision of the lesion) is often not possible because of the extensive growth when the tumor is finally diagnosed and because of the probable widespread metastases (especially to the liver, lungs, and bones). More often, treatment is limited to palliative measures.

Although pancreatic tumors may be resistant to standard radiation therapy, the patient may be treated with radiation and chemotherapy (fluorouracil and gemcitabine). If the patient undergoes surgery, intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) may be used to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor with minimal injury to other tissues. IORT may also be helpful in relief of
pain. Interstitial implantation of radioactive sources has also been used, although the rate of complications is high. A large biliary stent inserted percutaneously or by endoscopy may be used to relieve jaundice.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Pain management and attention to nutritional requirements are important nursing measures to improve the level of comfort. Skin care and nursing measures are directed toward relief of pain and discomfort associated with jaundice, anorexia, and profound weight loss. Specialty mattresses are beneficial and protect bony prominences from pressure. Pain associated with pancreatic cancer may be severe and may require liberal use of opioids; patientcontrolled analgesia should be considered for the patient with severe, escalating pain.

Because of the poor prognosis and likelihood of short survival, end-of-life preferences are discussed and honored. If appropriate, the nurse refers the patient to hospice care. (See Chaps. 16 and 17, respectively, for discussion of care of the patient with cancer and end-of-life care.)

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The specific patient and family teaching indicated varies with the stage of disease and the treatment choices made by the patient. If the patient elects to receive chemotherapy, the nurse focuses teaching on prevention of side effects and complications of the agents used. If surgery is performed to relieve obstruction and establish biliary drainage, teaching addresses management of the drainage system and monitoring for complications. The nurse instructs the family about changes in the patient's status that should be reported to the physician.

Continuing Care. A referral for home care is indicated to help the patient and family deal with the physical problems and discomforts associated with pancreatic cancer and the psychological impact of the disease. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical status, fluid and nutritional status, and skin integrity and the adequacy of pain management. The nurse teaches the patient and family strategies to prevent skin breakdown and relieve pain, pruritus, and anorexia. It is important to discuss and arrange palliative care (hospice services) in an effort to relieve patient discomfort, assist with care, and comply with the patient's end-of-life decisions and wishes.

\section*{TUMORS OF THE HEAD OF THE PANCREAS}

Sixty to eighty percent of pancreatic tumors occur in the head of the pancreas. Tumors in this region of the pancreas obstruct the common bile duct where the duct passes through the head of the pancreas to join the pancreatic duct and empty at the ampulla of Vater into the duodenum. The tumors producing the obstruction may arise from the pancreas, the common bile duct, or the ampulla of Vater.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The obstructed flow of bile produces jaundice, clay-colored stools, and dark urine. Malabsorption of nutrients and fat-soluble vitamins may result from obstruction by the tumor to entry of bile in the gastrointestinal tract. Abdominal discomfort or pain
and pruritus may be noted, along with anorexia, weight loss, and malaise. If these signs and symptoms are present, cancer of the head of the pancreas is suspected.

The jaundice of this disease must be differentiated from that due to a biliary obstruction caused by a gallstone in the common duct, which is usually intermittent and appears typically in obese patients, most often women, who have had previous symptoms of gallbladder disease.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic studies may include duodenography, angiography by hepatic or celiac artery catheterization, pancreatic scanning, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, ERCP, and percutaneous needle biopsy of the pancreas. Results of a biopsy of the pancreas may aid in the diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Before extensive surgery can be performed, a fairly long period of preparation is often necessary because the patient's nutritional and physical condition is often quite compromised. Various liver and pancreatic function studies are performed. A diet high in protein along with pancreatic enzymes is often prescribed. Preoperative preparation includes adequate hydration, correction of prothrombin deficiency with vitamin K , and treatment of anemia to minimize postoperative complications. Parenteral nutrition and blood component therapy are frequently required.

A biliary-enteric shunt may be performed to relieve the jaundice and, perhaps, to provide time for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Total pancreatectomy (removal of the pancreas) may be performed if there is no evidence of direct extension of the tumor to adjacent tissues or regional lymph nodes. A pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's procedure or resection) is used for potentially resectable cancer of the head of the pancreas (Fig. 40-7). This procedure involves removal of the gallbladder, distal portion of the stomach, duodenum, head of the pancreas, and common bile duct and anastomosis of the remaining pancreas and stomach to the jejunum (Stanford, 2001). The result is removal of the tumor, allowing flow of bile into the jejunum. When the tumor cannot be excised, the jaundice may be relieved by diverting the bile flow into the jejunum by anastomosing the jejunum to the gallbladder, a procedure known as cholecystojejunostomy.

The postoperative management of patients who have undergone a pancreatectomy or a pancreaticoduodenectomy is similar to the management of patients after extensive gastrointestinal and biliary surgery. The patient's physical status is often less than optimal, increasing the risk for postoperative complications. Hemorrhage, vascular collapse, and hepatorenal failure remain the major complications of these extensive surgical procedures. The mortality rate after these procedures has improved because of advances in nutritional support and improved surgical techniques. A nasogastric tube and suction and parenteral nutrition allow the gastrointestinal tract to rest while promoting adequate nutrition.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Preoperatively and postoperatively, nursing care is directed toward promoting patient comfort, preventing complications, and assisting the patient to return to and maintain as normal and comfortable a life as possible. The nurse closely monitors the patient in the intensive care unit after surgery; the patient will have

multiple intravenous and arterial lines in place for fluid and blood replacement as well as for monitoring arterial pressures, and is on a mechanical ventilator in the immediate postoperative period. It is important to give careful attention to changes in vital signs, arterial blood gases and pressures, pulse oximetry, laboratory values, and urine output. The nurse must also consider the patient's compromised nutritional status and risk for bleeding. Depending on the type of surgical procedure performed, malabsorption syndrome and diabetes mellitus are likely; the nurse must address these issues during acute and long-term patient care.

Although the patient's physiologic status is the focus of the health care team in the immediate postoperative period, the patient's psychological and emotional state must be considered, along with that of the family. The patient has undergone major and risky surgery and is critically ill; thus, anxiety and depression may affect recovery. The immediate and long-term outcome of this extensive surgical resection is uncertain, and the patient and family require emotional support and understanding in the critical and stressful preoperative and postoperative periods.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient who has undergone this extensive surgery requires careful and thorough preparation for self-care at home. The nurse instructs the patient and family about the need for modifications in the diet because of malabsorption and hyperglycemia resulting from the surgery. It is important to instruct them about the continuing need for pancreatic enzyme replacement, a low-fat diet, and vitamin supplementation.

The nurse teaches the patient and family strategies to relieve pain and discomfort, along with strategies to manage drains, if present, and to care for the surgical incision. The patient and family members may require instruction about use of patientcontrolled analgesia, parenteral nutrition, wound care, skin care, and management of drainage. It is important to describe, verbally and in writing, the signs and symptoms of complications, and to teach the patient and family about indicators of complications that should be reported promptly.

Discharge of the patient to a long-term care setting may be warranted after surgery as extensive as pancreatectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy, particularly if the patient's preoperative status was not optimal. Efforts are made to communicate to the long-term care staff about the teaching that has been provided so that instructions can be clarified and reinforced. During the recovery or long-term phase of care, the patient and family receive further instructions about care that they will carry out at home.

Continuing Care. A referral for home care may be indicated when the patient returns home. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical and psychological status and the ability of the patient and family to manage needed care. The home care nurse provides needed physical care and monitors the adequacy of pain management. In addition, it is important to assess the patient's nutritional status and monitor the use of parenteral nutrition. The nurse discusses the use of hospice services with the patient and family and makes a referral if indicated.

\section*{PANCREATIC ISLET TUMORS}

The pancreas contains the islets (islands) of Langerhans, small nests of cells that secrete directly into the bloodstream and therefore are part of the endocrine system. The hormone insulin is essential for the metabolism of glucose. Diabetes mellitus (see Chap. 41) is the result of deficient secretion of insulin.

At least two types of tumors of the pancreatic islet cells are known: those that secrete insulin (insulinoma) and those in which insulin secretion is not increased ("nonfunctioning" islet cell cancer). Insulinomas produce hypersecretion of insulin and cause an excessive rate of glucose metabolism. The resulting hypoglycemia may produce symptoms of weakness, mental confusion, and seizures. These symptoms may be relieved almost immediately by oral or intravenous administration of glucose. The 5-hour glucose tolerance test is helpful in diagnosing insulinoma and in distinguishing it from other causes of hypoglycemia.

\section*{Surgical Management}

When a tumor of the islet cells has been diagnosed, surgical treatment with removal of the tumor usually is recommended. The tumors may be benign adenomas or they may be malignant. Complete removal usually results in almost immediate relief of symptoms. In some patients, symptoms may be produced by simple hypertrophy of this tissue rather than a tumor of the islet cells. In such cases, a partial pancreatectomy (removal of the tail and part of the body of the pancreas) is performed.

\section*{Nursing Management}

In preparing the patient for surgery, the nurse must be alert for symptoms of hypoglycemia and be ready to administer glucose as prescribed if symptoms occur. Postoperatively, the nursing management is the same as that after other upper abdominal surgical procedures, with special emphasis on monitoring serum glucose levels. Patient teaching is determined by the extent of surgery and the alterations in pancreatic function that result.

\section*{HYPERINSULINISM}

Hyperinsulinism results from overproduction of insulin by the pancreatic islets. Symptoms resemble those of excessive doses of insulin and are attributable to the same mechanism, an abnormal reduction in blood glucose levels. Clinically, it is characterized by episodes during which the patient experiences unusual hunger, nervousness, sweating, headache, and faintness; in severe cases, seizures and episodes of unconsciousness may occur. The findings at the time of surgery or at autopsy may indicate hyperplasia (overgrowth) of the islets of Langerhans or a benign or malignant tumor involving the islets and capable of producing large amounts of insulin (see preceding discussion). Occasionally, tumors of nonpancreatic origin produce an insulin-like material that can cause severe hypoglycemia that may be responsible for seizures coinciding with blood glucose levels too low to sustain normal brain function (ie, below $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} [1.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}]$ ).

All the symptoms that accompany spontaneous hypoglycemia are relieved by the oral or parenteral administration of glucose. Surgical removal of the hyperplastic or neoplastic tissue from the pancreas is the only successful method of treatment. About $15 \%$ of patients with spontaneous or functional hypoglycemia eventually develop diabetes mellitus.

\section*{ULCEROGENIC TUMORS}

Some tumors of the islets of Langerhans are associated with hypersecretion of gastric acid that produces ulcers in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. The result is referred to as ZollingerEllison syndrome. The hypersecretion is so great that even after partial gastric resection, enough acid is produced to cause further ulceration. When a marked tendency to develop gastric and duodenal ulcers is noted, an ulcerogenic tumor of the islets of Langerhans is considered.

These tumors, which may be benign or malignant, are treated, when possible, by excision. Frequently, however, because of extension beyond the pancreas, removal is not possible. In many patients, a total gastrectomy may be necessary to reduce the secretion of gastric acid sufficiently to prevent further ulceration.

Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by elevated levels of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both (American Diabetes Association [ADA], Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Normally a certain amount of glucose circulates in the blood. The major sources of this glucose are absorption of ingested food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and formation of glucose by the liver from food substances.

Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, controls the level of glucose in the blood by regulating the production and storage of glucose. In the diabetic state, the cells may stop responding to insulin or the pancreas may stop producing insulin entirely. This leads to hyperglycemia, which may result in acute metabolic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). Long-term effects of hyperglycemia contribute to macrovascular complications (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease), chronic microvascular complications (kidney and eye disease), and neuropathic complications (diseases of the nerves).

Diabetes mellitus affects about 17 million people, 5.9 million of whom are undiagnosed. In the United States, approximately 800,000 new cases of diabetes are diagnosed yearly (Mokdad et al.,
2000). Diabetes is especially prevalent in the elderly, with up to $50 \%$ of people older than 65 suffering some degree of glucose intolerance. Among adults in the United States, diagnosed cases of diabetes increased $49 \%$ from 1990 to 2000, and similar increases are expected to continue (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2002).

Minority groups share a disproportionate burden of diabetes compared to non-minority groups. African-Americans and other racial and ethnic groups (Native Americans and persons of Hispanic origin) are more likely than Caucasians to develop diabetes and are at greater risk for many of the complications and higher death rates due to diabetes than Caucasians (U.S. Public Health Service [USPHS], 2000; CDC, 2002). Chart 41-1 summarizes other risk factors for diabetes mellitus.

The far-reaching and devastating physical, social, and economic consequences of diabetes are as follows:
- In the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations, blindness among working-age adults, and end-stage renal disease (USPHS, 2000).
- Diabetes is the third leading cause of death by disease, primarily because of the high rate of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) among people with diabetes.
alpha glucosidase inhibitor: a category of oral agents used to treat type 2 diabetes that delay the absorption of carbohydrate, resulting in lower postprandial blood glucose levels
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a small device that delivers insulin on a 24 -hour basis as basal insulin; it is also programmed by the patient to deliver a bolus dose before eating a meal in an attempt to mimic normal pancreatic function
diabetes mellitus: a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): a metabolic derangement in type 1 diabetes that results from a deficiency of insulin. Highly acidic ketone bodies are formed, resulting in acidosis; usually requires hospitalization for treatment and is usually caused by nonadherence to the insulin regimen, concurrent illness, or infection.
fasting plasma glucose (FPG): blood glucose determination obtained in the laboratory after fasting for more than 8 hours. Although plasma levels are specified in diagnostic criteria, blood glucose levels, which are slightly higher than plasma levels, are more commonly used.
glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ ): a long-term measure of glucose control that is a result of glucose attaching to hemoglobin for the life of the red blood cell ( 120 days). The goal of diabetes therapy is a normal to near-normal level of glycosy-
lated hemoglobin (referred to as $\mathrm{HgbA}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ or A1C), the same as in the nondiabetic population.
hyperglycemia: elevated blood glucose level-fasting level greater than $110 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(6.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$; 2-hour postprandial level greater than $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $7.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ )
hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS): a metabolic disorder of type 2 diabetes resulting from a relative insulin deficiency initiated by an intercurrent illness that raises the demand for insulin; associated with polyuria and severe dehydration
hypoglycemia: low blood glucose level (less than $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ [less than $2.7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ])
insulin: a hormone secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas that is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats; a deficiency of insulin results in diabetes mellitus
impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): a metabolic stage intermediate between normal glucose homeostasis and diabetes; not clinical entities in their own right but risk factors for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease
islet cell transplant: an investigational procedure in which purified islet cells from cadaver donors are injected into the portal vein of the liver, with the goal of having these cells secrete insulin and cure type 1 diabetes.
ketone: a highly acidic substance formed when the liver breaks down free fatty acids in the absence of insulin. The result is diabetic ketoacidosis.
nephropathy: a long-term complication of diabetes in which the kidney cells are damaged; characterized by microalbuminuria in early stages and progressing to endstage renal disease
neuropathy: a long-term complication of diabetes resulting from damage to the nerve cell.
retinopathy: a long-term complication of diabetes in which the microvascular system of the eye is damaged
self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG): a method of capillary blood glucose testing in which the patient pricks his/her finger and applies a drop of blood to a test strip that is read by a meter
sulfonylurea: a classification of oral antidiabetic medication for treating type 2 diabetes; enhances insulin secretion and insulin action
thiazolidinedione: a class of oral antidiabetic medications that reduce insulin resistance in target tissues, enhancing insulin action without directly stimulating insulin secretion
type 1 diabetes: a metabolic disorder characterized by an absence of insulin production and secretion from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Formerly called insulin-dependent, juvenile or type I diabetes.
type 2 diabetes: a metabolic disorder characterized by the relative deficiency of insulin production and a decreased insulin action and increased insulin resistance. Formerly called non-insulin-dependent, adult-onset, or type II diabetes.

- Hospitalization rates for people with diabetes are 2.4 times greater for adults and 5.3 times greater for children than for the general population.

The economic cost of diabetes continues to rise because of increasing health care costs and an aging population. Half of all people who have diabetes and who are older than 65 are hospitalized each year, and severe and life-threatening complications often contribute to the increased rates of hospitalization. Costs related to diabetes are estimated to be almost $\$ 100$ billion annually, including direct medical care expenses and indirect costs attributable to disability and premature death (CDC, 2002).

The primary goals of treatment for patients with diabetes include controlling blood glucose levels and preventing acute and long-term complications. Thus, the nurse who cares for diabetic patients must assist them to develop self-care management skills.

\section*{Classification of Diabetes}

There are several different types of diabetes mellitus; they may differ in cause, clinical course, and treatment. The major classifications of diabetes are:
- Type 1 diabetes (previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus)
- Type 2 diabetes (previously referred to as non-insulindependent diabetes mellitus)
- Gestational diabetes mellitus (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003)
- Diabetes mellitus associated with other conditions or syndromes

\section*{OVERVIEW}

The terms "insulin-dependent diabetes" and "non-insulindependent diabetes" and their acronyms (IDDM and NIDDM, respectively) are no longer used because they have resulted in classification of patients on the basis of the treatment of their diabetes rather than the underlying etiology. Use of Roman numerals (type I and type II) to distinguish between the two types has been changed to type 1 and type 2 to reduce confusion (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

Approximately 5\% to 10\% of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes, in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune process. As a result, they produce little or no insulin and require insulin injections to control their blood glucose levels. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by an acute onset, usually before age 30 (CDC, Diabetes Surveillance, 1999).

Approximately $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes (CDC, Data Factsheet, 2002), which results from decreased sensitivity to insulin (called insulin resistance) and impaired beta cell functioning resulting in decreased insulin production (Quinn, 2001a). Type 2 diabetes is first treated with diet and exercise. If elevated glucose levels persist, diet and exercise are supplemented with oral hypoglycemic agents. In some individuals with type 2 diabetes, oral agents do not control hyperglycemia, and insulin injections are required. In addition, some individuals whose type 2 diabetes can usually be controlled with diet, exercise, and oral agents may require insulin injections during periods of acute physiologic stress (eg, illness or surgery). Type 2 diabetes occurs more among people who are older than 30 years and obese (Diabetes Information Clearing House, 2001).

Diabetes complications may develop in any person with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, not only in patients who take insulin. Some patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with oral medications may have the impression that they do not really have diabetes or that they simply have "borderline" diabetes. They may believe that, compared with diabetic patients who require insulin injections, their diabetes is not a serious problem. It is important for the nurse to emphasize to these individuals that they do have diabetes and not a borderline problem with sugar (glucose). Borderline diabetes is classified as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and refers to a condition in which blood glucose levels fall between normal levels and levels considered diagnostic for diabetes.

Table 41-1 summarizes the major classifications of diabetes, current terminology, old labels, and major clinical characteristics. This classification system is dynamic in two ways. First, research findings suggest many differences among individuals within each category. Second, except for those with type 1 diabetes, patients may move from one category to another. For example, a woman with gestational diabetes may, after delivery, move into the type 2 category. These types also differ in their etiology, clinical course, and management.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETES}

Insulin is secreted by beta cells, which are one of four types of cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Insulin is an anabolic, or storage, hormone. When a person eats a meal, insulin secretion increases and moves glucose from the blood into muscle, liver, and fat cells. In those cells, insulin:
- Transports and metabolizes glucose for energy
- Stimulates storage of glucose in the liver and muscle (in the form of glycogen)
- Signals the liver to stop the release of glucose
- Enhances storage of dietary fat in adipose tissue
- Accelerates transport of amino acids (derived from dietary protein) into cells

Insulin also inhibits the breakdown of stored glucose, protein, and fat.

During fasting periods (between meals and overnight), the pancreas continuously releases a small amount of insulin (basal

insulin); another pancreatic hormone called glucagon (secreted by the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans) is released when blood glucose levels decrease and stimulate the liver to release stored glucose. The insulin and the glucagon together maintain a constant level of glucose in the blood by stimulating the release of glucose from the liver.

Initially, the liver produces glucose through the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis). After 8 to 12 hours without food, the liver forms glucose from the breakdown of noncarbohydrate substances, including amino acids (gluconeogenesis).

\section*{TYPE 1 DIABETES}

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. It is thought that combined genetic, immunologic, and possibly environmental (eg, viral) factors contribute to beta cell destruction. Although the events that lead to beta cell destruction are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that a genetic susceptibility is a common underlying factor in the development of type 1 diabetes. People do not inherit type 1 diabetes itself; rather, they inherit a genetic predisposition, or tendency, toward developing type 1 diabetes. This genetic tendency has been found in people with certain HLA (human leukocyte antigen) types. HLA refers to a cluster of genes responsible for transplantation antigens and other immune processes. About 95\% of Caucasians with type 1 diabetes exhibit specific HLA types (DR3 or DR4). The risk of developing type 1 diabetes is increased three to five times in people who have one of these two HLA types. The risk increases 10 to 20 times in people who have both DR3 and DR4 HLA types (as compared with the general population). Immune-mediated diabetes commonly develops during childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

There is also evidence of an autoimmune response in type 1 diabetes. This is an abnormal response in which antibodies are directed against normal tissues of the body, responding to these tissues as if they are foreign. Autoantibodies against islet cells and against endogenous (internal) insulin have been detected in people at the time of diagnosis and even several years before the development of clinical signs of type 1 diabetes. In addition to genetic and immunologic components, environmental factors, such as viruses or toxins, that may initiate destruction of the beta cell are being investigated.

Regardless of the specific etiology, the destruction of the beta cells results in decreased insulin production, unchecked glucose production by the liver, and fasting hyperglycemia. In addition, glucose derived from food cannot be stored in the liver but instead remains in the bloodstream and contributes to postprandial (after meals) hyperglycemia. If the concentration of glucose in the blood exceeds the renal threshold for glucose, usually 180 to $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 9.9 to $11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), the kidneys may not reabsorb all of the filtered glucose; the glucose then appears in the urine (glucosuria). When excess glucose is excreted in the urine, it is accompanied by excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes. This is called osmotic diuresis.

Because insulin normally inhibits glycogenolysis (breakdown of stored glucose) and gluconeogenesis (production of new glucose from amino acids and other substrates), in people with insulin deficiency, these processes occur in an unrestrained fashion and contribute further to hyperglycemia. In addition, fat breakdown occurs, resulting in an increased production of ketone bodies, which are the byproducts of fat breakdown.

> NURSING ALERT Ketone bodies are acids that disturb the acid-base balance of the body when they accumulate in excessive amounts. The resulting DKA may cause signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation, a fruity breath odor, and, if left untreated, altered level of consciousness, coma, and death. Initiation of insulin treatment, along with fluid and electrolytes as needed, is essential to treat hyperglycemia and DKA and rapidly improves the metabolic abnormalities.

\section*{TYPE 2 DIABETES}

The two main problems related to insulin in type 2 diabetes are insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Insulin resistance refers to a decreased tissue sensitivity to insulin. Normally, insulin binds to special receptors on cell surfaces and initiates a series of reactions involved in glucose metabolism. In type 2 diabetes, these intracellular reactions are diminished, thus rendering insulin less effective at stimulating glucose uptake by the tissues and at regulating glucose release by the liver (Fig. 41-1). The exact mechanisms that lead to insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes are unknown, although genetic factors are thought to play a role.

To overcome insulin resistance and to prevent the buildup of glucose in the blood, increased amounts of insulin must be secreted to maintain the glucose level at a normal or slightly elevated level. However, if the beta cells cannot keep up with the increased demand for insulin, the glucose level rises, and type 2 diabetes develops.

Despite the impaired insulin secretion that is characteristic of type 2 diabetes, there is enough insulin present to prevent the breakdown of fat and the accompanying production of ketone bodies. Therefore, DKA does not typically occur in type 2 diabetes. Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes may, however, lead to another acute problem, HHNS (see later discussion).

\caption{FIGURE 41-1 Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.}
\end{figure}

Type 2 diabetes occurs most commonly in people older than 30 years who are obese, although its incidence is increasing in younger adults (CDC, Diabetes Surveillance, 2002). Because it is associated with a slow (over years), progressive glucose intolerance, the onset of type 2 diabetes may go undetected for many years. If symptoms are experienced, they are frequently mild and may include fatigue, irritability, polyuria, polydipsia, skin wounds that heal poorly, vaginal infections, or blurred vision (if glucose levels are very high).

For most patients (approximately $75 \%$ ), type 2 diabetes is detected incidentally (eg, when routine laboratory tests or ophthalmoscopic examinations are performed). One consequence of undetected diabetes is that long-term diabetes complications (eg, eye disease, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease) may have developed before the actual diagnosis of diabetes is made (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

Because insulin resistance is associated with obesity, the primary treatment of type 2 diabetes is weight loss. Exercise is also important in enhancing the effectiveness of insulin. Oral antidiabetic agents may be added if diet and exercise are not successful in controlling blood glucose levels. If maximum doses of a single category of oral agents fail to reduce glucose levels to satisfactory levels, additional oral agents may be used. Insulin may be added to oral agent therapy, or patients may move to insulin therapy entirely. Some patients require insulin on an ongoing basis, and others may require insulin on a temporary basis during periods of acute physiologic stress, such as illness or surgery.

A recent report has demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed in persons at high risk for the disease through weight reduction and increased participation in moderate exercise (Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2002). Metformin, one of the antidiabetic agents, also prevented or delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes, but to a lesser degree. The findings of this study support the role that weight reduction and exercise have in the prevention of type 2 diabetes (Chart 41-2).

\section*{GESTATIONAL DIABETES}

Gestational diabetes is any degree of glucose intolerance with its onset during pregnancy. Hyperglycemia develops during pregnancy because of the secretion of placental hormones, which causes insulin resistance. For women who meet one or more of the following criteria, selective screening for diabetes during pregnancy is now being recommended between the 24th and 28th weeks of gestation: age 25 years or older; age 25 years or younger and obese; family history of diabetes in first-degree relatives; or member of an ethnic/racial group with a high prevalence of diabetes (eg, Hispanic American, Native American, Asian American, African American, or Pacific Islander).

Gestational diabetes occurs in up to $14 \%$ of pregnant women and increases their risk for hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (ADA, Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Initial management includes dietary modification and blood glucose monitoring. If hyperglycemia persists, insulin is prescribed. Oral antidiabetic agents should not be used during pregnancy. Goals for blood glucose levels during pregnancy are $105 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(5.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or less before meals and $120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(6.7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or less 2 hours after meals (ADA, Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

After delivery of the infant, blood glucose levels in the woman with gestational diabetes return to normal. However, many women who have had gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Therefore, all women who have had gestational diabetes should be counseled to maintain their ideal body weight and to exercise regularly to reduce their risk for type 2 diabetes (ADA, Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

Clinical manifestations of all types of diabetes include the "three Ps": polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. Polyuria (increased urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst) occur as a result of the excess loss of fluid associated with osmotic diuresis. The patient also experiences polyphagia (increased appetite) resulting from the catabolic state induced by insulin deficiency and the breakdown of proteins and fats. Other symptoms include fatigue and weakness, sudden vision changes, tingling or numbness in hands or feet, dry skin, skin lesions or wounds that are slow to heal, and recurrent infections. The onset of type 1 diabetes may also be associated with sudden weight loss or nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pains, if DKA has developed.

\section*{ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS}

An abnormally high blood glucose level is the basic criterion for the diabetes diagnosis. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels of $126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $7.0 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or more or random plasma glucose levels exceeding $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ on more than one occasion are diagnostic of diabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test and the intravenous glucose tolerance test are no longer recommended for routine clinical use. See Chart 41-3 for the ADA's diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

Plasma glucose values may be $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ higher than whole blood values, which are obtained with finger sticks (Porth, 2002). In addition to the assessment and diagnostic evaluation performed to diagnose diabetes, ongoing specialized assessment of patients with known diabetes and evaluation for complications in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes are important components of care. Parameters that should be regularly assessed are discussed in Chart 41-4.

\section*{Criteria for the Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus}
1. Symptoms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration equal to or greater than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. Casual is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. The classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.

\section*{or}
2. Fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to $126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $7.0 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours.

\section*{or}
3. 2-hour postload glucose equal to or greater than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) during an oral glucose tolerance test. The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.
In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation, these criteria should be confirmed by repeat testing on a different day. The third measure is not recommended for routine clinical use.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elevated blood glucose levels appear to be age-related and occur in both men and women throughout the world. Elevated blood glucose levels commonly appear in the fifth decade of life and increase in frequency with advancing age. When elderly people with overt diabetes are excluded from the statistics, approximately $10 \%$ to $30 \%$ of elderly people have age-related hyperglycemia. What causes age-related changes in carbohydrate metabolism is
unresolved. Possibilities include poor diet, physical inactivity, a decrease in the lean body mass in which ingested carbohydrate may be stored, altered insulin secretion, and increase in fat tissue, which increases insulin resistance.

\section*{Diabetes Management}

The main goal of diabetes treatment is to normalize insulin activity and blood glucose levels to reduce the development of vascular and neuropathic complications. The importance of tight blood glucose control was demonstrated by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a 10-year prospective clinical trial conducted from 1983 to 1993. The trial investigated the impact of intensive glucose control on the development and progression of complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. A cohort of 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to conventional treatment (one or two insulin injections per day) or intensive treatment (three or four insulin injections per day or insulin pump therapy plus frequent blood glucose monitoring and weekly contacts with diabetes educators). Results demonstrated that the risk for developing retinopathy, neuropathy, and early signs of nephropathy (microalbuminuria and albuminuria) was dramatically reduced. The reduction was attributed to control of blood glucose levels to normal or nearnormal levels. The ADA now recommends that all patients with diabetes strive for glucose control to reduce their risks for complications (ADA, Implications of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, 2003).

The major adverse effect of intensive therapy was a threefold increase in the incidence of severe hypoglycemia (severe enough to require assistance from another person), coma, or seizure. Because of these adverse effects, intensive therapy must be initiated with caution and must be accompanied by thorough education of the patient and family and by responsible behavior of the patient. Careful screening of patients is a key step in initiating intensive therapy.

A study conducted in the United Kingdom and reported in 1998 supported the results of the DCCT in type 2 diabetes and demonstrated a decrease in complications in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving intensive therapy compared to those receiving conventional therapy (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group [UKPDS], 1998; ADA, Implications of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, 2003).

Therefore, the therapeutic goal for diabetes management is to achieve normal blood glucose levels (euglycemia) without hypoglycemia and without seriously disrupting the patient's usual lifestyle and activity. There are five components of diabetes management (Fig. 41-2):
- Nutritional management
- Exercise
- Monitoring
- Pharmacologic therapy
- Education

Treatment varies because of changes in lifestyle and physical and emotional status as well as advances in treatment methods. Therefore, diabetes management involves constant assessment and modification of the treatment plan by health professionals and daily adjustments in therapy by the patient. Although the health care team directs the treatment, it is the patient who must manage the complex therapeutic regimen. For this reason, patient and family education is an essential component of diabetes treatment and is as important as all other components of the regimen.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT}

Nutrition, diet, and weight control are the foundation of diabetes management. The most important objective in the dietary and nutritional management of diabetes is control of total caloric intake to attain or maintain a reasonable body weight and control of blood glucose levels. Success of this alone is often associated with reversal of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. However, achieving this goal is not always easy. Because nutritional man-

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 41-2 The five components of diabetes management.}
\end{figure}
agement of diabetes is so complex, a registered dietitian who understands diabetes management has the major responsibility for this aspect of the therapeutic plan. However, the nurse and all other members of the health care team need to be knowledgeable about nutritional therapy and supportive of the patient who needs to implement dietary and lifestyle changes (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Nutritional management of the diabetic patient includes the following goals (ADA, Evidence-Based Nutrition Principles and Recommendations for the Treatment and Prevention of Diabetes and Related Complications, 2003):
- Providing all the essential food constituents (eg, vitamins, minerals) necessary for optimal nutrition
- Meeting energy needs
- Achieving and maintaining a reasonable weight
- Preventing wide daily fluctuations in blood glucose levels, with blood glucose levels as close to normal as is safe and practical to prevent or reduce the risk for complications
- Decreasing serum lipid levels, if elevated, to reduce the risk for macrovascular disease

For patients who require insulin to help control blood glucose levels, maintaining as much consistency as possible in the amount of calories and carbohydrates ingested at different meal times is essential. In addition, consistency in the approximate time intervals between meals, with the addition of snacks if necessary, helps in preventing hypoglycemic reactions and in maintaining overall blood glucose control.

For obese diabetic patients (especially those with type 2 diabetes), weight loss is the key to treatment. (It is also a major factor in preventing diabetes.) In general, overweight is considered to be a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29; obesity is defined as $20 \%$ above ideal body weight or a BMI equal to or greater than 30 (National Institutes of Health, 2000). BMI is a weight-to-height ratio calculated by dividing body weight (in kilograms) by the square of the height (in meters). Calculation of BMI is discussed in Chapter 5. Obesity is associated with an increased resistance to insulin; it is also a main factor in type 2 diabetes. Some obese patients who have type 2 diabetes and who require insulin or oral agents to control blood glucose levels may be able to reduce or eliminate the need for medication through weight loss. A weight loss as small as $10 \%$ of total weight may significantly improve blood glucose levels. For obese diabetic patients who do not take insulin, consistent meal content or timing is not as critical. Rather, decreasing the overall caloric intake assumes more importance. However, meals should not be skipped. Pacing food intake throughout the day places more manageable demands on the pancreas.

Long-term adherence to the meal plan is one of the most challenging aspects of diabetes management. For obese patients, it may be more realistic to restrict calories only moderately. For those who have lost weight, maintaining the weight loss may be difficult. To help these patients incorporate new dietary habits into their lifestyles, diet education, behavioral therapy, group support, and ongoing nutrition counseling are encouraged.

\section*{Meal Planning and Related Teaching}

For all patients with diabetes, the meal plan must consider the patient's food preferences, lifestyle, usual eating times, and ethnic and cultural background. For patients using intensive insulin therapy, there may be greater flexibility in the timing and content of meals by allowing adjustments in insulin dosage for changes in eating and exercise habits. Advances in insulin management (new

Hanna, K., \& Guthrie, D. (2001). The health-compromising behavior and diabetes mismanagement among adolescents and young adults with diabetes. Diabetes Educator, 27(2), 223-228.

\section*{Purpose}

Adolescence and young adulthood are periods often associated with health-compromising behaviors. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between health-compromising behavior, age, gender, and diabetes mismanagement in adolescents and young adults.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A correlational study was conducted; the sample included 107 adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Health-compromising behavior was measured by a 10 -item Problem Behavior Survey that assessed subjects' involvement with hard drugs, marijuana, alcohol, smoking/chewing tobacco, physical violence, fighting, carrying weapons, riding with a drinking driver, driving while drinking, and having sexual intercourse. Higher scores indicate higher levels of healthcompromising behavior. Diabetes mismanagement was measured using a 6 -item questionnaire that addressed glucose monitoring, diet, and insulin administration for the previous 10 days. Higher scores indicate higher levels of diabetes mismanagement. $\mathrm{HgbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ levels were used as indicators of metabolic control. The mean age of the sample was 17.4 ( $\mathrm{SD} \pm 3.2$ ); their ages ranged from 12 to 24 years. It was largely a Caucasian sample. Age since diagnosis of diabetes was 7 years and 5 months. Subjects reported a mean daily insulin dose of 1.0 units per kilogram of body weight. The mean $\mathrm{HgbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ of the sample was $8.9 \% . \mathrm{HgbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ values ranged from $5.1 \%$ to $16.6 \%$; the normal range of $\mathrm{HgbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ was $3.4 \%$ to $6.2 \%$.

\section*{Findings}

The mean scores on the diabetes mismanagement scale and the healthcompromising scale were below the medians and indicated relatively
low levels of diabetes mismanagement and health-compromising behaviors, respectively. Participants were categorized into two groups by scores on the health-compromising scale: those involved in health-compromising behavior and those not involved in such behavior. On multiple regression analysis, correlations were found of diabetes mismanagement with age ( $r=0.23, p=0.05$ ), female gender ( $r=0.24, \mathrm{p}=0.05$ ), and participation in health-compromising behaviors ( $r=0.32, p=0.001$ ). Additionally, there was a significant relationship ( $r=0.66, p=0.001$ ) between age and health-compromising behavior. Further analyses revealed that being female and having greater health-compromising behavior contributed to diabetes mismanagement; female subjects were found to have poorer metabolic control than males.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The results of this study reveal some issues important to nurses involved in the care of adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Participation in health-compromising behavior and gender are two of the many factors that affect diabetes management and metabolic control. Assessment of health-compromising behavior and diabetes mismanagement should be considered in nurses' assessment of adolescents and young adults with diabetes. Differentiating those adolescents and young adults who are involved in health-compromising behaviors and those who are not involved in those behaviors may provide information about those at risk for difficulty associated with management of diabetes. It is important to maintain open communication to determine if health-compromising behaviors are being practiced and to discuss these behaviors in a nonjudgmental way to decrease the risk for diabetes mismanagement.
insulin analogs, insulin algorithms, insulin pumps) permit greater flexibility of schedules than previously possible. This is in contrast to the older concept of maintaining a constant dose of insulin and requiring the patient to adjust his or her schedule to the actions and duration of the insulin.

The first step in preparing a meal plan is a thorough review of the patient's diet history to identify his or her eating habits and lifestyle. A thorough assessment of the patient's need for weight loss, gain, or maintenance is also undertaken. In most instances, the person with type 2 diabetes requires weight reduction.

In teaching about meal planning, the clinical dietitian uses various educational tools, materials, and approaches. Initial education addresses the importance of consistent eating habits, the relationship of food and insulin, and the provision of an individualized meal plan. In-depth follow-up education then focuses on management skills, such as eating at restaurants, reading food labels, and adjusting the meal plan for exercise, illness, and special occasions. The nurse plays an important role in communicating pertinent information to the dietitian and reinforcing the patient's understanding.

For some patients, certain aspects of meal planning, such as the food exchange system, may be difficult to learn. This may be related to limitations in the patient's intellectual level or to emotional issues, such as difficulty accepting the diagnosis of diabetes or feelings of deprivation and undue restriction in eating. In any case, it helps to emphasize that using the exchange system (or any food classification system) provides a new way of thinking about food rather than a new way of eating. It is also important to simplify information as much as possible and to
provide opportunities for the patient to practice and repeat activities and information.

\section*{CALORIC REQUIREMENTS}

Calorie-controlled diets are planned by first calculating the individual's energy needs and caloric requirements based on the patient's age, gender, height, and weight. An activity element is then factored in to provide the actual number of calories required for weight maintenance. To promote a 1 - to 2 -pound weight loss per week, 500 to 1,000 calories are subtracted from the daily total. The calories are distributed into carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and a meal plan is then developed.

The 1995 Exchange Lists for Meal Planning (ADA, 1995) are presented to the patient using the appropriate amount of calories, with strict diet adherence as the goal. Unfortunately, caloriecontrolled diets are often confusing and difficult to comply with. They require patients to measure precise portions and to eat specific foods and amounts at each meal and snack. In this instance, developing a meal plan based on the individual's usual eating habits and lifestyle may be a more realistic approach to glucose control and weight loss or weight maintenance. In both instances, the patient needs to work closely with a registered dietitian to assess current eating habits and to achieve realistic, individualized goals. The priority for a young patient with type 1 diabetes, for example, should be a diet with enough calories to maintain normal growth and development. Some patients may be underweight at the onset of type 1 diabetes because of rapid weight loss from severe hyperglycemia. The goal with these patients initially may be to provide a higher-calorie diet to regain lost weight.

\section*{CALORIC DISTRIBUTION}

A diabetic meal plan also focuses on the percentage of calories to come from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. In general, carbohydrate foods have the greatest effect on blood glucose levels because they are more quickly digested than other foods and are converted into glucose rapidly. Several decades ago it was recommended that diabetic diets contain more calories from protein and fat foods than from carbohydrates to reduce postprandial increases in blood glucose levels. However, this resulted in a dietary intake inconsistent with the goal of reducing the cardiovascular disease commonly associated with diabetes (ADA, Evidence-Based Nutrition Principles and Recommendations for the Treatment and Prevention of Diabetes and Related Complications, 2003).

Carbohydrates. The caloric distribution currently recommended is higher in carbohydrates than in fat and protein. However, research into the appropriateness of a higher-carbohydrate diet in patients with decreased glucose tolerance is ongoing, and recommendations may change accordingly. Currently, the ADA and the American Dietetic Association recommend that for all levels of caloric intake, $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of calories should be derived from carbohydrates, 20\% to 30\% from fat, and the remaining 10\% to $20 \%$ from protein. These recommendations are also consistent with those of the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (2000).

Carbohydrates consist of sugars and starches. Little scientific evidence supports the belief that sugars, such as sucrose, promote a greater blood glucose level compared to starches (eg, rice, pasta, or bread). Although low glycemic index diets (described below) may reduce postprandial glucose levels, there seem to be no clear effects on outcomes (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Thus, the latest nutrition guidelines recommend that all carbohydrates be eaten in moderation to avoid high postprandial blood glucose levels (ADA, Exchange Lists for Meal Planning, 1995). Foods high in carbohydrates, such as sucrose, are not eliminated from the diet but should be eaten in moderation (up to $10 \%$ of total calories) because these foods are typically high in fat and lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

Carbohydrate counting is another nutritional tool used for blood glucose management because carbohydrates are the main nutrients in food that influence blood glucose levels. This method provides flexibility in food choices, can be less complicated to understand than the diabetic food exchange list, and allows more accurate management with multiple daily injections (insulin before each meal). However, if carbohydrate counting is not used with other meal-planning techniques, weight gain can result. A variety of methods are used to count carbohydrates. When developing a diabetic meal plan using carbohydrate counting, all food sources should be considered. Once digested, $100 \%$ of carbohydrates are converted to glucose. However, approximately $50 \%$ of protein foods (meat, fish, and poultry) are also converted to glucose.

One method of carbohydrate counting includes counting grams of carbohydrates. If target goals are not reached by counting carbohydrates alone, protein will be factored into the calculations. This is especially true if the meal consists of only meat, fish, and non-starchy vegetables.

An alternative to counting grams of carbohydrate is measuring servings or choices. This method is used more often by people with type 2 diabetes. It is similar to the food exchange list and emphasizes portion control of total servings of carbohydrate at meals and snacks. One carbohydrate serving is equivalent to 15 g
of carbohydrate. Examples of one serving are an apple 2 inches in diameter and one slice of bread. Vegetables and meat are counted as one third of a carbohydrate serving.

Although carbohydrate counting is now commonly used for blood glucose management with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it is not a perfect system. All carbohydrates, to some extent, affect the blood glucose to different degrees, regardless of equivalent serving size.

Fats. The recommendations regarding fat content of the diabetic diet include both reducing the total percentage of calories from fat sources to less than $30 \%$ of the total calories and limiting the amount of saturated fats to $10 \%$ of total calories. Additional recommendations include limiting the total intake of dietary cholesterol to less than $300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. This approach may help to reduce risk factors such as elevated serum cholesterol levels, which are associated with the development of coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death and disability among people with diabetes.

The meal plan may include the use of some nonanimal sources of protein (eg, legumes and whole grains) to help reduce saturated fat and cholesterol intake. In addition, the amount of protein intake may be reduced in patients with early signs of renal disease.

Fiber. The use of fiber in diabetic diets has received increased attention as researchers study the effects on diabetes of a highcarbohydrate, high-fiber diet. This type of diet plays a role in lowering total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood. Increasing fiber in the diet may also improve blood glucose levels and decrease the need for exogenous insulin.

There are two types of dietary fibers: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber-in foods such as legumes, oats, and some fruitsplays more of a role in lowering blood glucose and lipid levels than does insoluble fiber, although the clinical significance of this effect is probably small (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Soluble fiber is thought to be related to the formation of a gel in the GI tract. This gel slows stomach emptying and the movement of food through the upper digestive tract. The potential glucose-lowering effect of fiber may be caused by the slower rate of glucose absorption from foods that contain soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber is found in whole-grain breads and cereals and in some vegetables. This type of fiber plays more of a role in increasing stool bulk and preventing constipation. Both insoluble and soluble fibers increase satiety, which is helpful for weight loss.

One risk involved in suddenly increasing fiber intake is that it may require adjusting the dosage of insulin or oral agents to prevent hypoglycemia. Other problems may include abdominal fullness, nausea, diarrhea, increased flatulence, and constipation if fluid intake is inadequate. If fiber is added to or increased in the meal plan, it should be done gradually and in consultation with a dietitian. The 1995 Exchange Lists for Meal Planning (ADA, 1995) is an excellent guide for increasing fiber intake. Fiber-rich food choices within the vegetable, fruit, and starch/bread exchanges are highlighted in the lists.

\section*{FOOD CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS}

To teach diet principles and to help patients in meal planning, several systems have been developed in which foods are organized into groups with common characteristics, such as number of calories, composition of foods (ie, amount of protein, fat, or carbohydrate in the food), or effect on blood glucose levels.

Exchange Lists. A commonly used tool for nutritional management is the Exchange Lists for Meal Planning (ADA, 1995).

There are six main exchange lists: bread/starch, vegetable, milk, meat, fruit, and fat. Foods included on one list (in the amounts specified) contain equal numbers of calories and are approximately equal in grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Meal plans (tailored to the patient's needs and preferences) are based on a recommended number of choices from each exchange list. Foods on one list may be interchanged with one another, allowing the patient to choose a variety while maintaining as much consistency as possible in the nutrient content of foods eaten. Table 41-2 presents three sample lunch menus that are interchangeable in terms of carbohydrate, protein, and fat content.

Exchange list information on combination foods, such as pizza, chili, and casseroles, and convenience foods, desserts, snack foods, and fast foods is available from the ADA. Some food manufacturers and restaurants publish exchange lists that describe their products as well. For more nutrition information, contact the ADA (see address at end of the chapter).

The Food Guide Pyramid. The Food Guide Pyramid is another tool used to develop meal plans. It is commonly used for patients with type 2 diabetes who have a difficult time complying with a calorie-controlled diet. The food pyramid consists of six food groups: (1) bread, cereal, rice, and pasta; (2) fruits; (3) vegetables; (4) meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; (5) milk, yogurt, and cheese; and (6) fats, oils, and sweets (see Chap. 5). The pyramid shape was chosen to emphasize that the foods in the largest area, the base of the pyramid (starches, fruits, and vegetables), are lowest in calories and fat and highest in fiber and should make up the basis of the diet. For those with diabetes, as well as for the general population, $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of the daily caloric intake should be from these three groups. As one moves up the pyramid, foods higher in fat (particularly saturated fat) are illustrated; these foods should account for a smaller percentage of the daily caloric intake. The very top of the pyramid comprises fats, oils, and sweets, foods that should be used sparingly by people with diabetes to obtain weight and blood glucose control and to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Reliance on the Food Guide Pyramid, however, may result in fluctuations in blood glucose levels because high-carbohydrate foods may be grouped with low-carbohydrate foods. The pyramid is appropriately used only as a first-step teaching tool (Dixon, Cronin, \& Krebs-Smith, 2001) for patients learning how to control food portions and how to identify which foods contain carbohydrate, protein, and fat.

Glycemic Index. One of the main goals of diet therapy in diabetes is to avoid sharp, rapid increases in blood glucose levels after food is eaten. The term "glycemic index" is used to describe how
much a given food raises the blood glucose level compared with an equivalent amount of glucose; however, the effects on blood glucose levels and on long-term patient outcomes have been questioned (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Although more research is necessary, the following guidelines can be helpful when making dietary recommendations:
- Combining starchy foods with protein- and fat-containing foods tends to slow their absorption and lower the glycemic response.
- In general, eating foods that are raw and whole results in a lower glycemic response than eating chopped, puréed, or cooked foods.
- Eating whole fruit instead of drinking juice decreases the glycemic response because fiber in the fruit slows absorption.
- Adding foods with sugars to the diet may produce a lower glycemic response if these foods are eaten with foods that are more slowly absorbed.
Patients can create their own glycemic index by monitoring their blood glucose level after ingesting a particular food. This can help patients improve blood glucose levels through individualized manipulation of the diet. Many patients who use frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels can use this information to adjust their insulin doses for variations in food intake.

\section*{Other Dietary Concerns}

\section*{ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION}

Patients with diabetes do not need to give up alcoholic beverages entirely, but patients and health care professionals need to be aware of the potential adverse effects of alcohol specific to diabetes. In general, the same precautions regarding the use of alcohol by people without diabetes should be applied to patients with diabetes. Moderation is recommended. The main danger of alcohol consumption by a diabetic patient is hypoglycemia, especially for patients who take insulin. Alcohol may decrease the normal physiologic reactions in the body that produce glucose (gluconeogenesis). Thus, if a diabetic patient takes alcohol on an empty stomach, there is an increased likelihood that hypoglycemia will develop. In addition, excessive alcohol intake may impair the patient's ability to recognize and treat hypoglycemia and to follow a prescribed meal plan to prevent hypoglycemia. To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, the patient should be cautioned to eat while drinking alcohol (ADA, Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 41-2 - Selected Sample Menus from Exchange Lists}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline EXCHANGES & SAMPLE LUNCH \#1 & SAMPLE LUNCH \#2 & SAMPLE LUNCH \#3 \\
\hline 2 starch & 2 slices bread & Hamburger bun & 1 cup cooked pasta \\
\hline 3 meat & 2 oz sliced turkey and 1 oz lowfat cheese & 3 oz lean beef patty & 3 oz boiled shrimp \\
\hline 1 vegetable & Lettuce, tomato, onion & Green salad & 1/2 cup plum tomatoes \\
\hline 1 fat & 1 tsp mayonnaise & 1 tbsp salad dressing & 1 tsp olive oil \\
\hline 1 fruit & 1 medium apple & 11/4 cup watermelon & 11/4 cup fresh strawberries \\

\hline & Mustard, pickle, hot pepper & 1 tbsp catsup, pickle, onions & Garlic, basil \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For the person with type 2 diabetes treated with the sulfonylurea agent chlorpropamide (Diabinese), a potential side effect of alcohol consumption is a disulfiram (Antabuse) type of reaction, which involves facial flushing, warmth, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating, or thirst within minutes of consuming alcohol. The intensity of the reaction depends on the amount of alcohol consumed; the reaction seems to be less common with other sulfonylureas.

Alcohol consumption may lead to excessive weight gain (from the high caloric content of alcohol), hyperlipidemia, and elevated glucose levels (especially with mixed drinks and liqueurs).

Patient teaching regarding alcohol intake must emphasize moderation in the amount of alcohol consumed. Lower-calorie or less sweet drinks, such as light beer or dry wine, and food intake along with alcohol consumption are advised. For patients with type 2 diabetes especially, incorporating the calories from alcohol into the overall meal plan is important for weight control.

\section*{SWEETENERS}

Using sweeteners is acceptable for patients with diabetes, especially if it assists in overall dietary adherence. Moderation in the amount of sweetener used is encouraged to avoid potential adverse effects. There are two main types of sweeteners: nutritive and non-nutritive. The nutritive sweeteners contain calories, and the non-nutritive sweeteners have few or no calories in the amounts normally used.

Nutritive sweeteners include fructose (fruit sugar), sorbitol, and xylitol. They are not calorie-free; they provide calories in amounts similar to those in sucrose (table sugar). They cause less elevation in blood sugar levels than sucrose and are often used in "sugar-free" foods. Sweeteners containing sorbitol may have a laxative effect.

Non-nutritive sweeteners have minimal or no calories. They are used in food products and are also available for table use. They produce minimal or no elevation in blood glucose levels and have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe for people with diabetes. Saccharin contains no calories. Aspartame (NutraSweet) is packaged with dextrose; it contains 4 calories per packet and loses sweetness with heat. Acesulfame-K (Sunnette) is also packaged with dextrose; it contains 1 calorie per packet. Sucralose (Splenda) is a newer non-nutritive, high-intensity sweetener that is about 600 times sweeter than sugar. The Food and Drug Administration has approved it for use in baked goods, nonalcoholic beverages, chewing gum, coffee, confections, frostings, and frozen dairy products.

\section*{MISLEADING FOOD LABELS}

Foods labeled "sugarless" or "sugar-free" may still provide calories equal to those of the equivalent sugar-containing products if they are made with nutritive sweeteners. Thus, for weight loss, these products may not always be useful. In addition, patients must not consider them "free" foods to be eaten in unlimited quantity, because they may elevate blood glucose levels.

Foods labeled "dietetic" are not necessarily reduced-calorie foods. They may be lower in sodium or have other special dietary uses. Patients are advised that foods labeled "dietetic" may still contain significant amounts of sugar or fat.

Patients must also be taught to read the labels of "health foods"-especially snacks-because they often contain carbohydrates such as honey, brown sugar, and corn syrup. In addition, these supposedly healthy snacks frequently contain saturated vegetable fats (eg, coconut or palm oil), hydrogenated vegetable
fats, or animal fats, which may be contraindicated in patients with elevated blood lipid levels.

\section*{EXERCISE}

\section*{Benefits}

Exercise is extremely important in managing diabetes because of its effects on lowering blood glucose and reducing cardiovascular risk factors. Exercise lowers the blood glucose level by increasing the uptake of glucose by body muscles and by improving insulin utilization. It also improves circulation and muscle tone. Resistance (strength) training, such as weight lifting, can increase lean muscle mass, thereby increasing the resting metabolic rate. These effects are useful in diabetes in relation to losing weight, easing stress, and maintaining a feeling of well-being. Exercise also alters blood lipid levels, increasing levels of high-density lipoproteins and decreasing total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This is especially important to the person with diabetes because of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Creviston \& Quinn, 2001). General guidelines for exercise in diabetes are presented in Chart 41-5.

\section*{Exercise Precautions}

Patients who have blood glucose levels exceeding $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} (14 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ and who have ketones in their urine should not begin exercising until the urine tests negative for ketones and the blood glucose level is closer to normal. Exercising with elevated blood glucose levels increases the secretion of glucagon, growth hormone, and catecholamines. The liver then releases more glucose, and the result is an increase in the blood glucose level (ADA, Physical Activity/Exercise and Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

The physiologic decrease in circulating insulin that normally occurs with exercise cannot occur in patients treated with insulin. Initially, the patient who requires insulin should be taught to eat a 15-g carbohydrate snack (a fruit exchange) or a snack of complex carbohydrate with a protein before engaging in moderate exercise, to prevent unexpected hypoglycemia. The exact amount of food needed varies from person to person and should be determined by blood glucose monitoring. Some patients find that they do not require a pre-exercise snack if they exercise within 1 to 2 hours after a meal. Other patients may require extra food regardless of when they exercise. If extra food is required, it need not be deducted from the regular meal plan.

Another potential problem for patients who take insulin is hypoglycemia that occurs many hours after exercise. To avoid postexercise hypoglycemia, especially after strenuous or prolonged exercise, the patient may need to eat a snack at the end of the exercise session and at bedtime and monitor the blood glucose level

General Precautions for Exercise in Diabetics
- Use proper footwear and, if appropriate, other protective equipment.
- Avoid exercise in extreme heat or cold.
- Inspect feet daily after exercise.
- Avoid exercise during periods of poor metabolic control.
more frequently. In addition, it may be necessary to have the patient reduce the dosage of insulin that peaks at the time of exercise. Patients who are capable, knowledgeable, and responsible can learn to adjust their own insulin doses. Others need specific instructions on what to do when they exercise.

Patients participating in extended periods of exercise should test their blood glucose levels before, during, and after the exercise period, and they should snack on carbohydrates as needed to maintain blood glucose levels (ADA, Physical Activity/Exercise and Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Other participants or observers should be aware that the person exercising has diabetes, and they should know what assistance to give if severe hypoglycemia occurs.

In obese people with type 2 diabetes, exercise in addition to dietary management both improves glucose metabolism and enhances loss of body fat. Exercise coupled with weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and may decrease the need for insulin or oral agents. Eventually, the patient's glucose tolerance may return to normal. The patient with type 2 diabetes who is not taking insulin or an oral agent may not need extra food before exercise.

\section*{Exercise Recommendations}

People with diabetes should exercise at the same time (preferably when blood glucose levels are at their peak) and in the same amount each day. Regular daily exercise, rather than sporadic exercise, should be encouraged. Exercise recommendations must be altered as necessary for patients with diabetic complications such as retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, sensorimotor neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (ADA, Physical Activity/Exercise and Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Increased blood pressure associated with exercise may aggravate diabetic retinopathy and increase the risk of a hemorrhage into the vitreous or retina. Patients with ischemic heart disease risk triggering angina or a myocardial infarction, which may be silent. Avoiding trauma to the lower extremities is especially important in the patient with numbness related to neuropathy.

In general, a slow, gradual increase in the exercise period is encouraged. For many patients, walking is a safe and beneficial form of exercise that requires no special equipment (except for proper shoes) and can be performed anywhere. People with diabetes should discuss an exercise program with their physician and undergo a careful medical evaluation with appropriate diagnostic studies before beginning an exercise program (ADA, Physical Activity/Exercise and Diabetes Mellitus, 2003; Creviston \& Quinn, 2001; Flood \& Constance, 2002).

For patients who are older than 30 years and who have two or more risk factors for heart disease, an exercise stress test is recommended. Risk factors for heart disease include hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol levels, abnormal resting electrocardiogram, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, male gender, and a family history of heart disease.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Physical activity that is consistent and realistic is beneficial to the elderly person with diabetes. Physical fitness in the elderly population with diabetes may lead to less chronic vascular disease and an improved quality of life (ADA, Physical Activity/Exercise and Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). Advantages of exercise in this population include a decrease in hyperglycemia, a general sense of wellbeing, and the use of ingested calories, resulting in weight reduction. Because there is an increased incidence of cardiovascular problems in the elderly, a pattern of gradual, consistent exercise should be planned that does not exceed the patient's physical
capacity. Physical impairment from other chronic diseases must also be considered. In some cases a physical therapy evaluation may be warranted with the goal of determining exercises specific to the patient's needs and abilities. Tools such as the "Armchair Fitness" video may be helpful. For more information about agerelated changes that affect diabetes management see Chart 41-6.

\section*{MONITORING GLUCOSE LEVELS AND KETONES}

Blood glucose monitoring is a cornerstone of diabetes management, and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) levels by patients has dramatically altered diabetes care. Frequent SMBG enables people with diabetes to adjust the treatment regimen to obtain optimal blood glucose control. This allows for detection and prevention of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and plays a crucial role in normalizing blood glucose levels, which in turn may reduce the risk of long-term diabetic complications.

Various SMBG methods are available. Most involve obtaining a drop of blood from the fingertip, applying the blood to a special reagent strip, and allowing the blood to stay on the strip for the amount of time specified by the manufacturer (usually 5 to 30 seconds). The meter gives a digital readout of the blood glucose value.

}

The meters available for SMBG offer different features and benefits. Newer monitors have eliminated the step of blood removal from the strip. The strip is placed in the meter first, before blood is applied to it. Once the blood is placed on the strip, it remains there for the duration of the test. The meter automatically displays the blood glucose level after a short time (less than 1 minute). Some meters are biosensors that use blood obtained from alternate test sites, such as the forearm. They have a special lancing device that is useful for patients who have painful fingertips or pain with finger sticks.

Some meters can be used by patients with visual impairments. They have audio components that assist the patient in performing the test and obtaining the result. In addition, meters are available to check both blood glucose and blood ketone levels by those who are particularly susceptible to development of DKA.

\section*{Advantages and Disadvantages of SMBG Systems}

The monitoring method used by the patient must match his or her skill level. Factors affecting SMBG performance include visual acuity, fine motor coordination, cognitive ability, comfort with technology, willingness, and cost.

Visual methods are the least expensive and require less equipment. However, they require the ability to distinguish colors and to be exact in timing the procedures. Further, they involve subjective interpretation of results. Monitoring blood glucose using meters is recommended because meters have become much less expensive and less technique-dependent, making the results more accurate. Referral to a social worker may be warranted to assist individuals without the financial means to purchase a meter.

Older meters that required removal of blood from the reagent strip are generally obsolete. These procedures have more steps that must be performed in an exact sequence. The newer meters that do not require removal of blood from the strip generally are easier to use. However, most do not provide a backup method for visually assessing the meter results. Figure 41-3 illustrates a system for glucose monitoring.

A potential hazard of all SMBG methods is that the patient may obtain and report erroneous blood glucose values as a result of using incorrect techniques. Some common sources of error include:
- Improper application of blood (eg, drop too small)
- Improper meter cleaning and maintenance (eg, allowing dust or blood to accumulate on the optic window). This is not an issue in the biosensor type of meter.
- Damage to the reagent strips by heat or humidity; use of outdated strips

The nurse plays an important role in providing initial teaching about SMBG techniques. Equally important is evaluating the techniques of patients who are experienced in self-monitoring. Patients should be discouraged from purchasing SMBG products from stores or catalogs that do not provide direct education. Every 6 to 12 months, patients should conduct a comparison of their meter with a simultaneous laboratory-measured blood glucose level in their physician's office. The accuracy of the meter and strips should also be assessed with control solutions specific to that meter whenever a new vial of strips is used or whenever the validity of the reading is in doubt.

\section*{Candidates for SMBG}

For everyone with diabetes, SMBG is useful for managing selfcare. It is a key component of treatment for any intensive insulin therapy regimen (including two to four injections per day or insulin pumps) and for diabetes management during pregnancy. It is also recommended for patients with:
- Unstable diabetes
- A tendency for severe ketosis or hypoglycemia
- Hypoglycemia without warning symptoms

For patients not taking insulin, SMBG is helpful for monitoring the effectiveness of exercise, diet, and oral antidiabetic agents. It can also help motivate patients to continue with treatment. For patients with type 2 diabetes, SMBG is recommended during periods of suspected hyperglycemia (eg, illness) or hypoglycemia (eg, unusual increased activity levels) (ADA, Physical Activity/Exercise and Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

\section*{Frequency of SMBG}

For most patients who require insulin, SMBG is recommended two to four times daily (usually before meals and at bedtime). For patients who take insulin before each meal, SMBG is required at least three times daily before meals to determine each dose (ADA, Tests of Glycemia in Diabetes, 2002). Patients not receiving insulin may be instructed to assess their blood glucose levels at least two or three times per week, including a 2-hour postprandial test. For all patients, testing is recommended whenever hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia is suspected. The patient should increase the frequency of SMBG with changes in medications, activity, or diet and with stress or illness.

\section*{Responding to SMBG Results}

Patients are instructed to keep a record or logbook of blood glucose levels so that they can detect patterns. Testing is done at the peak action time of the medication to evaluate the need for dosage adjustments. To evaluate basal insulin and determine bolus insulin doses, testing is performed before meals. To titrate bolus insulin doses, regular or lispro, testing is done 2 hours after meals. Patients with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to test before and 2 hours after the largest meal of the day. Patients who take insulin at bedtime or who are on an insulin infusion pump must also test at 3 a.m. once a week to document that the blood glucose level is not decreasing during the night. If a patient is unwilling or cannot afford to test frequently, then once or twice a day may be sufficient if the patient varies the time of day to test (eg, before breakfast one day, before lunch the next day).

A tendency to discontinue SMBG is more likely to occur when patients do not receive instruction about using the results to alter their treatment regimen. Instructions vary according to the patient's understanding and the physician's philosophy of diabetes management. At the very least, patients should be given parameters for calling the physician. Patients using intensive insulin therapy regimens may be instructed in the use of algorithms (rules or decision trees) for changing the insulin doses based on patterns of values greater or less than the target range and the amount of carbohydrate to be consumed. Baseline patterns should be established by SMBG for 1 to 2 weeks.

\section*{Glycosylated Hemoglobin}

Glycosylated hemoglobin (referred to as $\mathrm{HgbA}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ or A 1 C ) is a blood test that reflects average blood glucose levels over a period of approximately 2 to 3 months (ADA, Tests of Glycemia in Diabetes, 2003). When blood glucose levels are elevated, glucose molecules attach to hemoglobin in the red blood cell. The longer the amount of glucose in the blood remains above normal, the more glucose binds to the red blood cell and the higher the glycosylated hemoglobin level. This complex (the hemoglobin attached to the glucose) is permanent and lasts for the life of the red blood cell, approximately 120 days. If near-normal blood glucose levels are maintained, with only occasional increases in blood glucose, the overall value will not be greatly elevated. However, if the blood glucose values are consistently high, then the test result will also be elevated. If patients report mostly normal SMBG results but the glycosylated hemoglobin is high, there may be errors in the methods used for glucose monitoring, errors in recording results, or frequent elevations in glucose levels at times during the day when the patient is not usually monitoring the blood.

Various tests measure the same thing but have different names, including hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ and hemoglobin A1. The normal values differ slightly from test to test and from laboratory to laboratory and normally range from $4 \%$ to $6 \%$. Values within the normal range indicate consistently near-normal blood glucose levels, a goal made easier by SMBG.

\section*{Urine Testing for Glucose}

Before SMBG methods were available, urine glucose testing was the only way to monitor diabetes on a daily basis. Today its use is limited to patients who cannot or will not perform SMBG. The advantages of urine glucose testing are that it is less expensive than SMBG and it is not invasive. The general procedure involves applying urine to a reagent strip or tablet and matching colors on the strip with a color chart at the end of a specified period.

Disadvantages of urine testing include the following:
- Results do not accurately reflect the blood glucose level at the time of the test.
- The renal threshold for glucose is 180 to $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 9.9 to $11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), far above target blood glucose levels.
- Hypoglycemia cannot be detected because a "negative" urine glucose result may occur when the blood glucose level ranges from 0 to $180 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(9.9 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or higher.
- Patients may have a false sense of being in good control when results are always negative.
- Various medications (eg, aspirin, vitamin C, some antibiotics) may interfere with test results.
- In elderly patients and patients with kidney disease, the renal threshold (the level of blood glucose at which glucose
starts to appear in the urine) is raised; thus, false-negative readings may occur at dangerously elevated glucose levels.

\section*{Testing for Ketones}

Ketones (or ketone bodies) in the urine signal that control of type 1 diabetes is deteriorating, and the risk of DKA is high. When there is almost no effective insulin available, the body starts to break down stored fat for energy. Ketone bodies are byproducts of this fat breakdown, and they accumulate in the blood and urine. Urine testing is the most common method used for self-testing of ketone bodies by patients. A meter that enables testing of blood for ketones is available but not widely used.

Most commonly, patients use a urine dipstick (Ketostix or Chemstrip uK ) to detect ketonuria. The reagent pad on the strip turns purplish when ketones are present. (One of the ketone bodies is called acetone, and this term is frequently used interchangeably with the term "ketones.") Other strips are available for measuring both urine glucose and ketones (Keto-Diastix or Chemstrip uGK). Large amounts of ketones may depress the color response of the glucose test area.

Urine ketone testing should be performed whenever patients with type 1 diabetes have glucosuria or persistently elevated blood glucose levels (more than $240 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or $13.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ for two testing periods in a row) and during illness, in pregnancy with pre-existing diabetes, and in gestational diabetes (ADA, Tests of Glycemia in Diabetes, 2003).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

As stated earlier, insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans and works to lower the blood glucose level after meals by facilitating the uptake and utilization of glucose by muscle, fat, and liver cells. In the absence of adequate insulin, pharmacologic therapy is essential.

\section*{Insulin Therapy and Insulin Preparations}

Because the body loses the ability to produce insulin in type 1 diabetes, exogenous insulin must be administered for life. In type 2 diabetes, insulin may be necessary on a long-term basis to control glucose levels if diet and oral agents fail. In addition, some patients in whom type 2 diabetes is usually controlled by diet alone or by diet and an oral agent may require insulin temporarily during illness, infection, pregnancy, surgery, or some other stressful event. In many cases, insulin injections are administered two or more times daily to control the blood glucose level. Because the insulin dose required by the individual patient is determined by the level of glucose in the blood, accurate monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential; thus, SMBG has become a cornerstone of insulin therapy. A number of insulin preparations are available. They vary according to three main characteristics: time course of action, species (source), and manufacturer.

\section*{TIME COURSE OF ACTION}

Insulins may be grouped into several categories based on the onset, peak, and duration of action (Table 41-3). Human insulin preparations have a shorter duration of action than insulin from animal sources because the presence of animal proteins triggers an immune response that results in the binding of animal insulin, which slows its availability.

Rapid-acting insulins such as insulin lispro (Humalog) and insulin aspart (Novolog) are blood glucose-lowering agents that

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 41-3 - Categories of Insulin}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline TIME COURSE & AGENT & ONSET & PEAK & DURATION & INDICATIONS \\
\hline Rapid-acting & Lispro (Humalog) Aspart (Novolog) & $10-15 \mathrm{~min} 10-15 \mathrm{~min}$ & 1 h $40-50 \mathrm{~min}$ & 3 h $4-6 \mathrm{~h}$ & Used for rapid reduction of glucose level, to treat postprandial hyperglycemia, and/or to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia \\
\hline Short-acting & Regular (Humalog R, Novolin R, Iletin II Regular) & $1 / 2-1 \mathrm{~h}$ & $2-3 \mathrm{~h}$ & $4-6 \mathrm{~h}$ & Usually administered 20-30 minutes before a meal; may be taken alone or in combination with longeracting insulin \\
\hline Intermediate-acting & NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) (Humulin N, Iletin II Lente, Iletin II NPH, Novolin L [Lente], Novolin N [NPH]) & $2-4 \mathrm{~h}$ & $6-12 \mathrm{~h}$ & $16-20 \mathrm{~h}$ & Usually taken after food \\
\hline Long-acting & Ultralente ("UL") & $6-8 \mathrm{~h}$ & $12-16 \mathrm{~h}$ & $20-30 \mathrm{~h}$ & Used primarily to control fasting glucose level \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
produce a more rapid effect that is of shorter duration than regular insulin. These insulins have an onset of 5 to 15 minutes, a peak action of 1 hour after injection, and a duration of 2 to 4 hours. Because of their rapid onset, patients should be instructed to eat no more than 5 to 15 minutes after injection. Because of the short duration of action of these insulin analogs, patients with type 1 diabetes and some patients with type 2 or gestational diabetes also require a long-acting insulin to maintain glucose control. Basal insulin is necessary to maintain blood glucose levels irrespective of meals. A constant level of insulin is required at all times. Intermediate-acting insulins function as basal insulins but may have to be split into two injections to achieve 24-hour coverage.

Short-acting insulins, called regular insulin (marked R on the bottle), have an onset of 30 minutes to 1 hour; peak, 2 to 3 hours; and duration, 4 to 6 hours. Regular insulin is a clear solution and is usually administered 20 to 30 minutes before a meal, either alone or in combination with a longer-acting insulin. Humulin R, Iletin Regular, and Novolin R are examples of regular insulin.

Intermediate-acting insulins, called NPH insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn) or Lente insulin, have an onset of 3 to 4 hours; peak, 4 to 12 hours; and duration, 16 to 20 hours. Intermediateacting insulins, which are similar in their time course of action, appear white and cloudy. If NPH or Lente insulin is taken alone, it is not crucial that it be taken 30 minutes before the meal. It is important, however, for the patient to eat some food around the time of the onset and peak of these insulins. Humulin N, Iletin NPH, and Novolin N are examples of NPH insulins; Humulin L, Iletin L, and Novolin L are examples of Lente insulins.

Long-acting insulins, called Ultralente insulin, are sometimes referred to as peakless insulins because they tend to have a long, slow, sustained action rather than sharp, definite peaks in action. The onset of long-acting human insulin is 6 to 8 hours; peak, 12 to 16 hours; and duration, 20 to 30 hours.
"Peakless" basal insulin, insulin glargine (Lantus), is approved for use as a basal insulin-that is, the insulin is absorbed very slowly over 24 hours and can be given once a day. Because the in-
sulin is in a suspension with a pH of 4 , it cannot be mixed with other insulins because this would cause precipitation. It is given once a day at bedtime.

> NURSING ALERT When administering insulin, it is very important to read the label carefully and to be sure that the correct type of insulin is administered. It is also important to avoid mistaking Lantus insulin for Lente insulin and vice versa.

In the future, "inhaled insulin" may be approved for use. This type of insulin is in the form of a very fine powder, which is inhaled through a device similar to that used to administer asthma medications. The patient's program would consist of a "basal" rate of insulin such as glargine supplemented by an inhaled dose before each meal.

The nurse may find that different sources list differing numbers of hours for the onset, peak, and duration of action of the main types of insulin, and patients' responses may vary (ie, larger doses prolong onset, duration, and peak). The nurse should focus on which meals-and snacks-are being "covered" by which insulin doses. In general, the rapid- and short-acting insulins are expected to cover the rise in glucose levels after meals, immediately after the injection; the intermediate-acting insulins are expected to cover subsequent meals; and the long-acting insulins provide a relatively constant level of insulin and act as a basal insulin.

\section*{SPECIES (SOURCE)}

In the past, all insulins were obtained from beef (cow) and pork (pig) pancreases. "Human insulins" are now widely available. They are produced by recombinant DNA technology and have largely replaced insulin from animal sources (ADA, Insulin Administration, 2003).

\section*{MANUFACTURER}

The two manufacturers of insulin in the United States are EliLilly and Novo Nordisk. The insulins made by the different
companies are usually interchangeable, provided the concentration (eg, U-100), species (eg, human), and type (eg, NPH) of insulin are the same. Human insulins made by different companies have different brand names. Therefore, a patient taking 20 units human NPH insulin may be using either Humulin N or Novolin N.

\section*{Insulin Regimens}

Insulin regimens vary from one to four injections per day. Usually there is a combination of a short-acting insulin and a longeracting insulin. The normally functioning pancreas continuously secretes small amounts of insulin during the day and night. In addition, whenever blood glucose rises after ingestion of food, there is a rapid burst of insulin secretion in proportion to the glucoseraising effect of the food. The goal of all but the simplest, oneinjection insulin regimens is to mimic this normal pattern of insulin secretion in response to food intake and activity patterns. Table 41-4 describes several insulin regimens and the advantages and disadvantages of each.

Patients can learn to use SMBG results and carbohydrate counting to vary the insulin doses. This allows patients more flexibility in the timing and content of meals and exercise periods. However, complex insulin regimens require a strong level of commitment, intensive education, and close follow-up by the health care team. In addition, patients aiming for normal blood glucose levels run the risk of more hypoglycemic reactions.

The type of regimen used by any particular patient varies. For example, patient knowledge, willingness, goals, health status, and finances all may affect decisions regarding insulin treatment. In addition, the physician's philosophy about blood glucose control and the availability of equipment and support staff may influence decisions regarding insulin therapy. There are two general approaches to insulin therapy: conventional and intensive.

\section*{CONVENTIONAL REGIMEN}

One approach is to simplify the insulin regimen as much as possible, with the aim of avoiding the acute complications of diabetes (hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia). With this type of simplified regimen (eg, one or more injections of a mixture of short- and intermediate-acting insulins per day), patients may frequently have blood glucose levels well above normal. The exception is the patient who never varies meal patterns and activity levels. This approach would be appropriate for the terminally ill, the frail elderly with limited self-care abilities, or any patient who is completely unwilling or unable to engage in the self-management activities that are part of a more complex insulin regimen.

\section*{INTENSIVE REGIMEN}

The second approach is to use a more complex insulin regimen to achieve as much control over blood glucose levels as is safe and practical. The results of the landmark DCCT study (1993) and the UKPDS study (1998) have demonstrated that maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible prevents or slows the progression of long-term diabetic complications. Another reason for using a more complex insulin regimen is to allow patients more flexibility to change their insulin doses from day to day in accordance with changes in their eating and activity patterns, with stress and illness, and as needed for variations in the prevailing glucose level.

Although the DCCT found that intensive treatment (three or four injections of insulin per day) reduced the risk of complications, not all people with diabetes are candidates for very tight control of blood glucose. The risk for severe hypoglycemia was
increased threefold in patients receiving intensive treatment in the DCCT (ADA, Implications of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, 2003). Those who may not be candidates include patients with:
- Nervous system disorders rendering them unaware of hypoglycemic episodes (eg, those with autonomic neuropathy)
- Recurring severe hypoglycemia
- Irreversible diabetic complications, such as blindness or end-stage renal disease
- Cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular disease
- Ineffective self-care skills

An exception is the patient who has received a kidney transplant because of nephropathy and chronic renal failure; this patient should be on an intensive regimen to preserve function of the new kidney.

The patient needs to be involved in the decision regarding which insulin regimen to use. Patients need to compare the potential benefits of different regimens with the potential costs (eg, time involved, number of injections or finger sticks for glucose testing, amount of record-keeping). There are no set guidelines as to which insulin regimen should be used for which patients. It must not be assumed that an elderly patient or a patient with visual impairment should automatically be given a simplified regimen. Likewise, it must not be assumed that all people will want to be involved in a complex treatment regimen. Nurses play an important role in educating patients about the different approaches to insulin therapy. Nurses should refer patients to diabetes specialists or diabetes education centers, when available, for further training and education in the various insulin treatment regimens.

\section*{Complications of Insulin Therapy}

\section*{LOCAL ALLERGIC REACTIONS}

A local allergic reaction (redness, swelling, tenderness, and induration or a 2 - to $4-\mathrm{cm}$ wheal) may appear at the injection site 1 to 2 hours after the insulin administration. These reactions, which usually occur during the beginning stages of therapy and disappear with continued use of insulin, are becoming rare because of the increased use of human insulins. The physician may prescribe an antihistamine to be taken 1 hour before the injection if such a local reaction occurs.

\section*{SYSTEMIC ALLERGIC REACTIONS}

Systemic allergic reactions to insulin are rare. When they do occur, there is an immediate local skin reaction that gradually spreads into generalized urticaria (hives). The treatment is desensitization, with small doses of insulin administered in gradually increasing amounts using a desensitization kit. These rare reactions are occasionally associated with generalized edema or anaphylaxis.

\section*{INSULIN LIPODYSTROPHY}

Lipodystrophy refers to a localized reaction, in the form of either lipoatrophy or lipohypertrophy, occurring at the site of insulin injections. Lipoatrophy is loss of subcutaneous fat and appears as slight dimpling or more serious pitting of subcutaneous fat. The use of human insulin has almost eliminated this disfiguring complication.

Lipohypertrophy, the development of fibrofatty masses at the injection site, is caused by the repeated use of an injection site. If insulin is injected into scarred areas, absorption may be delayed.

This is one reason that rotation of injection sites is so important. The patient should avoid injecting insulin into these areas until the hypertrophy disappears.

\section*{INSULIN RESISTANCE}

Most patients at one time or another have some degree of insulin resistance. This may occur for various reasons, the most common being obesity, which can be overcome by weight loss. Clinical insulin resistance has been defined as a daily insulin requirement of 200 units or more. In most diabetic patients taking insulin, immune antibodies develop and bind the insulin, thereby decreasing the insulin available for use. All animal insulins, as well as human insulins to a lesser degree, cause antibody production in humans.

Very few resistant patients develop high levels of antibodies. Many of these patients have a history of insulin therapy interrupted for several months or more. Treatment consists of administering a more concentrated insulin preparation, such as U500, which is available by special order. Occasionally, prednisone is needed to block the production of antibodies. This may be followed by a gradual reduction in insulin requirement. Therefore, patients need to monitor themselves for hypoglycemia.

\section*{MORNING HYPERGLYCEMIA}

An elevated blood glucose level upon arising in the morning may be caused by an insufficient level of insulin due to several causes: the dawn phenomenon, the Somogyi effect, or insulin waning. The dawn phenomenon is characterized by a relatively normal blood glucose level until approximately 3 a.m., when blood glucose levels begin to rise. The phenomenon is thought to result from nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion that create a greater need for insulin in the early morning hours in patients with type 1 diabetes. It must be distinguished from insulin waning (the progressive increase in blood glucose from bedtime to morning) or the Somogyi effect (nocturnal hypoglycemia followed by rebound hyperglycemia). Insulin waning is frequently seen if the evening NPH dose is administered before dinner and is prevented by moving the evening dose of NPH insulin to bedtime.

It may be difficult to tell from the patient's history which of these causes is responsible for morning hyperglycemia. To determine the cause, the patient must be awakened once or twice during the night to test blood glucose levels. Testing the blood glucose level at bedtime, at 3 a.m., and on awakening provides information that can be used in making adjustments in insulin to avoid morning hyperglycemia caused by the dawn phenomenon. Table 41-5 summarizes the differences among insulin waning, the dawn phenomenon, and the Somogyi effect.

\section*{Alternative Methods of Insulin Delivery}

\section*{INSULIN PENS}

These devices use small (150- to 300-unit) prefilled insulin cartridges that are loaded into a penlike holder. A disposable needle is attached to the device for insulin injection. Insulin is delivered by dialing in a dose or pushing a button for every 1 - or 2 -unit increment administered. People using these devices still need to insert the needle for each injection; however, they do not need to carry insulin bottles or to draw up insulin before each injection. These devices are most useful for patients who need to inject only one type of insulin at a time (eg, premeal regular insulin three times a day and bedtime NPH insulin) or who can use the premixed insulins. These pens are convenient for those who admin-

ister insulin before dinner if eating out or traveling. They are also useful for patients with impaired manual dexterity, vision, or cognitive function that makes the use of traditional syringes difficult.

\section*{JET INJECTORS}

As an alternative to needle injections, jet injection devices deliver insulin through the skin under pressure in an extremely fine stream. These devices are more expensive than other alternative devices mentioned above and require thorough training and supervision when first used. In addition, patients should be cautioned that absorption rates, peak insulin activity, and insulin levels may be different when changing to a jet injector. (Insulin administered by jet injector is usually absorbed faster.) Bruising has occurred in some patients with use of the jet injector.

\section*{INSULIN PUMPS}

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion involves the use of small, externally worn devices that closely mimic the functioning of the normal pancreas (ADA, Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion, 2003). Insulin pumps contain a $3-\mathrm{mL}$ syringe attached to a long (24- to 42-in), thin, narrow-lumen tube with a needle or Teflon catheter attached to the end (Figs. 41-4 and 41-5). The patient inserts the needle or catheter into the subcutaneous tissue (usually on the abdomen) and secures it with tape or a transparent dressing. The needle or catheter is changed at least every 3 days. The pump is then worn either on a belt or in a pocket. Some women keep the pump tucked into the front or side of the bra or wear it on a garter belt on the thigh.

The rapid-acting lispro insulin is used in the insulin pump and is delivered at a basal rate and as a bolus with meals. A continuous basal rate of insulin is typically 0.5 to 2.0 units/hour, depending on the patient's needs. A bolus dose of insulin is delivered before each meal when the patient activates the pump (by pushing buttons). The patient determines the amount of insulin to infuse based on blood glucose levels and anticipated food intake and activity level. Advantages of insulin pumps include increased flexibility in lifestyle (in terms of timing and amount of

meals, exercise, and travel) and, for many patients, improved blood glucose control.

A disadvantage of insulin pumps is that unexpected disruptions in the flow of insulin from the pump may occur if the tubing or needle becomes occluded, if the supply of insulin runs out, or if the battery is depleted, increasing the risk of DKA. Effective teaching and a knowledgeable patient can minimize this risk. Another disadvantage is the potential for infection at needle insertion sites. Hypoglycemia may occur with insulin pump therapy; however, this is usually related to the lowered blood glucose levels many patients achieve rather than to a specific problem with the pump itself. The tight diabetic control associated with using an insulin pump may increase the incidence of hypoglycemia unawareness because of the very gradual decline in serum glucose level from levels greater than $70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(3.9 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ to those less than $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(3.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$.

Some patients find that wearing the pump for 24 hours each day is an inconvenience. However, the pump can easily be disconnected, per patient preference, for limited periods (eg, for showering, exercise, or sexual activity).

Insulin pump candidates must be willing to assess blood glucose levels multiple times daily while on pump therapy. In addition, they must be psychologically stable and open about having diabetes, because the insulin pump is often a visible sign to others and a constant reminder to the patient that he or she has diabetes. Most important, patients using insulin pumps must have extensive education in the use of the insulin pump and in selfmanagement of blood glucose and insulin doses. They must work closely with a team of health care professionals who are experienced in insulin pump therapy-specifically, a diabetologist/ endocrinologist, a dietitian, and a certified diabetes educator.

Many insurance policies cover the cost of pump therapy; if it is not covered, the extra expense of the pump and associated supplies may be a deterrent for some patients. Medicare now covers insulin pump therapy for the patient with type 1 diabetes.

\section*{IMPLANTABLE AND INHALANT INSULIN DELIVERY}

Research into mechanical delivery of insulin has involved implantable insulin pumps that can be externally programmed according to blood glucose test results. Clinical trials with these devices are continuing. In addition, there is research into the development of implantable devices that both measure the blood glucose level and deliver insulin as needed. Methods of administering insulin by the oral route (oral spray or capsule), skin patch, and inhalation are undergoing intensive study.

\section*{TRANSPLANTATION OF PANCREATIC CELLS}

Transplantation of the whole pancreas or a segment of the pancreas is being performed on a limited population (mostly diabetic patients receiving kidney transplantations simultaneously). One main issue regarding pancreatic transplantation is weighing the risks of antirejection medications against the advantages of pancreas transplantation. Another approach under investigation is the implantation of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells (ADA, Pancreas Transplantation for Patients With Type 1 Diabetes, 2003). This latter approach involves a less extensive surgical procedure and a potentially lower incidence of immunogenic problems. However, thus far, independence from exogenous insulin has been limited to 2 years after transplantation of islet cells. A recent study of patients with islet cell transplants using less toxic antirejection drugs has shown promise (Shapiro et al., 2000).

\section*{Oral Antidiabetic Agents}

Oral antidiabetic agents may be effective for patients who have type 2 diabetes that cannot be treated by diet and exercise alone; however, they cannot be used during pregnancy. In the United States, oral antidiabetic agents include the sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and meglitinides (Table 41-6). Sulfonylureas and meglitinides are considered insulin secretagogues because their action increases the secretion of insulin by the pancreatic beta cells.

\section*{SULFONYLUREAS}

The sulfonylureas exert their primary action by directly stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin. Therefore, a functioning pancreas is necessary for these agents to be effective, and they cannot be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. These agents improve insulin action at the cellular level and may also directly decrease glucose production by the liver. The sulfonylureas can be divided into first- and second-generation categories (see Table 41-6).

The most common side effects of these medications are GI symptoms and dermatologic reactions. Hypoglycemia may occur when an excessive dose of a sulfonylurea is used or when the patient omits or delays meals, reduces food intake, or increases activity. Because of the prolonged hypoglycemic effects of these agents (especially chlorpropamide), some patients need to be hospitalized for treatment of oral agent-induced hypoglycemia. Another side effect of chlorpropamide is a disulfiram
(Antabuse) type of reaction when alcohol is ingested (see section on alcohol consumption for more information). Some medications may directly interact with sulfonylureas, potentiating their hypoglycemic effects (eg, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, clofibrate, phenylbutazone, and bishydroxycoumarin). In addition, certain medications may independently affect blood glucose levels, thereby indirectly interfering with these agents. Medications that may increase glucose levels include potassium-losing diuretics, corticosteroids, estrogen compounds, and diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin). Medications that may cause hypoglycemia include salicylates, propranolol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and pentamidine.

Second-generation sulfonylureas have the advantage of a shorter half-life and excretion by both the kidney and the liver. This makes these medications safer to use in the elderly, in whom accumulation of the medication can cause recurring hypoglycemia.

\section*{BIGUANIDES}

The biguanides are other kinds of oral antidiabetic agents. Metformin (Glucophage) produces its antidiabetic effects by facilitating insulin's action on peripheral receptor sites. Therefore, it can be used only in the presence of insulin. Biguanides have no effect on pancreatic beta cells. Biguanides used with a sulfonylurea may enhance the glucose-lowering effect more than either medication used alone. Lactic acidosis is a potential and serious complication of biguanide therapy; the patient must be monitored closely when therapy is initiated or when dosage changes. Med-

ications that may interact with biguanides include anticoagulants, corticosteroids, diuretics, and oral contraceptives. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine level more than 1.4) or those at risk for renal dysfunction (eg, those with acute myocardial infarction). Renal function studies should be performed periodically to ensure that function is not impaired. Metformin should not be administered for 2 days before any diagnostic testing that may require use of a contrast agent. These situations increase the risk for lactic acidosis.

An extended-release form and a combination form (Glucovance) combines metformin with a sulfonylurea, such as glyburide. The combination provides two mechanisms of action and improved patient compliance. Hypoglycemia is a risk.

\section*{ALPHA GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS}

Acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset) are oral alpha glucosidase inhibitors used in type 2 diabetes management. They work by delaying the absorption of glucose in the intestinal system, resulting in a lower postprandial blood glucose level. As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ levels drop. In contrast to the sulfonylureas, acarbose and miglitol do not enhance insulin secretion. They can be used alone with dietary treatment as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or meglitinides. When these medications are used in combination with sulfonylureas or meglitinides, hypoglycemia may occur. The patient must be advised that if hypoglycemia occurs, sucrose absorption will be blocked and treatment for hypoglycemia should be in the form of glucose, such as glucose tablets. The advantage of oral alpha glucosidase inhibitors is that they are not systemically absorbed and are safe to use. Their side effects are diarrhea and flatulence. These effects may be minimized by starting at a very low dose and increasing the dose gradually. Because acarbose and miglitol affect food absorption, they must be taken immediately before a meal, making therapeutic adherence a potential problem.

\section*{THIAZOLIDINEDIONES}

Rosiglitizone (Avandia) and pioglitozone (Actos) are oral diabetes medications categorized as thiazolidinediones. They are indicated for patients with type 2 diabetes who take insulin injections and whose blood glucose control is inadequate (hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ level greater than $8.5 \%$ ). They have also been approved as firstline agents to treat type 2 diabetes, in combination with diet. Thiazolidinediones enhance insulin action at the receptor site without increasing insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas. These medications may affect liver function; therefore, liver function studies must be performed at baseline and at frequent intervals (monthly for the first 12 months of treatment, and quarterly thereafter). Women should be informed that thiazolidinediones can cause resumption of ovulation in perimenopausal anovulatory women, making pregnancy a possibility.

\section*{MEGLITINIDES}

Repaglinide (Prandin), an oral glucose-lowering agent of the class of oral agents called meglitinides, lowers the blood glucose level by stimulating insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells. Its effectiveness depends on the presence of functioning beta cells. Therefore, repaglinide is contraindicated in patients with type 1 diabetes. Repaglinide has a fast action and a short duration. It should be taken before each meal to stimulate the release of insulin in response to that meal. It is also indicated for use in combination with metformin in patients whose hyperglycemia
cannot be controlled by exercise, diet, and either metformin or repaglinide alone. The principal side effect of repaglinide is hypoglycemia; however, this side effect is less severe and frequent than for a sulfonylurea because repaglinide has a short half-life (approximately 1 hour). Patients must be taught the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and should understand that the medication should not be taken unless the patient eats a meal. Repaglinide is supplied in $0.5-1-$, and $2-\mathrm{mg}$ tablets.

Naglitinide (Starlix), another meglitinide, has a very rapid onset and short duration. It should be taken with meals and not taken if the meal is skipped. Hypoglycemia risk is low if taken correctly.

\section*{General Considerations for Oral Agents}

Patients need to understand that oral agents are prescribed as an addition to (not as a substitute for) other treatment modalities, such as diet and exercise. Use of oral antidiabetic medications may need to be halted temporarily and insulin prescribed if hyperglycemia develops that is attributable to infection, trauma, or surgery.

In time, oral antidiabetic agents may no longer be effective in controlling the patient's diabetes. In such cases, the patient is treated with insulin. Approximately half of all patients who initially use oral antidiabetic agents eventually require insulin. This is referred to as a secondary failure. Primary failure occurs when the blood glucose level remains high a month after initial medication use.

Because the mechanisms of action vary (Fig. 41-6), the effect may be enhanced using multidose, multiple medications (Inzucchi et al., 1998). Use of multiple medications with different mechanisms of action is very common today (Quinn, 2001b). Using a combination of oral agents with insulin has been proposed as a treatment for some patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the effectiveness of this approach has not yet been demonstrated.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient with diabetes can involve treatment of a wide variety of physiologic disorders, depending on the patient's health status and whether the patient is newly diagnosed or seeks care for an unrelated health problem. Nursing management of the newly diagnosed patient and the patient with diabetes as a secondary diagnosis is presented in subsequent sections of this chapter. Because all diabetic patients must master the concepts and skills necessary for long-term management of diabetes and its potential complications, a solid educational foundation is necessary for competent self-care and is an ongoing focus of nursing care.

\section*{EDUCATION}

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic illness requiring a lifetime of special self-management behaviors. Because diet, physical activity, and physical and emotional stress affect diabetic control, patients must learn to balance a multitude of factors. They must learn daily self-care skills to prevent acute fluctuations in blood glucose, and they must also incorporate into their lifestyle many preventive behaviors for avoidance of long-term diabetic complications. Diabetic patients must become knowledgeable about nutrition, medication effects and side effects, exercise, disease progression, prevention strategies, blood glucose monitoring techniques, and
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-183.jpg?height=797&width=1786&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=106)
medication adjustment. In addition, they must learn the skills associated with monitoring and managing diabetes and must incorporate many new activities into their daily routines. An appreciation for the knowledge and skills that diabetic patients must acquire can help the nurse in providing effective patient education and counseling (Beebe \& O'Donnell, 2001).

\section*{DEVELOPING A DIABETIC TEACHING PLAN}

Changes in the health care delivery system as a whole have had a major impact on diabetes education and training. Patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes have much shorter hospital stays or may be managed completely on an outpatient basis; patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes are rarely hospitalized for initial care. There has been a proliferation of outpatient diabetes education and training programs, with increasing support of third-party reimbursement. For some patients, however, exposure to diabetes education during hospitalization may be the only opportunity for learning self-management skills and preventing complications.

Many hospitals employ nurses who specialize in diabetes education and management and who are certified by the National Certification Board of Diabetes Educators as Certified Diabetes Educators. However, because of the large number of diabetic patients who are admitted to every unit of a hospital for reasons other than diabetes or its complications, the staff nurse plays a vital role in identifying diabetic patients, assessing self-care skills, providing basic education, reinforcing the teaching provided by the specialist, and referring patients for follow-up care after discharge. Diabetes patient education programs that have been peerreviewed by the ADA as meeting National Standards for Diabetes Education can seek reimbursement for education.

\section*{Organizing Information}

There are various strategies for organizing and prioritizing the vast amount of information that must be taught to diabetic patients. In addition, many hospitals and outpatient diabetes centers have devised written guidelines, care plans, and documenta-
tion forms (often based on guidelines from the ADA) that may be used to document and evaluate teaching. A general approach is to organize information and skills into two main types: basic, initial, or "survival" skills and information, and in-depth (advanced) or continuing education.

\section*{TEACHING SURVIVAL SKILLS}

This information must be taught to any patient with newly diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes and any patient receiving insulin for the first time. This basic information is literally what the patient must know to survive-that is, to avoid severe hypoglycemic or acute hyperglycemic complications after discharge. An outline of survival information includes:
1. Simple pathophysiology
a. Basic definition of diabetes (having a high blood glucose level)
b. Normal blood glucose ranges and target blood glucose levels
c. Effect of insulin and exercise (decrease glucose)
d. Effect of food and stress, including illness and infections (increase glucose)
e. Basic treatment approaches
2. Treatment modalities
a. Administration of insulin and oral antidiabetes medications
b. Diet information (food groups, timing of meals)
c. Monitoring of blood glucose and ketones
3. Recognition, treatment, and prevention of acute complications
a. Hypoglycemia
b. Hyperglycemia
4. Pragmatic information
a. Where to buy and store insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring supplies
b. When and how to reach the physician

For patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, emphasis is initially placed on diet. Patients starting to take oral sulfonylureas or meglitinides need to know about detecting, preventing,
and treating hypoglycemia. If diabetes has gone undetected for many years, the patient may already be experiencing some chronic diabetic complications. Thus, for some patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, the basic diabetes teaching must include information on preventive skills, such as foot care and eye care-for example, planning yearly or more frequent complete (dilated eye) examinations by the ophthalmologist and understanding that retinopathy is largely asymptomatic until the advanced stages.

Patients also need to realize that once they master the basic skills and information, further diabetes education must be pursued. Acquiring in-depth and advanced diabetes knowledge occurs throughout the patient's lifetime, both formally through programs of continuing education and informally through experience and sharing of information with other people with diabetes.

\section*{PLANNING IN-DEPTH AND CONTINUING EDUCATION}

This involves teaching more detailed information related to survival skills (eg, learning to vary diet and insulin and preparing for travel) as well as learning preventive measures for avoiding longterm diabetic complications. Preventive measures include:
- Foot care
- Eye care
- General hygiene (eg, skin care, oral hygiene)
- Risk factor management (eg, control of blood pressure and blood lipid levels, and normalizing blood glucose levels)
More advanced continuing education may include alternative methods for insulin delivery, such as the insulin pump, and algorithms or rules for evaluating and adjusting insulin doses. For example, patients can be taught to increase or decrease insulin doses based on a several-day pattern of blood glucose levels. The degree of advanced diabetes education to be provided depends on the patient's interest and ability. However, learning preventive measures (especially foot care and eye care) is mandatory for reducing the occurrence of amputations and blindness in diabetic patients.

\section*{Assessing Readiness to Learn}

Before initiating diabetes education, the nurse assesses the patient's (and family's) readiness to learn (Beebe \& O'Donnell, 2001). When patients are first diagnosed with diabetes (or first told of their need for insulin), they often go through various stages of the grieving process. These stages may include shock and denial, anger, depression, negotiation, and acceptance. The amount of time it takes for patients and family members to work through the grieving process varies from patient to patient. They may experience helplessness, guilt, altered body image, loss of self-esteem, and concern about the future. The nurse must assess the patient's coping strategies and reassure patients and families that feelings of depression and shock are normal.

Asking the patient and family about their major concerns or fears is an important way to learn about any misinformation that may be contributing to anxiety. Some common misconceptions regarding diabetes and its treatment are listed in Table 41-7. Simple, direct information should be provided to dispel misconceptions. More information can be provided once the patient masters survival skills.

After dispelling misconceptions or answering questions that concern the patient the most, the nurse focuses attention on concrete survival skills. Because of the immediate need for multiple new skills, teaching is initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis. Nurses whose patients are in the hospital rarely have the luxury
of waiting until the patient feels ready to learn; short hospital stays necessitate initiation of survival skill education as early as possible. This gives the patient the opportunity to practice skills with supervision by the nurse before discharge. Follow-up by home health nurses is often necessary for reinforcement of survival skills.

A major goal of patient teaching is an educated consumer, a patient who is informed about the wide variations in the prices of medications and supplies and about the importance of comparing prices.

\section*{Determining Teaching Methods}

Maintaining flexibility in teaching approaches is important. Teaching skills and information in a logical sequence is not always the most helpful for patients. For example, many patients fear the injection. Before they learn how to draw up, purchase, store, and mix insulins, they should be taught to insert the needle and inject insulin (or practice with saline solution). Numerous demonstrations by the nurse or practice injections before the patient (or family) gives the first injection may actually increase the patient's anxiety and fear of self-injection. Once patients have actually performed the injection, most are more prepared to hear and to comprehend other information. (If they then want to practice further using a pillow or an orange, that would be appropriate.) Thus, having patients self-inject first or having patients perform a fingerstick for glucose monitoring first may enhance learning to draw up the insulin or to operate the glucose meter. Ample opportunity should be provided for the patient and family to practice skills under supervision (including selfinjection, self-testing, meal selection, verbalization of symptoms, and treatment of hypoglycemia). Once skills have been mastered, participation in ongoing support groups may assist patients in incorporating new habits and maintaining adherence to the treatment regimen.

Various tools can be used to complement teaching. Many of the companies that manufacture products for diabetes self-care also provide booklets and videotapes to assist in patient teaching. It is important to use a variety of written handouts that match the patient's learning needs (including different languages, lowliteracy information, large print). Patients can continue learning about diabetes care by participating in activities sponsored by local hospitals and diabetes organizations. In addition, magazines with information on all aspects of diabetes management are available for people with diabetes.

\section*{IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN}

\section*{Teaching Experienced Diabetic Patients}

The nurse should continue to assess the skills of patients who have had diabetes for many years, because it is estimated that up to $50 \%$ of patients may make errors in self-care. Assessment of these patients must include direct observation of skills, not just their self-report of self-care behaviors. In addition, these patients must be fully aware of preventive measures related to foot care, eye care, and risk factor management. If patients are experiencing long-term diabetic complications for the first time, they may go through the grieving process again. Some of these patients may have a renewed interest in diabetes self-care in the hope of delaying further complications. Other patients may be overwhelmed by feelings of guilt and depression. The patient is encouraged to discuss feelings and fears related to complications; the nurse meanwhile provides appropriate information regarding diabetic complications.

\section*{Teaching Patients to Self-Administer Insulin}

Insulin injections are administered into the subcutaneous tissue with the use of special insulin syringes. A variety of syringes and injection-aid devices are available. Chart 41-7 provides important information to include and evaluate when teaching patients about insulin. Basic information includes explanation of the equipment, insulins, syringes, and mixing insulin.

\section*{STORING INSULIN}

Cloudy insulins should be thoroughly mixed by gently inverting the vial or rolling it between the hands before drawing the solution into a syringe or a pen.

Whether insulin is the short- or long-acting preparation, the vials not in use should be refrigerated and extremes of temperature should be avoided; insulin should not be allowed to freeze and should not be kept in direct sunlight or in a hot car. The in-
sulin vial in use should be kept at room temperature to reduce local irritation at the injection site, which may occur when cold insulin is injected. If a vial of insulin will be used up in 1 month, it may be kept at room temperature. Patients should be instructed to always have a spare vial of the type or types of insulin they use (ADA, Insulin Administration, 2003). Spare vials should be refrigerated.

Insulin bottles should also be inspected for flocculation, which is a frosted, whitish coating inside the bottle of intermediate- or long-acting insulins. This occurs most commonly with human insulins that are not refrigerated. If a frosted, adherent coating is present, some of the insulin is bound and should not be used.

\section*{SELECTING SYRINGES}

Syringes must be matched with the insulin concentration (eg, U-100). Currently, three sizes of U-100 insulin syringes are available:

\section*{Chart 41-7 - PATIENT EDUCATION Self-Injection of Insulin}

}
- $1-\mathrm{mL}(\mathrm{cc})$ syringes that hold 100 units
- $0.5-\mathrm{mL}$ syringes that hold 50 units
- $0.3-\mathrm{mL}$ syringes that hold 30 units

The concentration of insulin used in the United States is U-100; that is, there are 100 units per milliliter (or cubic centimeter). Syringe size varies. Small syringes allow patients who require small amounts of insulin to measure and draw up the amount of insulin accurately. Patients who require large amounts of insulin would use larger syringes. Although there is a U-500 ( 500 units $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ) concentration of insulin available by special order for patients who have severe insulin resistance and require massive doses of insulin, it is rarely used. (Individuals who travel outside of the United States should be aware that insulin is available in $40-\mathrm{U}$ concentration to avoid dosing errors.)

Most insulin syringes have a disposable 27- to 29-gauge needle that is approximately 0.5 inch long. The smaller syringes are marked in 1-unit increments and may be easier to use for patients with visual deficits or patients taking very small doses of insulin. The $1-\mathrm{mL}$ syringes are marked in 2 -unit increments. A small disposable insulin needle (29- to 30-gauge, 8 mm long) is available for very thin patients and children.

\section*{PREPARING THE INJECTION: MIXING INSULINS}

When rapid- or short-acting insulins are to be given simultaneously with longer-acting insulins, they are usually mixed together in the same syringe; the longer-acting insulins must be mixed thoroughly before use. There is some question as to whether the two insulins are stable if the mixture is kept in the syringe for more than 5 to 15 minutes. This may depend on the ratio of the insulins as well as the time between mixing and injecting. When regular insulin is mixed with long-acting insulin, there is a binding reaction that slows the action of the regular insulin. This may also occur to a greater degree when mixing regular insulin with one of the Lente insulins. Patients are advised to consult their health care provider for advice on this matter. The most important issue is that patients be consistent in how they prepare their insulin injections from day to day.

While there are varying opinions regarding which type of insulin (short- or longer-acting) should be drawn up into the syringe first when they are going to be mixed, the ADA recommends that the regular insulin be drawn up first. The most important issues are, again, that patients be consistent in technique so as not to draw up the wrong dose accidentally or the wrong type of insulin, and that patients not inject one type of insulin into the bottle containing a different type of insulin (ADA, Insulin Administration, 2003).

For patients who have difficulty mixing insulins, two options are available: they may use a premixed insulin, or they may have prefilled syringes prepared. Premixed insulins are available in several different ratios of NPH insulin to regular insulin. The ratio of $70 / 30$ ( $70 \%$ NPH and $30 \%$ regular insulin in one bottle) is the most common and is available as Novolin 70/30 (Novo Nordisk) and Humulin 70/30 (Lilly). Other ratios available include 80/20, 60/40, and 50/50. The ratio of $75 \%$ NPL and $25 \%$ insulin lispro is also available (ADA, Insulin Administration, 2002). NPL is used only to mix with Humalog; its action is the same as NPH. The appropriate initial dosage of premixed insulin must be calculated so that the ratio of NPH to regular insulin most closely approximates the separate doses needed.

For patients who can inject insulin but who have difficulty drawing up a single or mixed dose, syringes can be prefilled with the help of home care nurses or family and friends. A 3-week sup-
ply of insulin syringes may be prepared and kept in the refrigerator. The prefilled syringes should be stored with the needle in an upright position to avoid clogging of the needle (ADA, Insulin Administration, 2003).

\section*{WITHDRAWING INSULIN}

Most (if not all) of the printed materials available on insulin dose preparation instruct patients to inject air into the bottle of insulin equivalent to the number of units of insulin to be withdrawn. The rationale for this is to prevent the formation of a vacuum inside the bottle, which would make it difficult to withdraw the proper amount of insulin. Some nurses who specialize in diabetes report that some patients (who have been taking insulin for many years) have stopped injecting air before withdrawing the insulin. These patients found that the extra step was not necessary for accurately drawing up the insulin dose. Most patients find it easier to withdraw the insulin by eliminating the step and report no difficulty in preparing the proper insulin dose.

Eliminating this step (or alternating it by, for instance, injecting a syringe full of air into the vial once per week) facilitates the teaching process for some patients learning to draw up insulin for the first time. Some patients become confused with the sequence of steps involved in injecting air into two separate bottles in two different amounts before drawing up a mixed dose. For many individuals, including elderly ones, simplifying the procedure for preparing insulin injections may help them maintain independence in daily living.

As with other variations in insulin injection technique, the most important factors are that the patient maintain consistency in the procedure and that the nurse be flexible when teaching new patients or assessing the skills of experienced patients.

\section*{SELECTING AND ROTATING THE INJECTION SITE}

The four main areas for injection are the abdomen, arms (posterior surface), thighs (anterior surface), and hips (Fig. 41-7). Insulin is absorbed faster in some areas of the body than others. The speed of absorption is greatest in the abdomen and decreases progressively in the arm, thigh, and hip.

Systematic rotation of injection sites within an anatomic area is recommended to prevent localized changes in fatty tissue (lipodystrophy). In addition, to promote consistency in insulin absorption, patients should be encouraged to use all available injection sites within one area rather than randomly rotating sites from area to area (ADA, Insulin Administration, 2002). For example, some patients almost exclusively use the abdominal area, administering each injection 0.5 to 1 inch away from the previous injection. Another approach to rotation is always to use the same area at the same time of day. For example, patients may inject morning doses into the abdomen and evening doses into the arms or legs.

A few general principles apply to all rotation patterns. First, patients should try not to use the same site more than once in 2 to 3 weeks. In addition, if the patient is planning to exercise, insulin should not be injected into the limb that will be exercised, because it will be absorbed faster, and this may result in hypoglycemia.

In the past, patients were taught to rotate injections from one area to the next (eg, injecting once in the right arm, then once in the right abdomen, then once in the right thigh). Patients who still use this system must be taught to avoid repeated injections into the same site within an area. However, as previously stated, it is preferable for the patient to use the same anatomic

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-188.jpg?height=990&width=759&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=259}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 41-7 Suggested areas for insulin injection.}
\end{figure}
area at the same time of day consistently; this reduces day-to-day variation in blood glucose levels because of different absorption rates.

\section*{PREPARING THE SKIN}

Use of alcohol to cleanse the skin is not recommended, but patients who have learned this technique often continue to use it. They should be cautioned to allow the skin to dry after cleansing with alcohol. If the skin is not allowed to dry before the injection, the alcohol may be carried into the tissues, resulting in a localized reddened area.

\section*{INSERTING THE NEEDLE}

There are varying approaches to inserting the needle for insulin injections. The correct technique is based on the need for the insulin to be injected into the subcutaneous tissue. Injection that is too deep (eg, intramuscular) or too shallow may affect the rate of absorption of the insulin. Aspiration (inserting the needle and then pulling back on the plunger to assess for blood being drawn into the syringe) is generally not recommended with self-injection of insulin. Many patients who have been using insulin for an extended period have eliminated this step from their insulin injection routine with no apparent adverse effects.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Adherence to the therapeutic plan is the most important goal of self-care the patient must master. Patients who are having difficulty adhering to the diabetes treatment plan must be approached with care and understanding. Using scare tactics (such as threats of blindness or amputation if the patient does not adhere to the treatment plan) or
making the patient feel guilty is not productive and may interfere with establishing a trusting relationship with the patient. Judgmental actions, such as asking the patient if he or she has "cheated" on the diet, only promote feelings of guilt and low self-esteem.

If problems exist with glucose control or with the development of preventable complications, it is important to distinguish among nonadherence, knowledge deficit, and self-care deficit. It should not be assumed that problems with diabetes management are related to nonadherence. The patient may simply have forgotten or never learned certain information. The problem may be correctable simply through providing complete information and ensuring that the patient comprehends the information. Chart 41-8 details how to evaluate the effectiveness of self-injection of insulin.

If knowledge deficit is not the problem, certain physical or emotional factors may be impairing the patient's ability to perform self-care skills. For example, decreased visual acuity may impair the patient's ability to administer insulin accurately, measure the blood glucose level, or inspect the skin and feet. In addition, decreased joint mobility (especially in the elderly) impairs the ability to inspect the bottom of the feet. Emotional factors such as denial of the diagnosis or depression may impair the patient's ability to carry out multiple daily self-care measures. In other circumstances, family, personal, or work problems may be of higher priority to the patient. The patient facing competing demands for time and attention may benefit from assistance in establishing priorities. It is also important to assess the patient for infection or emotional stress that may lead to elevated blood glucose levels despite adherence to the treatment regimen.

The following approaches by the nurse are helpful for promoting self-care management skills:
- Address any underlying factors (eg, knowledge deficit, selfcare deficit, illness) that may affect diabetic control.
- Simplify the treatment regimen if it is too difficult for the patient to follow.
- Adjust the treatment regimen to meet patient requests (eg, adjust diet or insulin schedule to allow increased flexibility in meal content or timing).
- Establish a specific plan or contract with the patient with simple, measurable goals.
- Provide positive reinforcement of self-care behaviors performed instead of focusing on behaviors that were neglected (eg, positively reinforce blood glucose tests that were performed instead of focusing on the number of missed tests).
- Help the patient to identify personal motivating factors rather than focusing on wanting to please the doctor or nurse.
- Encourage the patient to pursue life goals and interests; discourage an undue focus on diabetes.

Continuing Care. As discussed, continuing care of the patient with diabetes is critical in managing and preventing complications. The degree to which the client interacts with health care providers to obtain ongoing care depends on many factors. Age, socioeconomic level, existing complications, type of diabetes, and comorbid conditions all may dictate the frequency of follow-up visits. Many patients with diabetes may be seen by home health nurses for diabetic education, wound care, insulin preparation, or assistance with glucose monitoring. Even patients who achieve

excellent glucose control and have no complications can expect to see their primary health care provider at least twice a year for ongoing evaluation.

In addition to follow-up care with health professionals, participation in support groups is encouraged for those who have had diabetes for many years as well as those who are newly diagnosed. Such participation may assist the patient and family in coping with changes in lifestyle that occur with the onset of diabetes and with its complications. Those who participate in support groups often have an opportunity to share valuable information and experiences and to learn from others. Support groups provide an opportunity for discussion of strategies to deal with diabetes and its management and to clarify and verify information with the nurse or other health care professionals. Participation in support groups may help patients and their families to become more knowledgeable about diabetes and its management and may promote adherence to the management plan. Another very important role of the nurse is to remind the patient about the importance of participating in other health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

\section*{Acute Complications of Diabetes}

There are three major acute complications of diabetes related to short-term imbalances in blood glucose levels: hypoglycemia, DKA, and HHNS, which is also called hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.

\section*{HYPOGLYCEMIA (INSULIN REACTIONS)}

Hypoglycemia (abnormally low blood glucose level) occurs when the blood glucose falls to less than 50 to $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(2.7$ to $3.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). It can be caused by too much insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, too little food, or excessive physical activity. Hypoglycemia may occur at any time of the day or night. It often occurs before meals, especially if meals are delayed or snacks are omitted. For example, midmorning hypoglycemia may occur when the morning regular insulin is peaking, whereas hypoglycemia that occurs in the late afternoon coincides with the peak of the morning NPH or Lente insulin. Middle-of-the-night hypoglycemia may occur because of peaking evening or predinner

NPH or Lente insulins, especially in patients who have not eaten a bedtime snack.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia may be grouped into two categories: adrenergic symptoms and central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. In mild hypoglycemia, as the blood glucose level falls, the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, resulting in a surge of epinephrine and norepinephrine. This causes symptoms such as sweating, tremor, tachycardia, palpitation, nervousness, and hunger.

In moderate hypoglycemia, the fall in blood glucose level deprives the brain cells of needed fuel for functioning. Signs of impaired function of the CNS may include inability to concentrate, headache, lightheadedness, confusion, memory lapses, numbness of the lips and tongue, slurred speech, impaired coordination, emotional changes, irrational or combative behavior, double vision, and drowsiness. Any combination of these symptoms (in addition to adrenergic symptoms) may occur with moderate hypoglycemia.

In severe hypoglycemia, CNS function is so impaired that the patient needs the assistance of another person for treatment of hypoglycemia. Symptoms may include disoriented behavior, seizures, difficulty arousing from sleep, or loss of consciousness

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Hypoglycemic symptoms can occur suddenly and unexpectedly. The combination of symptoms varies considerably from person to person. To some degree, this may be related to the actual level to which the blood glucose drops or to the rate at which it is dropping. For example, patients who usually have a blood glucose level in the hyperglycemic range (eg, in the 200s or greater) may feel hypoglycemic (adrenergic) symptoms when their blood glucose quickly drops to $120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $6.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or less. Conversely, patients who frequently have a glucose level in the low range of normal may be asymptomatic when the blood glucose slowly falls to less than $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(2.7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$.

Another factor contributing to altered hypoglycemic symptoms is a decreased hormonal (adrenergic) response to hypoglycemia. This occurs in some patients who have had diabetes for many years. It may be related to one of the chronic diabetic complications, autonomic neuropathy (see the section in this chapter on hypoglycemic unawareness). As the blood glucose level falls, the normal surge in adrenalin does not occur. The patient does not feel the usual adrenergic symptoms, such as sweating and shakiness. The hypoglycemia may not be detected until moderate or severe CNS impairment occurs. These patients must perform SMBG on a frequent regular basis, especially before driving or engaging in other potentially dangerous activities.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

In the elderly diabetic patient, hypoglycemia is a particular concern for many reasons:
- Elderly people frequently live alone and may not recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
- With decreasing renal function, it takes longer for oral hypoglycemic agents to be excreted by the kidneys.
- Skipping meals may occur because of decreased appetite or financial limitations.
- Decreased visual acuity may lead to errors in insulin administration.

\section*{Management}

Immediate treatment must be given when hypoglycemia occurs. The usual recommendation is for 15 g of a fast-acting concentrated source of carbohydrate such as the following, given orally:
- Three or four commercially prepared glucose tablets
- 4 to 6 oz of fruit juice or regular soda
- 6 to 10 Life Savers or other hard candies
- 2 to 3 teaspoons of sugar or honey

It is not necessary to add sugar to juice, even if it is labeled as unsweetened juice: the fruit sugar in juice contains enough carbohydrate to raise the blood glucose level. Adding table sugar to juice may cause a sharp increase in the blood glucose level, and the patient may experience hyperglycemia for hours after treatment.

The blood glucose level should be retested in 15 minutes and retreated if it is less than 70 to $75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 3.8 to $4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). If the symptoms persist more than 10 to 15 minutes after initial treatment, the treatment is repeated even if blood glucose testing is not possible. Once the symptoms resolve, a snack containing protein and starch (eg, milk or cheese and crackers) is recommended unless the patient plans to eat a regular meal or snack within 30 to 60 minutes.

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS}

It is important for patients with diabetes, especially those receiving insulin, to learn that they must carry some form of simple sugar with them at all times (ADA, Insulin Administration, 2002). There are many different commercially prepared glucose tablets and gels that patients may find convenient to carry. If the patient has a hypoglycemic reaction and does not have any of the recommended emergency foods available, any available food (preferably a carbohydrate food) should be eaten.

Patients are advised to refrain from eating high-calorie, highfat dessert foods (eg, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, ice cream) to treat hypoglycemia. The high fat content of these foods may slow the absorption of the glucose, and the hypoglycemic symptoms may not resolve as quickly as they would with the intake of carbohydrates. The patient may subsequently eat more of the foods when symptoms do not resolve rapidly. This in turn may cause very high blood glucose levels for several hours after the reaction and may also contribute to weight gain.

Patients who feel unduly restricted by their meal plan may view hypoglycemic episodes as a time to reward themselves with desserts. It may be more prudent to teach these patients to incorporate occasional desserts into the meal plan. This may make it easier for them to limit their treatment of hypoglycemic episodes to simple (low-calorie) carbohydrates such as juice or glucose tablets.

\section*{INITIATING EMERGENCY MEASURES}

For patients who are unconscious and cannot swallow, an injection of glucagon 1 mg can be administered either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Glucagon is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas that stimulates the liver to release glucose (through the breakdown of glycogen, the stored glucose). Injectable glucagon is packaged as a powder in $1-\mathrm{mg}$ vials and must be mixed with a diluent before being injected. After injection of glucagon, it may take up to 20 minutes for the patient to regain consciousness. A concentrated source of carbohydrate followed by a snack should be given to the patient on awakening to pre-
vent recurrence of hypoglycemia (because the duration of the action of 1 mg of glucagon is brief [its onset is 8 to 10 minutes and its action lasts 12 to 27 minutes]) and to replenish liver stores of glucose. Some patients experience nausea after the administration of glucagon; if this occurs, the patient should be turned to the side to prevent aspiration. The patient should be instructed to notify the physician after severe hypoglycemia has occurred.

Glucagon is sold by prescription only and should be part of the emergency supplies kept available by patients with diabetes who require insulin. Family members, neighbors, or coworkers should be instructed in the use of glucagon. This is especially true for patients who receive little or no warning of hypoglycemic episodes.

In the hospital or emergency department, patients who are unconscious or cannot swallow may be treated with 25 to 50 mL $50 \%$ dextrose in water $\left(\mathrm{D}_{50} \mathrm{~W}\right)$ administered intravenously. The effect is usually seen within minutes. Patients may complain of a headache and of pain at the injection site. Assuring patency of the intravenous (IV) line used for injection of $50 \%$ dextrose is essential because hypertonic solutions such as $50 \%$ dextrose are very irritating to the vein.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Hypoglycemia is prevented by a consistent pattern of eating, administering insulin, and exercising. Between-meal and bedtime snacks may be needed to counteract the maximum insulin effect. In general, the patient should cover the time of peak activity of insulin by eating a snack and by taking additional food when physical activity is increased. Routine blood glucose tests are performed so that changing insulin requirements may be anticipated and the dosage adjusted. Because unexpected hypoglycemia may occur, all patients treated with insulin should wear an identification bracelet or tag stating that they have diabetes.

Patients and family members must be instructed about the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Family members in particular must be made aware that any subtle (but unusual) change in behavior may be an indication of hypoglycemia. They should be taught to encourage and even insist that the person with diabetes assess blood glucose levels if hypoglycemia is suspected. Some patients (when hypoglycemic) become very resistant to testing or eating and become angry at family members trying to treat the hypoglycemia. Family members must be taught to persevere and to understand that the hypoglycemia can cause irrational behavior.

Some patients with autonomic neuropathy or those taking beta blockers such as propranolol to treat hypertension or cardiac dysrhythmias may not experience the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia. It is very important for these patients to perform blood glucose tests on a frequent and regular basis. Patients who have type 2 diabetes and who take oral sulfonylurea agents may also develop hypoglycemia (especially those taking chlorpropamide, a long-lasting oral hypoglycemic agent).

\section*{DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS}

DKA is caused by an absence or markedly inadequate amount of insulin. This deficit in available insulin results in disorders in the metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The three main clinical features of DKA are:
- Hyperglycemia
- Dehydration and electrolyte loss
- Acidosis

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Without insulin, the amount of glucose entering the cells is reduced and the liver increases glucose production. Both factors lead to hyperglycemia. In an attempt to rid the body of the excess glucose, the kidneys excrete the glucose along with water and electrolytes (eg, sodium and potassium). This osmotic diuresis, which is characterized by excessive urination (polyuria), leads to dehydration and marked electrolyte loss. Patients with severe DKA may lose up to 6.5 liters of water and up to 400 to 500 mEq each of sodium, potassium, and chloride over a 24 -hour period.

Another effect of insulin deficiency or deficit is the breakdown of fat (lipolysis) into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids are converted into ketone bodies by the liver. In DKA there is excessive production of ketone bodies because of the lack of insulin that would normally prevent this from occurring. Ketone bodies are acids; their accumulation in the circulation leads to metabolic acidosis.

Three main causes of DKA are decreased or missed dose of insulin, illness or infection, and undiagnosed and untreated diabetes (DKA may be the initial manifestation of diabetes). An insulin deficit may result from an insufficient dosage of insulin prescribed or from insufficient insulin being administered by the patient. Errors in insulin dosage may be made by patients who are ill and who assume that if they are eating less or if they are vomiting, they must decrease their insulin doses. (Because illness, especially infections, may cause increased blood glucose levels, patients do not need to decrease their insulin doses to compensate for decreased food intake when ill and may even need to increase the insulin dose.)

Other potential causes of decreased insulin include patient error in drawing up or injecting insulin (especially in patients with visual impairments), intentional skipping of insulin doses (especially in adolescents with diabetes who are having difficulty coping with diabetes or other aspects of their lives), or equipment problems (eg, occlusion of insulin pump tubing).

Illness and infections are associated with insulin resistance. In response to physical (and emotional) stressors, there is an increase in the level of "stress" hormones-glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone. These hormones promote glucose production by the liver and interfere with glucose utilization by muscle and fat tissue, counteracting the effect of insulin. If insulin levels are not increased during times of illness and infection, hyperglycemia may progress to DKA (Quinn, 2001c).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of DKA are listed in Figure 41-8. The hyperglycemia of DKA leads to polyuria and polydipsia (increased thirst). In addition, patients may experience blurred vision, weakness, and headache. Patients with marked intravascular volume depletion may have orthostatic hypotension (drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more on standing). Volume depletion may also lead to frank hypotension with a weak, rapid pulse.

The ketosis and acidosis of DKA lead to GI symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The abdominal pain and physical findings on examination can be so severe that they resemble an acute abdominal disorder that requires surgery. Patients may have acetone breath (a fruity odor), which occurs with elevated ketone levels. In addition, hyperventilation (with

FIGURE 41-8 Abnormal metabolism that causes signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pearce, M. A., Rosenberg, C. S., \& Davidson, M. D. (1998). Patient education. In M. B. Davidson (Ed.). Diabetes mellitus: Diagnosis and treatment. New York: Churchill Livingstone.
very deep, but not labored, respirations) may occur. These Kussmaul respirations represent the body's attempt to decrease the acidosis, counteracting the effect of the ketone buildup. In addition, mental status changes in DKA vary widely from patient to patient. Patients may be alert, lethargic, or comatose, most likely depending on the plasma osmolarity (concentration of osmotically active particles).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Blood glucose levels may vary from 300 to $800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 16.6 to $44.4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Some patients have lower glucose values, and others have values of $1,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(55.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or more (usually depending on the degree of dehydration). The severity of DKA is not necessarily related to the blood glucose level. Some patients may have severe acidosis with modestly elevated blood glucose levels, whereas others may have no evidence of DKA despite blood glucose levels of 400 to $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 22.2 to $27.7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) (Quinn, 2001c).

Evidence of ketoacidosis is reflected in low serum bicarbonate ( 0 to $15 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and low pH ( 6.8 to 7.3 ) values. A low $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ level ( 10 to 30 mm Hg ) reflects respiratory compensation (Kussmaul respirations) for the metabolic acidosis. Accumulation of ketone bodies (which precipitates the acidosis) is reflected in blood and urine ketone measurements.

Sodium and potassium levels may be low, normal, or high, depending on the amount of water loss (dehydration). Despite the plasma concentration, there has been a marked total body depletion of these (and other) electrolytes. Ultimately, these electrolytes will need to be replaced.

Elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin, and hematocrit may also be seen with dehydration. After rehydration, continued elevation in the serum creatinine and BUN levels will be present in the patient with underlying renal insufficiency.

\section*{Prevention}

For prevention of DKA related to illness, patients must be taught "sick day" rules for managing their diabetes when ill (Chart 41-9). The most important issue to teach patients is not to eliminate insulin doses when nausea and vomiting occur. Rather, they should take their usual insulin dose (or previously prescribed special "sick day" doses) and then attempt to consume frequent small portions of carbohydrates (including foods usually avoided, such as juices, regular sodas, and gelatin). Drinking fluids every hour is important to prevent dehydration. Blood glucose and urine ketones must be assessed every 3 to 4 hours.

If the patient cannot take fluids without vomiting, or if elevated glucose or ketone levels persist, the physician must be contacted. Patients are taught to have available foods for use on sick days. In addition, a supply of urine test strips (for ketone testing) and blood glucose test strips should be available. Patients must know how to contact their physician 24 hours a day.

Diabetes self-management skills (including insulin administration and blood glucose testing) should be assessed to ensure that an error in insulin administration or blood glucose testing did not occur. Psychological counseling is recommended for patients and family members if an intentional alteration in insulin dosing was the cause of the DKA.

Chart 41-9 • PATIENT EDUCATION Guidelines to Follow During Periods of Illness ("Sick Day Rules")
- Take insulin or oral antidiabetic agents as usual.
- Test blood glucose and test urine ketones every 3 to 4 hours.
- Report elevated glucose levels (greater than $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ [ $16.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ] or as otherwise specified) or urine ketones to the physician.
- Insulin-requiring patients may need supplemental doses of regular insulin every 3 to 4 hours.
- If usual meal plan cannot be followed, substitute soft foods (eg, $1 / 3$ cup regular gelatin, 1 cup cream soup, $1 / 2$ cup custard, 3 squares graham crackers) six to eight times per day.
- If vomiting, diarrhea, or fever persists, take liquids (eg, $1 / 2$ cup regular cola or orange juice, $1 / 2$ cup broth, 1 cup Gatorade) every $1 / 2$ to 1 hour to prevent dehydration and to provide calories.
- Report nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to the physician, because extreme fluid loss may be dangerous.
- For patients with type 1 diabetes, inability to retain oral fluids, may warrant hospitalization to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis and possibly coma.

\section*{Medical Management}

In addition to treating hyperglycemia, management of DKA is aimed at correcting dehydration, electrolyte loss, and acidosis (Quinn, 2001c).

\section*{REHYDRATION}

In dehydrated patients, rehydration is important for maintaining tissue perfusion. In addition, fluid replacement enhances the excretion of excessive glucose by the kidneys. Patients may need up to 6 to 10 liters of IV fluid to replace fluid losses caused by polyuria, hyperventilation, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Initially, $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride (normal saline) solution is administered at a rapid rate, usually 0.5 to 1 L per hour for 2 to 3 hours. Half-strength normal saline ( $0.45 \%$ ) solution (also known as hypotonic saline solution) may be used for patients with hypertension or hypernatremia or those at risk for heart failure. After the first few hours, half-normal saline solution is the fluid of choice for continued rehydration, if the blood pressure is stable and the sodium level is not low. Moderate to high rates of infusion (200 to 500 mL per hour) may continue for several more hours. When the blood glucose level reaches $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $16.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or less, the IV fluid may be changed to dextrose $5 \%$ in water ( $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$ ) to prevent a precipitous decline in the blood glucose level (ADA, Hyperglycemic Crisis in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

Monitoring fluid volume status involves frequent measurements of vital signs (including monitoring for orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate), lung assessment, and monitoring intake and output. Initial urine output will lag behind IV fluid intake as dehydration is corrected. Plasma expanders may be necessary to correct severe hypotension that does not respond to IV fluid treatment. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload is especially important for older patients, those with renal impairment, or those at risk for heart failure.

\section*{RESTORING ELECTROLYTES}

The major electrolyte of concern during treatment of DKA is potassium. Although the initial plasma concentration of potassium may be low, normal, or even high, there is a major loss of potassium from body stores and an intracellular to extracellular shift of potassium. Further, the serum level of potassium drops during the course of treatment of DKA as potassium re-enters the cells; therefore, it must be monitored frequently. Some of the factors related to treating DKA that reduce the serum potassium concentration include:
- Rehydration, which leads to increased plasma volume and subsequent decreases in the concentration of serum potassium. Rehydration also leads to increased urinary excretion of potassium.
- Insulin administration, which enhances the movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells.

Cautious but timely potassium replacement is vital to avoid dysrhythmias that may occur with hypokalemia. Up to 40 mEq per hour may be needed for several hours. Because extracellular potassium levels drop during DKA treatment, potassium must be infused even if the plasma potassium level is normal.

Frequent (every 2 to 4 hours initially) electrocardiograms and laboratory measurements of potassium are necessary during the first 8 hours of treatment. Potassium replacement is withheld only if hyperkalemia is present or if the patient is not urinating.

NURSING ALERT Because the patient's serum potassium level may drop quickly due to rehydration and insulin treatment, potassium replacement must begin once potassium levels drop to normal.

\section*{REVERSING ACIDOSIS}

Ketone bodies (acids) accumulate as a result of fat breakdown. The acidosis that occurs in DKA is reversed with insulin, which inhibits fat breakdown, thereby stopping acid buildup. Insulin is usually infused intravenously at a slow, continuous rate (eg, 5 units per hour). Hourly blood glucose values must be measured. IV fluid solutions with higher concentrations of glucose, such as normal saline (NS) solution (eg, $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{NS}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{50} .45 \mathrm{NS}$ ), are administered when blood glucose levels reach 250 to $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 13.8 to $16.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) to avoid too rapid a drop in the blood glucose level.

Various IV mixtures of regular insulin may be used. The nurse must convert hourly rates of insulin infusion (frequently prescribed as "units per hour") to IV drip rates. For example, if 100 units of regular insulin are mixed in $500 \mathrm{~mL} 0.9 \% \mathrm{NS}$, then 1 unit of insulin equals 5 mL . Thus, an initial insulin infusion rate of 5 units per hour would equal 25 mL per hour. The insulin is often infused separately from the rehydration solutions to allow frequent changes in the rate and content of rehydration solutions.

NURSING ALERT When mixing the insulin drip, it is important to flush the insulin solution through the entire IV infusion set and to discard the first 50 mL of fluid. Insulin molecules adhere to the inner surface of IV infusion sets; thus, the initial fluid may contain a decreased concentration of insulin.

Insulin must be infused continuously until subcutaneous administration of insulin resumes. Any interruption in adminis-
tration may result in the reaccumulation of ketone bodies and worsening acidosis. Even if blood glucose levels are dropping to normal, the insulin drip must not be stopped; rather, the rate or concentration of the dextrose infusion should be increased. Blood glucose levels are usually corrected before the acidosis is corrected. Thus, IV insulin may be continued for 12 to 24 hours until the serum bicarbonate level improves (to at least 15 to $18 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and until the patient can eat. In general, bicarbonate infusion to correct severe acidosis is avoided during treatment of DKA because it precipitates further, sudden (and potentially fatal) decreases in serum potassium levels. Continuous insulin infusion is usually sufficient for reversing DKA.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the patient with DKA focuses on monitoring fluid and electrolyte status as well as blood glucose levels; administering fluids, insulin, and other medications; and preventing other complications such as fluid overload. Urine output is monitored to ensure adequate renal function before potassium is administered to prevent hyperkalemia. The electrocardiogram is monitored for dysrhythmias indicating abnormal potassium levels. Vital signs, arterial blood gases, and other clinical findings are recorded on a flow sheet. The nurse documents the patient's laboratory values and the frequent changes in fluids and medications that are prescribed and monitors the patient's responses. As DKA resolves and the potassium replacement rate is decreased, the nurse makes sure that:
- There are no signs of hyperkalemia on the electrocardiogram (tall, peaked [or tented] T waves).
- The laboratory values of potassium are normal or low.
- The patient is urinating (ie, no renal shutdown).

As the patient recovers, the nurse reassesses the factors that may have led to DKA and teaches the patient and family about strategies to prevent its recurrence (Quinn, 2001c). If indicated,
the nurse initiates a referral for home care to ensure the patient's continued recovery.

\section*{HYPERGLYCEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR NONKETOTIC SYNDROME}

HHNS is a serious condition in which hyperosmolarity and hyperglycemia predominate, with alterations of the sensorium (sense of awareness). At the same time, ketosis is minimal or absent. The basic biochemical defect is lack of effective insulin (ie, insulin resistance). The patient's persistent hyperglycemia causes osmotic diuresis, resulting in losses of water and electrolytes. To maintain osmotic equilibrium, water shifts from the intracellular fluid space to the extracellular fluid space. With glucosuria and dehydration, hypernatremia and increased osmolarity occur. Table 41-8 compares DKA and HHNS.

This condition occurs most often in older people (ages 50 to 70) with no known history of diabetes or with mild type 2 diabetes. HHNS can be traced to a precipitating event such as an acute illness (eg, pneumonia or stroke), medications that exacerbate hyperglycemia (thiazides), or treatments, such as dialysis. The history includes days to weeks of polyuria with adequate fluid intake. What distinguishes HHNS from DKA is that ketosis and acidosis do not occur in HHNS partly because of differences in insulin levels. In DKA no insulin is present, and this promotes the breakdown of stored glucose, protein, and fat, which leads to the production of ketone bodies and ketoacidosis. In HHNS the insulin level is too low to prevent hyperglycemia (and subsequent osmotic diuresis), but it is high enough to prevent fat breakdown. Patients with HHNS do not have the ketosisrelated GI symptoms that lead them to seek medical attention. Instead, they may tolerate polyuria and polydipsia until neurologic changes or an underlying illness (or family members or others) prompts them to seek treatment. Because of possible delays in therapy, hyperglycemia, dehydration, and hyperosmolarity may be more severe in HHNS (Quinn, 2001c).

\end{tabular}

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical picture of HHNS is one of hypotension, profound dehydration (dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor), tachycardia, and variable neurologic signs (eg, alteration of sensorium, seizures, hemiparesis). The mortality rate ranges from $10 \%$ to $40 \%$, usually related to an underlying illness.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic assessment includes a range of laboratory tests, including blood glucose, electrolytes, BUN, complete blood count, serum osmolality, and arterial blood gas analysis. The blood glucose level is usually 600 to $1,200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, and the osmolality exceeds $350 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$. Electrolyte and BUN levels are consistent with the clinical picture of severe dehydration. Mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits, and hallucinations are common secondary to the cerebral dehydration that results from extreme hyperosmolality. Postural hypotension accompanies the dehydration (ADA, Hyperglycemic Crises in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

\section*{Medical Management}

The overall approach to the treatment of HHNS is similar to that of DKA: fluid replacement, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and insulin administration. Because of the older age of the typical patient with HHNS, close monitoring of volume and electrolyte status is important for prevention of fluid overload, heart failure, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Fluid treatment is started with $0.9 \%$ or $0.45 \%$ NS, depending on the patient's sodium level and the severity of volume depletion. Central venous or arterial pressure monitoring guides fluid replacement. Potassium is added to IV fluids when urinary output is adequate and is guided by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and frequent laboratory determinations of potassium.

Extremely elevated blood glucose levels drop as the patient is rehydrated. Insulin plays a less important role in the treatment of HHNS because it is not needed for reversal of acidosis, as in DKA. Nonetheless, insulin is usually administered at a continuous low rate to treat hyperglycemia, and replacement IV fluids with dextrose are administered (as in DKA) when the glucose level is decreased to the range of 250 to $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 13.8 to $16.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) (ADA, Hyperglycemic Crises in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus, 2003).

Other therapeutic modalities are determined by the underlying illness of the patient and the results of continuing clinical and laboratory evaluation. Treatment is continued until metabolic abnormalities are corrected and neurologic symptoms clear. It may take 3 to 5 days for neurologic symptoms to resolve; thus, treatment of HHNS usually continues well beyond the time when metabolic abnormalities are resolved.

After recovery from HHNS, many patients can control their diabetes with diet alone or with diet and oral antidiabetic agents. Insulin may not be needed once the acute hyperglycemic complication is resolved.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the patient with HHNS includes close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and laboratory values. In addition, strategies are implemented to maintain safety and prevent injury related to changes in the patient's sensorium secondary to HHNS. Fluid status and urine output are closely monitored because of
the high risk for renal failure secondary to severe dehydration. In addition, the nurse must direct nursing care to the condition that may have precipitated the onset of HHNS. Because HHNS tends to occur in older patients, the physiologic changes that occur with aging make careful assessment of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal function important throughout the acute and recovery phases of HHNS (Quinn, 2001c).

NURSING PROCESS:
THE PATIENT NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES MELLITUS

\section*{Assessment}

The history and physical assessment focus on the signs and symptoms of prolonged hyperglycemia and on physical, social, and emotional factors that may affect the patient's ability to learn and perform diabetes self-care activities. The patient is asked to describe symptoms that preceded the diagnosis of diabetes, such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, skin dryness, blurred vision, weight loss, vaginal itching, and nonhealing ulcers. The blood glucose and, for patients with type 1 diabetes, urine ketone levels are measured.

Patients with type 1 diabetes are assessed for signs of DKA, including ketonuria, Kussmaul respirations, orthostatic hypotension, and lethargy. The patient is questioned about symptoms of DKA, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Laboratory values are monitored for metabolic acidosis (ie, decreased pH and decreased bicarbonate level) and for electrolyte imbalance. Patients with type 2 diabetes are assessed for signs of HHNS, including hypotension, altered sensorium, seizures, and decreased skin turgor. Laboratory values are monitored for hyperosmolality and electrolyte imbalance.

If the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of DKA or HHNS, nursing care first focuses on treatment of these acute complications, as outlined in previous sections. Once these complications are resolving, nursing care then focuses on long-term management of diabetes, as discussed in this section.

Then the patient is assessed for physical factors that may impair his or her ability to learn or perform self-care skills, such as:
- Visual deficits (the patient is asked to read numbers or words on the insulin syringe, menu, newspaper, or written teaching materials)
- Deficits in motor coordination (the patient is observed eating or performing other tasks or handling a syringe or fingerlancing device)
- Neurologic deficits (eg, due to stroke, other neurologic disorders; other disabling conditions) (from history in chart; the patient is assessed for aphasia or decreased ability to follow simple commands)
The nurse evaluates the patient's social situation for factors that may influence the diabetes treatment and education plan, such as:
- Low literacy level (may be evaluated while assessing for visual deficits by having the patient read from teaching materials)
- Limited financial resources or lack of health insurance
- Presence or absence of family support
- Typical daily schedule (patient is asked about timing and number of usual daily meals, work and exercise schedule, plans for travel)

The patient's emotional status is assessed by observing general demeanor (eg, withdrawn, anxious) and body language (eg, avoids eye contact). The patient is asked about major concerns and fears about diabetes; this allows the nurse to assess for any misconceptions or misinformation regarding diabetes. Coping skills are assessed by asking how the patient has dealt with difficult situations in the past.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Risk for fluid volume deficit related to polyuria and dehydration
- Imbalanced nutrition related to imbalance of insulin, food, and physical activity
- Deficient knowledge about diabetes self-care skills/information
- Potential self-care deficit related to physical impairments or social factors
- Anxiety related to loss of control, fear of inability to manage diabetes, misinformation related to diabetes, fear of diabetes complications

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Fluid overload, pulmonary edema, heart failure
- Hypokalemia
- Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis
- Hypoglycemia
- Cerebral edema

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, optimal control of blood glucose levels, reversal of weight loss, ability to perform survival diabetes skills and self-care activities, decreased anxiety, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}

Intake and output are measured. IV fluids and electrolytes are administered as prescribed, and oral fluid intake is encouraged when it is permitted. Laboratory values of serum electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium) are monitored. Vital signs are monitored for signs of dehydration (tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension).

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL INTAKE}

The diet is planned with the control of glucose as the primary goal. It must take into consideration the patient's lifestyle, cultural background, activity level, and food preferences. An appropriate caloric intake allows the patient to achieve and maintain the desired body weight. The patient is encouraged to eat full meals and snacks as prescribed per the diabetic diet. Arrangements are made with the dietitian for extra snacks before increased physical activity. It is important for the nurse to ensure
that insulin orders are altered as needed for delays in eating because of diagnostic and other procedures.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

The nurse provides emotional support and sets aside time to talk with the patient who wishes to express feelings, cry, or ask questions about this new diagnosis. Any misconceptions the patient or family may have regarding diabetes are dispelled (see Table 41-7). The patient and family are assisted to focus on learning self-care behaviors. The patient is encouraged to perform the skills that are feared most and must be reassured that once a skill such as selfinjection or lancing a finger for glucose monitoring is performed for the first time, anxiety will decrease. Positive reinforcement is given for the self-care behaviors attempted, even if the technique is not yet completely mastered.

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-CARE}

Patient teaching (discussed earlier in the Nursing Management section and below) is the major strategy used to prepare the patient for self-care. Special equipment may be needed for instruction on diabetes survival skills, such as a magnifying glass for insulin preparation or an injection-aid device for insulin injection. Low-literacy information and literature in other languages can be obtained from the ADA. The family is also taught so that they can assist in diabetes management by, for instance, prefilling syringes or monitoring the blood glucose level. The diabetes specialist is consulted regarding various blood glucose monitors and other equipment for use by patients with physical impairments. The patient is assisted in identifying community resources for education and supplies as needed. Other members of the health care team are informed about variations in the timing of meals and the work schedule (eg, if the patient works at night or in the evenings and sleeps during the day) so that the diabetes treatment regimen can be adjusted accordingly.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Fluid Overload}

Fluid overload can occur because of the administration of a large volume of fluid at a rapid rate that is often required to treat the patient with DKA or HHNS. This risk is increased in elderly patients and in those with preexisting cardiac disease. To avoid fluid overload and resulting congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, the nurse monitors the patient closely during treatment by measuring vital signs at frequent intervals. Central venous pressure monitoring and hemodynamic monitoring may be initiated to provide additional measures of the fluid status. Physical examination focuses on assessment of cardiac rate and rhythm, breath sounds, venous distention, skin turgor, and urine output. The nurse monitors fluid intake and keeps careful records of IV and other fluid intake, along with urine output measurements.

\section*{Hypokalemia}

As previously described, hypokalemia is a potential complication during the treatment of DKA as potassium is lost from body stores. Low serum potassium levels may result from rehydration, increased urinary excretion of potassium, and movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells with insulin administration. Prevention of hypokalemia includes cautious replacement of potassium; before its administration, however, it is
important to ensure that the patient's kidneys are functioning. Because of the adverse effects of hypokalemia on cardiac function, monitoring of the cardiac rate, cardiac rhythm, electrocardiogram, and serum potassium levels is essential.

\section*{Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis}

Although the hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis that may have led to the new diagnosis of diabetes may be resolved, the patient is at risk for their subsequent recurrence. Therefore, blood glucose levels and urine ketones are monitored, and medications (insulin, oral antidiabetic agents) are administered as prescribed. The patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of impending hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis; if they occur, insulin and IV fluids are administered.

\section*{Hypoglycemia}

Hypoglycemia may occur if the patient skips or delays meals or does not follow the prescribed diet or greatly increases the amount of exercise without modifying diet and insulin. Also, the hospitalized patient or outpatient who fasts in preparation for diagnostic testing is at risk for hypoglycemia. Juice or glucose tablets are used for treatment of hypoglycemia. The patient is encouraged to eat full meals and snacks as prescribed per the diabetic diet. If hypoglycemia is a recurrent problem, the total therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated.

Because of the risk of hypoglycemia, especially with intensive insulin regimens, it is important for the nurse to review with the patient its signs and symptoms, possible causes, and measures to prevent and treat it. The nurse stresses to the patient and family the importance of having information on diabetes at home for reference.

\section*{Cerebral Edema}

Although the cause of cerebral edema is unknown, it is thought to be caused by rapid correction of hyperglycemia, resulting in fluid shifts. Cerebral edema can be prevented by gradual reduction in the blood glucose level (ADA, Hyperglycemic Crises in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus, 2003). An hourly flow sheet is used to enable close monitoring of the blood glucose level, serum electrolyte levels, urine output, mental status, and neurologic signs. Precautions are taken to minimize activities that could increase intracranial pressure.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient is taught survival skills, including simple pathophysiology; treatment modalities (insulin administration, monitoring of blood glucose, and, for type 1 diabetes, urine ketones, and diet); recognition, treatment, and prevention of acute complications (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia); and practical information (where to obtain supplies, when to call the physician). If the patient has signs of long-term diabetes complications at the time of diagnosis of diabetes, teaching about appropriate preventive behaviors (eg, foot care or eye care) should be included at this time (Chart 41-10).

\section*{Continuing Care}

Follow-up education is arranged with a home care nurse or an outpatient diabetes education center. This is particularly important for the patient who has had difficulty coping with the diagnosis, the patient who has limitations that may affect his or her

\section*{Long-Term Complications of Diabetes}

There has been a steady decline in the number of deaths of diabetic patients attributable to ketoacidosis and infection, but an alarming rise in the number of deaths from cardiovascular and renal complications. Long-term complications are becoming more
common as more people live longer with diabetes. The long-term complications of diabetes can affect almost every organ system of the body. The general categories of chronic diabetic complications are macrovascular disease, microvascular disease, and neuropathy.

The specific causes and pathogenesis of each type of complication are still being investigated. It appears, however, that increased levels of blood glucose may play a role in neuropathic disease, microvascular complications, and risk factors contributing to macrovascular complications. Hypertension may also be a major contributing factor, especially in macrovascular and microvascular diseases.

Long-term complications are seen in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes but usually do not occur within the first 5 to 10 years of the diagnosis. However, evidence of these complications may be present at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, as the patient may have had undiagnosed diabetes for many years. Renal (microvascular) disease is more prevalent among patients with type 1 diabetes, and cardiovascular (macrovascular) complications are more prevalent among older patients with type 2 diabetes.

\section*{MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS}

Diabetic macrovascular complications result from changes in the medium to large blood vessels. Blood vessel walls thicken, sclerose, and become occluded by plaque that adheres to the vessel walls. Eventually, blood flow is blocked. These atherosclerotic changes are indistinguishable from atherosclerotic changes in people without diabetes, but they tend to occur more often and at an earlier age in diabetes. Coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease are the three main types of macrovascular complications that occur more frequently in the diabetic population.

Myocardial infarction is twice as common in diabetic men and three times as common in diabetic women. There is also an increased risk for complications resulting from myocardial infarction and an increased likelihood of a second myocardial infarction. Coronary artery disease may account for $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of all deaths in patients with diabetes. One unique feature of coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes is that the typical ischemic symptoms may be absent. Thus, patients may not experience the early warning signs of decreased coronary blood flow and may have "silent" myocardial infarctions. These silent myocardial infarctions may be discovered only as changes on the electrocardiogram. This lack of ischemic symptoms may be secondary to autonomic neuropathy (see below).

Cerebral blood vessels are similarly affected by accelerated atherosclerosis. Occlusive changes or the formation of an embolus elsewhere in the vasculature that lodges in a cerebral blood vessel can lead to transient ischemic attacks and strokes. People with diabetes have twice the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease, and studies suggest there may be a greater likelihood of death from cerebrovascular disease in patients with diabetes. In addition, recovery from a stroke may be impaired in patients who have elevated blood glucose levels at the time of and immediately after a stroke. Because symptoms of cerebrovascular disease may be similar to symptoms of acute diabetic complications (HHNS or hypoglycemia), it is very important to rapidly assess the blood glucose level (and treat abnormal levels) in patients reporting these symptoms so that testing and treatment of cerebrovascular disease (stroke) can be initiated if indicated.

Atherosclerotic changes in the large blood vessels of the lower extremities are responsible for the increased incidence (two to three times higher than in nondiabetic people) of occlusive peripheral
arterial disease in patients with diabetes. Signs and symptoms of peripheral vascular disease include diminished peripheral pulses and intermittent claudication (pain in the buttock, thigh, or calf during walking). The severe form of arterial occlusive disease in the lower extremities is largely responsible for the increased incidence of gangrene and subsequent amputation in diabetic patients. Neuropathy and impairments in wound healing also play a role in diabetic foot disease (see below).

\section*{Role of Diabetes in Macrovascular Diseases}

Diabetes researchers continue to investigate the relation between diabetes and macrovascular diseases. The main feature unique to diabetes is an elevated blood glucose level; however, a direct link has not been found between hyperglycemia and atherosclerosis. Although it may be tempting to attribute the increased prevalence of macrovascular diseases to the increased prevalence of certain risk factors (eg, obesity, increased triglyceride levels, hypertension) among patients with diabetes, there is a higher-thanexpected rate of macrovascular diseases among patients with diabetes when compared with nondiabetic patients with the same risk factors (ADA, Management of Dyslipidemia in Adults With Diabetes, 2003). Thus, diabetes itself is seen as an independent risk factor for the development of accelerated atherosclerosis. Other potential factors that may play a role in diabetes-related atherosclerosis include platelet and clotting factor abnormalities, decreased flexibility of red blood cells, decreased oxygen release, changes in the arterial wall related to hyperglycemia, and possibly hyperinsulinemia.

\section*{Management}

Management of macrovascular complications involves prevention and treatment of the commonly accepted risk factors for atherosclerosis. Diet and exercise are important in managing obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. In addition, the use of medications to control hypertension and hyperlipidemia may be indicated. Smoking cessation is essential. Control of blood glucose levels may reduce triglyceride levels and can significantly reduce the incidence of complications.

When macrovascular complications do occur, treatment is the same as with nondiabetic patients. In addition, patients may require increased amounts of insulin or may need to switch from oral antidiabetic agents to insulin during illnesses.

\section*{MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS AND DIABETIC RETINOPATHY}

Although macrovascular atherosclerotic changes are seen in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, the microvascular changes are unique to diabetes. Diabetic microvascular disease (or microangiopathy) is characterized by capillary basement membrane thickening. The basement membrane surrounds the endothelial cells of the capillary. Researchers believe that increased blood glucose levels react through a series of biochemical responses to thicken the basement membrane to several times its normal thickness. Two areas affected by these changes are the retina and the kidneys. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people between 20 and 74 years of age in the United States; it occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (ADA, Diabetic Retinopathy, 2003). Similarly, about one in every four individuals starting dialysis has diabetic nephropathy.

People with diabetes are subject to multiple visual complications (Table 41-9). The eye pathology referred to as diabetic retinopathy is caused by changes in the small blood vessels in the retina, the area of the eye that receives images and sends information about the images to the brain (Fig. 41-9). It is richly supplied with blood vessels of all kinds: small arteries and veins, arterioles, venules, and capillaries. There are three main stages of retinopathy: nonproliferative (background) retinopathy, preproliferative retinopathy, and proliferative retinopathy.

Nearly all patients with type 1 diabetes and more than $60 \%$ of patients with type 2 diabetes have some degree of retinopathy after 20 years (ADA, Diabetic Retinopathy, 2003). Changes in the microvasculature include microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhage, hard exudates, and focal capillary closure. Although most patients do not develop visual impairment, it can be devastating if it occurs. A complication of nonproliferative retinopathy, macular edema, occurs in approximately $10 \%$ of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and may lead to visual distortion and loss of central vision.

An advanced form of background retinopathy, preproliferative retinopathy, is considered a precursor to the more serious proliferative retinopathy. In preproliferative retinopathy, there

It may take up to 2 months of improved blood glucose control before hyperglycemic swelling subsides and vision stabilizes. Therefore, patients are advised not to change eyeglass prescriptions during the 2 months after discovery of hyperglycemia. \\

are more widespread vascular changes and loss of nerve fibers. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that $10 \%$ to $50 \%$ of patients with preproliferative retinopathy will develop proliferative retinopathy within a short time (possibly as little as 1 year). As with background retinopathy, if visual changes occur during the preproliferative stage, they are usually caused by macular edema.

Proliferative retinopathy represents the greatest threat to vision. Proliferative retinopathy is characterized by the proliferation of new blood vessels growing from the retina into the vitreous. These new vessels are prone to bleeding. The visual loss associated with proliferative retinopathy is caused by this vitreous hemorrhage and/or retinal detachment. The vitreous is normally clear, allowing light to be transmitted to the retina. When there is a hemorrhage, the vitreous becomes clouded and cannot transmit light, resulting in loss of vision. Another consequence of vitreous hemorrhage is that resorption of the blood in the vitreous leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue. This scar tissue may place traction on the retina, resulting in retinal detachment and subsequent visual loss.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Retinopathy is a painless process. In nonproliferative and preproliferative retinopathy, blurry vision secondary to macular edema occurs in some patients, although many patients are asymptomatic. Even patients with a significant degree of proliferative retinopathy and some hemorrhaging may not experience major visual changes. However, symptoms indicative of hemorrhaging include floaters or cobwebs in the visual field, or sudden visual changes including spotty or hazy vision, or complete loss of vision.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis is by direct visualization with an ophthalmoscope or with a technique known as fluorescein angiography. Fluorescein angiography can document the type and activity of the retinopathy. Dye is injected into an arm vein and is carried to various parts of the body through the blood, but especially through the vessels of the retina of the eye. This technique allows the ophthalmologist, using special instruments, to see the retinal vessels in bright detail and gives useful information that cannot be obtained with just an ophthalmoscope.

Side effects of this diagnostic procedure may include nausea during the dye injection; yellowish, fluorescent discoloration of
the skin and urine lasting 12 to 24 hours; and occasional allergic reactions, usually manifested by hives or itching. Generally, however, it is a safe diagnostic procedure. Patient preparation includes explaining:
- The steps of the procedure
- The fact that the procedure is painless
- The potential side effects
- The type of information the technique can provide
- That the flash of the camera may be slightly uncomfortable for a short time

\section*{Medical Management}

The first focus of management is on primary and secondary prevention. The results of the DCCT study demonstrated that maintenance of blood glucose to a normal or near-normal level in type 1 diabetes through intensive insulin therapy and patient education decreased the risk for development of retinopathy by $76 \%$ when compared with conventional therapy in patients without preexisting retinopathy. The progression of retinopathy was decreased by $54 \%$ in patients with very mild to moderate nonproliferative retinopathy at the time of initiation of treatment. Similarly, the UKPDS study demonstrated a reduced risk of retinopathy in type 2 diabetes with better control of blood glucose levels (ADA, Diabetic Retinopathy, 2003).

For advanced cases, the main treatment of diabetic retinopathy is argon laser photocoagulation. The laser treatment destroys leaking blood vessels and areas of neovascularization. For patients at increased risk for hemorrhaging, panretinal photocoagulation may significantly reduce the rate of progression to blindness. Panretinal photocoagulation involves the systematic application of multiple (more than 1,000 ) laser burns throughout the retina (except in the macular region). This stops the widespread growth of new vessels and hemorrhaging of damaged vessels. The role of "mild" panretinal photocoagulation (with only a third to a half as many laser burns) in the early stages of proliferative retinopathy or in patients with preproliferative changes is being investigated. For macular edema, focal photocoagulation is used to apply smaller laser burns to specific areas of microaneurysms in the macular region. This may reduce the rate of visual loss from macular edema by 50\% (ADA, Diabetic Retinopathy, 2003).

Photocoagulation treatments are usually performed on an outpatient basis, and most patients can return to their usual activities by the next day. For some patients, limitations may be placed on activities involving weight bearing or bearing down. For most
patients, the treatment does not cause intense pain, although they may report varying degrees of discomfort. Usually an anesthetic eye drop is all that is needed during the treatment. A few patients may experience slight visual loss, loss of peripheral vision, or impairments in adaptation to the dark. For most patients, however, the risk of slight visual changes from the laser treatment itself is much less than the potential for loss of vision from progression of retinopathy.

When a major hemorrhage into the vitreous occurs, the vitreous fluid becomes mixed with blood and prevents light from passing through the eye; this can cause blindness. A vitrectomy is a surgical procedure in which vitreous humor filled with blood or fibrous tissue is removed with a special drill-like instrument and replaced with saline or another liquid. A vitrectomy is performed on patients who already have visual loss and in whom the vitreous hemorrhage has not cleared on its own after 6 months. The purpose is to restore useful vision; recovery to near-normal vision is not usually expected. Other strategies that may slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy include:
- Control of hypertension
- Control of blood glucose
- Cessation of smoking

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of patients with diabetic retinopathy or other eye disorders involves implementing the individual plan of care and providing patient education. Education focuses on prevention through regular ophthalmologic examinations and blood glucose control and self-management of eye care regimens. The effectiveness of early diagnosis and prompt treatment is emphasized in teaching the patient and family. If vision loss occurs, nursing care must also address the patient's adjustment to impaired vision and use of adaptive devices for diabetes self-care as well as activities of daily living. Nursing care for the patient with low vision or loss of vision is discussed in detail in Chapter 58.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. In all forms of therapy for retinopathy, something is destroyed in the process of saving vision, and the facts must be presented to the patient and family as honestly as possible. The course of the retinopathy may be long and stressful. In teaching and counseling the patient, it is important to stress the following:
- Retinopathy may appear after many years of diabetes, and its appearance does not necessarily mean that the diabetes is on a downhill course.
- The odds for maintaining vision are in the patient's favor, especially with adequate control of glucose levels and blood pressure.
- Frequent eye examinations are the best way to preserve vision, because they allow for the detection of any retinopathy.
Some additional points to keep in mind when the patient with diabetes has some type of visual impairment include the following:
- Visual impairment can be a shock. The person's response to vision loss depends on personality, self-concept, and coping mechanisms.
- As in any loss, acceptance of blindness by the patient occurs in stages; some patients may learn to accept blindness in a rather short period, and others may never do so.
- Although retinopathy occurs bilaterally, the severity may differ in the two eyes.
- Many of the chronic complications of diabetes occur simultaneously. For example, a patient who is blind due to diabetic retinopathy may also have peripheral neuropathy and may experience impairment of manual dexterity and tactile sensation.

Continuing Care. Continuing care for the patient with impaired vision due to diabetic changes depends on the severity of the impairment and the effectiveness of the patient's coping in response to the impairment. The importance of careful diabetes management is emphasized as one means of slowing the progression of visual changes. The patient is reminded of the need to see the ophthalmologist regularly. If eye changes are progressive and unrelenting, the patient needs to be prepared for inevitable blindness. Therefore, consideration is given to making referrals for teaching the patient Braille and for training with a guide dog. Referral to state agencies should be made to ensure that the patient receives services for the blind. Family members are also taught how to assist the patient to remain as independent as possible despite decreasing visual acuity.

Referral for home care may be indicated for some patients, particularly those who live alone, those not coping well, and those who have other health problems or complications of diabetes that may interfere with their ability to perform self-care. During home visits, the nurse can assess the patient's home environment and ability to manage diabetes despite visual impairments. Medical management and nursing care of patients with visual disturbances are discussed in detail in Chapter 58.

\section*{NEPHROPATHY}

Nephropathy, or renal disease secondary to diabetic microvascular changes in the kidney, is a common complication of diabetes. People with diabetes account for nearly half of new cases of endstage renal disease (ESRD) each year and about a quarter of those requiring dialysis or transplantation each year in the United States. About $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes develop nephropathy, but fewer of those with type 2 diabetes progress to ESRD. Native American, Hispanic, and AfricanAmerican persons with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk for ESRD than non-Hispanic whites (ADA, Diabetic Nephropathy, 2003).

Patients with type 1 diabetes frequently show initial signs of renal disease after 10 to 15 years, whereas patients with type 2 diabetes develop renal disease within 10 years of the diagnosis of diabetes. Many patients with type 2 diabetes have had diabetes for many years before it was diagnosed and treated. Therefore, they have evidence of nephropathy at the time of diagnosis.

There is no reliable method to predict whether a person will develop renal disease. The DCCT results showed that intensive treatment of diabetes with a goal of achieving a hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{C}}$ level as close to the nondiabetic range as possible reduced the occurrence of early signs of nephropathy, such as microalbuminuria by $39 \%$, and albuminuria by $54 \%$. Similarly, the UKPDS study demonstrated a reduced incidence of overt nephropathy in type 2 diabetes with control of blood glucose levels (ADA, Diabetic Nephropathy, 2003).

Soon after the onset of diabetes, and especially if the blood glucose levels are elevated, the kidney's filtration mechanism is stressed, allowing blood proteins to leak into the urine. As a result, the pressure in the blood vessels of the kidney increases. It is
thought that the elevated pressure serves as the stimulus for the development of nephropathy. Various medications and diets are being tested to prevent these complications.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Most of the signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction in the patient with diabetes are similar to those seen in patients without diabetes. (See Chap. 45 for the management of patients with renal disorders.) Also, as renal failure progresses, the catabolism (breakdown) of both exogenous and endogenous insulin decreases, and frequent hypoglycemic episodes may result. Insulin needs change as a result of changes in the catabolism of insulin, and also as a result of changes in diet related to the treatment of nephropathy. The stress of renal disease affects self-esteem, family relationships, marital relations, and virtually all aspects of daily life. As renal function decreases, the patient commonly has multiple-system failure (eg, declining visual acuity, impotence, foot ulcerations, heart failure, and nocturnal diarrhea).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

One of the most important blood proteins that leaks into the urine is albumin. Small amounts may leak undetected for years. Of patients with microalbuminuria, clinical nephropathy eventually develops in more than $85 \%$. However, if microalbuminuria is not present, nephropathy develops in fewer than 5\%. Early microalbuminuria may also be discovered in a 24 -hour urine sample. The urine should be checked annually for microalbuminuria. If the microalbuminuria level exceeds $30 \mathrm{mg} / 24$ hours on two consecutive tests, treatment is indicated (see Medical Management section below).

When a urine dipstick test reads consistently positive for significant amounts of albumin, serum creatinine and BUN levels are obtained. At this point in the development of renal disease, diagnostic testing for cardiac or other systemic problems may also be required. Some of the tests involve injection of special dyes that are not easily cleared by the damaged kidney, so the value of the diagnostic test must be weighed against the potential risks.

Hypertension often develops in patients (both diabetic and nondiabetic) who are in the early stages of renal disease. However, essential hypertension occurs in up to $50 \%$ of all individuals with diabetes (for unknown reasons). Thus, it should not be assumed that someone with diabetes who has hypertension also has renal disease; other diagnostic criteria must also be present.

\section*{Medical Management}

In addition to achieving and maintaining near-normal blood glucose levels, management for all patients with diabetes should include careful attention to the following:
- Control of hypertension (the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, such as captopril, because control of hypertension may also decrease or delay the onset of early proteinuria)
- Prevention or vigorous treatment of urinary tract infections
- Avoidance of nephrotoxic substances
- Adjustment of medications as renal function changes
- Low-sodium diet
- Low-protein diet

If the patient has already developed microalbuminuria and its level exceeds $30 \mathrm{mg} / 24$ hours on two consecutive tests, an ACE
inhibitor should be prescribed. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce microalbuminuria and therefore protect the kidney. Alternatively, angiotensin-receptor blocking (ARB) agents may be prescribed. This preventive strategy should be part of the standard of care for the person with diabetes. Carefully designed low-protein diets also appear to reverse early leakage of small amounts of protein from the kidney (ADA, Clinical Practice Recommendations, 2003; ADA, Diabetic Nephropathy, 2003).

In chronic or end-stage renal failure, two types of treatment are available: dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) and transplantation from a relative or a cadaver. Hemodialysis for the patient with diabetes is similar to that for patients without the disease (see Chap. 44). Because hemodialysis creates additional stress on patients with cardiovascular disease, it may not be appropriate for certain patients. In addition, it is extremely intrusive into a patient's life.

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is being used by an increasing number of patients with diabetes, mainly because of the independence it allows patients. In addition, insulin can be mixed into the dialysate, which may result in better blood glucose control and end the need for insulin injections. However, these patients may require more insulin because the dialysate contains glucose. Major risks of peritoneal dialysis are infection and peritonitis. The mortality rate for diabetic patients undergoing dialysis is higher than that in patients without diabetes undergoing dialysis and is closely related to the severity of cardiovascular problems.

Renal disease is frequently accompanied by advancing retinopathy that may require laser treatments and surgery. Severe hypertension also worsens eye disease because of the additional stress it places on the blood vessels. Patients being treated with hemodialysis who require eye surgery may be changed to peritoneal dialysis and have their hypertension aggressively controlled for several weeks before surgery. The rationale for this change is that hemodialysis requires anticoagulants that can increase the risk of bleeding after the surgery, and peritoneal dialysis minimizes pressure changes in the eyes.

The success rate for kidney transplantation in patients with diabetes has improved. In medical centers performing large numbers of transplants, the chances are $75 \%$ to $80 \%$ that the transplanted kidney will continue to function in the patient with diabetes for at least 5 years. Like the original kidneys, transplanted kidneys in patients with diabetes can eventually be damaged if blood glucose levels are consistently high after the transplantation. Therefore, monitoring blood glucose levels frequently and adjusting insulin levels in diabetic patients with transplanted kidneys are essential for long-term success. Pancreas transplants are sometimes attempted when a kidney transplant is performed. Pancreatic transplants have not been successful enough to be performed alone because of the risks associated with immunosuppression.

\section*{DIABETIC NEUROPATHIES}

Diabetic neuropathy refers to a group of diseases that affect all types of nerves, including peripheral (sensorimotor), autonomic, and spinal nerves. The disorders appear to be clinically diverse and depend on the location of the affected nerve cells. The prevalence increases with the age of the patient and the duration of the disease and may be as high as $50 \%$ in patients who have had diabetes for 25 years.

Elevated blood glucose levels over a period of years have been implicated in the etiology of neuropathy. The pathogenesis of
neuropathy may be attributed to either a vascular or a metabolic mechanism or both, but their relative contributions have yet to be determined. Capillary basement membrane thickening and capillary closure may be present. In addition, there may be demyelinization of the nerves, which is thought to be related to hyperglycemia. Nerve conduction is disrupted when there are aberrations of the myelin sheaths. Control of blood glucose levels to normal or near-normal levels was shown in the DCCT study to decrease the incidence of neuropathy by $60 \%$.

The two most common types of diabetic neuropathy are sensorimotor polyneuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. Cranial mononeuropathies, for example, those affecting the oculomotor nerve, also occur in diabetes, especially among the elderly.

Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is a diabetic neuropathy also called peripheral neuropathy. It most commonly affects the distal portions of the nerves, especially the nerves of the lower extremities. It affects both sides of the body symmetrically and may spread in a proximal direction.

\section*{Peripheral Neuropathy}

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

Initial symptoms include paresthesias (prickling, tingling, or heightened sensation) and burning sensations (especially at night). As the neuropathy progresses, the feet become numb. In addition, a decrease in proprioception (awareness of posture and movement of the body and of position and weight of objects in relation to the body) and a decreased sensation of light touch may lead to an unsteady gait. Decreased sensations of pain and temperature place patients with neuropathy at increased risk for injury and undetected foot infections. Deformities of the foot may also occur, with neuropathy-related joint changes producing Charcot joints. These joint deformities result from the abnormal weight distribution on joints due to lack of proprioception.

On physical examination, a decrease in deep tendon reflexes and vibratory sensation is found. For patients who have few or no symptoms of neuropathy, these physical findings may be the only indication of neuropathic changes. For patients with signs or symptoms of neuropathy, it is important to rule out other possible neuropathies, including alcohol-induced or vitamin-deficiency neuropathies.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

The results of the DCCT study demonstrate that intensive insulin therapy and control of blood glucose levels delay the onset and slow the progression of neuropathy. Pain, particularly of the lower extremities, is a disturbing symptom in some people with neuropathy secondary to diabetes. For some patients, neuropathic pain spontaneously resolves within 6 months. For other patients, pain persists for many years. Various approaches to pain management can be tried. These include analgesics (preferably nonopioid); tricyclic antidepressants; phenytoin, carbamazepine, or gabapentin (antiseizure medications); mexiletine (an antiarrhythmic); or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

The use of aldose reductase inhibitors is under study to determine whether they block the damaging effects of hyperglycemia. The topical medication capsaicin (Axscain) also has been shown in preliminary reports to decrease lower-extremity neuropathic pain. Studies of the role of this topical medication in neuropathy continue.

\section*{Autonomic Neuropathies}

Neuropathy of the autonomic nervous system results in a broad range of dysfunctions affecting almost every organ system of the body. Three manifestations of autonomic neuropathy are related to the cardiac, GI, and renal systems Cardiovascular symptoms range from fixed, slightly tachycardic heart rate; orthostatic hypotension; and silent, or painless, myocardial ischemia and infarction. Delayed gastric emptying may occur with the typical symptoms of early satiety, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. In addition, there may be unexplained wide swings in blood glucose levels related to inconsistent absorption of the glucose from ingested foods secondary to the inconsistent gastric emptying. "Diabetic" constipation or diarrhea (especially nocturnal diarrhea) may occur as a result.

Urinary retention, a decreased sensation of bladder fullness, and other urinary symptoms of neurogenic bladder result from autonomic neuropathy. Patients with a neurogenic bladder are predisposed to developing urinary tract infections due to inability to completely empty the bladder. This is especially true in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, because hyperglycemia impairs resistance to infection

\section*{HYPOGLYCEMIC UNAWARENESS}

Autonomic neuropathy of the adrenal medulla is responsible for diminished or absent adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients may report that they no longer feel the typical shakiness, sweating, nervousness, and palpitations associated with hypoglycemia. Strict blood glucose monitoring, including frequent SMBG, is recommended for these patients. Their inability to detect and treat these warning signs of hypoglycemia puts them at risk for developing dangerously low blood glucose levels. Therefore, their goals for blood glucose levels may need to be adjusted to reduce the risk for hypoglycemia. The patient and family need to be taught to recognize subtle signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (Tkacs, 2002).

\section*{SUDOMOTOR NEUROPATHY}

This neuropathic condition refers to a decrease or absence of sweating (anhidrosis) of the extremities, with a compensatory increase in upper body sweating. Dryness of the feet increases the risk for the development of foot ulcers.

\section*{SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION}

Sexual dysfunction, especially impotence in men, is a complication of diabetes. The effects of autonomic neuropathy on female sexual functioning are not well documented. Reduced vaginal lubrication has been mentioned as a possible neuropathic effect; other possible changes in sexual function in women with diabetes include decreased libido and lack of orgasm. Vaginal infection, increased in incidence in women with diabetes, may be associated with decreased lubrication and vaginal itching and tenderness. Urinary tract infections and vaginitis may also affect sexual function (Tilton, 1997).

Impotence (inability of the penis to become rigid and sustain an erection adequate for penetration) occurs with greater frequency in diabetic men than in nondiabetic men of the same age. However, diabetic neuropathy is not the only cause of impotence in men with diabetes. Medications such as antihypertensive agents, psychological factors, and other medical conditions (eg, vascular insufficiency) that may affect nondiabetic men also play a role in impotence in diabetic men.

Some men with autonomic neuropathy have normal erectile function and can experience orgasm but do not ejaculate. Retrograde ejaculation occurs: seminal fluid is propelled backward through the posterior urethra and into the urinary bladder. Examination of the urine confirms the diagnosis because of the large number of active sperm present. Fertility counseling is necessary for couples attempting conception.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Management strategies depend on the symptoms. There is no treatment for painless cardiac ischemia, and the prognosis is poor. Detection, however, is important so that education about avoiding strenuous exercise can be provided. Orthostatic hypotension may respond to a diet high in sodium, the discontinuation of medications that impede autonomic nervous system responses, the use of sympathomimetics and other agents (eg, caffeine) that stimulate an autonomic response, and the use of lower-body elastic garments that maximize venous return and prevent pooling of blood in the extremities.

Treatment of delayed gastric emptying includes a low-fat diet, frequent small meals, close blood glucose control, and use of agents that increase gastric motility (eg, metoclopramide, bethanechol). Treatment of diabetic diarrhea may include bulkforming laxatives or antidiarrheal agents. Constipation is treated with a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration; medications, laxatives, and enemas may be necessary when constipation is severe. Management of the patient with a neurogenic bladder is discussed in Chapter 44.

Treatment of sudomotor dysfunction focuses on education about skin care and heat intolerance. Erectile dysfunction is discussed in Chapter 49.

\section*{FOOT AND LEG PROBLEMS}

From 50\% to 75\% of lower extremity amputations are performed on people with diabetes. More than $50 \%$ of these amputations are thought to be preventable, provided patients are taught foot care measures and practice them on a daily basis (ADA, Preventive Foot Care in People With Diabetes, 2003). Complications of diabetes that contribute to the increased risk of foot infections include:
- Neuropathy: Sensory neuropathy leads to loss of pain and pressure sensation, and autonomic neuropathy leads to increased dryness and fissuring of the skin (secondary to decreased sweating). Motor neuropathy results in muscular atrophy, which may lead to changes in the shape of the foot.
- Peripheral vascular disease: Poor circulation of the lower extremities contributes to poor wound healing and the development of gangrene.
- Immunocompromise: Hyperglycemia impairs the ability of specialized leukocytes to destroy bacteria. Thus, in poorly controlled diabetes, there is a lowered resistance to certain infections.

The typical sequence of events in the development of a diabetic foot ulcer begins with a soft tissue injury of the foot, formation of a fissure between the toes or in an area of dry skin, or formation of a callus (Fig. 41-10). Injuries are not felt by the patient with an insensitive foot and may be thermal (eg, from using heating pads, walking barefoot on hot concrete, or testing bath water with the foot), chemical (eg, burning the foot while using caustic agents on calluses, corns, or bunions), or traumatic (eg,

\begin{figure}

\caption{EIGURE 41-10 Neuropathic ulcers occur on pressure points in areas with diminished sensation in diabetic polyneuropathy. Pain is absent (and therefore the ulcer may go unnoticed).}
\end{figure}
injuring skin while cutting nails, walking with an undetected foreign object in the shoe, or wearing ill-fitting shoes and socks).

If the patient is not in the habit of thoroughly inspecting both feet on a daily basis, the injury or fissure may go unnoticed until a serious infection has developed. Drainage, swelling, redness (from cellulitis) of the leg, or gangrene may be the first sign of foot problems that the patient notices. Treatment of foot ulcers involves bed rest, antibiotics, and débridement. In addition, controlling glucose levels, which tend to increase when infections occur, is important for promoting wound healing. In patients with peripheral vascular disease, foot ulcers may not heal because of the decreased ability of oxygen, nutrients, and antibiotics to reach the injured tissue. Amputation may be necessary to prevent the spread of infection.

Foot assessment and foot care instructions are most important when caring for patients who are at high risk for developing foot infections. Some of the high-risk characteristics include:
- Duration of diabetes more than 10 years
- Age older than 40 years
- History of smoking
- Decreased peripheral pulses
- Decreased sensation
- Anatomic deformities or pressure areas (eg, bunions, calluses, hammer toes)
- History of previous foot ulcers or amputation

\section*{Management}

Teaching patients proper foot care is a nursing intervention that can prevent costly, painful, and debilitating complications. Preventive foot care begins with careful daily assessment of the feet. The feet must be inspected on a daily basis for any redness, blisters, fissures, calluses, ulcerations, changes in skin temperature, and the development of foot deformities (ie, hammer toes, bunions). For patients with visual impairment or decreased joint mobility (especially the elderly), use of a mirror to inspect the bottom of the feet or the help of a family member in foot inspection may be necessary. The interior surfaces of shoes should be inspected for any rough spots or foreign objects.

In addition to the daily visual and manual inspection of the feet, the feet should be examined during every health care visit or at least once per year (more often if there is an increase in the patient's risk) by a podiatrist, physician, or nurse (Fritschi, 2001). Patients with neuropathy should also undergo evaluation of neurologic status using a monofilament device by an experienced examiner (Fig. 41-11). Patients with pressure areas, such as calluses, or thick toenails should see the podiatrist routinely for treatment of calluses and trimming of nails.

Additional aspects of preventive foot care that are taught to the patient and family include the following:
- Properly bathing, drying, and lubricating the feet, taking care not to allow moisture (water or lotion) to accumulate between the toes
- Wearing closed-toe shoes that fit well. Podiatrists can provide patients with inserts (orthotics) to remove pressure from pressure points on the foot. New shoes should be broken in slowly (ie, worn for 1 to 2 hours initially, with gradual increases in the length of time worn) to avoid blister formation. Patients with bony deformities may need extrawide shoes or extra-depth shoes. High-risk behaviors should be avoided, such as walking barefoot, using heating pads on the feet, wearing open-toed shoes, soaking the feet, and shaving calluses.
- Trimming toenails straight across and filing sharp corners to follow the contour of the toe (American Association of Diabetes Educators, 1998). If patients have visual deficits or thickened toenails, a podiatrist should cut the nails.
- Reducing risk factors, such as smoking and elevated blood lipids, that contribute to peripheral vascular disease
- Avoiding home remedies or over-the-counter agents or selfmedicating to treat foot problems (Fritschi, 2001)

Blood glucose control is important for avoiding decreased resistance to infections and for preventing diabetic neuropathy. The patient may be referred by the physician to a wound care center for managing persistent wounds of the feet or legs. Many wound care centers provide diabetes education; however, the pa-
tient needs to discuss recommendations for treating wounds with his or her own physician, as well as raising any questions about diabetes management.

\section*{Special Issues in Diabetes Care}

\section*{THE PATIENT WITH DIABETES UNDERGOING SURGERY}

During periods of physiologic stress such as surgery, blood glucose levels tend to rise as a result of an increase in the level of stress hormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone). If hyperglycemia is not controlled during surgery, the resulting osmotic diuresis may lead to excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes. Patients with type 1 diabetes also risk developing ketoacidosis during periods of stress.

Hypoglycemia is also a concern in diabetic patients undergoing surgery. This is especially a concern during the preoperative period if surgery is delayed beyond the morning in a patient who received a morning injection of intermediate-acting insulin.

There are various approaches to managing glucose control during the perioperative period. Frequent capillary glucose monitoring is essential throughout the preoperative and postoperative periods, regardless of the method used for glucose control. Examples of these approaches are as follows, although the use of IV insulin and dextrose has become widespread with the increased availability of meters for intraoperative glucose monitoring:
- The morning of surgery, all subcutaneous insulin doses are withheld (unless the blood glucose level is elevated-for example, more than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ [ $11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ], in which case a small dose of subcutaneous regular insulin may be prescribed). The blood glucose level is controlled during surgery with the IV infusion of regular insulin, which is balanced by an infusion of dextrose. The insulin and dextrose infusion rates are adjusted according to frequent (hourly) capillary glucose determinations. After surgery, the insulin infusion may be continued until the patient can eat. If IV insulin is

\end{figure}
discontinued, subcutaneous regular insulin may be administered at set intervals (every 4 to 6 hours), or intermediateacting insulin may be administered every 12 hours with supplemental regular insulin as necessary until the patient is eating and the usual pattern of insulin dosing is resumed. The nurse caring for a patient with diabetes who is receiving IV insulin must carefully monitor the insulin infusion rate and blood glucose levels. IV insulin has a much shorter duration of action than subcutaneous insulin. Thus, if the infusion is interrupted or discontinued, hyperglycemia will develop rapidly (within 1 hour in type 1 diabetes and within a few hours in type 2 diabetes). The nurse must ensure that subcutaneous insulin is administered 30 minutes before discontinuing the IV insulin infusion.
- One half to two thirds of the patient's usual morning dose of insulin (either intermediate-acting insulin alone or both short- and intermediate-acting insulins) is administered subcutaneously in the morning before surgery. The remainder is then administered after surgery.
- The patient's usual daily dose of subcutaneous insulin is divided into four equal doses of regular insulin. These are then administered at 6 -hour intervals. The last two approaches do not provide the control achieved by IV administration of insulin and dextrose.
- Patients with type 2 diabetes who do not usually take insulin may require insulin during the perioperative period to control blood glucose elevations. Patients who are taking chlorpropamide, a long-acting oral antidiabetic agent, may be instructed to discontinue the oral agent 24 to 48 hours before surgery. Some of these patients may resume their usual regimen of diet and oral agent during the recovery period. Other patients (whose diabetes is probably not well controlled with diet and an oral antidiabetic agent before surgery) need to continue with insulin injections after discharge.
- For patients with type 2 diabetes who are undergoing minor surgery but who do not normally take insulin, glucose levels may remain stable provided no dextrose is infused during the surgery. After surgery, they may require small doses of regular insulin until the usual diet and oral agent are resumed.

During the postoperative period, diabetic patients must also be closely monitored for cardiovascular complications because of the increased prevalence of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes, wound infections, and skin breakdown (especially in the patient with decreased pain sensation in the extremities due to neuropathy). Maintaining adequate nutrition and blood glucose control promotes wound healing.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF HOSPITALIZED DIABETIC PATIENTS}

At any one time, $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of general medical-surgical patients in the hospital have diabetes. This number may increase as elderly patients make up a greater proportion of the population. Although some hospitals may have a specialized diabetic/metabolic unit, typically patients with diabetes are admitted throughout the hospital.

Often diabetes is not the primary medical diagnosis, yet problems with the control of diabetes frequently result from changes in the patient's normal routine or from surgery or illness. Some of the main issues pertinent to nursing care of the hospitalized diabetic patient are presented in the following section.

\section*{Self-Care Issues}

All patients admitted to the hospital must relinquish control of some aspects of their daily care to the hospital staff. For the patient with diabetes who is actively involved in diabetes selfmanagement (especially insulin dose adjustment), relinquishing control over meal timing, insulin timing, and insulin dosage may be particularly difficult. The patient may fear hypoglycemia and express much concern over possible delays in receiving attention from the nurse if hypoglycemic symptoms occur.

It is important for the nurse to acknowledge the patient's concerns and to involve the patient as much as possible in the plan of care. If the patient disagrees with certain aspects of the nursing or medical care related to diabetes, the nurse must communicate this to other members of the health care team and, where appropriate, make changes in the plan to meet the patient's needs. The nurse and other health care providers need to pay particular attention to patients who are successful in managing self-care, assess their self-care management skills, and encourage them to continue their self-care management if correct and appropriate.

\section*{Hyperglycemia During Hospitalization}

Hyperglycemia may occur in the hospitalized patient as a result of the original illness that led to the need for hospitalization. In addition, a number of other factors may contribute to hyperglycemia, such as:
- Changes in the usual treatment regimen (eg, increased food, decreased insulin, decreased activity)
- Medications (eg, glucocorticoids such as prednisone, which are used in the treatment of a variety of inflammatory disorders)
- IV dextrose, which may be part of the maintenance fluids or may be used for the administration of antibiotics and other medications
- Overly vigorous treatment of hypoglycemia
- Mismatched timing of meals and insulin (eg, postmeal hyperglycemia may occur if short-acting insulin is administered immediately before or even after meals)

Nursing actions to correct some of these factors are important for avoiding hyperglycemia. Assessment of the patient's usual home routine is important. The nurse should try to approximate as much as possible the home schedule of insulin, meals, and activities. Monitoring blood glucose levels has been identified by the ADA as an additional "vital sign" essential in assessing the patient's status (ADA, Bedside Blood Glucose Monitoring in Hospitals, 2003). The results of blood glucose monitoring provide information needed to obtain orders for extra doses of insulin (at times when insulin is usually taken by the patient), an important nursing function. The insulin doses must not be withheld when blood glucose levels are normal.

Short-acting insulin is usually needed to avoid postprandial hyperglycemia (even in the patient with normal premeal glucose levels), and NPH insulin does not peak until many hours after the dose is given. IV antibiotics should be mixed in normal saline (if possible) to avoid excess infusion of dextrose (especially in the patient who is eating). It is important to avoid overly vigorous treatment of hypoglycemia, which may lead to hyperglycemia. Treatment of hypoglycemia should be based on the established hospital protocol (usually 15 g carbohydrate in the form of juice, glucose tablets, or, if necessary, 0.5 to 1 ampule of $50 \%$ dextrose administered intravenously). Extra sugar should not be added to
the juice. If the initial treatment does not increase the glucose level adequately, the same treatment may be repeated.

\section*{Hypoglycemia During Hospitalization}

Hypoglycemia in a hospitalized patient is usually the result of too much insulin or delays in eating. Specific examples include:
- Overuse of "sliding scale" regular insulin, particularly as a supplement to regularly scheduled, twice-daily short- and intermediate-acting insulins
- Lack of dosage change when dietary intake is changed (eg, in the patient taking nothing by mouth)
- Overly vigorous treatment of hyperglycemia (eg, giving toofrequent successive doses of regular insulin before the time of peak insulin activity is reached) so that there is an accumulated effect
- Delayed meal after administration of lispro or aspart insulin (patient should eat within 15 minutes of administration)
Nurses must assess the pattern of glucose values and avoid giving doses of insulin that repeatedly lead to hypoglycemia. Successive doses of subcutaneous regular insulin should be administered no more frequently than every 3 to 4 hours. For patients receiving NPH or Lente insulin before breakfast and dinner, the nurse must use caution in administering supplemental doses of regular insulin at lunch and bedtime. Hypoglycemia may occur when two insulins peak at similar times (eg, morning NPH peaks with lunchtime regular insulin and may lead to late-afternoon hypoglycemia, and dinnertime NPH peaks with bedtime regular insulin and may lead to nocturnal hypoglycemia). To avoid hypoglycemic reactions caused by delayed food intake, the nurse should arrange for a snack to be given to the patient if meals are going to be delayed because of procedures, physical therapy, or other activities.

\section*{Common Alterations in Diet}

Dietary modifications common during hospitalization require special consideration when the patient has diabetes.

\section*{NPO (NOTHING BY MOUTH)}

For the patient who must have nothing by mouth in preparation for diagnostic or surgical procedures, the nurse must ensure that the usual insulin dosage has been changed. These changes may include eliminating the regular insulin and giving a decreased amount (eg, half the usual dose) of intermediate-acting NPH or Lente insulin. Another approach is to use frequent (every 3 to 4 hours) dosing of regular insulin only. IV dextrose may be administered to provide calories and to avoid hypoglycemia.

Even when no food is taken, glucose levels may rise as a result of hepatic glucose production, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes and lean patients with type 2 diabetes. Further, in type 1 diabetes, elimination of the insulin dose may lead to the development of DKA. Thus, administering insulin to the patient with type 1 diabetes who is NPO is an important nursing action.

For patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking insulin, DKA does not develop when insulin doses are eliminated because the patient's pancreas produces some insulin. Thus, skipping the insulin dose altogether when the patient has type 2 diabetes (and is receiving IV dextrose) may be safe; however, close monitoring is essential.

For patients who are NPO for extended periods, glucose testing and insulin administration should be performed at regular intervals, usually two to four times per day. Insulin regimens for the patient who is NPO for an extended period may include NPH insulin every 12 hours (with regular insulin added to the NPH, depending on the results of glucose testing) or regular insulin only every 4 to 6 hours. These patients should receive dextrose infusions to provide some calories and limit ketosis.

To prevent these problems resulting from the need to withhold food, diagnostic tests and procedures and surgery should be scheduled early in the morning if possible.

\section*{CLEAR LIQUID DIET}

When the diet is advanced to include clear liquids, the diabetic patient will be receiving more simple carbohydrate foods, such as juice and gelatin desserts, than are usually included in the diabetic diet. It is important for hospitalized patients to maintain their nutritional status as much as possible to promote healing. Thus, the use of reduced-calorie substitutes such as diet soda or diet gelatin desserts would not be appropriate when the only source of calories is clear liquids. Simple carbohydrates, when eaten alone, cause a rapid rise in blood glucose levels; thus, it is important to try to match peak times of insulin with peaks in glucose. If a patient was receiving insulin at regular intervals while NPO, the scheduled times for glucose tests and insulin injections must be changed to match meal times.

\section*{ENTERAL TUBE FEEDINGS}

Tube feeding formulas contain more simple carbohydrates and less protein and fat than the typical diabetic diet. This results in increased levels of glucose in the diabetic patient receiving tube feedings. It is important that insulin doses be administered at regular intervals (eg, NPH every 12 hours or regular insulin every 4 to 6 hours) when tube feedings are administered at a continuous rate. If insulin is administered at routine (prebreakfast and predinner) times, hypoglycemia during the day may result from patients receiving more insulin without more calories, and hyperglycemia may occur during the night when feedings continue but insulin action decreases.

A common cause of hypoglycemia in patients receiving continuous tube feedings and insulin is inadvertent or purposeful discontinuation of the feeding. The nurse must discuss with the medical team any plans for temporarily discontinuing the tube feeding (eg, when the patient is away from the unit). Planning ahead may allow alterations to be made in the insulin dose, or it may allow for IV dextrose to be administered. In addition, if problems with the tube feeding develop unexpectedly (eg, the patient pulls out the tube, the tube clogs, or the feeding is discontinued when residual gastric contents are found), the nurse must notify the physician, assess blood glucose levels more frequently, and administer IV dextrose if indicated.

\section*{PARENTERAL NUTRITION}

The patient with diabetes receiving parenteral nutrition may receive both IV insulin (added to the parenteral nutrition container) and subcutaneous intermediate- or short-acting insulins. If the patient is receiving continuous parenteral nutrition, the blood glucose level should be monitored and insulin administered at regular intervals. If the parenteral nutrition is infused over a limited number of hours, subcutaneous insulin should be administered so that peak times of insulin action coincide with times of parenteral nutrition infusion.

\section*{Hygiene}

The nurse caring for a hospitalized diabetic patient must focus attention on oral hygiene and skin care. Because diabetic patients are at increased risk for periodontal disease, it is important for the nurse to assist patients with daily dental care. The patient may also require assistance in keeping the skin clean and dry, especially in areas of contact between two skin surfaces (eg, groin, axilla, and, in obese women, under the breasts), where chafing and fungal infections tend to occur.

For the bedridden diabetic patient, nursing care must emphasize the prevention of skin breakdown at pressure points. The heels are particularly susceptible to breakdown because of loss of sensation of pain and pressure associated with sensory neuropathy.

Feet should be cleaned, dried, lubricated with lotion (but not between the toes), and inspected frequently. If the patient is in the supine position, pressure on the heels can be alleviated by elevating the lower legs on a pillow, with the heels positioned over the edge of the pillow. When the patient is seated in a chair, the feet should be positioned so that pressure is not placed on the heels. If the patient has a foot ulcer, it is important to provide preventive foot care to the unaffected foot as well as to carry out special care of the affected foot.

As always, every opportunity should be taken to teach the patient about diabetes self-management, including daily oral, skin, and foot care. Female diabetic patients should also be instructed about measures for the avoidance of vaginal infections, which occur more frequently when blood glucose levels are elevated. Patients often take their cues from the nurse and realize the importance of daily personal hygiene if this is emphasized during their hospitalization.

\section*{Stress}

As mentioned earlier, physiologic stress, such as infections and surgery, contributes to hyperglycemia and may precipitate DKA or HHNS. Emotional stress may have a negative impact on diabetic control as well. An increase in stress hormones leads to an increase in glucose levels, especially when the intake of food and insulin remains unchanged. In addition, during periods of emotional stress, the person with diabetes may alter the usual pattern of meals, exercise, and medication. This contributes to hyperglycemia or even hypoglycemia (eg, in the patient taking insulin or oral antidiabetic agents who stops eating in response to stress).

People who have diabetes must be made aware of the potential deterioration in diabetic control that can accompany emotional stress. They must be encouraged to try to adhere to the diabetes treatment plan as much as possible during times of stress. In addition, learning strategies for minimizing stress and coping with stress when it does occur are important aspects of diabetes education.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

People with diabetes are living longer; therefore, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are seen more frequently in the elderly population. Regardless of the type or duration of diabetes, the goals of diabetes treatment may need to be altered when caring for the elderly. The focus is on quality of life issues, such as maintaining independent functioning and promoting general well-being. Although striving for strict blood glucose control may not be safe or appropriate, prolonged symptomatic hyperglycemia should be avoided.

Some elderly patients cannot manage a detailed diabetes treatment plan, but the nurse must not assume that all patients older than a certain age can adhere only to the simplest regimen. Although the goal may be simply to avoid hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia, certain patients may prefer more complex regimens that allow more flexibility in meals and daily schedule. As with all people with diabetes, individualization of the treatment plan with frequent follow-up by the health care team is important.

Some of the barriers to learning and self-care that may be seen in the elderly include decreased vision, hearing loss, memory deficits, decreased mobility and fine motor coordination, increased tremors, depression and loneliness, decreased financial resources, and limitations related to other medical illnesses. Assessing patients for these barriers as well as discussing any misconceptions or folk beliefs regarding the cause and treatment of diabetes is important in setting up a diabetes treatment plan and educational activities. Presenting brief, simplified instructions with ample opportunity for practice of skills is important. The use of special devices such as a magnifier for the insulin syringe, an insulin pen, or a mirror for foot inspection is helpful. If necessary, family members and other community resources are called on to assist with diabetes survival skills. It is preferable to teach patients or family members to test blood glucose at home; the choice of meter should be tailored to the patient's visual and cognitive status and dexterity. Frequent evaluation of self-care skills (insulin administration, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, diet planning) is essential, especially in patients with deteriorating vision and memory.

Dietary adherence is difficult for some elderly patients because of decreased appetite, poor dentition, and decreased physical and financial ability to prepare meals. In addition, patients may be unwilling to change long-standing dietary habits. Altering the meal plan to incorporate these eating habits or other limitations may be necessary.

> NURSING ALERT Careful monitoring for diabetes complications must not be neglected in elderly patients. Hypoglycemia is especially dangerous because it may go undetected and result in falls. Dehydration is a concern in patients who have chronically elevated blood glucose levels. Assessment for long-term complications, especially eye and foot problems, is important. Avoiding blindness and amputation through early detection and treatment of retinopathy and foot ulcers may mean the difference between institutionalization and continued independent living for the elderly person with diabetes.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH DIABETES AS A SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS}

People with diabetes frequently seek medical attention for problems not directly related to blood glucose control. However, during the course of treatment for the primary medical diagnosis, blood glucose control may worsen. In addition, the only opportunity for some patients with diabetes to update their knowledge about diabetes self-care and prevention of complications is during hospitalization. Therefore, it is important for the nurse caring for the patient with diabetes to focus attention on diabetes, regardless of the primary problem. Further, control of blood glucose levels is important because hyperglycemia impairs resistance to certain infections and impedes wound healing.

\section*{Assessment}

Assessment of the patient with diabetes with a primary problem such as cardiac disease, renal disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, surgery, or any other type of illness is the same as that for a nondiabetic patient and is described in other chapters. In addition to nursing assessment for the primary problem, assessment of the patient with diabetes must also focus on hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, skin breakdown, and diabetes self-care skills, including survival skills and measures for prevention of long-term complications. In addition, the patient is asked about use of alternative or complementary therapies; studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes are twice as likely as other patients to use these therapies, and some may be harmful (Egede et al., 2002).

The patient is assessed for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia with frequent blood glucose monitoring (usually prescribed before meals and at bedtime) and with monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia or prolonged hyperglycemia (including DKA or HHNS), as described in previous sections.

Careful assessment of the skin, especially at pressure points and on the lower extremities, is important. The skin is assessed for dryness, cracks, skin breakdown, and redness. The patient is asked about symptoms of neuropathy, such as tingling and pain or numbness of the feet. Deep tendon reflexes are assessed.

Assessment of diabetes self-care skills is performed as early as possible to determine whether the patient requires further diabetes teaching. The nurse observes the patient preparing and injecting the insulin, monitoring blood glucose, and performing foot care. (Simply questioning the patient about these skills without actually observing performance of the skills is not sufficient.) Knowledge about diet can be assessed with the help of the dietitian through direct questioning and review of patient choices on the menu. The patient is questioned regarding signs, treatment, and prevention of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The patient's knowledge of risk factors for macrovascular disease, including hypertension, increased lipids, and smoking, is assessed. The patient is asked the date of the last eye examination (including dilation of the pupil). It is also important to assess the patient's use of preventive health measures: annual influenza vaccination (flu shot), date of last pneumonia vaccine (ADA, Immunization and the Prevention of Influenza and Pneumococcal Disease in People With Diabetes, 2003), daily dose of aspirin (unless contraindicated) (ADA, Aspirin Therapy in Diabetes, 2003), and smoking cessation (ADA, Smoking and Diabetes, 2003).

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include:
- Imbalanced nutrition related to increase in stress hormones (caused by primary medical problem) and imbalances in insulin, food, and physical activity
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility and lack of sensation (caused by neuropathy)
- Deficient knowledge about diabetes self-care skills (caused by lack of basic diabetes education or lack of continuing indepth diabetes education)

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include:
- Inadequate control of blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia)
- DKA and HNNS

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include improved nutritional status, maintenance of skin integrity, ability to perform basic diabetes self-care skills as well as preventive care for the avoidance of chronic diabetes complications, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

The patient's diet is planned with the primary goal of glucose control; however, the dietary prescription must also consider the patient's primary health problem in addition to lifestyle, cultural background, activity level, and food preferences. If alterations are needed in the patient's diet because of the primary health problem (eg, GI problems), alternative strategies to ensure adequate nutritional intake must be implemented. The patient's nutritional intake is monitored carefully along with blood glucose, urine ketones, and daily weight. Blood glucose records are assessed for patterns of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia at the same time of day, and findings are reported to the physician for alteration in insulin orders. In the patient with elevated blood glucose levels that are prolonged, laboratory values and the patient's physical condition are monitored for signs of DKA or HHNS.

\section*{MAINTAINING SKIN CARE}

The skin is assessed daily for dryness or breaks. The feet are cleaned with warm water and soap. Excessive soaking of the feet is avoided. The feet are dried thoroughly, especially between the toes, and lotion is applied to the entire foot except between the toes. For bedridden patients (especially those with a history of neuropathy), the heels are elevated off the bed with a pillow placed under the lower legs and the heels resting over the edge of the pillow. Dermal ulcers are treated as indicated and prescribed. The nurse promotes optimal blood glucose control in patients with skin breakdown.

\section*{ADDRESSING KNOWLEDGE DEFICITS}

Hospital admission of the patient with diabetes provides an ideal opportunity for the nurse to assess the patient's level of knowledge about diabetes and its management. The nurse uses this opportunity to assess the patient's understanding of diabetes management, including blood glucose monitoring, administration of medications (ie, insulin, oral agents), dietary requirements, exercise, and strategies to prevent long- and short-term complications of diabetes. The nurse also assesses the adjustment of the patient and family to diabetes and its management and identifies any misconceptions they have.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Inadequate control of blood glucose levels may hinder recovery from the immediate health problem. Blood glucose levels are
monitored, and insulin is administered as prescribed. It is important for the nurse to ensure that insulin prescribed is modified as needed to compensate for changes in the patient's schedule or eating pattern. Treatment is given for hypoglycemia (with oral glucose) or hyperglycemia (with supplemental regular insulin no more often than every 3 to 4 hours). Blood glucose records are assessed for patterns of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia at the same time of day, and findings are reported to the physician for modification in insulin orders. In the patient with elevated blood glucose levels that are prolonged, laboratory values and the patient's physical condition are monitored for signs of DKA or HHNS.

Development of acute complications of diabetes secondary to inadequate control of blood glucose levels may be associated with other health care problems because of changes in activity level and diet and physiologic alterations related to the primary health problem itself. Therefore, the patient must be monitored for acute complications (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia) and measures must be implemented for their prevention and early treatment.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Even if the patient has had diabetes for many years, it is important to assess his or her knowledge and adherence to the plan of care. It may be necessary to plan and implement a teaching plan that includes basic information about diabetes, its cause and symptoms, and acute and chronic complications and their treatment. The nurse asks the patient to give repeated return demonstrations of skills that were not performed correctly during the initial assessment. The patient is taught self-care activities for the prevention of long-term complications, including foot care, eye care, and risk factor management. The nurse also reminds the patient and family about the importance of health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The patient who is hospitalized for another health problem may require referral for home care for that problem or if gaps in knowledge about self-care are uncovered. In either case, the home care nurse can use this opportunity to assess the patient's knowledge about diabetes management and the patient's and family's ability to carry out that management. Teaching provided in the hospital, clinic, office, or diabetes education center is reinforced by the nurse. The home care environment is assessed to determine its adequacy for self-care and safety.

During home care visits, the nurse assesses the patient for signs and symptoms of long-term complications and assesses the patient's and family's techniques in blood glucose monitoring, insulin administration, and food selection. In addition, the patient and family are reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities as well as recommended health screening.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A patient is newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Identify the major nursing assessment issues and nursing interventions in each of the following situations: (1) the patient is in the first trimester of pregnancy, (2) the patient refuses to use insulin, and (3) the patient is developmentally disabled and able to understand only simple instructions.
2. A patient with type 2 diabetes is scheduled for major abdominal surgery. What modifications in nursing assessment and care before, during, and after surgery are indicated because of the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes? How would these differ if the patient had type 1 diabetes?
3. A 57-year-old patient is brought to the emergency department by his daughter because he has become drowsy and has developed slurred speech over the last hour. His daughter, who lives out of town, tells you that he has recently been diagnosed with diabetes and has been depressed ever since. She does not know how the diabetes is being managed. What assessment data would you initially obtain? What diagnostic tests and treatments would you anticipate? Provide the rationale for those tests and treatments.
4. A 48-year-old patient with three children has had diabetes for 5 years and has not adhered to the prescribed treatment regimen. He says, "My father and grandfather both died from diabetes. I don't see any point in modifying my life if I'm going to die from diabetes anyway." How would you approach this patient? What resources would you use? How would you alter your approach if your first efforts to convince him of the benefits of treatment were unsuccessful?
5. Your patient has diabetes, and blood glucose monitoring is recommended. Develop a plan for teaching blood glucose monitoring to him. Explain how the results of monitoring are used in the management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. How would you modify your teaching plan if the patient is blind? If he understands little English?

$T_{h}$he nervous system and the interconnected network of glands known as the endocrine system control body systems. Disorders of the endocrine system are common and have the potential to affect the function of every organ system in the body. Understanding the function of each of the endocrine glands, and the consequences of hypofunction and hyperfunction of each gland, enables the nurse to anticipate physiologic changes and to plan interventions to address them. Nursing interventions that are essential in managing endocrine disorders are carried out in every setting from the intensive care unit to the outpatient setting and the home.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The endocrine system has far-reaching effects in the human body because of its links with the nervous system and the immune system. The hormones secreted by the endocrine system are affected in large part by structures in the central nervous system, such as the hypothalamus. Other structures located in the brain, such as the pituitary gland, are endocrine glands that influence the function of a large number of other endocrine glands. The effects of hormones secreted by the endocrine system affect the nervous system and are, in turn, mediated by the nervous system. The adrenal medulla, for example, secretes a number of substances (eg, norepinephrine and epinephrine) that act as neurotransmitters. The immune system also interacts closely with the endocrine system. It responds to the introduction of foreign agents by means of chemicals (eg, interleukins, interferons) and is regulated by hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex.

In addition to the hormones secreted by the major endocrine glands, other tissues produce hormones that are secreted into body fluids and act on nearby cells and tissues. The gastrointestinal mucosa produces hormones (eg, gastrin, enterogastrone, secretin, and cholecystokinin) that are important in the digestive process. The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. The white blood cells produce cytokines that actively participate in inflammatory and immune responses.

Hormones are important in regulation of the internal environment of the body and affect every aspect of life. Some hormones target specific tissues; for example, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or corticotrophin, is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland and targets the adrenal cortex to increase the secretion of the hormones of the adrenal cortex (ie, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens). Other hormones affect a wide variety of cells and tissues of the body. Thyroid hormone is one example; it affects metabolic activity of cells throughout the body.

\section*{GLANDS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM}

The endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, pancreatic islets, ovaries, and testes (Fig. 42-1). Endocrine glands secrete their products directly into the bloodstream, which differentiates them from exocrine glands, such as sweat glands, which secrete their products through ducts onto epithelial surfaces or into the gastrointestinal tract. The hypothalamus is the link between the nervous system and the endocrine system. (Because of the unique endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas, pancreatic function and disorders are discussed
acromegaly: disease process resulting from excessive secretion of somatotropin causing progressive enlargement of peripheral body parts, commonly the face, head, hands, and feet
Addison's disease: chronic adrenocortical insufficiency secondary to destruction of the adrenal glands
addisonian crisis: acute adrenocortical insufficiency; characterized by acute hypotension, cyanosis, fever, nausea and vomiting, and the classic signs of shock; precipitated by stress or abrupt withdrawal of therapeutic glucocorticoids
adrenalectomy: surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands.
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary, essential for growth and development
androgens: hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex; stimulate activity of accessory male sex organs and development of male sex characteristics
adrenogenital syndrome: masculinization in women, feminization in men, or premature sexual development in children; result of abnormal secretion of adrenocortical hormones, especially androgen
basal metabolic rate: chemical reactions occurring when the body is at rest calcitonin: hormone secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland; participates in calcium regulation
Chvostek's sign: spasm of the facial muscles produced by sharply tapping over the facial nerve in front of the parotid gland and anterior to the ear; causes spasm or twitching of the mouth, nose, and eye; suggestive of latent tetany in patients with hypocalcemia
corticosteroids: hormones produced by the adrenal cortex or their synthetic equivalents; also referred to as adrenal-cortical hormone and adrenocorticosteroid; consist of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens
cretinism: stunted body growth and mental development appearing during the first year of life as a result of congenital hypothyroidism
Cushing's syndrome: group of symptoms produced by an excess of free circulating cortisol from the adrenal cortex; characterized by truncal obesity, "moon face," acne, abdominal striae, and hypertension diabetes insipidus: condition in which abnormally large volumes of dilute urine are
excreted as a result of deficient production of vasopressin
dilutional hyponatremia: sodium deficiency developed as a result of fluid retention; associated with excessive ADH secretion in patients with SIADH
dwarfism: generalized limited growth; condition caused by insufficient secretion of growth hormone during childhood
endocrine: secreting internally; hormonal secretion of a ductless gland
euthyroid: state of normal thyroid hormone production
exocrine: secreting externally; hormonal secretion from excretory ducts
exophthalmos: abnormal protrusion of one or both eyeballs; produces a startled expression; usually due to hyperthyroidism
glucocorticoids: steroid hormones (ie, cortisol, cortisone, and corticosterone) secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to ACTH; produce a rise of liver glycogen and blood glucose
Graves' disease: a form of hyperthyroidism; characterized by a diffuse goiter, exophthalmos
goiter: enlargement of the thyroid gland; usually caused by an iodine-deficient diet

\section*{FUNCTION AND REGULATION OF HORMONES}

The chemical substances secreted by the endocrine glands are called hormones. Hormones help to regulate organ function in concert with the nervous system. This dual regulatory system, in which rapid action by the nervous system is balanced by slower hormonal action, permits precise control of organ functions in response to varied changes within and outside the body. Table 42-1 lists the major hormones, their target tissue, and some of their properties.

The endocrine glands are composed of secretory cells arranged in minute clusters known as acini. No ducts are present, but the glands have a rich blood supply so that the hormones they produce enter the bloodstream rapidly. In the healthy physiologic state, hormone concentration in the bloodstream is maintained at a relatively constant level. When the hormone concentration rises, further production of that hormone is inhibited. When the hormone concentration falls, the rate of production of that hormone increases. This mechanism for regulating hormone concentration in the bloodstream is called negative feedback, which is important in the regulation of many biologic processes.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION AND ACTION OF HORMONES}

Hormones are classified as steroid hormones (such as hydrocortisone), peptide or protein hormones (such as insulin), and amine hormones (such as epinephrine). These different classes of hormones act
on the target tissues by different mechanisms. Hormones can alter the function of the target tissue by interacting with chemical receptors located either on the cell membrane or in the interior of the cell.

Peptide and protein hormones interact with receptor sites on the cell surface, which results in the stimulation of the intracellular enzyme adenyl cyclase. This results in increased production of cyclic $3^{\prime}$, $5^{\prime}$-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The cyclic AMP inside the cell alters enzyme activity. Thus, cyclic AMP is the "second messenger" that links the peptide hormone at the cell surface to a change in the intracellular environment. Some of the protein and peptide hormones may also act by changing membrane permeability. These hormones act within seconds or minutes. The mechanism of action for amine hormones is similar to that for peptide hormones.

Steroid hormones, because of their smaller size and higher lipid solubility, penetrate the cell membranes and interact with intracellular receptors. This steroid-receptor complex modifies cell metabolism and formation of messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The messenger RNA then stimulates protein synthesis within the cell. Steroid hormones require several hours to exert their effects because they exert their action by the modification of protein synthesis.

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

Because of the widespread effects of the endocrine system on the body, a wide variety of signs and symptoms may occur with endocrine disorders. Although specific endocrine disorders are

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 42-1 Major hormone-secreting glands of the endocrine system.}
\end{figure}
often accompanied by specific clinical symptoms, more general manifestations may occur with a number of endocrine disorders. Changes in energy level and fatigue are common to many endocrine imbalances. During the health history, the nurse asks the patient about fatigue and changes in usual energy levels and about how the changes affect the patient's ability to carry out activities of daily life. The nurse also asks about changes in heat and cold tolerance as well as recent changes in weight: increases or decreases may occur with changes in adrenal and thyroid disorders and may be a result of changes in fat distribution or fluid loss or retention.

Changes in sexual function and secondary sex characteristics may occur with any number of endocrine disorders and are assessed by obtaining a sexual history. Asking the patient or family about changes in mood, memory, and ability to concentrate and altered sleep patterns is important because these changes are common in endocrine disorders. Other specific symptoms that occur with specific endocrine disorders are discussed with each of those disorders.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

The patient is observed for obvious changes in appearance that may indicate endocrine dysfunction. Changes in the skin texture are common with both hypofunction and hyperfunction of the
thyroid gland. Eye changes, such as exophthalmos, may occur with hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease. Changes in physical appearance (eg, appearance of facial hair in women, "moon face," "buffalo hump," thinning of the skin, obesity of the trunk and thinness of the extremities, increased size of the feet and hands, edema) may signify disorders of the thyroid, adrenal cortex, or pituitary gland.

Vital signs are measured and compared with previous values if known. Elevated blood pressure may occur with hyperfunction of the adrenal cortex or tumor of the adrenal medulla. Decreased blood pressure may occur with hypofunction of the adrenal cortex. Other specific physical assessment findings are discussed with each endocrine disorder.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

Although a wide variety of diagnostic tests can be used in the diagnostic workup, three major categories of diagnostic tests are common: blood tests, urine tests, and stimulation and suppression tests. Specific blood tests, urine tests, and stimulation and suppression tests are discussed with the specific endocrine disorders that follow in this chapter.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Blood tests may be used to determine hormone blood levels. For example, in a patient thought to have a thyroid disorder, serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone provide information about the nature (hypofunction or hyperfunction) and site (the thyroid gland, the pituitary, or the hypothalamus) of the disorder. Other blood tests are used to detect antibodies or assess the effect of the hormone on other substances (eg, the effect of insulin on blood glucose levels). Radioimmunoassays, which are radioisotope-labeled antigen tests used to measure hormones or other substances, may be performed.

Urine tests may be used to measure the amount of hormone or the end products of hormones excreted by the kidneys. Onetime specimens may be obtained, or in some disorders 24 -hour urine specimens are collected to measure hormones or their metabolites. For example, urinary levels of free catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine) may be measured in patients with suspected tumors of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma).

Stimulation and suppression tests may be used to diagnose endocrine disorders. Stimulation tests can determine how an endocrine gland responds to the administration of stimulating hormones that are normally produced or released by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. If the endocrine gland responds to this stimulation, the specific disorder may be in the hypothalamus or pituitary. Failure of the endocrine gland to respond to this stimulation helps to identify the problem as being in the endocrine gland itself. Suppression tests may be used to determine whether negative feedback mechanisms that normally control secretion of hormones from the hypothalamus or pituitary gland are intact.

\section*{Management of Patients With Pituitary Disorders}

The pituitary gland, or the hypophysis, is a round structure about 1.27 cm ( $1 / 2 \mathrm{inch}$ ) in diameter located on the inferior aspect of the brain. It is divided into the anterior, intermediate, and posterior lobes.

\section*{PITUITARY FUNCTION AND DYSFUNCTION}

Commonly referred to as the master gland, the pituitary secretes hormones that control the secretion of hormones by other endocrine glands (Fig. 42-2). The pituitary itself is controlled by the hypothalamus, an adjacent area of the brain connected to the pituitary by the pituitary stalk.

\section*{Posterior Pituitary}

The important hormones secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland are vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) and oxytocin. These hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus and travel from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary gland for storage. Vasopressin controls the excretion of water by the kidney; its secretion is stimulated by an increase in the osmolality of the blood or by a decrease in blood pressure. Oxytocin facilitates milk ejection during lactation and increases the force of uterine contractions during labor and delivery. Oxytocin secretion is stimulated during pregnancy and at childbirth.

\section*{Anterior Pituitary}

The major hormones of the anterior pituitary gland are folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and growth hormone (also referred to as somatotropin). The secretion of these major hormones is controlled by releasing factors secreted by the hypothalamus. These releasing factors reach the anterior pituitary by way of the bloodstream in a special circulation called the pituitary portal blood system. Other hormones include melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-lipotropin; the function of lipotropin is poorly understood.

The hormones released by the anterior pituitary enter the general circulation and are transported to their target organs. The main function of TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH is the release of hormones from other endocrine glands. Prolactin acts on the breast to stimulate milk production. Growth hormone has widespread effects on many target tissues and is discussed later. Hormones that stimulate other organs and tissues are discussed in conjunction with their target organs.

Growth hormone is a protein hormone that increases protein synthesis in many tissues, increases the breakdown of fatty acids in adipose tissue, and increases the glucose level in the blood. These actions of growth hormone are essential for normal growth, although other hormones, such as thyroid hormone and insulin, are required as well. Stress, exercise, and low blood glucose levels increase the secretion of growth hormone. The halflife of growth hormone activity in the blood is 20 to 30 minutes; the hormone is largely inactivated in the liver.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Abnormalities of pituitary function are caused by oversecretion or undersecretion of any of the hormones produced or released by the gland. Abnormalities of the anterior and posterior portions of the gland may occur independently. Oversecretion (hypersecretion) most commonly involves ACTH or growth hormone and results in Cushing's syndrome or acromegaly, respectively. Acromegaly, an excess of growth hormone in adults, results in bone and soft tissue deformities and enlargement of the viscera without an increase in height. In children, oversecretion of growth hormone results in gigantism, with a person reaching 7 or even 8 feet tall. Conversely, insufficient secretion of growth hormone during childhood results in generalized limited growth and dwarfism.

Undersecretion (hyposecretion) commonly involves all of the anterior pituitary hormones and is termed panhypopituitarism. In this condition, the thyroid gland, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads atrophy (shrink) because of loss of the trophic-stimulating hormones.

The most common disorder related to posterior lobe dysfunction is diabetes insipidus, a condition in which abnormally large volumes of dilute urine are excreted as a result of deficient production of vasopressin.

\section*{HYPOPITUITARISM}

Hypofunction of the pituitary gland (hypopituitarism) can result from disease of the pituitary gland itself or of the hypothalamus, but the result is essentially the same. Hypopituitarism may result from destruction of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Panhypopituitarism (Simmonds' disease) is total absence of all pituitary secretions and is rare. Postpartum pituitary necrosis (Sheehan's syndrome) is another uncommon cause of failure of the anterior pituitary. It is more likely to occur in women with severe blood loss, hypovolemia, and hypotension at the time of delivery.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-221.jpg?height=1727&width=1601&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=197}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 42-2 The pituitary gland, the relationship of the brain to pituitary action, and the hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary.}
\end{figure}

Hypopituitarism is also a complication of radiation therapy to the head and neck area. The total destruction of the pituitary gland by trauma, tumor, or vascular lesion removes all stimuli that are normally received by the thyroid, the gonads, and the adrenal glands. The result is extreme weight loss, emaciation, atrophy of all endocrine glands and organs, hair loss, impotence, amenorrhea, hypometabolism, and hypoglycemia. Coma and death occur if the missing hormones are not replaced.

\section*{PITUITARY TUMORS}

Pituitary tumors are usually benign, although their location and effects on hormone production by target organs can cause lifethreatening effects. Three principal types of pituitary tumors rep-
resent an overgrowth of (1) eosinophilic cells, (2) basophilic cells, or (3) chromophobic cells (ie, cells with no affinity for either eosinophilic or basophilic stains).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Eosinophilic tumors that develop early in life result in gigantism. The affected person may be more than 7 feet tall and large in all proportions, yet so weak and lethargic that he or she can hardly stand. If the disorder begins during adult life, the excessive skeletal growth occurs only in the feet, the hands, the superciliary ridge, the molar eminences, the nose, and the chin, giving rise to the clinical
picture called acromegaly. Enlargement, however, involves all tissues and organs of the body. Many of these patients suffer from severe headaches and visual disturbances because the tumors exert pressure on the optic nerves (Sachse, 2001). Assessment of central vision and visual fields may indicate loss of color discrimination, diplopia (double vision), or blindness of a portion of a field of vision. Decalcification of the skeleton, muscular weakness, and endocrine disturbances, similar to those occurring in patients with hyperthyroidism, also are associated with this type of tumor.

Basophilic tumors give rise to Cushing's syndrome with features largely attributable to hyperadrenalism, including masculinization and amenorrhea in females, truncal obesity, hypertension, osteoporosis, and polycythemia.

Chromophobic tumors represent $90 \%$ of pituitary tumors. These tumors usually produce no hormones but destroy the rest of the pituitary gland, causing hypopituitarism. People with this disease are often obese and somnolent and exhibit fine, scanty hair, dry, soft skin, a pasty complexion, and small bones. They also experience headaches, loss of libido, and visual defects progressing to blindness. Other signs and symptoms include polyuria, polyphagia, a lowering of the basal metabolic rate, and a subnormal body temperature.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnostic evaluation requires a careful history and physical examination, including assessment of visual acuity and visual fields. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to diagnose the presence and extent of pituitary tumors. Serum levels of pituitary hormones may be obtained along with measurements of hormones of target organs (eg, thyroid, adrenal) to assist in diagnosis if other information is inconclusive.

\section*{Medical Management}

Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor through a transsphenoidal approach is the usual treatment. Stereotactic radiation therapy, which requires use of a neurosurgery-type stereotactic frame, may be used to deliver external-beam radiation therapy precisely to the pituitary tumor with minimal effect on normal tissue (see Chap. 16). Other treatments include conventional radiation therapy, bromocriptine (dopamine antagonist), and octreotide (synthetic analog of growth hormone). These medications inhibit the production or release of growth hormone and may bring about marked improvement of symptoms. Octreotide (Sandostatin) may also be used preoperatively to improve the patient's clinical condition and to shrink the tumor.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT: HYPOPHYSECTOMY}

Hypophysectomy, or removal of the pituitary gland, may be performed to treat primary pituitary gland tumors. It is the treatment of choice in patients with Cushing's syndrome due to excessive production of ACTH by a tumor of the pituitary gland. Hypophysectomy may also be performed on occasion as a palliative measure to relieve bone pain secondary to metastasis of malignant lesions of the breast and prostate.

Several approaches are used to remove or destroy the pituitary gland: surgical removal by transfrontal, subcranial, or oronasaltranssphenoidal approaches or irradiation or cryosurgery. (See Chap. 61 for the transsphenoidal approach to the removal of a pituitary tumor and for the nursing management of a patient undergoing cranial surgery.) Even if surgery succeeds at removing the tumor, many of the features or symptoms of acromegaly will be unaffected (Sachse, 2001).

The absence of the pituitary gland alters the function of many body systems. Menstruation ceases and infertility occurs after total or near-total ablation of the pituitary gland. Replacement therapy with corticosteroids and thyroid hormone is necessary; therefore, patient teaching is imperative and is discussed later in this chapter.

\section*{DIABETES INSIPIDUS}

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland characterized by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), or vasopressin. Great thirst (polydipsia) and large volumes of dilute urine characterize the disorder. It may be secondary to head trauma, brain tumor, or surgical ablation or irradiation of the pituitary gland. It may also occur with infections of the central nervous system (meningitis, encephalitis, tuberculosis) or tumors (eg, metastatic disease, lymphoma of the breast or lung). Another cause of diabetes insipidus is failure of the renal tubules to respond to ADH ; this nephrogenic form may be related to hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and a variety of medications (eg, lithium, demeclocycline [Declomycin]).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Without the action of ADH on the distal nephron of the kidney, an enormous daily output of very dilute, water-like urine with a specific gravity of 1.001 to 1.005 occurs. The urine contains no abnormal substances such as glucose and albumin. Because of the intense thirst, the patient tends to drink 2 to 20 liters of fluid daily and craves cold water. In the hereditary form of diabetes insipidus, the primary symptoms may begin at birth. In adults, the onset of diabetes insipidus may be abrupt or insidious.

The disease cannot be controlled by limiting fluid intake because the high-volume loss of urine continues even without fluid replacement. Attempts to restrict fluids cause the patient to experience an insatiable craving for fluid and to develop hypernatremia and severe dehydration.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The fluid deprivation test is carried out by withholding fluids for 8 to 12 hours or until $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ of the body weight is lost. The patient is weighed frequently during the test. Plasma and urine osmolality studies are performed at the beginning and end of the test. The inability to increase the specific gravity and osmolality of the urine is characteristic of diabetes insipidus. The patient continues to excrete large volumes of urine with low specific gravity and experiences weight loss, rising serum osmolality, and elevated serum sodium levels. The patient's condition needs to be monitored frequently during the test, and the test is terminated if tachycardia, excessive weight loss, or hypotension develops.

Other diagnostic procedures include concurrent measurements of plasma levels of ADH (vasopressin) and plasma and urine osmolality, a trial of desmopressin (synthetic vasopressin) therapy and intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline solution. When the diagnosis is confirmed and the cause is not obvious (eg, head injury), the patient is carefully assessed for tumors that may be causing the disorder.

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of therapy are (1) to replace ADH (which is usually a long-term therapeutic program), (2) to ensure adequate fluid replacement, and (3) to identify and correct the underlying
intracranial pathology. Nephrogenic causes require different management approaches.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic vasopressin without the vascular effects of natural ADH, is particularly valuable because it has a longer duration of action and fewer adverse effects than other preparations previously used to treat the disease. It is administered intranasally; the patient sprays the solution into the nose through a flexible calibrated plastic tube. One or two administrations daily or every 12 to 24 hours usually control the symptoms (Tierney, McPhee, \& Papadakis, 2001).

Another form of therapy is the intramuscular administration of ADH, or vasopressin tannate in oil, which is used when the intranasal route is not possible. It is administered every 24 to 96 hours. The vial of medication should be warmed or shaken vigorously before administration. The injection is administered in the evening so that maximum results are obtained during sleep. Abdominal cramps are a side effect of this medication. Rotation of injection sites is necessary to prevent lipodystrophy.

Clofibrate, a hypolipidemic agent, has been found to have an antidiuretic effect on patients with diabetes insipidus who have some residual hypothalamic vasopressin. Chlorpropamide (Diabinese) and thiazide diuretics are also used in mild forms of the disease because they potentiate the action of vasopressin. The patient receiving chlorpropamide should be warned of the possibility of hypoglycemic reactions.

If the diabetes insipidus is renal in origin, the previously described treatments are ineffective. Thiazide diuretics, mild salt depletion, and prostaglandin inhibitors (ibuprofen, indomethacin, and aspirin) are used to treat the nephrogenic form of diabetes insipidus.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with possible diabetes insipidus needs encouragement and support while undergoing studies for a possible cranial lesion. The nurse needs to inform the patient and family about follow-up care and emergency measures. The nurse also needs to provide specific verbal and written instructions, show the patient how to administer the medications, and observe return demonstrations as appropriate. The nurse also advises the patient to wear a medical identification bracelet and to carry medication and information about this disorder at all times. Vasopressin must be administered with caution if the patient has coronary artery disease because the medication causes vasoconstriction.

\section*{SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE SECRETION}

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion includes excessive growth hormone (ADH) secretion from the pituitary gland even in the face of subnormal serum osmolality. Patients with this disorder cannot excrete a dilute urine. They retain fluids and develop a sodium deficiency known as dilutional hyponatremia. SIADH is often of nonendocrine origin; for instance, the syndrome may occur in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma in which malignant lung cells synthesize and release ADH. SIADH has also occurred with severe pneumonia, pneumothorax, and other disorders of the lungs, in addition to malignant tumors that affect other organs (Terpstra \& Terpstra, 2000).

Disorders of the central nervous system, such as head injury, brain surgery or tumor, and infection, are thought to produce SIADH by direct stimulation of the pituitary gland. Some med-
ications (vincristine, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, thiazide diuretics, and others) and nicotine have been implicated in SIADH; they either directly stimulate the pituitary gland or increase the sensitivity of renal tubules to circulating ADH.

Eliminating the underlying cause, if possible, and restricting fluid intake are typical interventions for managing this syndrome. Because retained water is excreted slowly through the kidneys, the extracellular fluid volume contracts and the serum sodium concentration gradually increases toward normal. Diuretics (eg, furosemide [Lasix]) may be used along with fluid restriction if severe hyponatremia is present.

Close monitoring of fluid intake and output, daily weight, urine and blood chemistries, and neurologic status is indicated for the patient at risk for SIADH. Supportive measures and explanations of procedures and treatments assist the patient to deal with this disorder (Terpstra \& Terpstra, 2000).

\section*{Management of Patients With Thyroid Disorders}

The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the lower neck anterior to the trachea (Fig. 42-3). It consists of two lateral lobes connected by an isthmus. The gland is about 5 cm long and 3 cm wide and weighs about 30 g . The blood flow to the thyroid is very high (about $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ per gram of thyroid tissue), about five times the blood flow to the liver. This reflects the high metabolic activity of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland produces three hormones: thyroxine ( $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ), triiodothyronine ( $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ), and calcitonin. Thyroxine and triiodothyronine are referred to collectively as thyroid hormone.

\section*{THYROID FUNCTION AND DYSFUNCTION}

Various hormones and chemicals are responsible for normal thyroid function. Key among them are thyroid hormone, calcitonin, and iodine.

\section*{Thyroid Hormone}

The two separate hormones, thyroxine ( $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ) and triiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$, that are produced by the thyroid gland and that make up thyroid hormone, are amino acids that have the unique property of

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-223.jpg?height=543&width=858&top_left_y=1939&top_left_x=1025}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 42-3 The thyroid gland and surrounding structures. From Weber, J. W. \& Kelley, J. (2003). Health assessment in nursing (2nd ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}
\end{figure}
containing iodine molecules bound to the amino acid structure. $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ contains four iodine atoms in each molecule, and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ contains only three. These hormones are synthesized and stored bound to proteins in the cells of the thyroid gland until needed for release into the bloodstream. About $75 \%$ of bound thyroid hormone is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG); the remaining bound thyroid hormone is bound to thyroid-binding prealbumin and albumin.

\section*{ROLE OF IODINE}

Iodine is essential to the thyroid gland for synthesis of its hormones. In fact, the major use of iodine in the body is by the thyroid, and the major derangement in iodine deficiency is alteration of thyroid function. Iodide is ingested in the diet and absorbed into the blood in the gastrointestinal tract. The thyroid gland is extremely efficient in taking up iodide from the blood and concentrating it within the cells, where iodide ions are converted to iodine molecules, which react with tyrosine (an amino acid) to form the thyroid hormones.

\section*{REGULATION OF THYROID HORMONE}

The secretion of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ by the thyroid gland is controlled by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, or thyrotropin) from the anterior pituitary gland. TSH controls the rate of thyroid hormone release. In turn, the level of thyroid hormone in the blood determines the release of TSH. If thyroid hormone concentration in the blood decreases, the release of TSH increases, which causes increased output of $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$. This is an example of negative feedback.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), secreted by the hypothalamus, exerts a modulating influence on the release of TSH from the pituitary. Environmental factors, such as a decrease in temperature, may lead to increased secretion of TRH, resulting in elevated secretion of thyroid hormones. Figure $42-4$ shows the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, which regulates thyroid hormone production.

\section*{FUNCTION OF THYROXINE AND TRIIODOTHYRONINE}

The primary function of the thyroid hormone is to control the cellular metabolic activity. $T_{4}$, a relatively weak hormone, maintains body metabolism in a steady state. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is about five times as potent as $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and has a more rapid metabolic action. These hormones accelerate metabolic processes by increasing the level of specific enzymes that contribute to oxygen consumption and altering the responsiveness of tissues to other hormones. The thyroid hormones influence cell replication and are important in brain development. Thyroid hormone is also necessary for normal growth. The thyroid hormones, through their widespread effects on cellular metabolism, influence every major organ system.

\section*{Calcitonin}

Calcitonin, or thyrocalcitonin, is another important hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. It is secreted in response to high plasma levels of calcium, and it reduces the plasma level of calcium by increasing its deposition in bone.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The thyroid gland is inspected and palpated routinely on all patients. Inspection begins with identification of landmarks. The lower neck region between the sternocleidomastoid muscles is inspected for swelling or asymmetry. The patient is instructed to extend the neck slightly and swallow. Thyroid tissue rises normally with swallowing. The thyroid is then palpated for size, shape, consistency, symmetry, and the presence of tenderness.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-224.jpg?height=1032&width=869&top_left_y=192&top_left_x=1116}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 42-4 The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone ( $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ). High circulating levels of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ inhibit further TSH secretion and thyroid hormone production through a negative feedback mechanism (dashed lines).}
\end{figure}

The examiner may examine the thyroid from an anterior or a posterior position. In the posterior position, both hands encircle the patient's neck. The thumbs rest on the nape of the neck, while the index and middle fingers palpate for the thyroid isthmus and the anterior surfaces of the lateral lobes. When palpable, the isthmus is perceived as firm and of a rubber-band consistency.

The left lobe is examined by positioning the patient so that the neck flexes slightly forward and to the left. The thyroid cartilage is then displaced to the left with the fingers of the right hand. This maneuver displaces the left lobe deep into the sternocleidomastoid muscle, where it can be more easily palpated. The left lobe is then palpated by placing the left thumb deep into the posterior area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, while the index and middle fingers exert opposite pressure in the anterior portion of the muscle. Having the patient swallow during the maneuver may assist the examiner to locate the thyroid as it ascends in the neck. The procedure is reversed to examine the right lobe. The isthmus is the only portion of the thyroid that is normally palpable. If a patient has a very thin neck, two thin, smooth, nontender lobes may also be palpable.

If palpation discloses an enlarged thyroid gland, both lobes are auscultated using the diaphragm of the stethoscope. Auscultation identifies the localized audible vibration of a bruit. This abnormal finding indicates increased blood flow through the thyroid gland and necessitates referral to a physician. Tenderness, enlargement, and nodularity within the thyroid also require referral for additional evaluation (Table 42-2).

\section*{THYROID FUNCTION TESTS}

Assessment measures in addition to palpation and auscultation include thyroid function tests, such as laboratory measurement of thyroid hormones, thyroid scanning, biopsy, and ultrasonography. The most widely used tests are serum immunoassay for TSH and free thyroxine $\left(\mathrm{FT}_{4}\right)$. Measurement of TSH has a sensitivity and specificity of greater than 95\% (Larson, Anderson \& Koslawy, 2000). $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ levels correlate with metabolic status and are elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism.

\section*{THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE}

Measurement of the serum TSH concentration is the single best screening test of thyroid function in outpatients because of its high sensitivity. The ability to detect minute changes in serum TSH makes it possible to distinguish subclinical thyroid disease from euthyroid states in patients with low or high normal values. Values above the normal range of 0.4 to $6.15 \mu \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ indicate primary hypothyroidism, and low values indicate hyperthyroidism. When the TSH is normal, there is a $98 \%$ chance that the $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ is also normal. Measurement of TSH is also used for monitoring thyroid hormone replacement therapy and for differentiating between disorders of the thyroid gland itself and disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus. Current recommendations suggest TSH screening for all adults beginning at age 35, and every 5 years thereafter (Ladenson, Singer, Ain, et al., 2000).

\section*{SERUM FREE THYROXINE}

The test most commonly used to confirm an abnormal TSH is $\mathrm{FT}_{4} . \mathrm{FT}_{4}$ is a direct measurement of free (unbound) thyroxine, the only metabolically active fraction of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. The range of $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ in serum is normally 0.9 to $1.7 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dL}(11.5$ to $21.8 \mathrm{pmol} / \mathrm{L})$. When measured by the dialysis method, $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ is not affected by variations in protein binding and is the procedure of choice for following the changes in $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ secretion during treatment of hyperthyroidism. Measurement of $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ by the immunoassay technique is less reliable because it may be affected by medication, illness, or changes
in protein binding. An estimate (or index) of $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ can also be calculated by multiplying total $T_{4}$ by $T_{3}$ resin uptake.

\section*{SERUM T ${ }_{3}$ AND T ${ }_{4}$}

Measurement of total $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ includes protein-bound and free hormone levels that occur in response to TSH secretion. $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is $80 \%$ bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG); $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is bound less firmly. Only $0.03 \%$ of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $0.3 \%$ of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is unbound. Any factor that alters binding proteins also changes the $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ levels. Serious systemic illnesses, medications (eg, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, phenytoin, salicylates), and protein wasting as a result of nephrosis and use of androgens may interfere with accurate test results. Normal range for $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is 4.5 to $11.5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 58.5 to $150 \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Although serum $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ levels generally increase or decrease together, the $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ level appears to be a more accurate indicator of hyperthyroidism, which causes a greater rise in $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ than $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ levels. The normal range for serum $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is 70 to $220 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 1.15 to $3.10 \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ).

\section*{$\mathrm{T}_{3}$ RESIN UPTAKE TEST}

The $T_{3}$ resin uptake test is an indirect measure of unsaturated TBG. Its purpose is to determine the amount of thyroid hormone bound to TBG and the number of available binding sites. This provides an index of the amount of thyroid hormone already present in the circulation. Normally, TBG is not fully saturated with thyroid hormone, and additional binding sites are available to combine with radioiodine-labeled $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ added to the blood specimen. The normal $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ uptake value is $25 \%$ to $35 \%$ (relative uptake fraction, 0.25 to 0.35 ), which indicates that about one third of the available sites of TBG are occupied by thyroid hormone. If the number of free or unoccupied binding sites is low, as in hyperthyroidism, the $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ uptake is greater than $35 \%(0.35)$. If the number of available sites is high, as occurs in hypothyroidism, the test results are less than $25 \%(0.25)$.
$\mathrm{T}_{3}$ uptake is useful in the evaluation of thyroid hormone levels in patients who have received diagnostic or therapeutic doses of

\section*{THYROID ANTIBODIES}

Autoimmune thyroid diseases include both hypothyroid and hyperthyroid conditions. Results of testing by immunoassay techniques for antithyroid antibodies, specifically antimicrosomal antibodies, are positive in chronic autoimmune thyroid disease ( $90 \%$ ), Hashimoto's thyroiditis ( $100 \%$ ), Graves' disease ( $80 \%$ ), and other organ-specific autoimmune disease, such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Antithyroid antibody titers are normally present in 5\% to 10\% of the population and increase with age.

\section*{RADIOACTIVE IODINE UPTAKE}

The radioactive iodine uptake test measures the rate of iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. The patient is administered a tracer dose of iodine-123 ( ${ }^{123}$ I) or another radionuclide, and a count is made over the thyroid gland with use of a scintillation counter, which detects and counts the gamma rays released from the breakdown of ${ }^{123} \mathrm{I}$ in the thyroid. It measures the proportion of the administered dose present in the thyroid gland at a specific time after its administration. It is a simple test and provides reliable results. It is affected by the patient's intake of iodide or thyroid hormone; therefore, a careful preliminary clinical history is essential in evaluating results. Normal values vary from one geographic region to another and with the intake of iodine. Patients with hyperthyroidism exhibit a high uptake of the ${ }^{123}$ I (in some patients, up to $90 \%$ ), whereas patients with hypothyroidism exhibit a very low uptake. This test is also used to determine what dose of ${ }^{123}$ I should be administered to treat a patient with hyperthyroidism.

\section*{FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY}

Using a small-gauge needle to sample the thyroid tissue for biopsy is a safe and accurate method of detecting malignancy. It is often the initial test for evaluation of thyroid masses. Results are reported as (1) negative (benign), (2) positive (malignant), (3) indeterminate (suspicious), and (4) inadequate (nondiagnostic).

\section*{THYROID SCAN, RADIOSCAN, OR SCINTISCAN}

In a thyroid scan, a scintillation detector or gamma camera moves back and forth across the area to be studied in a series of parallel tracks, and a visual image is made of the distribution of radioactivity in the area being scanned. Although ${ }^{123} \mathrm{I}$ has been the most commonly used isotope, several other radioactive isotopes, including technetium-99m ( ${ }^{99} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{Tc}$ ) pertechnetate, thallium, and americium, are also used.

Scans are helpful in determining the location, size, shape, and anatomic function of the thyroid gland, particularly when thyroid tissue is substernal or large. Identifying areas of increased function ("hot" areas) or decreased function ("cold" areas) can assist in diagnosis. Although most areas of decreased function do not represent malignancies, lack of function increases the likelihood of malignancy, particularly if only one nonfunctioning area is present. Scanning of the entire body, to obtain the total body profile, may be carried out in a search for a functioning thyroid metastasis.

\section*{OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS}

Ultrasound, CT scans, and MRI may be used to clarify or confirm the results of other diagnostic studies. Thyroglobulin (Tg), a precursor for $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$, can be measured reliably in the serum by radioimmunoassay. Clinically, it is used to detect persistence or recurrence of thyroid carcinoma.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

When thyroid tests are scheduled, it is necessary to determine whether the patient has taken medications or agents that contain iodine because these may alter the test results. Iodine-containing medications include contrast agents and those used to treat thyroid disorders. Less obvious sources of iodine are topical antiseptics, multivitamin preparations, and food supplements frequently found in health food stores; cough syrups; and amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent. Other medications that may affect test results are estrogens, salicylates, amphetamines, chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and mercurial diuretics. The nurse asks the patient about the use of these medications and notes their use on the laboratory requisition. Chart 42-1 gives a partial list of agents that may interfere with accurate testing of thyroid gland function.

\section*{ABNORMAL THYROID FUNCTION}

Inadequate secretion of thyroid hormone during fetal and neonatal development results in stunted physical and mental growth (cretinism) because of general depression of metabolic activity. In adults, hypothyroidism manifests as lethargy, slow mentation, and generalized slowing of body functions.

Oversecretion of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism) is manifested by a greatly increased metabolic rate. Many of the other characteristics of hyperthyroidism result from the increased response to circulating catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are discussed in detail in the following sections of this chapter.

Oversecretion of thyroid hormones is usually associated with an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter). Goiter also commonly occurs with iodine deficiency. In this latter condition, lack of iodine results in low levels of circulating thyroid hormones, which causes increased release of TSH; the elevated TSH causes overproduction of thyroglobulin and hypertrophy of the thyroid gland. The term euthyroid refers to thyroid hormone production that is within normal limits.

\section*{HYPOTHYROIDISM}

Hypothyroidism results from suboptimal levels of thyroid hormone. Thyroid deficiency can affect all body functions and can range from mild, subclinical forms to myxedema, an advanced form. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in adults is autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease), in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Symptoms of hyper-

thyroidism may later be followed by those of hypothyroidism and myxedema. Hypothyroidism also commonly occurs in patients with previous hyperthyroidism who have been treated with radioiodine or antithyroid medications or who have had surgery. It occurs most frequently in older women. Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer can also cause hypothyroidism in older men; therefore, testing of thyroid function is recommended for all patients who receive such treatment. Other causes of hypothyroidism are presented in Chart 42-2.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

More than $95 \%$ of patients with hypothyroidism have primary or thyroidal hypothyroidism, which refers to dysfunction of the thyroid gland itself. When thyroid dysfunction is caused by failure of the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, or both, it is known as central hypothyroidism. It may be referred to as pituitary or secondary hypothyroidism if it is caused entirely by a pituitary disorder, and hypothalamic or tertiary hypothyroidism if it is attributable to a disorder of the hypothalamus resulting in inadequate secretion of TSH because of decreased stimulation by TRH. When thyroid deficiency is present at birth, the condition is known as cretinism. In such instances, the mother may also suffer from thyroid deficiency.

The term myxedema refers to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in subcutaneous and other interstitial tissues. Although myxedema occurs in long-standing hypothyroidism, the term is used appropriately only to describe the extreme symptoms of severe hypothyroidism.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Early symptoms of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, but extreme fatigue makes it difficult for the person to complete a full day's work or participate in usual activities. Reports of hair loss, brittle nails, and dry skin are common, and numbness and tingling of the fingers may occur. On occasion, the voice may become husky, and the patient may complain of hoarseness. Menstrual disturbances such as menorrhagia or amenorrhea occur, in addition to loss of libido. Hypothyroidism affects women five times more frequently than men and occurs most often between 30 and 60 years of age.

Severe hypothyroidism results in a subnormal temperature and pulse rate. The patient usually begins to gain weight even without an increase in food intake, although severely hypothyroid patients may be cachectic. The skin becomes thickened because of an ac-

cumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the subcutaneous tissues (the origin of the term myxedema). The hair thins and falls out; the face becomes expressionless and masklike. The patient often complains of being cold even in a warm environment.

At first, the patient may be irritable and may complain of fatigue, but as the condition progresses, the emotional responses are subdued. The mental processes become dulled, and the patient appears apathetic. Speech is slow, the tongue enlarges, and hands and feet increase in size. The patient frequently complains of constipation. Deafness may also occur.

Advanced hypothyroidism may produce personality and cognitive changes characteristic of dementia. Inadequate ventilation and sleep apnea can occur with severe hypothyroidism. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and respiratory muscle weakness may also occur.

Severe hypothyroidism is associated with an elevated serum cholesterol level, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and poor left ventricular function. The patient with advanced hypothyroidism is hypothermic and abnormally sensitive to sedatives, opioids, and anesthetic agents. Therefore, these medications are administered only with extreme caution.

Patients with unrecognized hypothyroidism who are undergoing surgery are at increased risk for intraoperative hypotension and postoperative heart failure and altered mental status.

Myxedema coma describes the most extreme, severe stage of hypothyroidism, in which the patient is hypothermic and unconscious. Myxedema coma may follow increasing lethargy, progressing to stupor and then coma. Undiagnosed hypothyroidism may be precipitated by infection or other systemic disease or by use of sedatives or opioid analgesic agents. The patient's respiratory drive is depressed, resulting in alveolar hypoventilation, progressive $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention, narcosis, and coma. These symptoms, along with cardiovascular collapse and shock, require aggressive and intensive therapy if the patient is to survive. Even with early vigorous therapy, however, mortality is high.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Most patients with primary hypothyroidism are 40 to 70 years of age and present with long-standing mild to moderate hypothyroidism. Subclinical disease is common among older women and can be asymptomatic or mistaken for other medical conditions. Subtle symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, muscle aches, and mental confusion, may be attributed to the normal aging process by the patient, family, and health care provider. The higher prevalence of hypothyroidism in elderly people may be related to alterations in immune function with age. Regular screening of TSH levels is recommended for people older than 60 because they are at high risk for hypothyroidism (Ladenson et al., 2000).

The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism are often atypical in elderly people; the elderly patient may have few or no symptoms until the dysfunction is severe. Depression, apathy, or decreased mobility or activity may be the major initial symptom. The major symptoms of hypothyroidism may be depression and apathy, and may be accompanied by significant weight loss. One fourth of affected elderly patients experience constipation.

NURSING ALERT In all patients with hypothyroidism, the effects of analgesic agents, sedatives, and anesthetic agents are prolonged; particular caution is necessary in administering these agents to elderly patients because of concurrent changes in liver and renal function.

\section*{Medical Management}

The primary objective in the management of hypothyroidism is to restore a normal metabolic state by replacing the missing hormone.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Synthetic levothyroxine (Synthroid or Levothroid) is the preferred preparation for treating hypothyroidism and suppressing nontoxic goiters. The dosage for hormone replacement is based on the patient's serum TSH concentration. Desiccated thyroid is used less frequently because it often results in transient elevated serum concentrations of $T_{3}$, with occasional symptoms of hyperthyroidism. If replacement therapy is adequate, the symptoms of myxedema disappear and normal metabolic activity is resumed.

Prevention of Cardiac Dysfunction. Any patient who has had hypothyroidism for a long period is almost certain to have elevated serum cholesterol levels, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. As long as metabolism is subnormal and the tissues, including the myocardium, require relatively little oxygen, a reduction in blood supply is tolerated without overt symptoms of coronary artery disease. When thyroid hormone is administered, however, the oxygen demand increases, but oxygen delivery cannot be increased unless, or until, the atherosclerosis improves. This occurs very slowly, if at all. The occurrence of angina is the signal that the oxygen needs of the myocardium exceed its blood supply. Angina or dysrhythmias may occur when thyroid replacement is initiated because thyroid hormones enhance the cardiovascular effects of catecholamines.

NURSING ALERT The nurse must monitor for myocardial ischemia or infarction, which may occur in response to therapy in patients with severe, long-standing hypothyroidism or myxedema coma. The nurse must also be alert for signs of angina, especially during the early phase of treatment; if detected, it must be reported and treated at once to avoid a fatal myocardial infarction.

Obviously, if angina or dysrhythmias occur, thyroid hormone administration must be discontinued immediately. Later, when it can be resumed safely, thyroid hormone replacement should be prescribed cautiously at a lower dosage and under the close observation of the physician and the nurse.

Prevention of Medication Interactions. Precautions must be taken during the course of therapy because of the interaction of thyroid hormones with other medications. Thyroid hormones may increase blood glucose levels, which may necessitate adjustment in the dosage of insulin or oral antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes. The effects of thyroid hormone may be increased by phenytoin (Dilantin) and tricyclic antidepressant agents. Thyroid hormones may also increase the pharmacologic effects of digitalis glycosides, anticoagulant agents, and indomethacin, requiring careful observation and assessment by the nurse for side effects. Bone loss and osteoporosis may also occur with thyroid therapy.

NURSING ALERT Severe untreated hypothyroidism is characterized by an increased susceptibility to the effects of all hypnotic and sedative agents.

Even in small doses, hypnotic and sedative agents may induce profound somnolence, lasting far longer than anticipated. More-
over, they are likely to cause respiratory depression, which can easily be fatal because of decreased respiratory reserve and alveolar hypoventilation. If their use is necessary, the dose is one-half or one-third that ordinarily prescribed in patients of similar age and weight with normal thyroid function. If these medications must be used, the patient must be monitored closely for signs of impending narcosis (stupor-like condition) or respiratory failure.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

In the elderly patient with mild to moderate hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement must be started with low dosages and increased gradually to prevent serious cardiovascular and neurologic side effects. Angina, for example, may occur with rapid thyroid replacement in the presence of coronary artery disease secondary to the hypothyroid state. Heart failure and tachydysrhythmias may worsen during the transition from the hypothyroid state to the normal metabolic state. Dementia may become more apparent during early thyroid hormone replacement in the elderly patient.

Elderly patients with severe hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis may also become confused and agitated if their metabolic rates are raised too quickly. Marked clinical improvement follows the administration of hormone replacement; such medication must be continued for life, even though signs of hypothyroidism disappear within 3 to 12 weeks.

Myxedema and myxedema coma generally occur exclusively in patients older than 50 years. The high mortality rate of myxedema coma mandates immediate intravenous administration of high doses of thyroid hormone as well as supportive care.

\section*{SUPPORTIVE THERAPY}

In severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, management includes maintaining vital functions. Arterial blood gases may be measured to determine $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention and to guide the use of assisted ventilation to combat hypoventilation. Pulse oximetry may also be helpful in monitoring oxygen saturation levels. Fluids are administered cautiously because of the danger of water intoxication. Application of external heat (eg, heating pads) is avoided because it increases oxygen requirements and may lead to vascular collapse. If hypoglycemia is evident, concentrated glucose may be prescribed to provide glucose without precipitating fluid overload. Thyroid hormone (usually Synthroid) is administered intravenously until consciousness is restored if myxedema has progressed to myxedema coma. The patient is then continued on oral thyroid hormone therapy. Because of an associated adrenocortical insufficiency, corticosteroid therapy may be necessary.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the patient with hypothyroidism and myxedema is summarized in the Plan of Nursing Care.

\section*{MODIFYING ACTIVITY}

The patient with hypothyroidism experiences decreased energy and moderate to severe lethargy. As a result, the risk for complications from immobility increases. The patient's ability to exercise and participate in activities is further limited by the changes in cardiovascular and pulmonary status secondary to hypothyroidism. A major role of the nurse is assisting with care and hygiene while encouraging the patient to participate in activities within established tolerance levels to prevent the complications of immobility.

\section*{MONITORING PHYSICAL STATUS}

The nurse closely monitors the patient's vital signs and cognitive level to detect the following:
- Deterioration of physical and mental status
- Signs and symptoms indicating that treatment has resulted in the metabolic rate exceeding the ability of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems to respond
- Continued limitations or complications of myxedema

NURSING ALERT Medications are administered to the patient with hypothyroidism with extreme caution because of the potential for altered metabolism and excretion and depressed metabolic rate and respiratory status.

\section*{PROMOTING PHYSICAL COMFORT}

The patient often experiences chilling and extreme intolerance to cold, even if the room feels comfortable or hot to others. Extra clothing and blankets are provided, and the patient is protected from drafts. Use of heating pads and electric blankets is avoided because of the risk of peripheral vasodilation, further loss of body heat, and vascular collapse. Additionally, the patient could be burned by these items without being aware of it because of delayed responses and decreased mental status.

\section*{PROVIDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT}

The patient with moderate to severe hypothyroidism may experience severe emotional reactions to changes in appearance and body image and the frequent delay in diagnosis. The nonspecific, early symptoms may produce negative reactions by family members and friends, and the family and friends may have labeled the patient mentally unstable, uncooperative, or unwilling to participate in self-care activities.

As hypothyroidism is treated successfully and symptoms subside, the patient may experience depression and guilt as a result of the progression and severity of symptoms that occurred. The nurse informs the patient and family that the symptoms and inability to recognize them are common and part of the disorder itself. The patient and family may require assistance and counseling to deal with the emotional concerns and reactions that result.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Because most hypothyroidism treatment takes place at home, the patient and family require information and instruction that will enable them to monitor the patient's condition and response to therapy. The nurse instructs the patient about the desired actions and side effects of medications and about how and when to take prescribed medications. The importance of continuing to take medications as prescribed even after symptoms improve is stressed to the patient. Because of the slowed mental processes that occur with hypothyroidism, it is important that a family member also be informed and instructed about treatment goals, medication schedules, and side effects to be reported to the physician. The nurse provides written instructions and guidelines for the patient and family.

Dietary instruction is provided to promote weight loss once medication has been initiated and to promote return of normal bowel patterns. The patient and family are often very concerned about the changes they have observed as a result of the hypothyroid state. It is often reassuring to the patient and family to be informed that many of the symptoms will disappear with effective treatment (Chart 42-3).

Continuing Care. The patient with hypothyroidism and myxedema coma needs considerable follow-up and health care. Before hospital discharge, arrangements are made to ensure that the patient returns to an environment that will promote adherence to the prescribed treatment plan. Assistance in devising a schedule or record ensures accurate and complete administration of medications. The nurse reinforces the importance of continued thyroid hormone replacement and periodic follow-up testing and instructs the patient and family members about the signs of overmedication and undermedication.

If indicated, a referral is made for home care. The home care nurse assesses the patient's progress toward recovery and ability to cope with the recent changes, along with the patient's physical and cognitive status and the patient's and family's understanding of the importance of prescribed long-term medication therapy and compliance with the medication schedule and recommended follow-up tests and appointments. The nurse documents, and reports to the patient's primary health care provider, subtle signs and symptoms that may indicate either inadequate or excessive thyroxine hormone.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The elderly patient requires periodic follow-up monitoring of serum TSH levels because poor compliance with therapy may occur or the patient may take the medications erratically. A careful history may identify the need for further teaching about the importance of the medication. Because of the prevalence of hypothyroidism, testing of serum TSH levels in elderly people every 5 years has been recommended (Smallridge, 2000). In addition, the patient is reminded of the importance of participating in general health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

\section*{HYPERTHYROIDISM}

Hyperthyroidism is the second most prevalent endocrine disorder, after diabetes mellitus. Graves' disease, the most common type of hyperthyroidism, results from an excessive output of thyroid hormones caused by abnormal stimulation of the thyroid gland by circulating immunoglobulins. It affects women eight times more frequently than men, with onset usually between the second and fourth decades (Tierney et al., 2001). It may appear after an emotional shock, stress, or an infection, but the exact significance of these relationships is not understood. Other common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroiditis and excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients with well-developed hyperthyroidism exhibit a characteristic group of signs and symptoms (sometimes referred to as thyrotoxicosis). The presenting symptom is often nervousness. These patients are often emotionally hyperexcitable, irritable, and apprehensive; they cannot sit quietly; they suffer from palpitations; and their pulse is abnormally rapid at rest as well as on exertion. They tolerate heat poorly and perspire unusually freely. The skin is flushed continuously, with a characteristic salmon color, and is likely to be warm, soft, and moist. Elderly patients, however, may report dry skin and diffuse pruritus. A fine tremor of the hands may be observed. Patients may exhibit exophthalmos (bulging eyes), which produces a startled facial expression.

Other manifestations include an increased appetite and dietary intake, progressive weight loss, abnormal muscular fatigability and weakness (difficulty in climbing stairs and rising from a chair), amenorrhea, and changes in bowel function. The pulse rate ranges constantly between 90 and 160 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$; the systolic, but characteristically not the diastolic, blood pressure is elevated; atrial fibrillation may occur; and cardiac decompensation in the form of heart failure is common, especially in elderly patients. Osteoporosis and fracture are also associated with hyperthyroidism.

Cardiac effects may include sinus tachycardia or dysrhythmias, increased pulse pressure, and palpitations; it has been suggested that these changes may be related to increased sensitivity to catecholamines or to changes in neurotransmitter turnover. Myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure may occur if the hyperthyroidism is severe and untreated.

The course of the disease may be mild, characterized by remissions and exacerbations and terminating with spontaneous recovery in a few months or years. Conversely, it may progress relentlessly, with the untreated person becoming emaciated, intensely nervous, delirious, and even disoriented; eventually, the heart fails.

Symptoms of hyperthyroidism may occur with the release of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone as a result of inflammation after irradiation of the thyroid or destruction of thyroid tissue by tumor. Such symptoms may also occur with excessive administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of hypothyroidism. Long-standing use of thyroid hormone in the absence of close monitoring may be a cause of symptoms of hyperthyroidism. It is also likely to result in premature osteoporosis, particularly in women.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The thyroid gland invariably is enlarged to some extent. It is soft and may pulsate; a thrill often can be palpated, and a bruit is heard over the thyroid arteries. These are signs of greatly increased blood flow through the thyroid gland. In advanced cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the symptoms and an increase in serum $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and an increased ${ }^{123} \mathrm{I}$ or ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}$ uptake by the thyroid in excess of $50 \%$.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Although hyperthyroidism is much less common in elderly people than hypothyroidism, patients older than 60 years account for $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the cases of thyrotoxicosis. Although some older patients develop typical signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, in most an atypical picture is present, which is often subclinical (Toft, 2001).

Elderly patients commonly present with vague and nonspecific signs and symptoms, making disorders hard to detect. Symptoms such as tachycardia, fatigue, mental confusion, weight loss, change in bowel habits, and depression can be attributed to age and other illnesses common to elderly people. In addition, the patient may report cardiovascular symptoms and difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a chair because of muscle weakness. New or worsening heart failure or angina is more likely to occur in elderly than in younger patients. The elderly patient may experience a single manifestation, such as atrial fibrillation, anorexia, or weight loss. These signs and symptoms may mask the underlying thyroid disease.

Spontaneous remission of hyperthyroidism is rare in elderly patients. Measurement of TSH is indicated in elderly patients with unexplained physical or mental deterioration.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of hyperthyroidism is directed toward reducing thyroid hyperactivity to relieve symptoms and remove the cause of important complications. Treatment depends on the cause of the hyperthyroidism and may require a combination of therapeutic approaches.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Two forms of pharmacotherapy are available for treating hyperthyroidism and controlling excessive thyroid activity: (1) use of irradiation by administration of the radioisotope ${ }^{123} \mathrm{I}$ or ${ }^{131} \mathrm{I}$ for destructive effects on the thyroid gland and (2) antithyroid medications that interfere with the synthesis of thyroid hormones and other agents that control manifestations of hyperthyroidism. Surgical removal of most of the thyroid gland is a nonpharmacologic alternative.

Radioactive lodine Therapy. The goal of radioactive iodine therapy ( ${ }^{123} \mathrm{I}$ or ${ }^{131} \mathrm{I}$ ) is to destroy the overactive thyroid cells. Use of radioactive iodine is the most common treatment in elderly patients. Almost all the iodine that enters and is retained in the body becomes concentrated in the thyroid gland. Therefore, the radioactive isotope of iodine is concentrated in the thyroid gland, where it destroys thyroid cells without jeopardizing other radiosensitive tissues. Over a period of several weeks, thyroid cells exposed to the radioactive iodine are destroyed, resulting in reduction of the hyperthyroid state and inevitably hypothyroidism.

The patient is instructed about what to expect with this tasteless, colorless radioiodine, which may be administered by the radiologist. A single oral dose of the agent is administered, based on 80 to $160 \mu \mathrm{Ci} / \mathrm{g}$ estimated thyroid weight. About $70 \%$ to $85 \%$ of patients are cured by one dose of radioactive iodine. An additional $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ require two doses; rarely is a third dose necessary. Use of an ablative dose of radioactive iodine initially causes an acute release of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland and may cause an increase of symptoms. The patient is observed for signs of thyroid storm; propranolol is useful in controlling these symptoms.

After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient is followed closely until the euthyroid state is reached. In 3 to 4 weeks, symp-
toms of hyperthyroidism subside. Because the incidence of hypothyroidism after this form of treatment is very high (ie, more than $90 \%$ at 10 years), close follow-up is required to evaluate thyroid function. Thyroid hormone replacement is necessary; small doses are usually prescribed, with the dose gradually increased over a period of months (up to about 1 year) until the $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ and TSH levels stabilize within normal ranges.

Radioactive iodine has been used to treat toxic adenomas and multinodular goiter and most varieties of thyrotoxicosis (rarely permanently successful); it is preferred for treating patients beyond the childbearing years with diffuse toxic goiter. It is contraindicated in pregnancy and in nursing mothers because radioiodine crosses the placenta and is secreted in breast milk. A major advantage of treatment with radioactive iodine is that it avoids many of the side effects associated with antithyroid medications. However, many patients and their families fear medications that are radioactive. Because of this fear, many patients elect to take antithyroid medications rather than radioactive iodine.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The use of radioactive iodine is generally recommended for treatment of thyrotoxicosis in elderly patients unless an enlarged thyroid gland is pressing on the airway. The hypermetabolic state of thyrotoxicosis must be controlled by antithyroid medications before radioactive iodine is administered because radiation may precipitate thyroid storm by increasing the release of hormone from the thyroid gland. Thyroid storm, if it occurs, has a mortality rate of $10 \%$ in elderly patients (Chart 42-4).

Antithyroid Medications. The objective of pharmacotherapy is to inhibit one or more stages in thyroid hormone synthesis or hormone release; another goal may be to reduce the amount of thyroid tissue, with resulting decreased thyroid hormone production.

Antithyroid agents block the utilization of iodine by interfering with the iodination of thyrosine and the coupling of iodothyrosines in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. This prevents the synthesis of thyroid hormone. The most commonly used medications are propylthiouracil (Propacil, PTU) or methimazole (Tapazole) until the patient is euthyroid (ie, neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid). These medications block extrathyroidal conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Because antithyroid medications do not interfere with release or activity of previously formed thyroid hormones, it may take several weeks for relief of symptoms. At this time the maintenance dose is established, followed by a gradual withdrawal of the medication over the next several months.

Therapy is determined on the basis of clinical criteria, including changes in pulse rate, pulse pressure, body weight, size of the goiter, and results of laboratory studies of thyroid function.

Toxic complications of antithyroid medications are relatively uncommon; nevertheless, the importance of periodic follow-up is emphasized because medication sensitization, fever, rash, urticaria, or even agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia (decrease in granulocytes and platelets) may develop. With any sign of infection, especially pharyngitis and fever or the occurrence of mouth ulcers, the patient is advised to stop the medication, notify the physician immediately, and undergo hematologic studies. Rash, arthralgias, and fever occur in 5\% of patients. Agranulocytosis, the most serious toxic side effect, occurs in 1 of every 200 patients. Its incidence is higher in patients older than 40 years. It generally occurs within the first 3 months of therapy but may occur up to 1 year after it is started.

\section*{Thyroid Storm (Thyrotoxic Crisis, Thyrotoxicosis)}

Thyroid storm (thyrotoxic crisis) is a form of severe hyperthyroidism, usually of abrupt onset. Untreated it is almost always fatal, but with proper treatment the mortality rate is reduced substantially. The patient with thyroid storm or crisis is critically ill and requires astute observation and aggressive and supportive nursing care during and after the acute stage of illness.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Thyroid storm is characterized by:
- High fever (hyperpyrexia) above $38.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(101.3^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$
- Extreme tachycardia (more than 130 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ )
- Exaggerated symptoms of hyperthyroidism with disturbances of a major system-for example, GI (weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain), or cardiovascular (edema, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations)
- Altered neurologic or mental state, which frequently appears as delirium psychosis, somnolence, or coma
Life-threatening thyroid storm is usually precipitated by stress, such as injury, infection, thyroid and nonthyroid surgery, tooth extraction, insulin reaction, diabetic acidosis, pregnancy, digitalis intoxication, abrupt withdrawal of antithyroid medications, extreme emotional stress, or vigorous palpation of the thyroid. These factors can precipitate thyroid storm in the partially controlled or completely untreated patient with hyperthyroidism. Current methods of diagnosis and treatment for hyperthyroidism have greatly decreased the incidence of thyroid storm, making it uncommon today.

\section*{Management}

Immediate objectives are reduction of body temperature and heart rate and prevention of vascular collapse. Measures to accomplish these objectives include:
- A hypothermia mattress or blanket, ice packs, a cool environment, hydrocortisone, and acetaminophen (Tylenol). Salicylates (eg, aspirin) are not used because they displace thyroid hormone from binding proteins and worsen the hypermetabolism.
- Humidified oxygen is administered to improve tissue oxygenation and meet the high metabolic demands. Arterial blood gas levels or pulse oximetry may be used to monitor respiratory status.
- Intravenous fluids containing dextrose are administered to replace liver glycogen stores that have been decreased in the hyperthyroid patient.
- PTU or methimazole is administered to impede formation of thyroid hormone and block conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, the more active form of thyroid hormone.
- Hydrocortisone is prescribed to treat shock or adrenal insufficiency.
- Iodine is administered to decrease output of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ from the thyroid gland. For cardiac problems such as atrial fibrillation, dysrhythmias, and heart failure, sympatholytic agents may be administered. Propranolol, combined with digitalis, has been effective in reducing severe cardiac symptoms.

Patients taking antithyroid medications are instructed not to use decongestants for nasal stuffiness because they are poorly tolerated. Antithyroid medications are contraindicated in late pregnancy because they may produce goiter and cretinism in the fetus.

Thyroid hormone is occasionally administered with antithyroid medications to put the thyroid gland at rest. In this approach, hypothyroidism from excess antithyroid medication is avoided, as is stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH. Thyroid hormone is available as thyroglobulin (Proloid) and levothyroxine sodium (Synthroid). These slow-acting preparations take about 10 days to achieve their full effect. Liothyronine sodium (Cytomel) has a more rapid onset, and its action is of short duration.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

If antithyroid agents are used in elderly patients, the patient must be monitored closely because elderly patients are more likely to develop granulocytopenia. The dosage of other medications to treat other chronic illnesses in elderly patients may need to be modified because of the altered rate of metabolism in hyperthyroidism.

Adjunctive Therapy. Iodine or iodide compounds, once the only therapy available for patients with hyperthyroidism, are no longer used as the sole method of treatment. Such compounds decrease the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland and reduce the vascularity and size of the thyroid. Compounds such as potassium iodide (KI), Lugol's solution, and saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) may be used in combination with antithyroid agents or beta-adrenergic blockers to prepare the patient with hyperthyroidism for surgery. These agents reduce the activity of the thyroid hormone and the vascularity of the thyroid gland, making the surgical procedure safer. Solutions of iodine and iodide compounds are more palatable in milk or fruit juice and are administered through a straw to prevent staining of the teeth. These compounds
reduce the metabolic rate more rapidly than antithyroid medications, but their action does not last as long.

> NURSING ALERT Patients receiving these medications should be observed for the development of goiter and should be cautioned against use of over-the-counter medications that contain iodides and can increase the response to iodide therapy. Cough medications, expectorants, bronchodilators, and salt substitutes may contain iodide and should be avoided by the patient receiving iodide therapy.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are important in controlling the sympathetic nervous system effects of hyperthyroidism. For example, propranolol (Inderal) is used to control nervousness, tachycardia, tremor, anxiety, and heat intolerance. The patient continues taking propranolol until the $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ is within the normal range and the TSH level approaches normal.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents (eg, propranolol [Inderal]) may be indicated to decrease the cardiovascular and neurologic signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. These agents must be used with extreme caution in elderly patients to minimize adverse effects on cardiac function that may produce heart failure.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgery to remove thyroid tissue was once the primary method of treating hyperthyroidism; today, surgery is reserved for special circumstances-for example, in pregnant women allergic to antithyroid medications, patients with large goiters, or patients unable to take antithyroid agents. Surgery for treatment of hyperthyroidism is performed soon after the thyroid function has returned to normal ( 4 to 6 weeks).

The surgical removal of about five sixths of the thyroid tissue (subtotal thyroidectomy) practically ensures a prolonged remission in most patients with exophthalmic goiter. Its use today is reserved for large goiters, presence of obstructive symptoms, pregnant women, or when there is a need for rapid normalization of thyroid function (Argueta \& Whitaker, 2000; Fatourechi, 2000). Before surgery, propylthiouracil is administered until signs of hyperthyroidism have disappeared. A beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol) may be used to reduce the heart rate and other signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism; however, this does not create a euthyroid state. Iodine (Lugol's solution or potassium iodide) may be prescribed in an effort to reduce blood loss; however, the effectiveness of this is unknown. Patients receiving iodine medication must be monitored for evidence of iodine toxicity (iodism), which requires immediate withdrawal of the medication. Symptoms of iodism include swelling of the buccal mucosa, excessive salivation, coryza, and skin eruptions.

\section*{Recurrent Hyperthyroidism}

No treatment for thyrotoxicosis is without side effects, and all three treatments (radioactive iodine therapy, antithyroid medications, and surgery) share the same complications: relapse or recurrent hyperthyroidism and permanent hypothyroidism. The rate of relapse increases in patients who had very severe disease, a long history of dysfunction, ocular and cardiac symptoms, large goiter, and relapse after previous treatment. The relapse rate after radioactive iodine therapy depends on the dose used in treatment. Patients receiving a lower dose of radioactive iodine are more likely to require subsequent treatment than those being treated with a higher dose. Hypothyroidism occurs in almost $80 \%$ of patients at 1 year and in $90 \%$ to $100 \%$ by 5 years for both the multiple low-dose and single high-dose methods.

Although rates of relapse and the occurrence of hypothyroidism vary, relapse with antithyroid medications is about $45 \%$ by 1 year after completion of therapy and almost $75 \%$ by 5 years later (Larson et al., 2000). Discontinuation of antithyroid medications before therapy is complete usually results in relapse within 6 months in most patients. The incidence of relapse with subtotal thyroidectomy is $19 \%$ at 18 months; an incidence of hypothyroidism of $25 \%$ has been reported at 18 months after surgery. The risk for these complications illustrates the importance of long-term follow-up of patients treated for hyperthyroidism.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS:}

\section*{THE PATIENT WITH HYPERTHYROIDISM}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history and examination focus on symptoms related to accelerated or exaggerated metabolism. These include the patient's and family's report of irritability and increased emotional reaction and the impact these changes have had on the patient's interaction with family, friends, and coworkers. The history includes other stressors and the patient's ability to cope with stress.

The nurse assesses the patient's nutritional status and the presence of symptoms. Symptoms related to excessive nervous system output and changes in vision and appearance of the eyes are noted. The nurse periodically assesses and monitors the patient's cardiac status, including heart rate, blood pressure, heart sounds, and peripheral pulses.

Because emotional changes are associated with hyperthyroidism, the patient's emotional state and psychological status are
evaluated, as are such symptoms as irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances, apathy, and lethargy, all of which may occur with hyperthyroidism. The family may also provide information about recent changes in the patient's emotional status.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses of the patient with hyperthyroidism include the following:
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to exaggerated metabolic rate, excessive appetite, and increased gastrointestinal activity
- Ineffective coping related to irritability, hyperexcitability, apprehension, and emotional instability
- Low self-esteem related to changes in appearance, excessive appetite, and weight loss
- Altered body temperature

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm
- Hypothyroidism

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The goals for the patient may be improved nutritional status, improved coping ability, improved self-esteem, maintenance of normal body temperature, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

Hyperthyroidism affects all body systems, including the gastrointestinal system. The appetite is increased but may be satisfied by several well-balanced meals of small size, even up to six meals a day. Foods and fluids are selected to replace fluid lost through diarrhea and diaphoresis and to control the diarrhea that results from increased peristalsis. Rapid movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract may result in nutritional imbalance and further weight loss. To reduce diarrhea, highly seasoned foods and stimulants such as coffee, tea, cola, and alcohol are discouraged. High-calorie, high-protein foods are encouraged. A quiet atmosphere during mealtime may aid digestion. Weight and dietary intake are recorded to monitor nutritional status.

\section*{ENHANCING COPING MEASURES}

The patient with hyperthyroidism needs reassurance that the emotional reactions being experienced are a result of the disorder and that with effective treatment those symptoms will be controlled. Because of the negative effect these symptoms have on family and friends, they too need reassurance that these symptoms are expected to disappear with treatment.

It is important to use a calm, unhurried approach with the patient. Stressful experiences are minimized; therefore, if hospitalized, the patient is not placed in a room with very ill or talkative patients. The environment is kept quiet and uncluttered. Noises, such as loud music, conversation, and equipment alarms, are minimized. The nurse encourages relaxing activities if they do not overstimulate the patient.

If thyroidectomy is planned, the patient needs to know that pharmacologic therapy is necessary to prepare the thyroid gland for surgical treatment. The nurse instructs and reminds the patient to take the medications as prescribed. Because of hyperexcitability and shortened attention span, the patient may require repetition of this information and written instructions.

\section*{IMPROVING SELF-ESTEEM}

The hyperthyroid patient is likely to experience changes in appearance, appetite, and weight. These factors, along with the patient's inability to cope well with family and the illness, may result in loss of self-esteem. The nurse conveys an understanding of the patient's concern about these problems and assists the patient to develop effective coping strategies. The patient and family need to know that these changes are a result of the thyroid dysfunction and are, in fact, out of the patient's control.

If changes in appearance are very disturbing to the patient, mirrors may be covered or removed. In addition, the nurse reminds family members and personnel to avoid bringing these changes to the patient's attention. The nurse explains to the patient and family that most of these changes are expected to disappear with effective treatment.

If the patient experiences eye changes secondary to hyperthyroidism, eye care and protection may become necessary. The patient may need instructions about instillation of eye drops or ointment prescribed to soothe the eyes and protect the exposed cornea.

The patient may be embarrassed by the need to eat large meals. Therefore, the nurse arranges for the patient to eat alone if desired and avoids commenting on the patient's large dietary intake while making sure that the patient receives sufficient food.

\section*{MAINTAINING NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE}

The patient with hyperthyroidism frequently finds a normal room temperature too warm because of an exaggerated metabolic rate and increased heat production. The nurse maintains the environment at a cool, comfortable temperature and changes bedding and clothing as needed. Cool baths and cool or cold fluids may provide relief. The reason for the patient's discomfort and the importance of providing a cool environment are explained to the family and staff.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The nurse closely monitors the patient with hyperthyroidism for signs and symptoms that may be indicative of thyroid storm. Cardiac and respiratory function are assessed by measuring vital signs and cardiac output, ECG monitoring, arterial blood gases, and pulse oximetry. Assessment continues when treatment is initiated because of the potential side effects on cardiac function. Oxygen is administered to prevent hypoxia, to improve tissue oxygenation, and to meet the high metabolic demands. Intravenous fluids may be necessary to maintain blood glucose levels and to replace lost fluids. Antithyroid medications (PTU or methimazole) may be prescribed to reduce thyroid hormone levels. In addition, propranolol and digitalis may be prescribed to treat cardiac symptoms. If shock develops, treatment strategies must be implemented (see Chap. 15).

Hypothyroidism is likely to occur with any of the treatments used to treat hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the nurse periodically monitors the patient. Most patients report a greatly improved sense of well-being after treatment of hyperthyroidism, and some fail to continue to take prescribed thyroid replacement therapy. Therefore, part of patient and family teaching is instruction about the importance of continuing therapy indefinitely after discharge and a discussion of the consequences of failing to take medication.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The nurse teaches the patient with hyperthyroidism how and when to take prescribed medication, and provides instruction about the essential role of the medication in the broader therapeutic plan. Because of the hyperexcitability and decreased attention span associated with hyperthyroidism, the nurse provides a written plan for the patient to use at home. The type and amount of information given depend on the patient's stress and anxiety levels. The patient and family members receive verbal and written information about the actions and possible side effects of the medications. The nurse identifies adverse effects that should be reported if they occur (Chart 42-5).

If a total or subtotal thyroidectomy is anticipated, the patient needs information about what to expect. This information is repeated as the time of surgery approaches. The nurse also advises
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-236.jpg?height=741&width=1783&top_left_y=1869&top_left_x=202)
the patient to avoid stressful situations that may precipitate thyroid storm.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care, if indicated, allows the home care nurse to assess the home and family environment and the patient's and family's understanding of the importance of adhering to the therapeutic regimen and the recommended follow-up monitoring. The nurse reinforces to the patient and family the importance of long-term follow-up because of the risk for hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy or treatment with antithyroid medications or radioactive iodine. The nurse also assesses the patient for changes indicating return to normal thyroid function and signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Further, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

\section*{THYROIDITIS}

Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid gland, can be acute, subacute, or chronic. Each type of thyroiditis is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, or lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland.

\section*{ACUTE THYROIDITIS}

Acute thyroiditis is a rare disorder caused by infection of the thyroid gland by bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, or parasites. Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci are the most common causes. Infection typically causes anterior neck pain and swelling, fever, dysphagia, and dysphonia. Pharyngitis or pharyngeal pain is often present. Examination may reveal warmth, erythema (redness), and tenderness of the thyroid gland. Treatment of acute thyroiditis in-
cludes antimicrobial agents and fluid replacement. Surgical incision and drainage may be needed if an abscess is present.

\section*{SUBACUTE THYROIDITIS}

Subacute thyroiditis may be subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (deQuervain's thyroiditis) or painless thyroiditis (silent thyroiditis or subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis). Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland that predominantly affects women between 40 and 50 years old (Smallridge, 2000). The condition presents as a painful swelling in the anterior neck that lasts 1 to 2 months and then disappears spontaneously without residual effect. It often follows a respiratory infection. The thyroid enlarges symmetrically and may be painful. The overlying skin is often reddened and warm. Swallowing may be difficult and uncomfortable. Irritability, nervousness, insomnia, and weight loss-manifestations of hyperthyroidism-are common, and many patients experience chills and fever as well.

Treatment aims to control the inflammation. In general, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to relieve neck pain. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is avoided if symptoms of hyperthyroidism occur because aspirin displaces thyroid hormone from its binding sites and increases the amount of circulating hormone. Beta-blocking agents (eg, propranolol [Inderal]) may be used to control symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid agents, which block the synthesis of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, are not effective in thyroiditis because the associated thyrotoxicosis results from the release of stored thyroid hormones rather than from their increased synthesis. In more severe cases, oral corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce swelling and relieve pain; however, they do not usually affect the underlying cause. In some cases, temporary hypothyroidism may develop and may necessitate thyroid hormone therapy. Follow-up monitoring is necessary to document the patient's return to a euthyroid state.

Painless thyroiditis (subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis) often occurs in the postpartum period and is thought to be an autoimmune process. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism are possible. Treatment is directed at symptoms, and yearly follow-up is recommended to determine the patient's need for treatment of subsequent hypothyroidism.

\section*{CHRONIC THYROIDITIS (HASHIMOTO'S DISEASE)}

Chronic thyroiditis, which occurs most frequently in women between 30 and 50 years old, has been termed Hashimoto's disease, or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis; its diagnosis is based on the histologic appearance of the inflamed gland. In contrast to acute thyroiditis, the chronic forms are usually not accompanied by pain, pressure symptoms, or fever, and thyroid activity is usually normal or low rather than increased. Cell-mediated immunity may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic thyroiditis, and there may be a genetic predisposition to it. If untreated, the disease runs a slow, progressive course, leading eventually to hypothyroidism.

The objective of treatment is to reduce the size of the thyroid gland and prevent hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone therapy is prescribed to reduce thyroid activity and the production of thyroglobulin. If hypothyroid symptoms are present, thyroid hormone therapy is prescribed. Surgery may be required if pressure symptoms persist.

\section*{THYROID TUMORS}

Tumors of the thyroid gland are classified on the basis of being benign or malignant, the presence or absence of associated thyrotoxicosis, and the diffuse or irregular quality of the glandular

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Metabolic Disorders}

Some examples of metabolic and endocrine disorders influenced by genetic factors include the following:
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
- Cystic fibrosis
- Diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2
- Hereditary hemochromatosis
- Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type I and type II
- Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
- Possibly, the chronic thyroiditis known as Hashimoto's disease

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Assess family history for relatives with early-onset hepatic, pancreatic, endocrine disease.
- Inquire about family members with diabetes and their ages at onset.
- Assess family history of other related genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- Assess for physical symptoms such as mucosal neuromas, hypertrophied lips, skeletal abnormalities, and marfanoid appearance.
- Assess for signs of arthritis, bronze pigmentation of the skin (hereditary hemochromatosis).

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether DNA mutation testing has been performed on any affected family member.
- If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of genetic testing and gene-based interventions.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to families with newly diagnosed geneticrelated metabolic and endocrine conditions.
- Participate in management and coordination of care of patients with genetic conditions, individuals predisposed to develop or pass on a genetic condition.

enlargement. If the enlargement is sufficient to cause a visible swelling in the neck, the tumor is referred to as a goiter.

All grades of goiter are encountered, from those that are barely visible to those producing disfigurement. Some are symmetric and diffuse; others are nodular. Some are accompanied by hyperthyroidism, in which case they are described as toxic; others are associated with a euthyroid state and are called nontoxic goiters.

\section*{ENDEMIC (IODINE-DEFICIENT) GOITER}

The most common type of goiter, encountered chiefly in geographic regions where the natural supply of iodine is deficient (eg, the Great Lakes areas of the United States), is the so-called simple or colloid goiter. In addition to being caused by an iodine deficiency, simple goiter may be caused by an intake of large quantities of goitrogenic substances in patients with unusually susceptible glands. These substances include excessive amounts of iodine or lithium, which is used in treating bipolar disorders.

Simple goiter represents a compensatory hypertrophy of the thyroid gland, caused by stimulation by the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland produces thyrotropin or TSH, a hormone that controls the release of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland. Its production increases if there is subnormal thyroid activity, as when insufficient iodine is available for production of the thyroid hormone. Such goiters usually cause no symptoms, except for the
swelling in the neck, which may result in tracheal compression when excessive.

Many goiters of this type recede after iodine imbalance is corrected. Supplementary iodine, such as SSKI, is prescribed to suppress the pituitary's thyroid-stimulating activity. When surgery is recommended, the risk for postoperative complications is minimized by ensuring a preoperative euthyroid state by treatment with antithyroid medications and iodide to reduce the size and vascularity of the goiter.

Providing children in iodine-poor regions with iodine compounds can prevent simple or endemic goiter. If the mean iodine intake is less than $40 \mathrm{fg} /$ day , the thyroid gland hypertrophies. The World Health Organization recommends that salt be iodized to a concentration of 1 part in 100,000, which is adequate for the prevention of endemic goiter. In the United States, salt is iodized to 1 part in 10,000 . The introduction of iodized salt has been the single most effective means of preventing goiter in at-risk populations.

\section*{NODULAR GOITER}

Some thyroid glands are nodular because of areas of hyperplasia (overgrowth). No symptoms may arise as a result of this condition, but not uncommonly these nodules slowly increase in size, with some descending into the thorax, where they cause local pressure symptoms. Some nodules become malignant, and some
are associated with a hyperthyroid state. Thus, the patient with many thyroid nodules may eventually require surgery.

\section*{THYROID CANCER}

Cancer of the thyroid is much less prevalent than other forms of cancer; however, it accounts for $90 \%$ of endocrine malignancies. According to the American Cancer Society (2002), about 20,700 new cases of thyroid cancer are diagnosed each year. Women account for 15,800 of the new cases and men 4,900. About 800 women and 500 men die annually from this malignancy. There are several types of cancer of the thyroid gland; the type determines the course and prognosis (Table 42-3).

External radiation of the head, neck, or chest in infancy and childhood increases the risk of thyroid carcinoma. Between 1940 and 1960, radiation therapy was occasionally used to shrink enlarged tonsillar and adenoid tissue, to treat acne, or to reduce an enlarged thymus. For people exposed to external radiation in childhood, there appears to be an increased incidence of thyroid cancer 5 to 40 years after irradiation. Consequently, people who underwent such treatment should consult a physician, request an isotope thyroid scan as part of the evaluation, follow recommended treatment of abnormalities of the gland, and continue with annual checkups (Chart 42-6).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Lesions that are single, hard, and fixed on palpation or associated with cervical lymphadenopathy suggest malignancy. Thyroid function tests may be helpful in evaluating thyroid nodules and
masses; however, their results are rarely conclusive. Needle biopsy of the thyroid gland is used as an outpatient procedure to make a diagnosis of thyroid cancer, to differentiate cancerous thyroid nodules from noncancerous nodules, and to stage the cancer if detected. The procedure is safe and usually requires only a local anesthetic. Patients who undergo the procedure are followed closely, however, because cancerous tissues may be missed during the procedure. A second type of aspiration or biopsy uses a largebore needle rather than the fine needle used in standard biopsy; it may be used when the results of the standard biopsy are inconclusive, or with rapidly growing tumors. Additional diagnostic studies include ultrasound, MRI, CT scans, thyroid scans, radioactive iodine uptake studies, and thyroid suppression tests.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment of choice for thyroid carcinoma is surgical removal. Total or near-total thyroidectomy is performed when possible. Modified neck dissection or more extensive radical neck dissection is performed if there is lymph node involvement.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Efforts are made to spare parathyroid tissue to reduce the risk for postoperative hypocalcemia and tetany. After surgery, ablation procedures are carried out with radioactive iodine to eradicate residual thyroid tissue if the tumor is radiosensitive. Radioactive iodine also maximizes the chance of discovering thyroid metastasis at a later date if total-body scans are carried out.

After surgery, thyroid hormone is administered in suppressive doses to lower the levels of TSH to a euthyroid state (Thyroid

Radiation-Induced Thyroid Damage and Cancer
The thyroid gland has a very efficient mechanism to remove iodine from the bloodstream and concentrate or "trap" it for subsequent synthesis of thyroid hormone. The effectiveness of this mechanism to concentrate iodide is reflected in a concentration of iodide 20 to 40 times the concentration of iodide in the plasma.

If milk and other food sources become contaminated with radioactivity as a result of a nuclear detonation or a nuclear power plant incident or mishap, the radioactive iodide would become concentrated in the thyroid gland at a very high concentration and would irradiate the thyroid gland, increasing the risk for thyroid gland cancer. Therefore, in communities exposed to increased radioactivity, attempts have been made to block the uptake of radioactive iodide by flooding or saturating the thyroid gland with nonradioactive iodide.

Administration of potassium iodide (KI) or other iodide preparations as soon as possible after exposure almost completely inhibits thyroid absorption of the radioactive iodide and promotes rapid excretion of any that is absorbed. In 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement recommending KI administration in advance of exposure to radioactive iodine-that is, when exposure is imminent (FDA, 2001).

Carcinoma Guidelines, 2001). If remaining thyroid tissue is inadequate to produce sufficient thyroid hormone, thyroxine is required permanently.

Several routes are available for administering radiation to the thyroid or tissues of the neck, including oral administration of radioactive iodine and external administration of radiation therapy. The patient who receives external sources of radiation therapy is at risk for mucositis, dryness of the mouth, dysphagia, redness of the skin, anorexia, and fatigue (see Chap. 16 for a discussion of these side effects of radiation). Chemotherapy is infrequently used to treat thyroid cancer.

Patients whose thyroid cancer is detected early and who are appropriately treated usually do very well. Patients who have had papillary cancer, the most common and least aggressive tumor, have a 10 -year survival rate greater than $90 \%$. Long-term survival is also common in follicular cancer, a more aggressive form of thyroid cancer (Tierney et al., 2001). Continued thyroid hormone therapy and periodic follow-up and diagnostic testing, however, are important to ensure the patient's well-being (Thyroid Carcinoma Guidelines, 2001).

Postoperatively, the patient is instructed to take exogenous thyroid hormone to prevent hypothyroidism. Later follow-up includes clinical assessment for recurrence of nodules or masses in the neck and signs of hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea. Totalbody scans are performed 2 to 4 months after surgery to detect residual thyroid tissue or metastatic disease. Thyroid hormones are stopped for about 6 weeks before the tests. Care must be taken to avoid iodine-containing foods and contrast agents. A repeat scan is done 1 year after the initial surgery. If measurements are stable, a final scan is obtained in 3 to 5 years.
$\mathrm{FT}_{4}$, TSH, serum calcium, and phosphorus levels are monitored to determine whether the thyroid hormone supplementation is adequate and to note whether calcium balance is maintained.

Although local and systemic reactions to radiation may occur and may include neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, these complications are rare when radioactive iodine is used. Patients who undergo surgery that is combined with radioiodine have a higher survival rate than those undergoing surgery alone. Patient teaching emphasizes the importance of taking prescribed medications and following recommendations for follow-up monitoring. The patient who is undergoing radiation therapy is also instructed in how to assess and manage side effects of treatment.

Partial or complete thyroidectomy may be carried out as primary treatment of thyroid carcinoma, hyperthyroidism, or hyperparathyroidism. The type and extent of the surgery depend on the

Stajduhar, K. I., Neithercut, J., Chu, E., Pham, P., Rohde, J., Sicotte, A., \& Young, K. (2000). Thyroid cancer:
Patients' experiences of receiving iodine-131 therapy. Oncology Nursing Forum, 27(8), 1213-1218.

\section*{Purpose}

Examination of quality of life and patient experiences for prevalent cancers is well documented in the literature. However, for cancers with low incidence rates, such as thyroid cancer, little information exists. This study examines the experiences of patients who received ${ }^{131} \mathrm{I}$ treatment for thyroid cancer. It explores the patients' perspective of educational needs related to treatment.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Patients who had received ${ }^{131}$ I therapy treatment within the previous 2 years were recruited from an oncology/acute care medical unit in a large tertiary medical center. Unstructured focus groups, telephone interviews, and field notes were used in data collection. Five men and 22 women ages 18 to 80 years (mean 38) were asked to respond to an open-ended prompt, such as, "Tell me about your experiences when you were a patient on our unit." Tape recordings were made during each contact and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes.

\section*{Findings}

Four major themes were elicited from the analysis: recognizing the totality of the cancer experience, recognizing the totality of the treat-
ment experiences, being isolated, and understanding barriers to treatment. Participants reported that health care providers did not understand the totality of their experience and that the experiences were often unrecognized or minimized. Isolation left many participants feeling uncared for and ignored. Effective communication by health care providers was identified as an important part of the support needed by patients. Information provided by caregivers was inconsistent, leaving the patients feeling confused and concerned that nurses and other care providers were unaware of the implications of receiving ${ }^{131}$ I therapy.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Patients receiving ${ }^{131}$ I therapy share many of the fears and concerns expressed by those receiving treatment for more prevalent forms of cancer. Effective communication is an essential component in addressing the psychosocial and physical needs of these patients. Comprehensive education programs for staff and patients prior to therapy are critical in providing consistent quality care. These programs must address the fears resulting from a lack of understanding and the implications associated with ${ }^{131}$ I therapy treatment to address the totality of the experience.
diagnosis, goal of surgery, and prognosis. Thyroidectomy may be the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic hyperparathyroidism (see later discussion), kidney stones, or bone disease.

The patient undergoing surgery for treatment of hyperthyroidism is given appropriate medications to return the thyroid hormone levels and metabolic rate to normal and to reduce the risk for thyroid storm and hemorrhage during the postoperative period. Medications that may prolong clotting (eg, aspirin) are stopped several weeks before surgery to minimize the risk for postoperative bleeding.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Important preoperative goals are to gain the patient's confidence and reduce anxiety. Often, the patient's home life has become tense because of his or her restlessness, irritability, and nervousness secondary to hyperthyroidism. Efforts are necessary to protect the patient from such tension and stress to avoid precipitating thyroid storm. If the patient reports increased stress when with family or friends, suggestions are made to limit contact with them. Quiet and relaxing forms of recreation or occupational therapy may be helpful.

\section*{PROVIDING PREOPERATIVE CARE}

The nurse instructs the patient about the importance of eating a diet high in carbohydrates and proteins. A high daily caloric intake is necessary because of the increased metabolic activity and rapid depletion of glycogen reserves. Supplementary vitamins, particularly thiamine and ascorbic acid, may be prescribed. The patient is reminded to avoid tea, coffee, cola, and other stimulants.

The nurse also informs the patient about the purpose of preoperative tests, if they are to be performed, and explains what preoperative preparations to expect. The information should help to reduce the patient's anxiety about the surgery. In addition, special efforts are made to ensure a good night's rest before surgery, although many patients are admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery.

Preoperative teaching includes demonstrating to the patient how to support the neck with the hands after surgery to prevent stress on the incision. This involves raising the elbows and placing the hands behind the neck to provide support and reduce strain and tension on the neck muscles and the surgical incision.

\section*{PROVIDING POSTOPERATIVE CARE}

The nurse periodically assesses the surgical dressings and reinforces them when necessary. When the patient is in a recumbent position, the nurse observes the sides and the back of the neck as well as the anterior dressing for bleeding. In addition to monitoring the pulse and blood pressure for any indication of internal bleeding, it is also important to be alert for complaints of a sensation of pressure or fullness at the incision site. Such symptoms may indicate hemorrhage and hematoma formation subcutaneously and should be reported.

Difficulty in respiration occurs as a result of edema of the glottis, hematoma formation, or injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This complication requires that an airway be inserted. Therefore, a tracheostomy set is kept at the bedside at all times, and the surgeon is summoned at the first indication of respiratory distress. If the respiratory distress is due to hematoma, surgical evacuation is required.

The intensity of pain is assessed and analgesic agents are administered as prescribed for pain. The nurse should anticipate apprehension in the patient and should inform him or her that oxygen will assist breathing. When moving and turning the pa-
tient, the nurse carefully supports the head and avoids tension on the sutures. The most comfortable position is the semi-Fowler's position, with the head elevated and supported by pillows.

Intravenous fluids are administered during the immediate postoperative period. Water may be given by mouth as soon as nausea subsides. Usually, there is a little difficulty in swallowing; initially, cold fluids and ice may be taken better than other fluids. Often, patients prefer a soft diet to a liquid diet in the immediate postoperative period.

The patient is advised to talk as little as possible to reduce edema to the vocal cords, but when the patient does speak, any voice changes are noted because they might indicate injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which lies just behind the thyroid next to the trachea.

An overbed table may be used to provide easy access to items that are needed frequently, such as paper tissues, water pitcher and glass, and a small emesis basin. These are kept within easy reach so that the patient will not need to turn the head to reach for them. It is also convenient to use this table when vapor-mist inhalations are prescribed for the relief of excessive mucous secretions.

The patient is usually permitted out of bed as soon as possible and is encouraged to eat foods that are easily eaten. A well-balanced, high-calorie diet may be prescribed to promote weight gain. Sutures or skin clips are usually removed on the second day. The patient is usually discharged from the hospital the day of surgery or soon afterward if the postoperative course is uncomplicated.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Hemorrhage, hematoma formation, edema of the glottis, and injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve are complications that have been reviewed previously in this chapter. Occasionally in thyroid surgery the parathyroid glands are injured or removed, producing a disturbance in calcium metabolism. As the blood calcium level falls, hyperirritability of the nerves occurs, with spasms of the hands and feet and muscle twitching. This group of symptoms is termed tetany, and the nurse must immediately report its appearance because laryngospasm, although rare, may occur and obstruct the airway. Tetany of this type is usually treated with intravenous calcium gluconate. This calcium abnormality is usually temporary after thyroidectomy.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient may be discharged the evening of surgery or within 1 or 2 days. Therefore, the patient and family need to be knowledgeable about the signs and symptoms of the complications that may occur and those that should be reported. Strategies are suggested for managing postoperative pain at home and for increasing humidification. The nurse explains to the patient and family the need for rest, relaxation, and nutrition. The patient is permitted to resume his or her former activities and responsibilities completely once recovered from surgery.

Continuing Care. If indicated, a referral to home care is made. The home care nurse assesses the patient's recovery from surgery. The nurse also assesses the surgical incision and reinforces instruction about limiting activities that put strain on the incision and sutures. Family responsibilities and factors relating to the home environment that produce emotional tension have often been implicated as precipitating causes of thyrotoxicosis. A home visit provides an opportunity to evaluate these factors and to suggest ways to improve the home and family environment. The nurse gives specific instructions regarding follow-up visits to the
physician or the clinic, which are important for monitoring the thyroid status.

\section*{Management of Patients With Parathyroid Disorders}

The parathyroid glands (normally four) are situated in the neck and embedded in the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland (Fig. 42-5). These small glands are easily overlooked and can be removed inadvertently during thyroid surgery. Inadvertent surgical removal is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism.

\section*{PARATHYROID FUNCTION}

Parathormone, the protein hormone from the parathyroid glands, regulates calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Increased secretion of parathormone results in increased calcium absorption from the kidney, intestine, and bones, thereby raising the blood calcium level. Some actions of this hormone are increased by the presence of vitamin D. Parathormone also tends to lower the blood phosphorus level.

Excess parathormone can result in markedly elevated levels of serum calcium, a potentially life-threatening situation. When the product of serum calcium and serum phosphorus (calcium $\times$ phosphorus) rises, calcium phosphate may precipitate in various organs of the body and cause tissue calcification.

The serum level of ionized calcium regulates the output of parathormone. Increased serum calcium results in decreased parathormone secretion, creating a negative feedback system.

\section*{HYPERPARATHYROIDISM}

Hyperparathyroidism, which is caused by overproduction of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands, is characterized by bone decalcification and the development of renal calculi (kidney stones) containing calcium.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-242.jpg?height=846&width=866&top_left_y=1671&top_left_x=200}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 42-5 The parathyroid glands are located behind the thyroid gland. The parathyroids may be embedded in the thyroid tissue.}
\end{figure}

Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs two to four times more often in women than in men and is most common in patients between 60 and 70 years of age. About 100,000 new cases of hyperparathyroidism are detected each year in the United States. The disease is rare in children younger than 15 years, but the incidence increases tenfold between the ages of 15 and 65 years. Half of the patients diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism do not have symptoms.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism, with manifestations similar to those of primary hyperparathyroidism, occurs in patients with chronic renal failure and so-called renal rickets as a result of phosphorus retention, increased stimulation of the parathyroid glands, and increased parathyroid hormone secretion.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient may have no symptoms or may experience signs and symptoms resulting from involvement of several body systems. Apathy, fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hypertension, and cardiac dysrhythmias may occur; all are attributable to the increased concentration of calcium in the blood. Psychological manifestations may vary from irritability and neurosis to psychoses caused by the direct effect of calcium on the brain and nervous system. An increase in calcium produces a decrease in the excitation potential of nerve and muscle tissue.

The formation of stones in one or both kidneys, related to the increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus, is one of the important complications of hyperparathyroidism and occurs in $55 \%$ of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Renal damage results from the precipitation of calcium phosphate in the renal pelvis and parenchyma, resulting in renal calculi (kidney stones), obstruction, pyelonephritis, and renal failure.

Musculoskeletal symptoms accompanying hyperparathyroidism may result from demineralization of the bones or bone tumors composed of benign giant cells resulting from overgrowth of osteoclasts. The patient may develop skeletal pain and tenderness, especially of the back and joints; pain on weight bearing; pathologic fractures; deformities; and shortening of body stature. Bone loss attributable to hyperparathyroidism increases the risk for fracture.

The incidence of peptic ulcer and pancreatitis is increased with hyperparathyroidism and may be responsible for many of the gastrointestinal symptoms that occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed by persistent elevation of serum calcium levels and an elevated level of parathormone. Radioimmunoassays for parathormone are sensitive and differentiate primary hyperparathyroidism from other causes of hypercalcemia in more than $90 \%$ of patients with elevated serum calcium levels. An elevated serum calcium level alone is a nonspecific finding because serum levels may be altered by diet, medications, and renal and bone changes. Bone changes may be detected on x-ray or bone scans in advanced disease. The double antibody parathyroid hormone test is used to distinguish between primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy as a cause of hypercalcemia. Ultrasound, MRI, thallium scan, and fine-needle biopsy have been used to evaluate the function of the parathyroids and to localize parathyroid cysts, adenomas, or hyperplasia.

\section*{Complications: Hypercalcemic Crisis}

Acute hypercalcemic crisis can occur with extreme elevation of serum calcium levels. Serum calcium levels higher than $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $3.7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) result in neurologic, cardiovascular, and renal symptoms that can be life-threatening. Treatment includes rehydration with large volumes of intravenous fluids, diuretic agents to promote renal excretion of excess calcium, and phosphate therapy to correct hypophosphatemia and decrease serum calcium levels by promoting calcium deposit in bone and reducing the gastrointestinal absorption of calcium. Cytotoxic agents (mithramycin), calcitonin, and dialysis may be used in emergency situations to decrease serum calcium levels quickly.

NURSING ALERT The patient in acute hypercalcemic crisis requires close monitoring for life-threatening complications and prompt treatment to reduce serum calcium levels.

A combination of calcitonin and corticosteroids has been administered in emergencies to reduce the serum calcium level by increasing calcium deposition in bone. Other agents that may be administered to decrease serum calcium levels include bisphosphonates (eg, etidronate [Didronel], pamidronate).

The patient requires expert assessment and care to minimize complications and reverse the life-threatening hypercalcemia. Medications are administered with care, and attention is given to fluid balance to promote return of normal fluid and electrolyte balance. Supportive measures are necessary for the patient and family.

\section*{Medical Management}

The insidious onset and chronic nature of hyperparathyroidism and its diverse and commonly vague symptoms may result in depression and frustration. The family may have considered the patient's illness to be psychosomatic. An awareness of the course of the disorder and an understanding approach by the nurse may help the patient and family to deal with their reactions and feelings. The recommended treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism is the surgical removal of abnormal parathyroid tissue. In some patients without symptoms and with only mildly elevated serum calcium levels and normal renal function, surgery may be delayed and the patient followed closely for worsening of hypercalcemia, bone deterioration, renal impairment, or the development of kidney stones.

\section*{HYDRATION THERAPY}

Because kidney involvement is possible, patients with hyperparathyroidism are at risk for renal calculi. Therefore, a fluid intake of $2,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ or more is encouraged to help prevent calculus formation. Cranberry juice is suggested because it may lower the urinary pH . It can be added to juices and ginger ale for variety. The patient is instructed to report other manifestations of renal calculi, such as abdominal pain and hematuria. Thiazide diuretics are avoided because they decrease the renal excretion of calcium and further elevate serum calcium levels. Because of the risk of hypercalcemic crisis, the patient is instructed to avoid dehydration and to seek immediate health care if conditions that commonly produce dehydration (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) occur.

\section*{MOBILITY}

Mobility of the patient, with walking or use of a rocking chair for those with limited mobility, is encouraged as much as possible be-
cause bones subjected to normal stress give up less calcium. Bed rest increases calcium excretion and the risk for renal calculi. Oral phosphates lower the serum calcium level in some patients. Longterm use is not recommended because of the risk for ectopic calcium phosphate deposits in soft tissues.

\section*{DIET AND MEDICATIONS}

Nutritional needs are met, but the patient is advised to avoid a diet with restricted or excess calcium. If the patient has a coexisting peptic ulcer, prescribed antacids and protein feedings are necessary. Because anorexia is common, efforts are made to improve the appetite. Prune juice, stool softeners, and physical activity, along with increased fluid intake, help to offset constipation, which is common postoperatively.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nursing management of the patient undergoing parathyroidectomy is essentially the same as that of a patient undergoing thyroidectomy. However, the previously described precautions about dehydration, immobility, and diet are particularly important in the patient awaiting and recovering from parathyroidectomy. Although not all parathyroid tissue is removed during surgery in an effort to control the calcium-phosphorus balance, the nurse closely monitors the patient to detect symptoms of tetany (which may be an early postoperative complication). Most patients quickly regain function of the remaining parathyroid tissue and experience only mild, transient postoperative hypocalcemia. In patients with significant bone disease or bone changes, a more prolonged period of hypocalcemia should be anticipated. The nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of follow-up to ensure return of serum calcium levels to normal (Chart 42-7).

\section*{HYPOPARATHYROIDISM}

The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone after interruption of the blood supply or surgical removal of parathyroid gland tissue during thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, or radical neck dissection. Atrophy of the parathyroid glands of unknown cause is a less common cause of hypoparathyroidism.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are caused by a deficiency of parathormone that results in elevated blood phosphate (hyperphosphatemia) and decreased blood calcium (hypocalcemia) levels. In the absence of parathormone, there is decreased intestinal absorption of dietary calcium and decreased resorption of calcium from bone and through the renal tubules. Decreased renal excretion of phosphate causes hypophosphaturia, and low serum calcium levels result in hypocalciuria.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Hypocalcemia causes irritability of the neuromuscular system and contributes to the chief symptom of hypoparathyroidism-tetany. Tetany is a general muscle hypertonia, with tremor and spasmodic or uncoordinated contractions occurring with or without efforts to make voluntary movements. Symptoms of latent tetany are numbness, tingling, and cramps in the extremities, and the patient complains of stiffness in the hands and feet. In overt tetany, the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-244.jpg?height=690&width=1783&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=202)
signs include bronchospasm, laryngeal spasm, carpopedal spasm (flexion of the elbows and wrists and extension of the carpophalangeal joints), dysphagia, photophobia, cardiac dysrhythmias, and seizures. Other symptoms include anxiety, irritability, depression, and even delirium. ECG changes and hypotension also may occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A positive Trousseau's sign or a positive Chvostek's sign suggests latent tetany. Trousseau's sign is positive when carpopedal spasm is induced by occluding the blood flow to the arm for 3 minutes with a blood pressure cuff. Chvostek's sign is positive when a sharp tapping over the facial nerve just in front of the parotid gland and anterior to the ear causes spasm or twitching of the mouth, nose, and eye (see Chap. 14).

The diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism often is difficult because of the vague symptoms, such as aches and pains. Therefore, laboratory studies are especially helpful. Tetany develops at serum calcium levels of 5 to $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 1.2 to $1.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or lower. Serum phosphate levels are increased, and x-rays of bone show increased density. Calcification is detected on x-rays of the subcutaneous or paraspinal basal ganglia of the brain.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of therapy is to raise the serum calcium level to 9 to $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(2.2$ to $2.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ and to eliminate the symptoms of hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. When hypocalcemia and tetany occur after a thyroidectomy, the immediate treatment is to administer calcium gluconate intravenously. If this does not decrease neuromuscular irritability and seizure activity immediately, sedative agents such as pentobarbital may be administered.

Parenteral parathormone can be administered to treat acute hypoparathyroidism with tetany. The high incidence of allergic reactions to injections of parathormone, however, limits its use to acute episodes of hypocalcemia. The patient receiving parathormone is monitored closely for allergic reactions and changes in serum calcium levels.

Because of neuromuscular irritability, the patient with hypocalcemia and tetany requires an environment that is free of
noise, drafts, bright lights, or sudden movement. Tracheostomy or mechanical ventilation may become necessary, along with bronchodilating medications, if the patient develops respiratory distress.

Therapy for the patient with chronic hypoparathyroidism is determined after serum calcium levels are obtained. A diet high in calcium and low in phosphorus is prescribed. Although milk, milk products, and egg yolk are high in calcium, they are restricted because they also contain high levels of phosphorus. Spinach also is avoided because it contains oxalate, which would form insoluble calcium substances. Oral tablets of calcium salts, such as calcium gluconate, may be used to supplement the diet. Aluminum hydroxide gel or aluminum carbonate (Gelusil, Amphojel) also is administered after meals to bind phosphate and promote its excretion through the gastrointestinal tract.

Variable dosages of a vitamin D preparation - dihydrotachysterol (AT 10 or Hytakerol), ergocalciferol (vitamin D), cholecalciferol (vitamin D)-are usually required and enhance calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management of the patient with possible acute hypoparathyroidism includes the following:
- Care of postoperative patients having thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, and radical neck dissection is directed toward detecting early signs of hypocalcemia and anticipating signs of tetany, seizures, and respiratory difficulties.
- Calcium gluconate is kept at the bedside, with equipment necessary for intravenous administration. If the patient has a cardiac disorder, is subject to dysrhythmias, or is receiving digitalis, calcium gluconate is administered slowly and cautiously.
- Calcium and digitalis increase systolic contraction and also potentiate each other; this may produce potentially fatal dysrhythmias. Consequently, the cardiac patient requires continuous cardiac monitoring and careful assessment.

An important aspect of nursing care is teaching about medications and diet therapy. The patient needs to know the reason for high calcium and low phosphate intake and the symptoms of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia; he or she should know to

contact the physician immediately if these symptoms occur (Chart 42-8).

\section*{Management of Patients With Adrenal Disorders}

There are two adrenal glands in the human, each attached to the upper portion of a kidney. Each adrenal gland is, in reality, two endocrine glands with separate, independent functions. The adrenal medulla at the center of the gland secretes catecholamines, and the outer portion of the gland, the adrenal cortex, secretes steroid hormones (Fig. 42-6). The secretion of hormones from the adrenal cortex is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH), which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete ACTH. ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoid hormone (cortisol). Increased levels of the adrenal hormone then inhibit the production or secretion
of CRH and ACTH. This system is an example of a negative feedback mechanism.

\section*{ADRENAL FUNCTION}

\section*{Adrenal Medulla}

The adrenal medulla functions as part of the autonomic nervous system. Stimulation of preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers, which travel directly to the cells of the adrenal medulla, causes release of the catecholamine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. About $90 \%$ of the secretion of the human adrenal medulla is epinephrine (also called adrenaline). Catecholamines regulate metabolic pathways to promote catabolism of stored fuels to meet caloric needs from endogenous sources. The major effects of epinephrine release are to prepare to meet a challenge (fight-or-flight response). Secretion of epinephrine causes decreased blood flow to tissues that are not needed in emergency situations, such as the gastrointestinal tract, and causes increased

\begin{figure}

FIGURE 42-6 (A) The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney. (B) Each gland is composed of the outer cortex and the inner medulla. Each area secretes specific hormones. The adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine; the adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and sex hormones. From Porth, C. (2002).

blood flow to tissues that are important for effective fight or flight, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle. Catecholamines also induce the release of free fatty acids, increase the basal metabolic rate, and elevate the blood glucose level.

\section*{Adrenal Cortex}

A functioning adrenal cortex is necessary for life; adrenocortical secretions make it possible for the body to adapt to stress of all kinds. The three types of steroid hormones produced by the adrenal cortex are glucocorticoids, the prototype of which is hydrocortisone; mineralocorticoids, mainly aldosterone; and sex hormones, mainly androgens (male sex hormones). Without the adrenal cortex, severe stress would cause peripheral circulatory failure, circulatory shock, and prostration. Survival in the absence of a functioning adrenal cortex is possible only with nutritional, electrolyte, and fluid replacement and appropriate replacement with exogenous adrenocortical hormones.

\section*{GLUCOCORTICOIDS}

The glucocorticoids are so named because they have an important influence on glucose metabolism: increased hydrocortisone secretion results in elevated blood glucose levels. However, the glucocorticoids have major effects on the metabolism of almost all organs of the body. Glucocorticoids are secreted from the adrenal cortex in response to the release of ACTH from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. This system represents an example of negative feedback. The presence of glucocorticoids in the blood inhibits the release of corticotropin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus and also inhibits ACTH secretion from the pituitary. The resultant decrease in ACTH secretion causes diminished release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.

Glucocorticoids (in the form of corticosteroids) are administered frequently to inhibit the inflammatory response to tissue injury and suppress allergic manifestations. Their side effects include the development of diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, increased protein breakdown resulting in muscle wasting and poor wound healing, and redistribution of body fat.

Large amounts of exogenously administered glucocorticoids in the blood inhibit the release of ACTH and endogenous glucocorticoids. Because of this, the adrenal cortex can atrophy. If exogenous glucocorticoid administration is discontinued suddenly, adrenal insufficiency results because of the inability of the atrophied cortex to respond adequately.

\section*{MINERALOCORTICOIDS}

Mineralocorticoids exert their major effects on electrolyte metabolism. They act principally on the renal tubular and gastrointestinal epithelium to cause increased sodium ion absorption in exchange for excretion of potassium or hydrogen ions. ACTH only minimally influences aldosterone secretion. It is primarily secreted in response to the presence of angiotensin II in the bloodstream. Angiotensin II is a substance that elevates the blood pressure by constricting arterioles. Its concentration is increased when renin is released from the kidney in response to decreased perfusion pressure. The resultant increased aldosterone levels promote sodium reabsorption by the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract, which tends to restore blood pressure to normal. The release of aldosterone is also increased by hyperkalemia. Aldosterone is the primary hormone for the long-term regulation of sodium balance.

\section*{ADRENAL SEX HORMONES (ANDROGENS)}

Androgens, the third major type of steroid hormones produced by the adrenal cortex, exert effects similar to those of male sex hormones. The adrenal gland may also secrete small amounts of some estrogens, or female sex hormones. ACTH controls the secretion of adrenal androgens. When secreted in normal amounts, the adrenal androgens probably have little effect, but when secreted in excess, in certain inborn enzyme deficiencies, masculinization may result. This is termed the adrenogenital syndrome.

\section*{PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA}

Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that is usually benign and originates from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. In $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of patients (O'Connell, 1999), the tumor arises in the medulla; in the remaining patients, it occurs in the extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue located in or near the aorta, ovaries, spleen, or other organs. Pheochromocytoma may occur at any age, but its peak incidence is between ages 40 and 50 years (Rakel \& Bope, 2001). It affects men and women equally. Because of the high incidence of pheochromocytoma in family members, the patient's family members should be alerted and screened for this tumor. Ten percent of the tumors are bilateral, and $10 \%$ are malignant.

Pheochromocytoma is the cause of high blood pressure in $0.2 \%$ of patients with new onset of hypertension (O'Connell, 1999). Although it is uncommon, it is one form of hypertension that is usually cured by surgery; without detection and treatment, it is usually fatal. Pheochromocytoma may occur in the familial form as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2; therefore, it should be considered a possibility in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma and parathyroid hyperplasia or tumor.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The nature and severity of symptoms of functioning tumors of the adrenal medulla depend on the relative proportions of epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion. The typical triad of symptoms comprises headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations (Matthews et al., 1999). Hypertension and other cardiovascular disturbances are common. The hypertension may be intermittent or persistent. Only half of patients with pheochromocytoma, however, have sustained or persistent hypertension. If the hypertension is sustained, it may be difficult to distinguish from other causes of hypertension. Other symptoms may include tremor, headache, flushing, and anxiety. Hyperglycemia may result from conversion of liver and muscle glycogen to glucose by epinephrine secretion; insulin may be required to maintain normal blood glucose levels.

The clinical picture in the paroxysmal form of pheochromocytoma is usually characterized by acute, unpredictable attacks lasting seconds or several hours. During these attacks, the patient is extremely anxious, tremulous, and weak. The patient may experience headache, vertigo, blurring of vision, tinnitus, air hunger, and dyspnea. Other symptoms include polyuria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a feeling of impending doom. Palpitations and tachycardia are common. Blood pressures exceeding $250 / 150 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ have been recorded. Such blood pressure elevations are life-threatening and may cause severe complications, such as cardiac dysrhythmias, dissecting aneurysm, stroke, and acute renal failure. Postural hypotension occurs in $70 \%$ of patients with untreated pheochromocytoma.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Pheochromocytoma is suspected if signs of sympathetic nervous system overactivity occur in association with marked elevation of blood pressure. These signs can be associated with the "five Hs ": hypertension, headache, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hypermetabolism, and hyperglycemia. The presence of these signs has a $93.8 \%$ specificity and a $90.9 \%$ sensitivity for pheochromocytoma. Absence of hypertension excludes pheochromocytoma with a $99 \%$ certainty. Paroxysmal symptoms of pheochromocytoma commonly develop in the fifth decade of life.

Measurements of urine and plasma levels of catecholamines are the most direct and conclusive tests for overactivity of the adrenal medulla. Measurements of urinary catecholamine metabolites (metanephrines [MN] and vanillylmandelic acid [VMA]) or free catecholamines are the standard diagnostic tests used in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Levels can be as high as three times normal limits (O'Connell, 1999). A 24-hour specimen of urine is collected for determining free catecholamines, MN, and VMA; the use of combined tests increases the diagnostic accuracy of testing. A number of medications and foods (eg, coffee, tea, bananas, chocolate, vanilla, aspirin) may alter the results of these tests; therefore, careful instructions to avoid restricted items must be given to the patient. Urine collected over a 2 - or 3 -hour period after an attack of hypertension can be assayed for catecholamine content.

Total plasma catecholamine (epinephrine and norepinephrine) concentration is measured with the patient supine and at rest for 30 minutes. To prevent elevation of catecholamine levels by the stress of venipuncture, a butterfly needle, scalp vein needle, or venous catheter may be inserted 30 minutes before the blood specimen is obtained.

Factors that may elevate catecholamine levels must be controlled to obtain valid results; these factors include consumption of coffee or tea, use of tobacco, emotional and physical stress, and use of many prescription and over-the-counter medications (eg, amphetamines, nose drops or sprays, decongestant agents, and bronchodilators).

Normal plasma values of epinephrine are $100 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ( $590 \mathrm{pmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ); normal values of norepinephrine are generally less than 100 to $550 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ( 590 to $3,240 \mathrm{pmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Values of epinephrine greater than $400 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}(2,180 \mathrm{pmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or norepinephrine values greater than $2,000 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}(11,800 \mathrm{pmol} / \mathrm{L})$ are considered diagnostic of pheochromocytoma. Values that fall between normal values and those diagnostic of pheochromocytoma indicate the need for further testing.

A clonidine suppression test may be performed if the results of plasma and urine tests of catecholamines are inconclusive. Clonidine (Catapres) is a centrally acting, antiadrenergic medication that suppresses the release of neurogenically mediated catecholamines. The suppression test is based on the principle that catecholamine levels are normally increased through the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. In pheochromocytoma, increased catecholamine levels result from the diffusion of excess catecholamines into the circulation, bypassing normal storage and release mechanisms. Therefore, in patients with pheochromocytoma, clonidine does not suppress the release of catecholamines.

The results of the test are considered normal if 2 to 3 hours after a single oral dose of clonidine, the total plasma catecholamine value decreases at least $40 \%$ from baseline. Patients with pheochromocytoma exhibit no change in catecholamine levels. False-positive results, however, may occur in patients with primary hypertension.

Imaging studies, such as CT scans, MRI, and ultrasound, may also be carried out to localize the pheochromocytoma and to determine whether more than one tumor is present. Use of ${ }^{131}$ I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy may be required to determine the location of the pheochromocytoma and to detect metastatic sites outside the adrenal gland. MIBG is a specific isotope for catecholamine-producing tissue. It has been helpful in identifying tumors not detected by other tests or procedures. MIBG scintigraphy is a noninvasive, safe procedure that has increased the accuracy of diagnosis of adrenal tumors.

Other diagnostic studies may focus on evaluating the function of other endocrine glands because of the association of pheochromocytoma in some patients with other endocrine tumors.

\section*{Medical Management}

During an episode or attack of hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, and the other symptoms of pheochromocytoma, the patient is placed on bed rest with the head of the bed elevated to promote an orthostatic decrease in blood pressure.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

The patient may be moved to the intensive care unit for close monitoring of ECG changes and careful administration of alphaadrenergic blocking agents (eg, phentolamine [Regitine]) or smooth muscle relaxants (eg, sodium nitroprusside [Nipride]) to lower the blood pressure quickly.

Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline), a long-acting alpha-blocker, may be used when the blood pressure is stable to prepare the patient for surgery. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol (Inderal), may be used in patients with cardiac dysrhythmias or those not responsive to alpha-blockers. Alphaadrenergic and beta-adrenergic blocking agents must be used with caution because patients with pheochromocytoma may have increased sensitivity to them. Still other medications that may be used preoperatively are catecholamine synthesis inhibitors, such as alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (metyrosine). These are occasionally used when adrenergic blocking agents do not reduce the effects of catecholamines.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The definitive treatment of pheochromocytoma is surgical removal of the tumor, usually with adrenalectomy. Bilateral adrenalectomy may be necessary if tumors are present in both adrenal glands. Patient preparation includes control of blood pressure and blood volumes; usually this is carried out over 7 to 10 days. Phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) may be used safely without causing undue hypotension. Other medications (metyrosine [Demser] and prazosin [Minipress]) have been used to treat pheochromocytoma. The patient needs to be well hydrated before, during, and after surgery to prevent hypotension.

Manipulation of the tumor during surgical excision may cause release of stored epinephrine and norepinephrine, with marked increases in blood pressure and changes in heart rate. Therefore, use of sodium nitroprusside (Nipride) and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents may be required during and after surgery. Exploration of other possible tumor sites is frequently undertaken to ensure removal of all tumor tissue. As a result, the patient is subject to the stress and effects of a long surgical procedure, which may increase the risk of hypertension postoperatively.

Corticosteroid replacement is required if bilateral adrenalectomy has been necessary. Corticosteroids may also be necessary
for the first few days or weeks after removal of a single adrenal gland. Intravenous administration of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone sodium succinate [Solu-Medrol]) may begin the evening before surgery and continue during the early postoperative period to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Oral preparations of corticosteroids (prednisone) will be prescribed after the acute stress of surgery diminishes.

Hypotension and hypoglycemia may occur in the postoperative period because of the sudden withdrawal of excessive amounts of catecholamines. Therefore, careful attention is directed toward monitoring and treating these changes. Blood pressure is expected to return to normal with treatment; however, one third of patients continue to be hypertensive after surgery. This may result if not all pheochromocytoma tissue was removed, if pheochromocytoma recurs, or if the blood vessels were damaged by severe and prolonged hypertension. Several days after surgery, urine and plasma levels of catecholamines and their metabolites are measured to determine whether surgery was successful.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient who has undergone surgery to treat pheochromocytoma has experienced a stressful preoperative and postoperative course and may remain fearful of repeated attacks. Although it is usually expected that all pheochromocytoma tissue has been removed, there is a possibility that other sites were undetected and that attacks may recur. The patient is monitored for several days in the intensive care unit with special attention given to ECG changes, arterial pressures, fluid and electrolyte balance, and blood glucose levels. Several intravenous lines are inserted for administration of fluids and medications.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. During the preoperative and postoperative phases of care, the nurse informs the patient about the importance of follow-up monitoring to ensure that pheochromocytoma does not recur undetected. After adrenalectomy, use of corticosteroids may be needed. Therefore, the nurse instructs the patient about their purpose, the medication schedule, and the risks of skipping doses or stopping their administration abruptly.

It is important to teach the patient and family how to measure the patient's blood pressure and when to notify the physician about changes in blood pressure. Additionally, the nurse provides verbal and written instructions about the procedure for collecting 24 -hour urine specimens to monitor urine catecholamine levels.

Continuing Care. A follow-up visit from a home care nurse may be indicated to assess the patient's postoperative recovery, surgical incision, and compliance with the medication schedule. This may help to reinforce previous teaching about management and monitoring. The home care nurse also obtains blood pressure measurements and assists the patient in preventing or dealing with problems that may result from long-term use of corticosteroids.

Because of the risk of recurrence of hypertension, periodic checkups are required, especially in young patients and in patients whose families have a history of pheochromocytoma. The patient is scheduled for periodic follow-up appointments to observe for return of normal blood pressure and plasma and urine levels of catecholamines.

\section*{ADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY (ADDISON'S DISEASE)}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Addison's disease, or adrenocortical insufficiency, results when adrenal cortex function is inadequate to meet the patient's need for cortical hormones. Autoimmune or idiopathic atrophy of the adrenal glands is responsible for $80 \%$ of cases (Rakel \& Bope, 2001). Other causes include surgical removal of both adrenal glands or infection of the adrenal glands. Tuberculosis and histoplasmosis are the most common infections that destroy adrenal gland tissue. Although autoimmune destruction has replaced tuberculosis as the principal cause of Addison's disease, tuberculosis should be considered in the diagnostic workup because of its increasing incidence. Inadequate secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland also results in adrenal insufficiency because of decreased stimulation of the adrenal cortex.

Therapeutic use of corticosteroids is the most common cause of adrenocortical insufficiency (Coursin \& Wood, 2002). The symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency may also result from the sudden cessation of exogenous adrenocortical hormonal therapy, which suppresses the body's normal response to stress and interferes with normal feedback mechanisms. Treatment with daily administration of corticosteroids for 2 to 4 weeks may suppress function of the adrenal cortex; therefore, adrenal insufficiency should be considered in any patient who has been treated with corticosteroids.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Addison's disease is characterized by muscle weakness, anorexia, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, emaciation, dark pigmentation of the skin, knuckles, knees, elbows, and mucous membranes, hypotension, and low blood glucose levels, low serum sodium levels, and high serum potassium levels. Mental status changes such as depression, emotional lability, apathy, and confusion are present in $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ of patients. In severe cases, the disturbance of sodium and potassium metabolism may be marked by depletion of sodium and water and severe, chronic dehydration.

With disease progression and acute hypotension, the patient develops addisonian crisis, which is characterized by cyanosis and the classic signs of circulatory shock: pallor, apprehension, rapid and weak pulse, rapid respirations, and low blood pressure. In addition, the patient may complain of headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea and show signs of confusion and restlessness. Even slight overexertion, exposure to cold, acute infections, or a decrease in salt intake may lead to circulatory collapse, shock, and death if untreated. The stress of surgery or dehydration resulting from preparation for diagnostic tests or surgery may precipitate an addisonian or hypotensive crisis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Although the clinical manifestations presented appear specific, the onset of Addison's disease usually occurs with nonspecific symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory test results. Laboratory findings include decreased blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) levels, an increased serum potassium (hyperkalemia) level, and an increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis).

The diagnosis is confirmed by low levels of adrenocortical hormones in the blood or urine and decreased serum cortisol levels. If the adrenal cortex is destroyed, baseline values are low, and ACTH administration fails to cause the normal rise in plasma cortisol and urinary 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids. If the adrenal gland is normal but not stimulated properly by the pituitary, a normal response to repeated doses of exogenous ACTH is seen, but no response follows the administration of metyrapone, which stimulates endogenous ACTH.

\section*{Medical Management}

Immediate treatment is directed toward combating circulatory shock: restoring blood circulation, administering fluids and corticosteroids, monitoring vital signs, and placing the patient in a recumbent position with the legs elevated. Hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef) is administered intravenously, followed with 5\% dextrose in normal saline. Vasopressor amines may be required if hypotension persists.

Antibiotics may be administered if infection has precipitated adrenal crisis in a patient with chronic adrenal insufficiency. Additionally, the patient is assessed closely to identify other factors, stressors, or illnesses that led to the acute episode.

Oral intake may be initiated as soon as tolerated. Gradually, intravenous fluids are decreased when oral fluid intake is adequate to prevent hypovolemia. If the adrenal gland does not regain function, the patient needs lifelong replacement of corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids to prevent recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The patient will require additional supplementary therapy with glucocorticoids during stressful procedures or significant illnesses to prevent addisonian crisis (Coursin \& Wood, 2002). Additionally, the patient may need to supplement dietary intake with added salt during times of gastrointestinal losses of fluids through vomiting and diarrhea.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{ASSESSING THE PATIENT}

The health history and examination focus on the presence of symptoms of fluid imbalance and on the patient's level of stress. To detect inadequate fluid volume, the nurse monitors the blood pressure and pulse rate as the patient moves from a lying to a standing position. The nurse assesses the skin color and turgor for changes related to chronic adrenal insufficiency and hypovolemia. Other key assessments include checking for weight changes, muscle weakness, and fatigue and investigating any illness or stress that may have precipitated the acute crisis.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING ADDISONIAN CRISIS}

The patient at risk is monitored for signs and symptoms indicative of addisonian crisis. These symptoms are often the manifestations of shock: hypotension; rapid, weak pulse; rapid respiratory rate; pallor; and extreme weakness. The patient with addisonian crisis is at risk for circulatory collapse and shock (see Chap. 15 for management of the patient in shock); therefore, physical and psychological stressors must be avoided. These include exposure to cold, overexertion, infection, and emotional distress.

The patient with addisonian crisis requires immediate treatment with intravenous administration of fluid, glucose, and electrolytes, especially sodium; replacement of missing steroid hormones; and vasopressors. During acute addisonian crisis, the patient must avoid exertion; therefore, the nurse anticipates the patient's needs and takes measures to meet them.

Careful monitoring of symptoms, vital signs, weight, and fluid and electrolyte status is essential to monitor the patient's progress and return to a precrisis state. To reduce the risk of future episodes of addisonian crisis, efforts are made to identify and reduce the factors that may have led to the crisis.

\section*{RESTORING FLUID BALANCE}

To provide information about fluid balance and the adequacy of hormone replacement, the nurse assesses the patient's skin turgor, mucous membranes, and weight while instructing the patient to report increased thirst, which may indicate impending fluid imbalance. Lying, sitting, and standing blood pressures also provide information about fluid status. A decrease in systolic pressure ( 20 mm Hg or more) may indicate depletion of fluid volume, especially if accompanied by symptoms. The nurse encourages the patient to consume foods and fluids that will assist in restoring and maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance; along with the dietitian, the nurse assists the patient to select foods high in sodium during gastrointestinal disturbances and very hot weather.

The nurse instructs the patient and family to administer hormone replacement as prescribed and to modify the dosage during illness and other stressful occasions. Written and verbal instructions are provided about the administration of mineralocorticoid (Florinef) or corticosteroid (prednisone) as prescribed.

\section*{IMPROVING ACTIVITY TOLERANCE}

Until the patient's condition is stabilized, the nurse takes precautions to avoid unnecessary activity and stress that could precipitate another hypotensive episode. Efforts are made to detect signs of infection or the presence of other stressors. Even minor events or stressors may be excessive in patients with adrenal insufficiency. During the acute crisis, the nurse maintains a quiet, nonstressful environment and performs all activities (eg, bathing, turning) for the patient. Explaining all procedures to the patient and family will reduce their anxiety. Explaining the rationale for minimizing stress during the acute crisis assists the patient to increase activity gradually.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Because of the need for lifelong replacement of adrenal cortex hormones to prevent addisonian crises, the patient and family members receive explicit verbal and written instructions about the rationale for replacement therapy and proper dosage. Additionally, they are instructed about how to modify the medication dosage and increase salt intake in times of illness, very hot weather, and other stressful situations. The patient also learns how to modify diet and fluid intake to help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.

The patient and family are frequently prescribed preloaded, single-injection syringes of corticosteroid for use in emergencies. Careful instructions about how and when to use the injection are also provided. It is important to instruct the patient to inform other health care providers, such as dentists, about the use of corticosteroids, to wear a medical alert bracelet, and to carry information at all times about the need for corticosteroids. If the patient with Addison's disease requires surgery, careful administration of fluids and corticosteroids is necessary before, during, and after surgery to prevent addisonian crisis.

The patient and family need to know the signs of excessive or insufficient hormone replacement. The development of edema or weight gain may signify too high a dose of hormone; postural hypotension (decrease in systolic blood pressure, lightheadedness,
dizziness on standing) and weight loss frequently signify too low a dose (Chart 42-9).

Continuing Care. Although most patients can return to their job and family responsibilities soon after hospital discharge, others cannot do so because of concurrent illnesses or incomplete recovery from the episode of adrenal insufficiency. In these circumstances, a referral for home care enables the home care nurse to assess the patient's recovery, monitor hormone replacement, and evaluate stress in the home. The nurse assesses the patient's and family's knowledge about medication therapy and dietary modifications. A home visit also allows the nurse to assess the patient's plans for follow-up visits to the clinic or physician's office. The nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of participating in health promotion activities and health screening.

\section*{CUSHING'S SYNDROME}

Cushing's syndrome results from excessive, rather than deficient, adrenocortical activity. The syndrome may result from excessive administration of corticosteroids or ACTH or from hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Cushing's syndrome is commonly caused by use of corticosteroid medications and is infrequently due to excessive corticosteroid production by the adrenal cortex (Tierney et al., 2001). However, overproduction of endogenous corticosteroids may be caused by several mechanisms, including a tumor of the pituitary gland that produces ACTH and stimulates the adrenal cortex to increase its hormone secretion despite adequate amounts being produced. Primary hyperplasia of the adrenal glands in the absence of a pituitary tumor is less common. Another less common cause of Cushing's syndrome is the ectopic production of ACTH by malignancies; bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common type of these malignancies. Regardless of the cause, the normal feedback mechanisms that control the function of the adrenal cortex become ineffective, and the usual diurnal pattern of cortisol is lost.

The signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome are primarily a result of oversecretion of glucocorticoids and androgens (sex hormones), although mineralocorticoid secretion also may be affected.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

When overproduction of the adrenal cortical hormone occurs, arrest of growth, obesity, and musculoskeletal changes occur along with glucose intolerance. The classic picture of Cushing's syndrome in the adult is that of central-type obesity, with a fatty "buffalo hump" in the neck and supraclavicular areas, a heavy trunk, and relatively thin extremities. The skin is thin, fragile, and easily traumatized; ecchymoses (bruises) and striae develop. The patient complains of weakness and lassitude. Sleep is disturbed because of altered diurnal secretion of cortisol.

Excessive protein catabolism occurs, producing muscle wasting and osteoporosis. Kyphosis, backache, and compression fractures of the vertebrae may result. Retention of sodium and water occurs as a result of increased mineralocorticoid activity, producing hypertension and heart failure.

The patient develops a "moon-faced" appearance and may experience increased oiliness of the skin and acne. There is increased susceptibility to infection. Hyperglycemia or overt diabetes may develop. The patient may also report weight gain, slow healing of minor cuts, and bruises.

Women ages 20 to 40 years are five times more likely than men to develop Cushing's syndrome. In females of all ages, virilization may occur as a result of excess androgens. Virilization is characterized by the appearance of masculine traits and the recession of feminine traits. There is an excessive growth of hair on the face (hirsutism), the breasts atrophy, menses cease, the clitoris enlarges, and the voice deepens. Libido is lost in men and women.

Changes occur in mood and mental activity; psychosis may develop. Distress and depression are common and are increased by the severity of the physical changes that occur with this syndrome. If Cushing's syndrome is a consequence of pituitary tumor, visual disturbances may occur because of pressure of the growing tumor on the optic chiasm. Chart 42-10 summarizes the changes associated with Cushing's syndrome.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Indicators of Cushing's syndrome include an increase in serum sodium and blood glucose levels and a decreased serum concentration of potassium, a reduction in the number of blood eosinophils, and disappearance of lymphoid tissue. Measurements of plasma and urinary cortisol levels are obtained. Several blood samples may be collected to determine whether the normal diurnal variation in plasma levels is present; this variation is frequently absent in adrenal dysfunction. If several blood samples are required, they must be collected at the times specified and the time of collection must be noted on the requisition slip.

An overnight dexamethasone suppression test is the most widely used screening test for diagnosis of pituitary and adrenal causes of Cushing's syndrome. It can be performed on an outpatient basis. Dexamethasone ( 1 mg ) is administered orally at 11 pm , and a plasma cortisol level is obtained at 8 the next morning. Suppression of cortisol to less than $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ indicates that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is functioning properly. Stress, obesity, depression, and medications such as antiseizure agents, estrogen, and rifampin can falsely elevate cortisol levels. Other diagnostic studies include a 24 -hour urinary free cortisol level and a high-dose or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. High-dose and low-dose suppression tests are similar to the overnight test but vary in dosage and timing.

Measurement of plasma ACTH by radioimmunoassay is used in conjunction with the high-dose suppression test to distinguish pituitary tumors from ectopic sites of ACTH production as the cause of Cushing's syndrome. Elevation of both ACTH and cortisol level indicates pituitary or hypothalamic disease. Low ACTH with a high cortisol level indicates adrenal disease. A CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI may be performed to localize adrenal tissue and detect tumors of the adrenal gland.

\section*{Medical Management}

If Cushing's syndrome is caused by pituitary tumors rather than tumors of the adrenal cortex, treatment is directed at the pituitary gland. Surgical removal of the tumor by transsphenoidal hypophysectomy (see Chap. 61) is the treatment of choice and has a $90 \%$ success rate (Rakel \& Bope, 2001). Radiation of the pituitary gland also has been successful, although it may take several months for control of symptoms. Adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice in patients with primary adrenal hypertrophy.

Postoperatively, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may begin to appear 12 to 48 hours after surgery because of reduction of the high levels of circulating adrenal hormones. Temporary replacement therapy with hydrocortisone may be necessary for several months until the adrenal glands begin to respond normally to the body's needs. If both adrenal glands have been removed (bilateral adrenalectomy), lifetime replacement of adrenal cortex hormones is necessary.

Adrenal enzyme inhibitors (eg, metyrapone, aminoglutethimide, mitotane, ketoconazole) may be used to reduce hyperadrenalism if the syndrome is caused by ectopic ACTH secretion by a tumor that cannot be eradicated. Close monitoring is necessary because symptoms of inadequate adrenal function may result and because of possible side effects of these medications.

If Cushing's syndrome is a result of the administration of corticosteroids, an attempt is made to reduce or taper the medication to the minimum dosage needed to treat the underlying disease process (eg, autoimmune and allergic diseases and rejection of transplanted organs). Frequently, alternate-day therapy decreases the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome and allows recovery of the adrenal glands' responsiveness to ACTH.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH CUSHING'S SYNDROME}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history and examination focus on the effects on the body of high concentrations of adrenal cortex hormones and on the inability of the adrenal cortex to respond to changes in
cortisol and aldosterone levels. The history includes information about the patient's level of activity and ability to carry out routine and self-care activities. The skin is observed and assessed for trauma, infection, breakdown, bruising, and edema. Changes in physical appearance are noted, and the patient's responses to these changes are elicited. The nurse assesses the patient's mental function, including mood, responses to questions, awareness of environment, and level of depression. The family is often a good source of information about gradual changes in the patient's physical appearance as well as emotional status.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, the major nursing diagnoses of the patient with Cushing's syndrome include the following:
- Risk for injury related to weakness
- Risk for infection related to altered protein metabolism and inflammatory response
- Self-care deficit related to weakness, fatigue, muscle wasting, and altered sleep patterns
- Impaired skin integrity related to edema, impaired healing, and thin and fragile skin
- Disturbed body image related to altered physical appearance, impaired sexual functioning, and decreased activity level
- Disturbed thought processes related to mood swings, irritability, and depression

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Addisonian crisis
- Adverse effects of adrenocortical activity

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include decreased risk for injury, decreased risk for infection, increased ability to carry out self-care activities, improved skin integrity, improved body image, improved mental function, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{DECREASING RISK FOR INJURY}

Establishing a protective environment will help to prevent falls, fractures, and other injuries to bones and soft tissues. The patient who is very weak may require assistance from the nurse in ambulating to prevent falls or bumping into sharp corners of furniture. Foods high in protein, calcium, and vitamin D are recommended to minimize muscle wasting and osteoporosis. Referral to a dietitian may assist the patient in selecting appropriate foods that are also low in sodium and calories.

\section*{DECREASING RISK FOR INFECTION}

The patient should avoid unnecessary exposure to others with infections. The nurse frequently assesses the patient for subtle signs of infection because the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids may mask the common signs of inflammation and infection.

\section*{PREPARING THE PATIENT FOR SURGERY}

The patient is prepared for adrenalectomy, if indicated, and the postoperative course (see later discussion in this chapter). If Cushing's syndrome is a result of a pituitary tumor, a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy may be performed (see Chap. 61). Diabetes mellitus and peptic ulcer are common in the patient with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, insulin therapy and medication to treat peptic ulcer may be initiated if needed. Before, during, and after surgery, blood glucose monitoring and assessment of stools for blood are carried out to monitor for appropriate intervention. If the patient has other symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, these are considered in the preoperative preparation. For example, if the patient has experienced weight gain, special instruction is given about postoperative breathing exercises.

\section*{ENCOURAGING REST AND ACTIVITY}

Weakness, fatigue, and muscle wasting make it difficult for the patient with Cushing's syndrome to carry out normal activities. Yet the nurse should encourage moderate activity to prevent complications of immobility and promote increased self-esteem. Insomnia often contributes to the patient's fatigue. It is important to help the patient plan and space rest periods throughout the day. Efforts are made to promote a relaxing, quiet environment for rest and sleep.

\section*{PROMOTING SKIN INTEGRITY}

Meticulous skin care is necessary to avoid traumatizing the patient's fragile skin. Use of adhesive tape is avoided because it can irritate the skin and tear the fragile tissue when the tape is removed. The nurse frequently assesses the skin and bony prominences and encourages and assists the patient to change positions frequently to prevent skin breakdown.

\section*{IMPROVING BODY IMAGE}

If the cause of Cushing's syndrome can be treated successfully, the major physical changes disappear in time. The patient may benefit from discussion of the effect the changes have had on his or her self-concept and relationships with others. Weight gain and edema may be modified by a low-carbohydrate, low-sodium diet, and a high-protein intake may reduce some of the other bothersome symptoms.

\section*{IMPROVING THOUGHT PROCESSES}

Explanations to the patient and family members about the cause of emotional instability are important in helping them cope with the mood swings, irritability, and depression that may occur. Psychotic behavior may occur in a few patients and should be reported. The nurse encourages the patient and family members to verbalize their feelings and concerns.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Addisonian Crisis}

The patient with Cushing's syndrome whose symptoms are treated by withdrawing corticosteroids, by adrenalectomy, or by removing a pituitary tumor is at risk for adrenal hypofunction and addisonian crisis. If high levels of circulating adrenal hormones have suppressed the function of the adrenal cortex, atrophy of the adrenal cortex is likely. If the circulating hormone level is decreased rapidly because of surgery or by abruptly stopping corticosteroid agents, manifestations of adrenal hypofunction and addisonian crisis may develop. Therefore, the patient
with Cushing's syndrome is monitored closely for hypotension; rapid, weak pulse; rapid respiratory rate; pallor; and extreme weakness. Efforts are made to identify factors that may have led to the crisis.

The patient with Cushing's syndrome who experiences highly stressful events, such as trauma or emergency surgery, is at increased risk for addisonian crisis because of long-term suppression of the adrenal cortex. The patient may require intravenous administration of fluid and electrolytes and corticosteroids before, during, and after treatment or surgery. If addisonian crisis occurs, the patient is treated for circulatory collapse and shock (see Chap. 15 for management of the patient in shock).

\section*{Adverse Effects of Adrenocortical Activity}

The nurse assesses fluid and electrolyte status by monitoring laboratory values and daily weights. Because of the increased risk for glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia, blood glucose monitoring is initiated. The nurse reports elevated blood glucose levels to the physician so that treatment can be prescribed if indicated.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The patient with Cushing's syndrome and the patient's family require teaching and support to enable them to prevent problems associated with the syndrome and to manage those that cannot be prevented. The nurse presents information verbally and in writing. If the disorder is a result of corticosteroid use for treatment of a chronic disease, the patient and family need to understand that stopping the corticosteroid use abruptly and without medical supervision is likely to result in acute adrenal insufficiency and reappearance of the underlying symptoms of the chronic disease. The nurse emphasizes the need to ensure an adequate supply of the corticosteroid, because running out of the medication and skipping doses can precipitate addisonian crisis. Refer to the later discussion, Therapeutic Uses of Corticosteroids, for more information.

The nurse stresses the need for dietary modifications to ensure adequate calcium intake without increasing the risk for hypertension, hyperglycemia, and weight gain. The patient and family
may be taught to monitor blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and weight. Wearing a medical alert bracelet and notifying other health providers (eg, dentist) are important to alert others that the patient has Cushing's syndrome (Chart 42-11).

\section*{Continuing Care}

The need for follow-up depends on the origin and duration of the disease and its management. The patient who has been treated by adrenalectomy or removal of a pituitary tumor requires close monitoring to ensure that adrenal function has returned to normal and to ensure adequacy of circulating adrenal hormones. The patient who requires continued corticosteroid therapy is monitored to ensure understanding of the medications and the need for a dosage that treats the underlying disorder while minimizing the side effects. Home care referral may be indicated to ensure a safe environment that minimizes stress and risk for falls and other side effects. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical and psychological status and reports changes to the physician. The nurse also assesses the patient's understanding of the medication regimen and the patient's compliance with the regimen, and reinforces previous teaching about the medications and the importance of taking them as prescribed. The nurse emphasizes the importance of regular medical follow-up, the side effects and toxic effects of medications, and the need to wear medical identification with Addison's and Cushing's disease. Additionally, the nurse reminds the patient and family about the importance of health promotion activities and recommended health screening, including bone mineral density testing.

\section*{PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM}

The principal action of aldosterone is to conserve body sodium. Under the influence of this hormone, the kidneys excrete less sodium and more potassium and hydrogen. Excessive production of aldosterone, which occurs in some patients with functioning tumors of the adrenal gland, causes a distinctive pattern of biochemical changes and a corresponding set of clinical manifestations that are diagnostic of this condition.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients with aldosteronism exhibit a profound decline in the serum levels of potassium (hypokalemia) and hydrogen ions (alkalosis), as demonstrated by an increase in pH and serum bicarbonate level. The serum sodium level is normal or elevated depending on the amount of water reabsorbed with the sodium. Hypertension is the most prominent and almost universal sign of aldosteronism, although it is the primary cause in less than $1 \%$ of cases of hypertension (Tierney et al., 2001).

Hypokalemia is responsible for the variable muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue in patients with aldosteronism, as well as an inability on the part of the kidneys to acidify or concentrate the urine. Accordingly, the urine volume is excessive, leading to polyuria. Serum, by contrast, becomes abnormally concentrated, contributing to excessive thirst (polydipsia) and arterial hypertension. A secondary increase in blood volume and possible direct effects of aldosterone on nerve receptors, such as the carotid sinus, are other factors producing the hypertension.

Hypokalemic alkalosis may decrease the ionized serum calcium level and predispose the patient to tetany and paresthesias. Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs can be used to assess neuromuscular irritability before overt paresthesia and tetany occur.

Glucose intolerance may occur because hypokalemia interferes with insulin secretion from the pancreas.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In addition to a high or normal serum sodium level and low serum potassium level, diagnostic studies indicate high serum aldosterone levels and low serum renin levels. The measurement of the aldosterone excretion rate after salt loading is a useful diagnostic test for primary aldosteronism. The renin-aldosterone stimulation test and bilateral adrenal venous sampling are useful in differentiating the cause of primary aldosteronism. Antihypertensive medication may be discontinued up to 2 weeks prior to testing.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of primary aldosteronism usually involves surgical removal of the adrenal tumor through adrenalectomy. Hypokalemia resolves for all patients after surgery, but hypertension may persist. Spironolactone may be prescribed to control hypertension.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT: ADRENALECTOMY}

Adrenalectomy may be used in treating adrenal tumors, primary Cushing's syndrome, and aldosteronism. For adrenal tumors, all of the endocrine disturbances associated with a hypersecreting tumor of the adrenal cortex or medulla can be relieved completely by surgical removal of the involved gland.

Adrenalectomy is performed through an incision in the flank or the abdomen. In general, the postoperative care resembles that for other abdominal surgery. However, the patient is susceptible to fluctuations in adrenocortical hormones and requires administration of corticosteroids, fluids, and other agents to maintain blood pressure and prevent acute complications. If the adrenalectomy is bilateral, replacement of corticosteroids will be lifelong; if one adrenal gland is removed, replacement therapy may be temporarily necessary because of suppression of the remaining adrenal gland by high levels of adrenal hormones. A normal serum glucose level is maintained with insulin, appropriate intravenous fluids, and dietary modifications.

Nursing management in the postoperative period includes frequent assessment of vital signs to detect early signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and crisis or hemorrhage. Explaining all treatments and procedures, providing comfort measures, and providing rest periods can reduce the patient's stress and anxiety level.

\section*{CorticosteroidTherapy}

Corticosteroids are used extensively for adrenal insufficiency and are also widely used in suppressing inflammation and autoimmune reactions, controlling allergic reactions, and reducing the rejection process in transplantation. Commonly used corticosteroid preparations are listed in Table 42-4. Their antiinflammatory and antiallergy actions make corticosteroids effective in treating rheumatic or connective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. They are also frequently used in the treatment of asthma, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune disorders.

High doses appear to allow patients to tolerate high degrees of stress. Such antistress action may be caused by the ability of corticosteroids to aid circulating vasopressor substances in keeping

the blood pressure elevated; other effects, such as maintenance of the serum glucose level, also may keep blood pressure elevated.

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS}

Although the synthetic corticosteroids are safer for some patients because of relative freedom from mineralocorticoid activity, most natural and synthetic corticosteroids produce similar kinds of side effects. The dose required for anti-inflammatory and antiallergy effects also produces metabolic effects, pituitary and adrenal gland suppression, and changes in the function of the central nervous system. Thus, although corticosteroids are highly effective therapeutically, they may also be very dangerous. Dosages of these medications are frequently altered to allow high concentrations when necessary and then tapered in an attempt to avoid undesirable effects. This requires that patients be observed closely for side effects and that the dose be reduced when high doses are no longer required. Suppression of the adrenal cortex may persist up to a year after a course of corticosteroids of only 2 weeks' duration.

\section*{THERAPEUTIC USES OF CORTICOSTEROIDS}

The dosage of corticosteroids is determined by the nature and chronicity of the illness as well as the patient's other medical problems. Rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma, and multiple sclerosis are chronic disorders that corticosteroids do not cure; however, these medications may be useful when other measures do not provide adequate control of symptoms. In addition, corticosteroids may be used to treat acute exacerbations of these disorders.

In such situations, the adverse effects of corticosteroids are weighed against the patient's current problems. These medications may be used for a period but then are gradually reduced or tapered as the symptoms subside. The nurse plays an important role in providing encouragement and understanding during the times the patient may experience (or is apprehen-
sive about experiencing) recurrence of symptoms while taking smaller doses.

\section*{Treatment of Acute Conditions}

Acute flare-ups and crises are treated with large doses of corticosteroids. Examples include emergency treatment for bronchial obstruction in status asthmaticus and septic shock from septicemia caused by gram-negative bacteria. Other measures, such as anti-infective agents or medications, are also used with corticosteroids to treat shock and other major symptoms. At times, corticosteroids are continued past the acute flare-up stage to prevent serious complications.

\section*{Eye Treatment}

A different problem exists when corticosteroids are used in treating eye infections. Outer eye infection can be treated by topical application of eye drops because these do not cause systemic toxicity. However, long-term application may cause an increase in intraocular pressure, which leads to glaucoma in some patients. In some patients, prolonged use of corticosteroids leads to cataract formation.

\section*{Dermatologic Disorders}

Topical administration of corticosteroids in the form of creams, ointments, lotions, and aerosols is especially effective in many dermatologic disorders. It may be more effective in some conditions to use occlusive dressings around the affected part to achieve maximum absorption of the medication. Penetration and $a b-$ sorption are also increased if the medication is applied when the skin is hydrated or moist (eg, immediately after bathing).

Absorption of topical agents varies with body location. For example, absorption is greater through the layers of skin on the scalp, face, and genital area than on the forearm; as a result, use of topical agents on these sites increases the risk for side effects of the medication. The availability of over-the-counter topical corticosteroids increases the risk for side effects in patients who are unaware of their potential risks. Excessive use of these agents, especially on large surface areas of inflamed skin, can lead to decreased therapeutic effects and increased side effects.

\section*{DOSAGE}

Attempts have been made to determine the best time to administer pharmacologic doses of steroids. When symptoms have been controlled on a 6-hour or 8-hour program, a once-daily or every-other-day schedule may be implemented. In keeping with the natural secretion of cortisol, the best time of the day for the total corticosteroid dose is in the early morning from 7 to 8 AM . Large-dose therapy at 8 AM , when the gland is most active, produces maximal suppression of the gland. A large 8 AM dose is more physiologic because it allows the body to escape effects of the steroids from 4 PM to 6 AM , when serum levels are normally low, hence minimizing cushingoid effects. If symptoms of the disorder being treated are suppressed, alternate-day therapy is helpful in reducing pituitary-adrenal suppression in patients requiring prolonged therapy. Some patients report discomfort associated with symptoms of their primary illness on the second
day; therefore, it is important to explain to patients that this regimen is necessary to minimize side effects and suppression of adrenal function.

\section*{TAPERING}

Corticosteroid dosages are reduced gradually (tapered) to allow normal adrenal function to return and to prevent steroid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Up to 1 year or more after use of cortico-
steroids, the patient is still at risk for adrenal insufficiency in times of stress. For example, if surgery for any reason is necessary, the patient is likely to require intravenous corticosteroids during and after surgery to reduce the risk for acute adrenal crisis. Patients receiving corticosteroids must have an adequate supply of medication on hand, so that they do not miss a scheduled dose and increase their risk for adrenal insufficiency. Table 42-5 provides an overview of the effects of corticosteroid therapy and their nursing implications.

\section*{Assessment of Renal and Urinary Tract Function}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the anatomy and physiology of the upper and lower urinary tracts.
2. Identify the assessment parameters used for determining the status of upper and lower urinary tract function.
3. Describe the diagnostic studies used to determine upper and lower urinary tract function.
4. Initiate education and preparation for patients undergoing assessment of the urinary system.
5. Discuss the role of the kidney in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, acid-base balance, and blood pressure.

$P_{\text {r }}$roper function of the urinary system is essential to life. Dysfunction of the kidneys and lower urinary tract is common and may occur at any age and with varying levels of severity. Assessment of upper and lower urinary tract function is part of every health examination and necessitates an understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the urinary system as well as of the effect of changes in the system on other physiologic functions.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The urinary system comprises the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. A thorough understanding of the urinary system is necessary for assessing individuals with acute or chronic urinary dysfunction and implementing appropriate nursing care.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE UPPER AND LOWER URINARY TRACTS}

The urinary system-the structures of which precisely maintain the internal chemical environment of the body-perform various excretory, regulatory, and secretory functions.

\section*{Kidneys}

The kidneys are a pair of brownish-red structures located retroperitoneally (behind and outside the peritoneal cavity) on the posterior wall of the abdomen from the 12th thoracic vertebra to the 3rd lumbar vertebra in the adult (Fig. 43-1). An adult kidney weighs 120 to 170 g (about 4.5 oz ) and is 12 cm (about 4.5 inches) long, 6 cm wide, and 2.5 cm thick. The kidneys are well protected by the ribs, muscles, Gerota's fascia, perirenal fat, and the renal capsule, which surround each kidney.

The kidney consists of two distinct regions, the renal parenchyma and the renal pelvis. The renal parenchyma is divided into the cortex and the medulla. The cortex contains the glomeruli, proximal and distal tubules, and cortical collecting ducts and their adjacent peritubular capillaries. The medulla resembles conical pyramids. The pyramids are situated with the base facing the concave surface of the kidney and the apex facing the hilum, or
pelvis. Each kidney contains approximately 8 to 18 pyramids. The pyramids drain into 4 to 13 minor calices that, in turn, drain into 2 to 3 major calices that open directly into the renal pelvis.

The hilum, or pelvis, is the concave portion of the kidney through which the renal artery enters and the renal vein exits. The renal artery (arising from the abdominal aorta) divides into smaller and smaller vessels, eventually forming the afferent arteriole. The afferent arteriole branches to form the glomerulus, which is the capillary bed responsible for glomerular filtration. Blood leaves the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and flows back to the inferior vena cava through a network of capillaries and veins.

Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons, the functional units of the kidney. Each kidney is capable of providing adequate renal function if the opposite kidney is damaged or becomes nonfunctional. The nephron consists of a glomerulus containing afferent and efferent arterioles, Bowman's capsule, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting ducts (Fig. 43-2). Collecting ducts converge into papillae, which empty into the minor calices, which drain into three major calices that open directly into the renal pelvis.

Nephrons are structurally divided into two types: cortical and juxtamedullary. Cortical nephrons are found in the cortex of the kidney, and juxtamedullary nephrons sit adjacent to the medulla. The juxtamedullary nephrons are distinguished by their long loops of Henle and the vasa recta, long capillary loops that dip into the medulla of the kidney.

The glomerulus is composed of three filtering layers: the capillary endothelium, the basement membrane, and the epithelium. The glomerular membrane normally allows filtration of fluid and small molecules yet limits passage of larger molecules, such as blood cells and albumin. Kidney function begins to decrease at a rate of approximately $1 \%$ each year beginning at approximately age 30.

\section*{Ureters, Bladder, and Urethra}

Urine, which is formed within the nephrons, flows into the ureter, a long fibromuscular tube that connects each kidney to the bladder. The ureters are narrow, muscular tubes, each 24 to 30 cm long, that originate at the lower portion of the renal pelvis and terminate
aldosterone: hormone synthesized and released by the adrenal cortex; causes the kidneys to reabsorb sodium
antidiuretic hormone (ADH): hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland; causes the kidneys to reabsorb more water
anuria: total urine output less than 50 mL in 24 hours
bacteriuria: bacteria in the urine; bacterial count higher than 100,000 colonies $/ \mathrm{mL}$
clearance: volume of plasma that the kidneys can clear of a specific solute (eg, creatinine); expressed in milliliters per minute
creatinine: endogenous waste product of muscle energy metabolism
dysuria: painful or difficult urination
frequency: voiding more frequently than every 3 hours
glomerulus: tuft of capillaries forming part of the nephron through which filtration occurs
glomerular filtration rate (GFR): volume of plasma filtered at the glomerulus into the kidney tubules each minute; normal rate is approximately $120 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$
hematuria: red blood cells in the urine
micturition: urination or voiding
nephron: structural and functional unit of the kidney responsible for urine formation
nocturia: awakening at night to urinate
oliguria: total urine output less than 400 mL in 24 hours
osmolality: number of particles dissolved per kilogram of urine; expression of the degree of concentration of the urine proteinuria: protein in the urine
pyuria: pus in the urine

in the trigone of the bladder wall. There are three narrowed areas of each ureter: the ureteropelvic junction, the ureteral segment near the sacroiliac junction, and the ureterovesical junction.

The angling of the ureterovesical junction is the primary means of providing antegrade, or downward, movement of urine, also referred to as efflux of urine. This angling prevents vesicoureteral

reflux, which is the retrograde, or backward, movement of urine from the bladder, up the ureter, toward the kidney. During voiding (micturition), increased intravesical pressure keeps the ureterovesical junction closed and keeps urine within the ureters. As soon as micturition is completed, intravesical pressure returns to its normal low baseline value, allowing efflux of urine to resume. Therefore, the only time that the bladder is completely empty is in the last seconds of micturition before efflux of urine resumes.

The three areas of narrowing within the ureters have a propensity toward obstruction because of renal calculi (kidney stones) or stricture. Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction is the most serious because of its close proximity to the kidney and the risk of associated kidney dysfunction. The left ureter is slightly shorter than the right. The lining of the ureters is made up of transitional cell epithelium called urothelium. As in the bladder, the urothelium prevents reabsorption of urine. The movement of urine from the renal pelves through the ureters into the bladder is facilitated by peristaltic waves (occurring about one to five times per minute) from contraction of the smooth muscle in the ureter wall (Walsh, Retik, Vaughan \& Wein, 1998).

The urinary bladder is a muscular, hollow sac located just behind the pubic bone. Adult bladder capacity is about 300 to 600 mL of urine. In infancy, the bladder is found within the abdomen. In adolescence and through adulthood, the bladder assumes its position in the true pelvis. The bladder is characterized by its central, hollow area called the vesicle, which has two inlets (the ureters) and one outlet (the urethrovesical junction), which is surrounded by the bladder neck. The wall of the bladder comprises four layers. The outermost layer is the adventitia, which is made up of connective tissue. Immediately beneath the adventitia is a smooth muscle layer known as the detrusor. Beneath the detrusor is a smooth muscle tunic known as the lamina propria, which serves as an interface between the detrusor and the innermost layer, the urothelium. The urothelium layer is specialized, transitional cell epithelium, containing a membrane that is impermeable to water. The urothelium prevents the reabsorption of urine stored in the bladder. The bladder neck contains bundles of involuntary smooth muscle that form a portion of the urethral sphincter known as the internal sphincter. The portion of the sphincteric mechanism that is under voluntary control is the external urinary sphincter at the anterior urethra, the segment most distal from the bladder (Walsh et al., 1998).

The urethra arises from the base of the bladder: In the male, it passes through the penis; in the female, it opens just anterior to the vagina. In the male, the prostate gland, which lies just below the bladder neck, surrounds the urethra posteriorly and laterally.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY OF THE UPPER AND LOWER URINARY TRACTS}

The urinary system performs various roles that are essential for normal bodily homeostasis (Chart 43-1). These functions include urine formation; excretion of waste products; regulation of electrolyte, acid, and water excretion; and autoregulation of blood pressure.

\section*{Urine Formation}

Urine is formed in the nephrons through a complex three-step process: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. Figure 43-3 illustrates the three processes of urine formation and typical values of water and electrolytes associated with each process. The various substances normally filtered by the glomerulus, reabsorbed by the tubules, and excreted in the urine include sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, potassium, glucose, urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Within the tubule, some of these substances are selectively reabsorbed into the blood. Others are secreted from the blood into the filtrate as it travels down the tubule. Some substances, such as glucose, are completely reabsorbed in the tubule and normally do not appear in the urine. Amino acids and glucose are usually filtered at the level of the

glomerulus and reabsorbed so that neither is excreted in the urine. Glucose, however, appears in the urine (glycosuria) if the amount of glucose in the blood and glomerular filtrate exceeds the amount that the tubules are able to reabsorb. Normally, glucose is completely reabsorbed when the blood glucose level is less than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $11 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). In diabetes, when the blood glucose level exceeds the kidneys' reabsorption capacity, glucose appears in the urine. Glycosuria is also common in pregnancy.

Protein molecules are also generally not found in the urine; however, low-molecular-weight proteins (globulins and albumin) may periodically be excreted in small amounts. Transient proteinuria in amounts less than $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ is considered normal and does not require further evaluation. Persistent proteinuria usually signifies damage to the glomeruli.

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

\caption{FIGURE 43-3 Urine is formed in the nephrons in a three-step process: filtration, reabsorption, and excretion.

Typical normal volumes of these substances during the steps of urine formation appear above. Wide variations may occur in the values depending on diet.}
\end{figure}

The steps of urine formation are:
- Glomerular filtration: The normal blood flow through the kidneys is about $1,200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. As blood flows into the glomerulus from an afferent arteriole, filtration occurs. The filtered fluid, also known as filtrate or ultrafiltrate, then enters the renal tubules. Under normal conditions, about $20 \%$ of the blood passing through the glomeruli is filtered into the nephron, amounting to about $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of filtrate. The filtrate normally consists of water, electrolytes, and other small molecules, because water and small molecules are allowed to pass, whereas larger molecules stay in the bloodstream. Efficient filtration depends on adequate blood flow maintaining a consistent pressure through the glomerulus. Many factors can alter this blood flow and pressure, including hypotension, decreased oncotic pressure in the blood, and increased pressure in the renal tubules from an obstruction.
- Tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion: The second and third steps of urine formation occur in the renal tubules and are called tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion. In tubular reabsorption, a substance moves from the filtrate back into the peritubular capillaries or vasa recta. In tubular secretion, a substance moves from the peritubular capillaries or vasa recta into tubular filtrate. Of the 180 L ( 45 gallons) of filtrate that the kidneys produce each day, $99 \%$ is reabsorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in 1,000 to $1,500 \mathrm{~mL}$ of urine each day. Although most reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule, reabsorption occurs along the entire tubule. Reabsorption and secretion in the tubule frequently involve passive and active transport and may require the use of energy. Filtrate becomes concentrated in the distal tubule and collecting ducts under the influence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and becomes urine, which then enters the renal pelvis.

\section*{Excretion of Waste Products}

The kidney functions as the body's main excretory organ, eliminating the body's metabolic waste products. The major waste product of protein metabolism is urea, of which about 25 to 30 g is produced and excreted daily. All of this urea must be excreted in the urine; otherwise it will accumulate in body tissues. Other waste products of metabolism that must be excreted are creatinine, phosphates, and sulfates. Uric acid, formed as a waste product of purine metabolism, is also eliminated in the urine. The kidneys serve as the primary mechanism for excreting drug metabolites.

\section*{Regulation of Electrolyte Excretion}

When the kidneys are functioning normally, the volume of electrolytes excreted per day is exactly equal to the amount ingested. For example, the average American daily diet contains 6 to 8 g each of sodium chloride (salt) and potassium chloride. Nearly all of this is excreted in the urine. Electrolyte excretion includes sodium and potassium.

\section*{SODIUM}

More than $99 \%$ of the water and sodium filtered at the glomeruli is reabsorbed into the blood by the time the urine leaves the body. Water from the filtrate follows the reabsorbed sodium to maintain osmotic balance. By regulating the amount of sodium (and therefore water) reabsorbed, the kidney can regulate the volume of body fluids. If more sodium is excreted than ingested, dehydration results; if less sodium is excreted than ingested, fluid retention results.

The regulation of sodium volume excreted depends on aldosterone, a hormone synthesized and released from the adrenal cortex. With increased aldosterone in the blood, less sodium is excreted in the urine because aldosterone fosters renal reabsorption of sodium. Release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex is largely under the control of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II levels are in turn controlled by renin, an enzyme that is released from specialized cells in the kidneys (Fig. 43-4). This complex system is activated when pressure in the renal arterioles falls below normal levels, as occurs with shock, dehydration, or decreased sodium chloride delivery to the tubules. Activation of this system increases the retention of water and expansion of intravascular fluid volume.

\section*{POTASSIUM}

Potassium is the most abundant intracellular ion, with about $98 \%$ of the total-body potassium located intracellularly. To maintain a normal potassium balance in the body, the kidneys are responsible for excreting more than $90 \%$ of the total daily potassium intake. Several factors influence potassium loss through the kidneys. Aldosterone causes the kidney to excrete potassium, in contrast to aldosterone's effects on sodium described previously. Acid-base balance, the amount of dietary potassium intake, and the flow rate of the filtrate in the distal tubule also influence the amount of potassium secreted into the urine. Retention of potassium is the most life-threatening effect of renal failure.

\section*{Regulation of Acid Excretion}

The catabolism, or breakdown, of proteins results in the production of acid compounds, in particular phosphoric and sulfuric acids. The normal daily diet also includes a certain amount of acid materials. Unlike carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, phosphoric and sulfuric acids are nonvolatile and cannot be eliminated by the lungs. Because accumulation of these acids in the blood would lower its pH (making the blood more acidic) and inhibit cell function, they must be excreted in the urine. A person with normal kidney function excretes about 70 mEq of acid each day. The kidney is able to excrete some of this acid directly into the urine until the urine pH reaches 4.5 , which is 1,000 times more acidic than blood.

More acid, however, usually needs to be eliminated from the body than can be excreted directly as free acid in the urine. These excess acids are bound to chemical buffers so they can be excreted in the urine. Two important chemical buffers are phosphate ions and ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$. When buffered with acid, ammonia becomes ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)$. Phosphate is present in the glomerular filtrate, and ammonia is produced by the cells of the renal tubules and secreted into the tubular fluid. Through the buffering process, the kidney is able to excrete large quantities of acid in a bound form, without further lowering the pH of the urine.

\section*{Regulation of Water Excretion}

Regulation of the amount of water excreted is also an important function of the kidney. With high fluid intake, a large volume of dilute urine is excreted. Conversely, with a low fluid intake, a small volume of concentrated urine is excreted. A person normally ingests about 1 to 2 L of water per day, and normally all but 400 to 500 mL of this fluid is excreted in the urine. The remainder is lost from the skin, from the lungs during breathing, and in the feces.

\section*{OSMOLALITY}

The degree of dilution or concentration of the urine can be measured in terms of osmolality, the number of particles (electrolytes

and other molecules) dissolved per kilogram of urine. The filtrate in the glomerular capillary normally has the same osmolality as the blood, with a value of about $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}(300 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. As the filtrate passes through the tubules and collecting ducts, the osmolality may vary from 50 to $1,200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, reflecting the maximal diluting and concentrating abilities of the kidney. When a person is dehydrated or retaining fluid, less water is excreted, and proportionately more particles are present in the urine, giving the urine a concentrated appearance and a high osmolality. When a person excretes a large volume of water, the particles are diluted. The urine appears dilute and the osmolality is low. Certain substances can alter the volume of water excreted and are described as osmotically active. When these substances are filtered, they pull water across the glomeruli and tubules and increase the volume of urine. Glucose and proteins are two examples of osmotically active molecules. Urine osmolality normally ranges from 300 to $1,100 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$; however, after a 12-hour fluid restriction, that range narrows to 500 to $850 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$. This wide range of normal makes the test valuable only when the kidneys' concentrating and diluting abilities are questioned.

\section*{SPECIFIC GRAVITY}

Specific gravity is a measurement of the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. It compares the weight of urine (weight of particles) to the weight of distilled water, which has a specific gravity of 1.000. Normal urine specific gravity is 1.010 to 1.025 when fluid intake is normal. Factors that may interfere with an accurate urine
specific gravity reading include radiopaque contrast agents, glucose, and proteins. Cold urine specimens may also produce a falsely high reading. Several methods can be used to measure specific gravity:
- Multiple-test dipstick (most common method), with a specific reagent area for specific gravity
- Urinometer (least accurate method), in which urine is placed in a small cylinder, and the urinometer is floated in the urine; a specific gravity reading is obtained at the meniscus level of the urine
- Refractometer, an instrument used in a laboratory setting, which measures differences in the speed of light passing through air and the urine sample
Urine specific gravity depends largely on hydration status. When fluid intake decreases, specific gravity normally increases. With high fluid intake, specific gravity decreases. In patients with kidney disease, urine specific gravity does not vary with fluid intake, and the patient's urine is said to have a fixed specific gravity. Disorders or conditions that cause a low urine specific gravity include diabetes insipidus, glomerulonephritis, and severe renal damage. Those that can cause an increased specific gravity include diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, and excessive fluid loss.

\section*{ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE}

ADH (also known as vasopressin) regulates water excretion and urine concentration in the tubule by varying the amount of water that is reabsorbed. ADH is a hormone that is secreted by the pos-
terior part of the pituitary gland in response to changes in osmolality of the blood. With decreased water intake, blood osmolality tends to rise and stimulate ADH release. ADH then acts on the kidney, increasing reabsorption of water and thereby returning the osmolality of the blood to normal. With excess water intake, the secretion of ADH by the pituitary is suppressed; therefore, less water is reabsorbed by the kidney tubule. This latter situation leads to increased urine volume (diuresis).

A dilute urine with a fixed specific gravity (about 1.010) or fixed osmolality (about $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ) indicates an inability to concentrate and dilute the urine, a common early sign of kidney disease.

\section*{Autoregulation of Blood Pressure}

Regulation of blood pressure is also a function of the kidney. Specialized vessels of the kidney called the vasa recta constantly monitor blood pressure as blood begins its passage into the kidney. When the vasa recta detect a decrease in blood pressure, specialized juxtaglomerular cells near the afferent arteriole, distal tubule, and efferent arteriole secrete the hormone renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II, the most powerful vasoconstrictor known. The vasoconstriction causes the blood pressure to increase. The adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone in response to stimulation by the pituitary gland, which in turn is in response to poor perfusion or increasing serum osmolality. The result is an increase in blood pressure. When the vasa recta recognize the increase in blood pressure, renin secretion stops. Failure of this feedback mechanism is one of the primary causes of hypertension.

\section*{Renal Clearance}

Renal clearance refers to the ability of the kidneys to clear solutes from the plasma. A 24-hour collection of urine is the primary test of renal clearance used to evaluate how well the kidney performs this important excretory function. Clearance depends on several factors: how quickly the substance is filtered across the glomerulus, how much of the substance is reabsorbed along the tubules, and how much of the substance is secreted into the tubules. It is possible to measure the renal clearance of any substance, but the one measure that is particularly useful is the creatinine clearance.

Creatinine is an endogenous waste product of skeletal muscle that is filtered at the glomerulus, passed through the tubules with minimal change, and excreted in the urine. Hence, creatinine clearance is a good measure of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To calculate creatinine clearance, a 24 -hour urine specimen is collected. Midway through the collection, the serum creatinine level is measured. The following formula is then used to calculate the creatinine clearance:
$$\frac{(\text { Volume of urine }[\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min}] \times \text { urine creatinine }[\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}])}{\text { serum creatinine }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})}$$

The normal adult GFR is about 100 to $120 \mathrm{~mL} / \min$ ( 1.67 to $2.0 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{sec})$. Creatinine clearance is an excellent measure of renal function; as renal function declines, creatinine clearance decreases.

\section*{Regulation of Red Blood Cell Production}

When the kidneys sense a decrease in the oxygen tension in renal blood flow, they release erythropoietin. Erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells (RBCs), thereby increasing the amount of hemoglobin available to carry oxygen.

\section*{Vitamin D Synthesis}

The kidneys are also responsible for the final conversion of inactive vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Vitamin D is necessary for maintaining normal calcium balance in the body.

\section*{Secretion of Prostaglandins}

The kidneys also produce prostaglandin E (PGE) and prostacyclin (PGI), which have a vasodilatory effect and are important in maintaining renal blood flow.

\section*{Urine Storage}

The bladder is the reservoir for urine. Both bladder filling and emptying are mediated by coordinated sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system control mechanisms involving the detrusor muscle and the bladder outlet. In an infant, bladder filling and emptying are mediated within the micturition center in the pons area of the brain stem. By the time a child is 3 to 4 years old, the cerebral cortex is mature enough to cause a conscious awareness of bladder filling. This conscious awareness of bladder filling occurs as a result of sympathetic neuronal pathways that travel via the spinal cord to the level of T10-12, where peripheral, hypogastric nerve innervation allows for continued bladder filling. As bladder filling continues, stretch receptors in the bladder wall are activated, coupled with the desire to void. This information from the detrusor muscle is relayed back to the cerebral cortex via the parasympathetic pelvic nerves at the level of S2 through S4. Normally, the pressure in the bladder remains low even as the urine accumulates, due to the bladder's compliance, or ability to expand with increasing urine volumes (Appell, 1999).

Bladder compliance is due in part to the smooth muscle lining of the bladder and collagen deposits within the wall of the bladder, as well as to neuronal mechanisms that inhibit the detrusor muscle from contracting (specifically, adrenergic receptors that mediate relaxation). To maintain adequate kidney filtration rates, bladder pressure during filling must remain lower than $40 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Ordinarily, the first sensation of bladder filling occurs when there is approximately 100 to 150 mL of urine in the bladder. The first sensation of bladder fullness is transmitted to the central nervous system when the bladder has reached approximately half of its capacity, about 200 to 300 mL in adults, and an initial desire to void occurs. A marked sense of fullness with a strong desire to void usually occurs when the bladder contains 350 mL or more of urine ("functional capacity"). During anesthesia, the average adult bladder under pressure of $60 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ can hold 1,500 to $2,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ ("anatomic capacity"). During normal circumstances, with appropriate bladder wall innervation, capacity would never reach this level because of the tremendous pain and pressure that such fullness would cause. Neurologic changes to the bladder at the level of the supraspinal, spinal, or bladder wall itself can cause abnormally high volumes of urine to be stored due to a decreased or absent urge to void. Under normal circumstances with average fluid intake of approximately 1,500 to $2,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ per day, the bladder should be able to store urine for periods of 2 to 4 hours at a time during the day. At night, the release of vasopressin in response to decreased fluid intake causes less production of urine that is more concentrated. This phenomenon usually allows the bladder to continue filling for periods of 6 to 8 hours in adolescents and adults. In older individuals, decreasing bladder compliance and vasopressin levels cause nighttime bladder filling to decrease to periods ranging from 3 to 6 hours (Appell, 1999).

\section*{Bladder Emptying}

Micturition (voiding) normally occurs approximately eight times in a 24 -hour period. It is activated via the micturition reflex arc within the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, which causes a coordinated sequence of events. Initiation of voiding occurs when the efferent pelvic nerve, which originates in S2 to S4, stimulates the bladder to contract, resulting in complete relaxation of the striated urethral sphincter and followed by a fall in urethral pressure, contraction of the detrusor muscle, opening of the vesicle neck and proximal urethra, and flow of urine. This coordinated effort by the parasympathetic system is mediated by muscarinic and, to a lesser extent, cholinergic receptors within the detrusor muscle. The pressure generated in the bladder during micturition is about 20 to $40 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in females. It is somewhat higher and more variable in males ages 45 and older due to the normal hyperplasia of the cells of the middle lobes of the prostate gland that surround the proximal urethra. An obstruction of the bladder outlet, such as in advanced benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), results in abnormally high voiding pressure with a slow, prolonged flow of urine. In females, gravity drains any urine remaining in the urethra; in males, voluntary muscle contractions expel the urine (Wein, 2001).

If the spinal pathways from the brain to the urinary system are destroyed (eg, after a spinal cord injury), reflex contraction of the bladder is maintained, but voluntary control over the process is lost. In both situations, the detrusor muscle can contract and expel urine, but the contractions are generally insufficient to empty the bladder completely, so residual urine (urine left in the bladder after voiding) remains. Normally, residual urine amounts to no more than 50 mL in the middle-aged adult and less than 50 to 100 mL in the older adult. Chronic urine retention is more prevalent in older men and women (Gray, 2000b).

\section*{Assessment}

Obtaining a comprehensive health history, which includes an assessment of risk factors, is the first step in assessing a patient with upper or lower urinary tract dysfunction. Various diseases or clinical situations can place a patient at increased risk for urinary tract dysfunction. Data collection about previous health problems or diseases provides the health care team with useful information for evaluating the patient's current urinary status. Risk factors for specific disorders and kidney and lower urinary tract dysfunction are discussed in Chart 43-2 and in Chapters 44 and 45.

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

Obtaining a urologic health history requires excellent communication skills because many patients are embarrassed or uncomfortable discussing genitourinary function or symptoms. It is important to use language the patient can understand and to avoid medical jargon. It is also important to review risk factors, particularly with those at risk. For example, the nurse needs to be aware that multiparous women delivering their children vaginally are at high risk for stress urinary incontinence, which if severe enough can also lead to urge incontinence. Elderly women and persons with neurologic disorders such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease often have incomplete emptying of the bladder with urinary stasis, which may result in urinary tract infection or increasing bladder pressure leading to overflow incontinence, hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis, or renal insufficiency.

Risk Factors for Selected Renal or Urologic Disorders

Persons with a family history of urinary tract problems are at increased risk for renal disorders. Persons with diabetes who have consistent hypertension are at risk for renal dysfunction (Bakris, Williams, Dworkin et al., 2000). Older men are at risk for prostatic enlargement, which causes urethral obstruction and which can result in urinary tract infections and renal failure (Degler, 2000). Moreover, many persons with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop lupus nephritis (Smith, FortuneFaulkner \& Spurbeck, 2000). When obtaining the health history, the nurse should inquire about the following:
- The patient's chief concern or reason for seeking health care, the onset of the problem, and its effect on the patient's quality of life
- The location, character, and duration of pain, if present, and its relationship to voiding; factors that precipitate pain, and those that relieve it
- History of urinary tract infections, including past treatment or hospitalization for urinary tract infection
- Fever or chills
- Previous renal or urinary diagnostic tests or use of indwelling urinary catheters
- Dysuria and when it occurs during voiding (at initiation or termination of voiding)
- Hesitancy, straining, or pain during or after urination
- Urinary incontinence (stress incontinence, urge incontinence, overflow incontinence, or functional incontinence)
- Hematuria or change in color or volume of urine
- Nocturia and its date of onset
- Renal calculi (kidney stones), passage of stones or gravel in urine
- Female patients: number and type (vaginal or cesarean) of deliveries; use of forceps; vaginal infection, discharge, or irritation; contraceptive practices
- Presence or history of genital lesions or sexually transmitted diseases
- Habits: use of tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs
- Any prescription and over-the-counter medications (including those prescribed for renal or urinary problems)

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

A thorough medication history is especially important for elderly patients, for whom the increased occurrence of chronic illness often necessitates polypharmacy (concurrent use of multiple medications). Aging affects the way the body absorbs, metabolizes,
and excretes drugs, thus placing the elderly patient at risk for adverse reactions, including compromised renal function.

Other key information to obtain while gathering the health history includes an assessment of the patient's psychosocial status, level of anxiety, perceived threats to body image, available support systems, and sociocultural patterns. Obtaining this information during the initial and subsequent nursing assessments enables the nurse to uncover special needs, misunderstandings, lack of knowledge, and need for patient teaching. Pain, changes in voiding, and gastrointestinal symptoms are particularly suggestive of urinary tract disease. Dysfunction of the kidney can produce a complex array of symptoms throughout the body.

\section*{Unexplained Anemia}

Gradual kidney dysfunction can be insidious in its presentation, although fatigue is a common symptom. Fatigue, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance all result from the condition known as "anemia of chronic disease." Although hematocrit has been the blood test of choice when assessing a patient for anemia, the 2001 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative: Management of Anemia Guidelines recommend that anemia be quantified using hemoglobin level rather than hematocrit, because that measurement is a better assessment of circulating oxygen (Eschbach, 2001).

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Urinary Tract Disorders}

Various conditions that affect the renal system and urinary tract function are influenced by genetic factors. Some examples of these genetic disorders are:
- Congenital absence of the vas deferens (caused by CFTR gene mutation for cystic fibrosis)
- Cystic, dysplastic kidneys
- Familial Wilms' tumor
- Horseshoe kidney
- Polycystic kidney (autosomal dominant gene)
- Nephrosis of later onset
- Renal cystic disease in tuberous sclerosis complex

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY}
- Inquire about other family members with renal and/or urinary tract malformations.
- Ask about family history of kidney disease with onset in third to fifth decade (polycystic kidney, autosomal dominant gene).
- Identify family history of male infertility and cystic fibrosis (congenital absence of vas deferens).
- Be alert for family members with history of early-onset renal (Wilms' tumor) or other cancers.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- Be alert for signs and symptoms of renal disease at an early age (hematuria, hypertension, abdominal mass).
- Assess for clinical findings suggesting that renal disease is a component of a genetic syndrome (eg, seizures, mental retardation, skin involvement).

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether DNA mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on an affected family member.
- If indicated, refer for genetic counseling and evaluation so that the family can discuss concerns regarding inheritance, risks to other family members, availability of genetic testing, and gene-based interventions.
- Offer appropriate genetic information and resources (eg, Genetic Alliance web site).
- Provide support to families newly diagnosed with geneticrelated renal and/or kidney disease.

\section*{Pain}

Genitourinary pain is usually caused by distention of some portion of the urinary tract because of obstructed urine flow or inflammation and swelling of tissues. Severity of pain is related to the sudden onset rather than the extent of distention.

Table 43-1 lists the various types of genitourinary pain, characteristics of the pain, associated signs and symptoms, and possible causes. However, kidney disease does not always involve pain. It tends to be diagnosed because of other symptoms that cause a patient to seek health care, such as pedal edema, shortness of breath, and changes in urine elimination (Kuebler, 2001).

\section*{Changes in Voiding}

Voiding (micturition) is normally a painless function occurring approximately eight times in a 24 -hour period. The average person voids 1,200 to $1,500 \mathrm{~mL}$ of urine in 24 hours, although this amount varies depending on fluid intake, sweating, environmental temperature, vomiting, or diarrhea. Common problems associated with voiding include frequency, urgency, dysuria, hesitancy, incontinence, enuresis, polyuria, oliguria, and hematuria. These problems and others are described in Table 43-2. Increased urinary urgency and frequency coupled with decreasing urine volumes strongly suggest urine retention. Depending on the acuity of the onset of these symptoms, immediate bladder emptying via catheterization and evaluation are necessary to prevent kidney dysfunction (Gray, 2000a).

\section*{Gastrointestinal Symptoms}

Gastrointestinal symptoms may occur with urologic conditions because of shared autonomic and sensory innervation and renointestinal reflexes. The anatomic relation of the right kidney to the colon, duodenum, head of the pancreas, common bile duct, liver, and gallbladder may cause gastrointestinal disturbances. The proximity of the left kidney to the colon (splenic flexure), stomach,
pancreas, and spleen may also result in intestinal symptoms. The most common signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal distention. Urologic symptoms can mimic such disorders as appendicitis, peptic ulcer disease, or cholecystitis, thus making diagnosis difficult, especially in the elderly, because of decreased neurologic innervation to this area (Kuebler, 2001; Wade-Elliot, 1999).

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

Several body systems can affect upper and lower urinary tract dysfunction, and that dysfunction can affect several end organs; therefore, a head-to-toe assessment is indicated. Areas of emphasis include the abdomen, suprapubic region, genitalia and lower back, and lower extremities.

Direct palpation of the kidneys may help determine their size and mobility. The correct position for palpation is presented in Figure 43-5. It may be possible to feel the smooth, rounded lower pole of the kidney between the hands, although the right kidney is easier to feel because it is somewhat lower than the left one. In obese patients, palpation of the kidneys is generally more difficult.

Renal dysfunction may produce tenderness over the costovertebral angle, which is the angle formed by the lower border of the 12th, or bottom, rib and the spine. The abdomen (just slightly to the right and left of midline in both upper quadrants) is auscultated to assess for bruits (low-pitched murmurs that indicate renal artery stenosis or an aortic aneurysm). The abdomen is also assessed for the presence of peritoneal fluid, which may occur with kidney dysfunction.

The bladder should be percussed after the patient voids to check for residual urine. Percussion of the bladder begins at the midline just above the umbilicus and proceeds downward. The sound changes from tympanic to dull when percussing over the bladder. The bladder, which can be palpated only if it is moderately distended, feels like a smooth, firm, round mass rising out of the abdomen, usually at midline (Fig. 43-6). Dullness to percussion of the bladder following voiding indicates incomplete bladder emptying.

\end{table}

In older men, benign prostatic hyperplasia $(\mathrm{BPH})$ is a common cause of urinary dysfunction. Because the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer can mimic those of BPH , the prostate gland is palpated by digital rectal examination (DRE) as part of the yearly physical examination in men ages 50 and older ( 45 if there is a family history of prostate cancer). In addition, a blood specimen is obtained to test the prostate specific antigen (PSA) level annually; the results of the DRE and PSA are then correlated. Blood is drawn for PSA before the DRE because manipulation of the prostate can cause the PSA level to rise temporarily. The inguinal area is examined for enlarged nodes, an inguinal or femoral hernia, or varicocele (varicose veins of the spermatic cord) (American Foundation for Urological Disease, 2000; Degler, 2001).

In women, the vulva, urethral meatus, and vagina are examined. The urethra is palpated for diverticula and the vagina is assessed for adequate estrogen effect and any of five types of herniation (Goolsby, 2001). Urethrocele is the bulging of the anterior vaginal wall into the urethra. Cystocele is the herniation of the bladder wall into the vaginal vault. The cervix bulging into the vaginal vault is referred to as pelvic prolapse. Enterocele is herniation of the bowel into the posterior vaginal wall, and rectocele is the herniation of the rectum into the vaginal wall. These prolapses are graded depending on the degree of herniation (see Chap. 47 for more information).

The woman is asked to cough and perform a Valsalva maneuver to assess the urethra's system of muscular and ligament support. If urine leakage occurs, the index and middle fingers of the examiner's gloved hand are used to support either side of the ure-
thra as the woman is asked to repeat these maneuvers. This is called the Marshall-Boney maneuver.

If no urine leakage is detected when external support is provided to the urethra, poor pelvic floor support-referred to as urethral hypermobility-is identified as the suspected cause of the urinary incontinence. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is graded based on its severity. Grade 1 and Grade 2 SUI relate to the degree of urethral hypermobility. Grade 3, the most severe form of SUI, refers to the inability of the urethral walls to remain compressed with abdominal pressure such as a cough or Valsalva maneuver. Grade 3 is referred to as intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) (Albaugh, 1999).

If some residual leakage of urine is noted despite support, ISD is suspected. Urethral hypermobility may be suspected when Q-tip test results are positive. The Q-tip test involves gently placing a well-lubricated Q -tip into the urethra until resistance is no longer noted, then gently pulling back on the Q-tip until resistance is felt. The female patient is asked to cough and perform the Valsalva maneuver. If there is an upward (positive deflection) of the visible part of the Q-tip, urethral hypermobility is at least one of the causes for the type of incontinence referred to as stress incontinence (see Chap. 44) (Albaugh, 1999).

The patient is assessed for edema and changes in body weight. Edema may be observed, particularly in the face and dependent parts of the body, such as the ankles and sacral areas, and suggests fluid retention. An increase in body weight commonly accompanies edema. A $1-\mathrm{kg}$ weight gain equals approximately $1,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ of fluid.

The deep tendon reflexes of the knee are assessed for quality and symmetry. This is an important part of testing for neurological causes of bladder dysfunction because the sacral area, which innervates the lower extremities, is the same peripheral nerve area responsible for urinary continence. The gait pattern of the individual with bladder dysfunction is also noted, as well as the patient's ability to walk toe-to-heel. These tests evaluate possible supraspinal causes for urinary incontinence (Appell, 1999).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Upper and lower urinary tract function changes with age. The GFR decreases with age starting between ages 35 and 40. A yearly decline of about $1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ continues thereafter. Tubular function, including reabsorption and concentrating ability, is also reduced with increasing age. Although renal function usually remains adequate despite these changes, renal reserve is decreased and may reduce the kidneys' ability to respond effectively to drastic or sudden physiologic changes. This steady decrease in glomerular filtration, combined with the use of multiple medications whose metabolites clear the body via the kidneys, puts the older individual at higher risk for adverse drug effects and drug-to-drug interactions (Schafer, 2001).

Structural or functional abnormalities that occur with aging may prevent complete emptying of the bladder. This may be due
to decreased bladder wall contractility, due to myogenic or neurogenic causes, or structurally, related to bladder outlet obstruction, as in BPH. Vaginal and urethral tissues atrophy (become thinner) in aging women due to decreased estrogen levels. This causes decreased blood supply to the urogenital tissues, causing urethral and vaginal irritation and urinary incontinence.

Urinary incontinence is the most common reason for admission to skilled nursing facilities. Many older individuals and their families are unaware that urinary incontinence stems from many causes. The nurse needs to inform the patient and family that with appropriate evaluation, urinary incontinence can often be managed at home and in many cases can be eliminated (Degler, 2000). Many treatments are available for urinary incontinence in the elderly, including noninvasive, behavioral interventions that the individual or the caregiver can carry out (Kincade, Peckous \& Busby-Whitehead, 2001). Treatment modalities for urinary incontinence are described in further detail in Chapter 44.

Preparation of the elderly patient for diagnostic tests must be managed carefully to prevent dehydration, which might precipitate renal failure in a patient with marginal renal reserve. Limitations in mobility may affect an elderly patient's ability to void adequately or to consume an adequate volume of fluids. The patient may limit fluid intake to minimize the frequency of voiding or the risk of incontinence. Teaching the patient and family about the dangers of an inadequate fluid intake is an important role of the nurse caring for the elderly patient.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

\section*{URINALYSIS AND URINE CULTURE}

The urinalysis provides important clinical information on kidney function and helps diagnose other diseases, such as diabetes. The urine culture determines if bacteria are present in the urine, as well as their strains and concentration. Urine culture and sensitivity also identify the antimicrobial therapy that is best suited for the particular strains identified, taking into consideration the antibiotics that have the best rate of resolution in that particular geographic region. Appropriate evaluation of any abnormality can assist in detecting serious underlying diseases.

Urine examination includes the following:
- Urine color (Table 43-3)
- Urine clarity and odor
- Urine pH and specific gravity
- Tests to detect protein, glucose, and ketone bodies in the urine (proteinuria, glycosuria, and ketonuria, respectively)
- Microscopic examination of the urine sediment after centrifuging to detect RBCs (hematuria), white blood cells, casts (cylindruria), crystals (crystalluria), pus (pyuria), and bacteria (bacteriuria)

\section*{Significance of Findings}

Several abnormalities, such as hematuria and proteinuria, produce no symptoms but may be detected during a routine urinalysis using a dipstick. Normally, about 1 million RBCs pass into the urine daily, which is equivalent to one to three RBCs per high-power field. Hematuria (more than three RBCs per highpower field) can develop from an abnormality anywhere along the genitourinary tract. Common causes include acute infection (cystitis, urethritis, or prostatitis), renal calculi, and neoplasm. Other causes include systemic disorders, such as bleeding disorders; malignant lesions; and medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin)

and heparin. Although hematuria may initially be detected using a dipstick test, further microscopic evaluation is necessary (National Institute of Diabetes \& Digestive \& Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 1999).

Protein in the urine (proteinuria) may be a benign finding, or it may signify serious disease. Occasional loss of up to 150 mg /day of protein in the urine, primarily albumin and Tamm-Horsfall protein, is considered normal and usually does not require further evaluation. A dipstick examination, which can detect from 30 to $1,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ of protein, should be used as a screening test only, because urine concentration, pH , hematuria, and radiocontrast materials all affect the results. Because dipstick analysis does not detect protein concentrations of less than $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, the test cannot be used for early detection of diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria (excretion of 20 to $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ of protein in the urine) is an early sign of diabetic nephropathy. Common benign causes of transient proteinuria are fever, strenuous exercise, and prolonged standing.

Causes of persistent proteinuria include glomerular diseases, malignancies, collagen diseases, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, hypothyroidism, heart failure, exposure to heavy metals, and use of medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (NIDDK, 2000).

\section*{RENAL FUNCTION TESTS}

Renal function tests are used to evaluate the severity of kidney disease and to assess the patient's clinical progress. These tests also provide information on the effectiveness of the kidney in carrying out its excretory function. Renal function test results may be within normal limits until the GFR is reduced to less than $50 \%$
of normal. Renal function can be assessed most accurately if several tests are performed and their results analyzed together. Common tests of renal function include renal concentration tests, creatinine clearance, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Table 43-4 describes the purpose and normal ranges for each. Other helpful tests for evaluating renal function are serum electrolyte levels.

\section*{X-RAY FILMS AND OTHER IMAGING MODALITIES}

\section*{Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder Studies}

An x-ray study of the abdomen or kidney, ureters, and bladder (KUB) may be performed to delineate the size, shape, and position of the kidneys and to reveal any abnormalities, such as calculi (stones) in the kidneys or urinary tract, hydronephrosis (distention of the pelvis of the kidney), cysts, tumors, or kidney displacement by abnormalities in surrounding tissues.

\section*{General Ultrasonography}

Ultrasonography is a noninvasive procedure that uses sound waves passed into the body through a transducer to detect abnormalities of internal tissues and organs. Structures of the urinary system create characteristic ultrasonographic images. Abnormalities such as fluid accumulation, masses, congenital malformations, changes in organ size, or obstructions can be identified. During the test, the lower abdomen and genitalia may need to be exposed. Ultrasonography requires a full bladder; therefore, fluid intake should be encouraged before the procedure. Because of its sensitivity, ultra-

Kincade, J. E., Peckous, B. K., \& Busby-Whitehead, J. (2001). A pilot study to determine predictors of behavioral treatment completion for urinary incontinence. Urologic Nursing, 21(1), 39-44.

\section*{Purpose}

Urinary incontinence (UI) affects approximately 13 million Americans. The usual behavioral interventions include a program of pelvic muscle strengthening. Despite the well-documented safety and efficacy of this intervention, high rates of patient withdrawal have been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics that best predict completion of behavioral treatment for UI in an outpatient setting.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The sample for this descriptive study was obtained from a universityaffiliated clinic that provided community-based care for adults with UI. To be eligible for inclusion in the study, subjects had to be 50 years old or older. They also had to complete an initial clinic visit and perform pelvic floor exercises augmented with biofeedback prescribed by the clinician. Data collected by review of clinic records for the study included demographic data (age, gender, race, and education level), incontinence-related variables (initial treatment goal; frequency, amount, and duration of urine loss; type of incontinence and presence of nocturia), service-related variables (distance to clinic, source of referral to the UI clinic, previous efforts to get provider help for UI, and completion of a 7-day bladder diary), and health-related variables (number of comorbidities and of prescription medications). Program completion was the study's dependent variable.

\section*{Findings}

Of the 156 patients in the UI clinic, 98 met the study criteria. The majority of participants were older, Caucasian, well-educated women with mainly urge and mixed urinary incontinence of many years' duration. Over half ( $55.1 \%$ ) of the patients completed the treatment program. The only characteristic that differed significantly ( $p \leq 0.0001$ ) in those who completed the program and those who did not was completion of a 7-day bladder diary. Those who completed the 7-day bladder diary before the program study was initiated were much more likely to complete the program than those who did not complete the diary.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Completion of a 7-day voiding diary before beginning a behavioral continence program is usually considered pivotal for an accurate record of day-to-day bladder status, and the data obtained from the review are important in assessing the effectiveness of the treatment. Clinicians need to assess the patient's reasons for unwillingness or inability to complete the diary. Protocols or treatment strategies should be developed for this subset of patients so that they can benefit from this noninvasive, effective treatment modality for UI.
sonography has replaced many other tests as the initial diagnostic procedure.

\section*{Bladder Ultrasonography}

Bladder ultrasonography is a noninvasive method of measuring urine volume in the bladder. It may be indicated for urinary frequency, inability to void after removal of an indwelling urinary catheter, measurement of postvoiding residual urine volume, inability to void postoperatively, or assessment of the need for

catheterization during the initial stages of an intermittent catheterization training program. Portable, battery-operated devices are available for bedside use. The scan head is placed on the patient's abdomen and directed toward the bladder. The device automatically calculates and displays urine volume.

\section*{Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are noninvasive techniques that provide excellent crosssectional views of the kidney and urinary tract. They are used in evaluating genitourinary masses, nephrolithiasis, chronic renal infections, renal or urinary tract trauma, metastatic disease, and soft tissue abnormalities. The nurse should explain to the patient that a sedative may be prescribed. Claustrophobia is often a problem, especially with MRI. Patient preparation for the MRI includes removal of any metallic objects, such as jewelry or clothing with metallic clasps. Credit cards should be kept away from the MRI area because of their magnetic strips. MRI is contraindicated in patients with pacemakers, surgical clips, or any metallic objects anywhere in the body. Occasionally, an oral or intravenous radiopaque contrast material is used in CT scanning to enhance visualization. Nursing care guidelines for patient preparation and test precautions for any imaging procedure requiring a contrast agent (also called contrast medium) are explained in Chart 43-3.

\section*{Patient Care During Urologic Testing With Contrast Agents}

For some patients, contrast agents are nephrotoxic and allergenic. The following guidelines can help the nurse and other caregivers respond quickly in the event of a problem.

\section*{Nursing Actions for Room Preparation}
- Have emergency equipment and medications available in case the patient has an anaphylactic reaction to the contrast agent. Emergency supplies include epinephrine, corticosteroids, and vasopressors; oxygen; and airway and suction equipment.

\section*{Nursing Actions for Patient Preparation}
- Obtain the patient's allergy history with emphasis on allergy to iodine, shellfish, and other seafood, because many contrast agents contain iodine.
- Notify physician and radiologist if the patient is allergic or suspected to be allergic to iodine.
- Obtain health history. Contrast agents should be used with caution in older patients and patients who have diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, renal insufficiency, or volume depletion.
- Inform the patient that he or she may experience a temporary feeling of warmth, flushing of the face, and an unusual flavor (seafood) in the mouth when the contrast agent is infused.
- Monitor patient closely for allergic reaction and monitor urine output.

\section*{Nuclear Scans}

Nuclear scans require injection of a radioisotope (technetium99 m -labeled compound or iodine-131 hippurate) into the circulatory system; the isotope is then monitored as it moves through the blood vessels of the kidneys. A scintillation camera is placed behind the kidney with the patient in a supine, prone, or seated position. Hypersensitivity to the radioisotope is rare. The technetium scan provides information about kidney perfusion; the hippurate scan provides information about kidney function.

Nuclear scans are used to evaluate acute and chronic renal failure, renal masses, and blood flow before and after kidney transplantation. The radioisotope is injected at a specified time before the study to achieve the proper concentration in the kidneys. After the procedure is completed, the patient is encouraged to drink fluids to promote excretion of the radioisotope by the kidneys.

\section*{Intravenous Urography}

Intravenous urography includes various tests such as excretory urography, intravenous pyelography (IVP), and infusion drip pyelography. A radiopaque contrast agent is administered intravenously. An IVP, or intravenous urogram, shows the kidneys, ureter, and bladder via x-ray imaging as dye moves through the upper and then lower urinary system. A nephrotomogram may be carried out as part of the study to visualize different layers of the kidney and the
diffuse structures within each layer and to differentiate solid masses or lesions from cysts in the kidneys or urinary tract.

Intravenous urography may be used as the initial assessment of any suspected urologic problem, especially lesions in the kidneys and ureters. It also provides a rough estimate of renal function. After the contrast agent (sodium diatrizoate or meglumine diatrizoate) is administered intravenously, multiple x-rays are obtained to visualize drainage structures.

Infusion drip pyelography requires an intravenous infusion of a large volume of a dilute contrast agent to opacify the renal parenchyma and fill the urinary tract. This examination method is useful when prolonged opacification of the drainage structures is desired so that tomograms (body-section radiography) can be made. Images are obtained at specified intervals after the start of the infusion. These images show the filled and distended collecting system. The patient preparation is the same as for excretory urography, except that fluids are not restricted.

\section*{Retrograde Pyelography}

In retrograde pyelography, catheters are advanced through the ureters into the renal pelvis by means of cystoscopy. A contrast agent is then injected. Retrograde pyelography is usually performed if intravenous urography provides inadequate visualization of the collecting systems. It may also be used before extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or in patients with urologic cancer who need follow-up and are allergic to intravenous contrast agents. Possible complications include infection, hematuria, and perforation of the ureter. Retrograde pyelography is used infrequently because of improved techniques in excretory urography.

\section*{Cystography}

Cystography aids in evaluating vesicoureteral reflux (backflow of urine from the bladder into one or both ureters) and assessing the patient for bladder injury. A catheter is inserted into the bladder, and a contrast agent is instilled to outline the bladder wall. The contrast agent may leak through a small bladder perforation stemming from bladder injury, but such leakage is usually harmless. Cystography can also be performed with simultaneous pressure recordings inside the bladder.

\section*{Voiding Cystourethrography}

Voiding cystourethrography uses fluoroscopy to visualize the lower urinary tract and assess urine storage in the bladder. It is commonly used as a diagnostic tool to identify vesicoureteral reflux (between bladder and ureter). A urethral catheter is inserted, and a contrast agent is instilled into the bladder. When the bladder is full and the patient feels the urge to void, the catheter is removed, and the patient voids. Retrograde urethrography, in which a contrast agent is injected retrograde into the urethra, is always performed before urethral catheterization if urethral trauma is suspected.

\section*{Renal Angiography}

A renal angiogram, or renal arteriogram, provides an image of the renal arteries. The femoral (or axillary) artery is pierced with a needle, and a catheter is threaded up through the femoral and iliac arteries into the aorta or renal artery. A contrast agent is injected to opacify the renal arterial supply. Angiography is used to
evaluate renal blood flow in suspected renal trauma, to differentiate renal cysts from tumors, and to evaluate hypertension. It is used preoperatively for renal transplantation. Before the procedure, a laxative may be prescribed to evacuate the colon so that unobstructed x-rays can be obtained. Injection sites (groin for femoral approach or axilla for axillary approach) may be shaved. The peripheral pulse sites (radial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis) are marked for easy access during postprocedural assessment. The patient is informed that there may be a brief sensation of heat along the course of the vessel when the contrast agent is injected.

After the procedure, vital signs are monitored until stable. If the axillary artery was the injection site, blood pressure measurements are taken on the opposite arm. The injection site is examined for swelling and hematoma. Peripheral pulses are palpated, and the color and temperature of the involved extremity are noted and compared with those of the uninvolved extremity. Cold compresses may be applied to the injection site to decrease edema and pain. Possible complications include hematoma formation, arterial thrombosis or dissection, false aneurysm formation, and altered renal function.

\section*{UROLOGIC ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES}

Endourology, or urologic endoscopic procedures, can be performed in one of two ways: using a cystoscope inserted into the urethra, or percutaneously, through a small incision.

The cystoscopic examination is used to directly visualize the urethra and bladder. The cystoscope, which is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, has a self-contained optical lens system that provides a magnified, illuminated view of the bladder (Fig. 43-7). The use of a high-intensity light and interchangeable lenses allows excellent visualization and permits still and motion pictures to be taken. The cystoscope is manipulated to allow complete visualization of the urethra and bladder as well as the ureteral orifices and prostatic urethra. Small ureteral catheters can be passed through the cystoscope, allowing assessment of the ureters and the pelvis of each kidney.

\end{figure}

The cystoscope also permits the urologist to obtain a urine specimen from each kidney to evaluate its function. Cup forceps can be inserted through the cystoscope for biopsy. Calculi may be removed from the urethra, bladder, and ureter using cystoscopy. If a lower tract cystoscopy is performed, the patient is usually awake and the procedure is usually no more uncomfortable than a catheterization. To minimize post-test urethral discomfort, viscous lidocaine is usually injected several minutes prior to the study. If the cystoscopy includes examination of the upper tracts, a sedative may be administered before the procedure. General anesthesia is usually administered to ensure that there are no involuntary muscle spasms when the scope is being passed through the ureters or kidney.

The nurse describes the examination to the patient and family to prepare them and to allay their fears. If an upper cystoscopy is to be performed, the patient is usually kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for several hours beforehand, unless the examination is being done to assess structural integrity following trauma.

Postprocedural management is directed at relieving any discomfort resulting from the examination. Some burning on voiding, blood-tinged urine, and urinary frequency from trauma to the mucous membrane can be expected. Moist heat to the lower abdomen and warm sitz baths are helpful in relieving pain and relaxing the muscles.

After a cystoscopic examination, the patient with obstructive pathology may experience urine retention if the instruments used during the examination caused edema. The nurse carefully monitors the patient with prostatic hyperplasia for urine retention. Warm sitz baths and antispasmodic medication, such as flavoxate (Urispas), may be prescribed to relieve temporary urine retention due to poor relaxation of the urinary sphincter; however, intermittent catheterization may be necessary for a few hours after the examination. The nurse monitors the patient for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection. Because edema of the urethra secondary to local trauma may obstruct urine flow, the patient is also monitored for signs and symptoms of obstruction (NIDDK, 2001a).

\section*{BIOPSY}

\section*{Renal and Ureteral Brush Biopsy}

Brush biopsy techniques provide specific information when abnormal x-ray findings of the ureter or renal pelvis raise questions about whether the defect is a tumor, a stone, a blood clot, or an artifact. First, a cystoscopic examination is conducted. Then, a ureteral catheter is introduced, followed by a biopsy brush that is passed through the catheter. The suspected lesion is brushed back and forth to obtain cells and surface tissue fragments for histologic analysis.

After the procedure, intravenous fluids may be administered to help clear the kidneys and prevent clot formation. Urine may contain blood (usually clearing in 24 to 48 hours) from oozing at the brushing site. Postoperative renal colic occasionally occurs and responds to analgesics.

\section*{Kidney Biopsy}

Biopsy of the kidney is used in diagnosing and evaluating the extent of kidney disease. Indications for biopsy include unexplained acute renal failure, persistent proteinuria or hematuria, transplant rejection, and glomerulopathies. A small section of renal cortex is
obtained either percutaneously (needle biopsy) or by open biopsy through a small flank incision. Before the biopsy is carried out, coagulation studies are conducted to identify any risk for postbiopsy bleeding. Contraindications to a kidney biopsy include bleeding tendencies, uncontrolled hypertension, and a solitary kidney.

\section*{PROCEDURE}

The patient may be placed on a fasting regimen 6 to 8 hours before the test. An intravenous line is established. A urine specimen is obtained and saved for comparison with the postbiopsy specimen.

If a needle biopsy is to be performed, the patient is instructed to breathe in and hold that breath (to prevent the kidney from moving) while the needle is being inserted. The sedated patient is placed in a prone position with a sandbag under the abdomen. The skin at the biopsy site is infiltrated with a local anesthetic. The biopsy needle is introduced just inside the renal capsule of the outer quadrant of the kidney. The location of the needle may be confirmed by fluoroscopy or by ultrasound, in which case a special probe is used.

With open biopsy, a small incision is made over the kidney, allowing direct visualization. Preparation for an open biopsy is similar to that for any major abdominal surgery (NIDDK, 2001b).

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

After the tissue specimen is obtained, pressure is applied to the biopsy site. The patient may be kept in a prone position immediately after biopsy and on bed rest for 6 to 8 hours to minimize the risk of bleeding.

Monitoring and Managing Potential Complications. Potential postbiopsy complications include persistent hematuria, fistula or aneurysm formation, or laceration of organs or blood vessels adjacent to the kidney. The nurse monitors the patient closely for hematuria, which may appear soon after biopsy. The kidney is a highly vascular organ, and about one fourth of the entire cardiac output circulates through it in about 1 minute. The passage of the biopsy needle punctures the kidney capsule, and bleeding can occur in the perirenal space. Usually the bleeding subsides on its own, but a large amount of blood can accumulate in this space in a short time without noticeable signs until cardiovascular collapse is evident.

Nursing interventions after a kidney biopsy include:
- Monitor vital signs every 5 to 15 minutes for the first hour to detect early signs of bleeding, and then with decreasing frequency as indicated.
- Be alert for signs and symptoms that suggest bleeding, including a rise or fall in blood pressure, tachycardia, anorexia, vomiting, and the development of a dull, aching discomfort in the abdomen.
- Immediately report any symptoms of backache, shoulder pain, or dysuria.

Flank pain may occur but usually represents bleeding into the muscle rather than around the kidney. Colicky pain similar to that of ureteral colic may develop when a clot is present in the ureter; there may be excruciating, sharp flank pain that radiates to the groin.

All urine that the patient voids is inspected for evidence of bleeding and compared with the prebiopsy specimen and subsequent voiding samples. If bleeding persists, as indicated by an enlarging hematoma, the abdomen should not be palpated or manipulated.

Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are obtained within 8 hours to assess for changes; decreasing levels may indicate bleeding. Usually, the fluid intake is maintained at $3,000 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day unless the patient has renal insufficiency. If bleeding occurs, the patient is prepared for blood component therapy and surgical intervention to control the hemorrhage; surgical drainage or, rarely, nephrectomy (removal of the kidney) may be needed.

Patient Teaching. Because hemorrhage can occur up to several days after the biopsy, the patient is instructed to avoid strenuous activities, sports, and heavy lifting for at least 2 weeks. The patient and family are instructed to notify the physician or clinic if any of the following occur: flank pain, hematuria, light-headedness and fainting, rapid pulse, or any other signs and symptoms of bleeding.

\section*{URODYNAMIC TESTS}

Urodynamic tests provide an accurate evaluation of voiding problems, thus assisting in diagnosis. Urodynamic studies are useful in evaluating changes in bladder filling and bladder emptying. Chart 43-4 outlines patient education for all basic urodynamic tests. The following urodynamic test procedures and measurements are the most common and are often performed simultaneously (Albaugh, 1999; Appell, 1999).

\section*{Uroflowmetry}

Uroflowmetry (flow rate) is the record of the volume of urine passing through the urethra per time unit (milliliters per second). The flow rate reflects the combined activity of the detrusor muscle and the bladder neck and the degree of relaxation of the urethral sphincter. Because this test depends on the amount voided, the patient is instructed to arrive for the test with a strong urge to void, but not have an overly full bladder (EMG). When urethral sphincter competency is being evaluated, uroflowmetry is combined with electromyographic measurement of the external urethral sphincter via surface wire or needle electrodes placed at the
level of the sphincter, on either side of the urethra. Uroflowmetry is often combined with cystometrography, in which case the bladder is filled as the intravesical pressure is being monitored before the voiding phase of the study.

\section*{Cystometrography}

A cystometrogram (CMG) is a graphic recording of the pressures in the bladder during bladder filling and emptying. It is the major diagnostic portion of urodynamic testing. During the test, the amount of fluid instilled into the bladder and the patient's sensations of bladder fullness and urge to void are recorded. These are then compared with the pressures measured in the bladder during bladder emptying. A urethral catheter is connected to a water manometer, and sterile solution of either normal saline or water is allowed to flow into the bladder, usually at the rate of $1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{sec}$. The patient informs the examiner when the first sensation of bladder filling is felt, when mild urgency is noted, and again when the bladder feels full. The degree of bladder filling at these points is recorded. The pressures above the zero level at the symphysis pubis are measured, and the pressures and volumes within the bladder are plotted and recorded. This test measures bladder sensation, compliance of the bladder wall during filling, and functional capacity. It also evaluates any phasic or sharp increases in bladder pressure, which may or may not be associated with incontinence of the infused fluid.

Throughout and at the end of bladder filling, the degree of abdominal pressure against the bladder, which could potentially cause leaking (stress incontinence), is measured. This measurement is referred to as the Valsalva leak-point pressure (VLPP). The terms VLPP and abdominal leak-point pressure can be used interchangeably.

While in a sitting or standing position, the patient is asked to cough or perform a Valsalva maneuver to assess whether urine leaks. Before this test is performed, it is important to determine if the patient is prone to vasovagal reactions and to alert the urodynamicist. A competent sphincter will not allow for any loss of

\section*{Chart 43-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION \\ Before and After Urodynamic Testing}

In preparing the patient for urodynamic testing, the nurse instructs the patient about how urodynamic procedures are performed, what is expected of the patient, and what sensations the patient can expect afterward. The nurse reassures the patient that staff will be present during the procedure, but privacy and comfort will be maintained. Additional information for the patient follows:
- An in-depth interview will be conducted. Questions related to your urologic symptoms and voiding habits will be asked by the staff.
- You will be asked to describe sensations felt during the procedure.
- During the procedure, you might be asked to change positions (for example, from supine to sitting or standing).
- You may be asked to cough or perform the Valsalva maneuver (bear down) during the procedure.
- You will probably need to have one or two urethral catheters inserted so that bladder pressure and bladder filling can be measured. Another catheter may be placed in the rectum or vagina to measure abdominal pressure.
- You may also have electrodes (surface, wire, or needle) placed in the perianal area for electromyography (EMG). This may be
uncomfortable initially during insertion and later during position changes.
- Your bladder will be filled through the urethral catheter one or more times during the procedure.
- After the procedure, you may experience urinary frequency, urgency, or dysuria from the urethral catheters. Avoid caffeinated, carbonated, and alcoholic beverages after the procedure because these can further irritate the bladder. These symptoms usually decrease or subside by the day after the procedure.
- You might notice a slight hematuria (blood-tinged urine) right after the procedure (especially in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia). Drinking fluids will help to clear the hematuria.
- If the urinary meatus is irritated, a warm sitz bath may be helpful.
- Be alert for signs of a urinary tract infection after the procedure. Contact your physician if you experience fever, chills, lower back pain, or continued dysuria and hematuria.
- If you receive an antibiotic medication before the procedure, you should continue taking the complete course of medication after the procedure. This is a measure to prevent infection.
urine, even with a full bladder and maneuvers such as a cough, laugh, or position change. When minimal weakness of the urethral sphincter causes a small amount of incontinence (currently considered leakage at or above a bladder pressure of 100 cm $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ), urethral hypermobility is the cause. When leakage occurs with a cough or the Valsalva maneuver at bladder pressures less than $100 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, intrinsic sphincter deficiency is believed to contribute to the incontinence. During the cystometrogram portion of the urodynamic study, if any urine leakage is noted when the patient coughs or performs a Valsalva maneuver, regardless of the amount of abdominal force that caused the leaking, a diagnosis of "genuine stress urinary incontinence" is made. The VLPP determines the severity of SUI.

\section*{Urinary Pressure Flow}

Urinary pressure flow is a study that is performed immediately after the filling phase of the CMG and simultaneously with the voiding CMG. Bladder pressure, urine flow, and sphincter electromyography are measured simultaneously. This allows for a detailed picture of voiding function.

\section*{Electromyography}

Electromyography (EMG) involves the placement of electrodes in the pelvic floor musculature or over the area of the anal sphincter to evaluate the neuromuscular function of the lower tract. It is usually performed simultaneously with the CMG.

\section*{Videofluorourodynamic Study}

The videofluorourodynamic study is considered the optimal urodynamic evaluation. This test combines a study of the filling and voiding phases of the CMG and the EMG with a simultaneous visualization of the lower urinary tract via a radiopaque filling agent in place of sterile water or saline. It allows for a complete and detailed assessment of the voiding dysfunction, which may be due in part to anatomic dysfunction.

\section*{Urethral Pressure Profile}

The urethral pressure profile measures the amount of urethral pressure along the length of the urethra needed to maintain continence. Gas or fluid is instilled through a catheter that is withdrawn while the pressures along the urethral wall are obtained.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Most patients undergoing urologic testing or imaging studies are apprehensive, even those who have had these tests in the past. Patients frequently feel discomfort and embarrassment about such a private and personal function as voiding. Voiding in the presence of others can frequently cause guarding, a natural reflex that inhibits voiding due to situational anxiety. Because the outcomes of these studies determine the plan of care, the nurse must help the patient relax by providing as much privacy and explanation about the procedure as possible.

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS}

Potential nursing diagnoses for the patient undergoing assessment of urinary or renal function include the following:
- Deficient knowledge about the procedures and diagnostic tests
- Acute pain related to renal infection, edema, obstruction, or bleeding along the urinary tract, or to invasive diagnostic procedures
- Fear related to possible diagnosis of serious illness, altered renal function, and embarrassment secondary to discussion of urinary function, and exposure and invasion of genitalia

\section*{PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION}

The goals, nursing interventions and rationale, and expected outcomes are discussed in greater detail in the Plan of Nursing Care. Patient and family education is essential to help the patient understand the purpose of the procedure and what to expect before, during, and after it. Pertinent home care considerations can be discussed at this time.

\section*{Promoting Home and Community-Based Care}

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

Many procedures and tests used to evaluate upper and lower urinary tract function are carried out in outpatient or short-procedure settings. Therefore, family members or other caregivers in the home may be called upon to provide postprocedural care. They need clear explanations about the procedures and tests, how to prepare for them, and what precautions, if any, need to be taken afterward. The patient and family members are provided with verbal and written explanations about monitoring that may be necessary at home and are instructed about steps to take if complications occur.

\section*{CONTINUING CARE}

Follow-up telephone calls made to the patient and family at home provide an opportunity for them to ask questions and to report on the patient's status. Teaching is reinforced, and the patient is reminded of the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with primary health care providers.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Following the removal of an indwelling catheter 2 days after a complete abdominal hysterectomy, your patient complains of abdominal pain. An abdominal examination confirms a distended bladder on visual observation, dullness to percussion over the suprapubic area, and pain with light palpation to this area. You confirm your suspicions of acute urine retention when a review of the urine output over the past 12 hours shows no output and the patient confirms that she has not voided since the catheter was removed. What should be your next course of action? Review the possible causes, and describe the actions you could take and the rationale for each action.
2. A 65 -year-old man with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes comes to the primary care clinic for his quarterly lab work and urinalysis. He states that he has been following the dietitian's recommendations for his diabetic diet. Results of a urinalysis demonstrate a protein level greater than $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and a glucose level greater than $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Explain the appropriate patient education in regard to these findings in relation to the management of his diabetes.

\title{
Management of Patients With Upper or Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Explain the different types of urinary incontinence and their causes.
2. Compare and contrast urinary retention and urinary incontinence in terms of their clinical manifestations, complications, and medical and nursing management.
3. Describe the sequence of events leading to urinary tract infection in a patient with an indwelling urinary catheter.
4. Outline the principles of management of a patient with an indwelling urinary catheter.
5. Compare and contrast hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in terms of underlying principles, procedures, complications, and nursing considerations.
6. Describe nursing management of the hospitalized dialysis patient.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of patients undergoing kidney surgery.

Patients with disorders of the upper or lower urinary tract often exhibit similar problems, regardless of the underlying disorder. This chapter provides an overview of common problems that these patients experience, such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances and dysfunctional voiding patterns. Interdisciplinary medical and surgical management strategies (eg, catheterization, dialysis, and surgery) for various urologic diseases and disorders are also discussed.

\section*{Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances in Renal Disorders}

Patients with renal disorders commonly experience fluid and electrolyte imbalances and require astute assessment and close monitoring for signs of potential problems. The fluid intake and output record, a key monitoring tool, is used to document important fluid parameters, including the amount of fluid taken in (orally or parenterally), the volume of urine excreted, and other fluid losses (diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis).

These records and changes in the patient's weight are essential for determining the daily fluid allowance and indicating signs of
fluid overload or deficit. The patient whose fluid intake exceeds the ability of the kidneys to excrete fluid is said to have a fluid overload. If fluid intake is inadequate, the patient is said to be vol-ume-depleted and may show signs and symptoms of fluid volume deficit.

INURSING ALERT The most accurate indicator of fluid loss or gain in an acutely ill patient is weight. An accurate daily weight must be obtained and recorded. A $1-\mathrm{kg}$ weight gain is equal to $1,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ of retained fluid.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of common fluid and electrolyte disturbances that can occur in patients with renal disease are listed in Table 44-1, as are general management strategies. The nurse should continually assess, monitor, and inform appropriate members of the health care team if the patient exhibits any of these signs. Management strategies for fluid and electrolyte disturbances in renal disease are discussed in greater depth later in this chapter (see also Chap. 14).

\section*{Dysfunctional Voiding Patterns}

Dysfunctional voiding presents in the form of urinary incontinence or urine retention. Urinary incontinence is the unplanned loss of urine that is sufficient to be considered a problem. Urinary continence relies on intact urinary, neurologic, and musculoskeletal systems. Continence is maintained via a complex communication system of suprasacral, sacral, and local nerve-mediated loops of information, all of which must be functioning efficiently and synergistically. Any break in these loops of communication (for example, an upper or lower neuron lesion, spinal stenosis, or bladder
outlet obstruction) can cause some degree of urinary dysfunction. Depending on the location of the insult, both incontinence and incomplete bladder emptying can occur. Anatomic integrity of the upper and lower urinary system must be intact; otherwise, urine extravasation into the peritoneal or perivesical cavity (as seen in acute trauma) or extraurethral incontinence (as seen in some forms of congenital malformations) will occur. Genitourinary fistula formation between the bladder wall and other areas, such as the vagina, will result in extraurethral incontinence. The etiology of dysfunctional voiding can be congenital or acquired in adulthood. Each is reviewed separately.

\section*{CONGENITAL VOIDING DYSFUNCTION}

Congenital anomalies usually result in voiding dysfunction early in life and are usually partially or completely surgically corrected. When voiding dysfunction occurs in adults, it may affect only the lower urinary system (eg, the bladder and urethra); when voiding dysfunction occurs in children, it commonly involves damage to the upper urinary system (ie, the ureters and kidneys) as well. Many congenital anomalies are discovered early in utero because of prenatal care measures such as ultrasound. The urinary system begins developing days after conception, and anomalies can be seen on a sonogram as early as 20 weeks. Depending on the anomaly, intrauterine surgery may be performed on the fetus. Because the urinary system may be only one of several organ systems that are abnormal due to genetic disorders, any defects not noted during gestation should be immediately apparent at birth. Such anomalies include renal agenesis (complete absence of one or both kidneys), ectopic ureter, and Eagle-Barrett syndrome (also
known as prune-belly syndrome), with exstrophy of the bladder. On the other hand, voiding dysfunction can be discovered insidiously (for example, during toilet training). At times congenital anomalies, such as posterior urethral valves, typically seen only in males, may escape detection until early adolescence or adulthood, when the voiding dysfunction or its sequelae cause the individual to seek a urologic evaluation. Although pediatric in nature, these disorders may affect urinary tract function when the patient becomes an adult.

\section*{ADULT VOIDING DYSFUNCTION}

Both neurogenic and non-neurogenic disorders can cause adult voiding dysfunction (Table 44-2). The micturition (voiding) process involves several highly coordinated neurologic responses that mediate bladder function. A functional urinary system allows for appropriate bladder filling and complete bladder emptying (see Chap. 43). If voiding dysfunction goes undetected and un-

treated, the upper urinary system may be compromised. Chronic incomplete bladder emptying from poor detrusor pressure results in recurrent bladder infection. Incomplete bladder emptying due to bladder outlet obstruction (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia), causing high-pressure detrusor contractions, can result in hydronephrosis from the high detrusor pressure that radiates up the ureters to the renal pelves.

\section*{URINARY INCONTINENCE}

More than 17 million adults in the United States are estimated to have urinary incontinence, with most of them experiencing overactive bladder syndrome, making this disorder more prevalent than diabetes or ulcer disease. Despite widespread media coverage, urinary incontinence remains underdiagnosed and underreported. Patients may be too embarrassed to seek help, causing them to ignore or conceal symptoms. Many patients resort to using absorbent pads or other devices without having their condition properly diagnosed and treated. Health care providers must be alert to subtle cues of urinary incontinence and stay informed about current management strategies.

The costs of care for patients with urinary incontinence are not limited to the dollars spent for absorbent products, medications, and surgical or nonsurgical treatment modalities. The psychosocial costs of urinary incontinence are also significant: embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, and social isolation are common outcomes. Urinary incontinence in elderly patients often decreases their ability to maintain an independent lifestyle. This increases dependence on caregivers and often leads to institutionalization.

Urinary incontinence affects people of all ages but is particularly common among the elderly. It has been reported that more than half of all nursing home residents have urinary incontinence. Although urinary incontinence is not a normal consequence of aging, age-related changes in the urinary tract predispose the older person to incontinence.

Although urinary incontinence is commonly regarded as a condition that occurs in older multiparous women, it is also common in young nulliparous women, especially during vigorous high-impact activity. Age, gender, and number of vaginal deliveries are established risk factors (Chart 44-1); they explain, in part, the increased incidence in women. Urinary incontinence is a symptom with many possible causes.

\section*{Risk Factors for Urinary Incontinence}

Pregnancy: vaginal delivery, episiotomy
Menopause
Genitourinary surgery
Pelvic muscle weakness
Incompetent urethra due to trauma or sphincter relaxation Immobility
High-impact exercise
Diabetes mellitus
Stroke
Age-related changes in the urinary tract
Morbid obesity
Cognitive disturbances: dementia, Parkinson's disease
Medications: diuretics, sedatives, hypnotics, opioids
Caregiver or toilet unavailable

\section*{Clinical Manifestations: Types of Incontinence}

Stress incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine through an intact urethra as a result of a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure (sneezing, coughing, or changing position). It predominately affects women who have had vaginal deliveries and is thought to be the result of decreasing ligament and pelvic floor support of the urethra and decreasing or absent estrogen levels within the urethral walls and bladder base. In men, stress incontinence is often experienced after a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer because of the loss of urethral compression that the prostate had supplied before the surgery, and possibly bladder wall irritability (Reilly, 2001; Sueppel et al., 2001) (see Nursing Research Profile 44-1).

Urge incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine associated with a strong urge to void that cannot be suppressed. The patient is aware of the need to void but is unable to reach a toilet in time. An uninhibited detrusor contraction is the precipitating factor. This can occur in a patient with neurologic dysfunction that impairs inhibition of bladder contraction or in a patient without overt neurologic dysfunction (Chancellor, 1999).

Reflex incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine due to hyperreflexia in the absence of normal sensations usually associated with voiding. This commonly occurs in patients with spinal cord injury because they have neither neurologically mediated motor control of the detrusor nor sensory awareness of the need to void.

Overflow incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine associated with overdistention of the bladder. Such overdistention results from the bladder's inability to empty normally, despite frequent urine loss. Both neurologic abnormalities (eg, spinal cord lesions) and factors that obstruct the outflow of urine (eg, tumors, strictures, and prostatic hyperplasia) can cause overflow incontinence (Reilly, 2001).

Functional incontinence refers to those instances in which lower urinary tract function is intact but other factors, such as severe cognitive impairment (eg, Alzheimer's dementia), make it difficult for the patient to identify the need to void or physical impairments make it difficult or impossible for the patient to reach the toilet in time for voiding.

Iatrogenic incontinence refers to the involuntary loss of urine due to extrinsic medical factors, predominantly medications. One such example is the use of alpha-adrenergic agents to lower blood pressure. In some individuals with an intact urinary system, these agents adversely affect the alpha receptors responsible for bladder neck closing pressure; the bladder neck relaxes to the point of incontinence with a minimal increase in intra-abdominal pressure, thus mimicking stress incontinence. As soon as the medication is discontinued, the apparent incontinence resolves (Reilly, 2001).

Some patients have several types of urinary incontinence. This mixed incontinence is usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence.

Only with appropriate recognition of the problem, assessment, and referral for diagnostic evaluation and treatment can the outcome of incontinence be determined. All people with incontinence should be considered for evaluation and treatment.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Once incontinence is recognized, a thorough history is necessary. This includes a detailed description of the problem and a history of medication use. The patient's voiding history, a diary of fluid intake and output, and bedside tests (ie, residual urine, stress maneuvers) may be used to help determine the type of urinary
incontinence involved. Extensive urodynamic tests may be performed; see Chapter 43. Urinalysis and urine culture are performed to identify hematuria (from infection, cancer, or a kidney stone), glycosuria (causes polyuria), pyuria, and bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine), all of which may identify transient causes of urinary incontinence.

Management depends on the type of urinary incontinence and its causes. Urinary incontinence may be transient or reversible (Chart 44-2), provided that the underlying cause is successfully treated and the voiding pattern reverts to normal. Management of urinary incontinence not considered transient or reversible falls into three categories: pharmacologic, surgical, and behavioral.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Many older individuals experience transient episodes of incontinence that tend to be abrupt in onset. When this occurs, the nurse should question the patient, as well as the family if possible, about the onset of symptoms and any signs or symptoms of a change in other organ systems.

Acute urinary tract infection, infection elsewhere in the body, constipation, decreased fluid intake, a change in a chronic disease pattern, such as elevated blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes or decreased estrogen levels in menopausal women, can provoke the onset of urinary incontinence. If the cause is identified and modified or eliminated early at the onset of incontinence, the incontinence itself may be eliminated. Although the older bladder is more vulnerable to unstable detrusor activity, age alone is not a risk factor for urinary incontinence (Suchinski et al., 1999).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of urinary incontinence depends on the underlying cause. Before appropriate treatment can be initiated, however, the problem and the cause must be identified.

\section*{BEHAVIORAL THERAPY}

Behavioral therapies are always the first choice to decrease or eliminate urinary incontinence. In using these techniques, clinicians help patients avoid potential adverse effects of pharmacologic or surgical interventions (AHCPR, 1996; Roberts, 2001) (Chart 44-3).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Pharmacologic therapy works best when used as an adjunct to behavioral interventions. Anticholinergic agents (oxybutynin

McCallum, T. J., Moore, K. N. \& Griffiths, D. (2001). Urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: Implications and urodynamics. Urologic Nursing, 21(2), 113-119.

\section*{Purpose}

Urinary incontinence is debilitating for some men after radical prostatectomy. Previous research shows that men with preoperative symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia are more likely to have persistent incontinence than men without preoperative symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate urine loss, quality of life, and urodynamic findings in men with persistent urinary incontinence 12 months after radical prostatectomy.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

One hundred eighty men from a previous study on quality of life (QOL) and treatment for post-prostatectomy incontinence were asked to participate. Sixty-three men who were still incontinent participated in the study and were asked to complete a 24-hour pad test, a frequency/volume chart, and a QOL questionnaire at $2,3,6$, and 8 months after radical prostatectomy. Persistent incontinence was defined as more than 10 g of urine loss on a 24 -hour pad test at 8 months after surgery. Of the original 63 men, 21 were identified as still being incontinent. A second researcher then contacted these men for enrollment for video urodynamic testing. Sixteen of the 21 agreed to participate and underwent video urodynamic testing.

\section*{Findings}

Four of the 16 men in the final sample reported preoperative urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia. These 4 as well as 3 others (7), demonstrated objective evidence of overactive bladder (detrusor instability) on urodymanics. Four of these 7 had demonstrable stress incontinence as well (mixed incontinence). One other study participant demonstrated stress incontinence without associated detrusor instability. Although the retrospective nature of the questionnaire is a limitation of the study, the findings suggest that preoperative symptoms may be a risk factor for postoperative incontinence.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Men who have postoperative symptoms of stress incontinence may well have unrecognized detrusor dysfunction that, if recognized, could be treated, although symptoms of stress incontinence may persist. Preoperative identification of men with detrusor dysfunction could result in an altered postoperative plan of care to increase the overall level of continence and improved quality of life.
[Ditropan], dicyclomine [Antispas]) inhibit bladder contraction and are considered first-line medications for urge incontinence. Several tricyclic antidepressant medications (imipramine, doxepin, desipramine, and nortriptyline) also decrease bladder contractions as well as increase bladder neck resistance. Stress incontinence may be treated using pseudoephedrine (eg, Sudafed). Estrogen (taken orally, transdermally, or topically) has been shown to be beneficial for all types of urinary incontinence. Estrogen decreases obstruction to urine flow by restoring the mucosal, vascular, and muscular integrity of the urethra.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly individuals may experience cognitive decline when taking short-acting anticholinergic medications. The long-acting forms of anticholinergic medications such as oxybutynin (Ditropan XL)

\section*{Behavioral Interventions for Urinary Incontinence}

Behavioral strategies are largely carried out, coordinated, and monitored by the nurse. These interventions may or may not be augmented by the use of medications.

\section*{Fluid Management}

One of the most common approaches is fluid management because adequate daily fluid intake of approximately 50 to 60 ounces ( 1,500 to $1,600 \mathrm{~mL}$ ), taken as small increments between breakfast and the evening meal, helps to reduce urinary urgency related to concentrated urine production, decreases the risk of urinary tract infection, and maintains bowel functioning.

Constipation, resulting from inadequate daily fluid intake, can increase urinary urgency and/or urine retention. The best fluid is water. Fluids containing caffeine, carbonation, alcohol, or artificial sweetener should be avoided because they irritate the bladder wall, thus resulting in urinary urgency. Some individuals who have coexisting medical diagnoses, such as heart failure or end-stage renal disease, need to discuss their daily fluid limit with their primary health care provider.

\section*{Standardized Voiding Frequency}

After establishing a patient's natural voiding and urinary incontinence tendencies, voiding on a schedule can be very effective in both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired patients, although cognitively impaired patients require assistance with this technique from nursing personnel or family members. The object is to purposely empty the bladder before the bladder reaches the critical volume that would cause an urge or stress incontinence episode. This approach involves the following:
- Timed voiding involves establishing a set voiding frequency (such as every 2 hours if incontinent episodes tend to occur 2 or more hours after voiding). The individual chooses to "void by the clock" at the given interval while awake, rather than wait until a voiding urge occurs.
- Prompted voiding is timed voiding that is carried out by staff or family members when the individual has cognitive difficulties that make it difficult to remember to void at set intervals. The caregiver checks the patient to assess if he or she has remained dry and, if so, assists the patient to use the bathroom while providing positive reinforcement for remaining dry.
- Habit retraining is timed voiding at an interval that is more frequent than the individual would usually choose. This technique helps to restore the sensation of the need to void in individuals who are experiencing diminished sensation of bladder filling due to various medical conditions such as a mild cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
- Bladder retraining, also known as "bladder drill," incorporates a timed voiding schedule and urinary urge inhibition exercises to inhibit voiding, or leaking urine, in an attempt to remain dry for a set time. When the first timing interval is easily reached on a consistent basis without urinary urgency or in-
continence, a new voiding interval, usually 10 to 15 minutes beyond the last, is established. Again, the individual practices urge inhibition exercises to delay voiding or avoid incontinence until the next preset interval arrives. When an acceptable voiding interval is reached, the patient continues that timed voiding sequence throughout the day.

\section*{Pelvic Muscle Exercise (PME)}

Also known as Kegel exercises, PME aims to strengthen the voluntary muscles that assist in bladder and bowel continence in both men and women. Research shows that written and/or verbal instruction alone is usually inadequate to teach an individual how to identify and strengthen the pelvic floor for sufficient bladder and bowel control (Sueppel, et al, 2001; Joseph \& Chang, 2000). Biofeedback-assisted PME uses either electromyography or manonetry to help the individual identify the pelvic muscles as he or she attempts to learn which muscle group is involved when performing PME. The biofeedback method also allows assessment of the strength of this muscle area while the exercise is taking place (AHCPR, 1996).

PME involves gently tightening the same muscles used to stop flatus or the stream of urine for 5 - to 10 -second increments, followed by 10 -second resting phases. To be effective, these exercises need to be performed 2 or 3 times a day for at least 6 weeks. Depending on the strength of the pelvic musculature when initially evaluated, anywhere from 10 to 30 repetitions of PME are prescribed at each session. Elderly patients may need to exercise for an even longer time to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic muscle exercises are helpful for women with stress, urge, or mixed incontinence and for men who have undergone prostate surgery.

\section*{Vaginal Cone Retention Exercises}

Vaginal cone retention exercises are an adjunct to the Kegel exercises. Vaginal cones of varying weight are inserted intravaginally twice a day. The patient tries to retain the cone for 15 minutes by contracting the pelvic muscles.

\section*{Transvaginal or Transrectal Electrical Stimulation}

Commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, electrical stimulation is known to elicit a passive contraction of the pelvic floor musculature, thus re-educating these muscles to provide enhanced levels of continence. This modality is often used with biofeedback-assisted pelvic muscle exercise training and voiding schedules. At high frequencies, it is effective for stress incontinence. At low frequencies, electrical stimulation can also relieve symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. Intermediate ranges are used for mixed incontinence (AHCPR, 1996; Bernier \& Davila, 2000).

\section*{Neuromodulation}

Neuromodulation via transvaginal or transrectal nerve stimulation of the pelvic floor inhibits detrusor overactivity and hypersensory bladder signals and strengthens weak sphincter muscles.
and tolterodine (Detrol LA) have a significantly lower incidence of adverse effects in all populations, including the elderly (Roberts, 2001).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical correction may be indicated in patients who have not achieved continence using behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. Surgical options vary according to the underlying anatomy and the physiologic problem. Most procedures involve lifting and stabilizing the bladder or urethra to restore the normal urethrovesical angle or to lengthen the urethra.

Women with stress incontinence may have an anterior vaginal repair, retropubic suspension, or needle suspension to reposi-
tion the urethra. Procedures to compress the urethra and increase resistance to urine flow include sling procedures and placement of periurethral bulking agents such as artificial collagen.

Periurethral bulking is a semipermanent procedure in which small amounts of artificial collagen are placed within the walls of the urethra to enhance the closing pressure of the urethra. This procedure takes only 10 to 20 minutes and may be performed under local anesthesia or moderate sedation. A cystoscope is inserted into the urethra. An instrument is inserted through the cystoscope to deliver a small amount of collagen into the urethral wall at locations selected by the urologist. The patient is usually discharged home after voiding. There are no restrictions following the procedure, although occasionally more than one collagen
bulking session may be necessary if the initial procedure did not halt the stress urinary incontinence. Collagen placement anywhere in the body is considered semipermanent because its durability averages between 12 and 24 months, until the body absorbs the material. Periurethral bulking with collagen offers an alternative to surgery, as in a frail, elderly individual. It is also an option for individuals who are seeking help with stress urinary incontinence who prefer to avoid surgery and who do not have access to biofeedback and electrical stimulation.

A modified artificial sphincter that uses a silicone-rubber balloon as a self-regulating pressure mechanism can be used to close the urethra. Electronic stimulation of the pelvic floor by means of a miniature pulse generator with electrodes mounted on an intra-anal plug is another method of controlling stress incontinence.

Men with overflow and stress incontinence may undergo a transurethral resection to relieve symptoms of prostatic enlargement. An artificial sphincter can be used after prostatic surgery for sphincter incompetence (Fig. 44-1). After surgery, periurethral bulking agents can be injected into the periurethral area to increase compression of the urethra.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing management is based on the premise that incontinence is not inevitable with illness or aging and that it is often reversible and treatable. The nursing interventions are determined in part by the type of treatment that is undertaken. For behavioral therapy to be effective, the nurse must provide support and encouragement, because it is easy for the patient to become discouraged if therapy does not quickly improve the level of continence. Patient teaching regarding the bladder program is important and should be provided verbally and in writing (Chart 44-4). The patient is assisted to develop and use a log or diary to record timing of Kegel exercises, changes in bladder function with treatment, and episodes of incontinence.

If pharmacologic treatment is used, its purpose is explained to the patient and family. If surgical correction is undertaken, the procedure and its desired outcomes are described to the patient and family. Follow-up contact with the patient enables the nurse to answer the patient's questions and to provide reinforcement and encouragement. Patients who have mixed incontinence (both stress and urge incontinence) need to understand that anti-

Review the following recommendations with patients who are coping with urinary incontinence:
- Increase your awareness of the amount and timing of all fluid intake.
- Avoid taking diuretics after 4 PM.
- Avoid bladder irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, and aspartame (NutraSweet).
- Take steps to avoid constipation: drink adequate fluids, eat a well-balanced diet high in fiber, exercise regularly, and take stool softeners if recommended.
- Void regularly, 5 to 8 times a day (about every 2 to 3 hours):

First thing in the morning
Before each meal
Before retiring to bed
Once during night if necessary
- Perform all pelvic floor muscle exercises as prescribed, every day.
- Stop smoking (smokers usually cough frequently, which increases incontinence).
cholinergic and antispasmodic agents can help decrease urinary urgency and frequency and urge incontinence, but they do not decrease the urinary incontinence related to stress incontinence.

\section*{URINARY RETENTION}

Urinary retention is the inability to empty the bladder completely during attempts to void. Chronic urine retention often leads to overflow incontinence (from the pressure of the retained urine in the bladder). Residual urine is urine that remains in the bladder after voiding. In a healthy adult younger than age 60 , complete bladder emptying should occur with each voiding. In adults older than age 60,50 to 100 mL of residual urine may remain after each void because of the decreased contractility of the detrusor muscle.

Urinary retention can occur postoperatively in any patient, particularly if the surgery affected the perineal or anal regions and resulted in reflex spasm of the sphincters. General anesthesia reduces bladder muscle innervation and suppresses the urge to void, impeding bladder emptying (Gray, 2000a, 2000b).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Urinary retention may result from diabetes, prostatic enlargement, urethral pathology (infection, tumor, calculus), trauma (pelvic injuries), pregnancy, or neurologic disorders such as cerebrovascular accident, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease.

Some medications cause urinary retention, either by inhibiting bladder contractility or by increasing bladder outlet resistance. Medications that cause retention by inhibiting bladder contractility include anticholinergic agents (atropine sulfate, dicyclomine hydrochloride [Antispas, Bentyl]), antispasmodic agents (oxybutynin chloride [Ditropan], belladonna, and opioid suppositories), and tricyclic antidepressant medications (imipramine [Tofranil], doxepin [Sinequan]). Medications that cause urine retention by increasing bladder outlet resistance include alpha-adrenergic agents (ephedrine sulfate, pseudoephedrine), beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol), and estrogens.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The assessment of a patient for urinary retention is multifaceted because the signs and symptoms may be easily overlooked. The following questions serve as a guide in assessment:
- What was the time of the last voiding, and how much urine was excreted?
- Is the patient voiding small amounts of urine frequently?
- Is the patient dribbling urine?
- Does the patient complain of pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen? (Discomfort may be relatively mild if the bladder distends slowly.)
- Is the pelvic area rounded and swollen (could indicate urine retention and a distended bladder)?
- Does percussion of the suprapubic region elicit dullness (possibly indicating urine retention and a distended bladder)?
- Are other indicators of urinary retention present, such as restlessness and agitation?
- Does a postvoid bladder ultrasound test reveal residual urine?

The patient may verbalize an awareness of bladder fullness and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. The nurse also assesses the patient for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection, such as hematuria and dysuria. A series of urodynamic studies, described in Chapter 43, may be performed to identify the type of bladder dysfunction and to aid in determining appropriate treatment. The patient may complete a voiding diary to provide a written record of the amount of urine voided and the frequency of voiding.

Postvoid residual urine can be measured accurately without the need for postvoid straight catheterization using a portable ultrasound bladder scanner (see Nursing Research Profile 44-2). The scanner is operated by gently pressing a wand-like scan head that detects fluid over the bladder. If the scanner detects more than 100 mL of urine after a patient voids, a postvoid catheterization should be performed to reduce the risks of urinary tract infection and bladder overdistention (Phillips, 2000; Schott-Baer \& Reaume, 2001).

\section*{Complications}

Urine retention can lead to chronic infection. Infections that are unresolved predispose the patient to calculi, pyelonephritis, and sepsis. The kidney may also eventually deteriorate if large volumes of urine are retained, causing backward pressure on the upper urinary tract. In addition, urine leakage can lead to perineal skin breakdown, especially if regular hygiene measures are neglected.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Management strategies are instituted to prevent overdistention of the bladder and to treat infection or correct obstruction. Many problems, however, can be prevented with careful nursing assessment and appropriate nursing interventions. The nurse should explain why normal voiding is not occurring and should monitor urine output closely. The nurse should also provide reassurance about the temporary nature of retention and successful management strategies.

\section*{PROMOTING NORMAL URINARY ELIMINATION}

Nursing measures to encourage voiding include providing privacy, ensuring an environment and a position conducive to void-

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 44-2 \\ Ultrasound as a Predictor of Postroid Residual Volume}

Schott-Baer, F. D., \& Reaume, L. (2001). Accuracy of ultrasound estimates of urine volume. Urologic Nursing, 21(3), 193-195.

\section*{Purpose}

UTIs following catheterization are the leading cause of infection in hospitalized patients and can lead to sepsis in this population. Therefore, it is important to avoid catheterization when possible while ensuring adequate emptying of the bladder. The purpose of this study was to compare urine volumes obtained with ultrasound bladder scanning to actual bladder volumes obtained from intermittent catheterization.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Forty-eight patients on general surgery and rehabilitation units were included in the sample. The bladder scanner used for this study was the Diagnostic Ultrasound Corporation BVI 2500, a portable, battery-operated ultrasonic device intended for the noninvasive measurement of bladder volume. Subjects included all patients on whom a postvoid catheterization measurement was ordered by their physician, following the removal of an indwelling catheter. Each patient's actual catheterized volume provided the comparison data. The catheterization was performed immediately after the bladder scan was completed.

\section*{Findings}

Mean bladder ultrasound volumes and urinary catheterization volumes were essentially equal. Only $10 \%$ of the sample had scan volumes that differed by more than 100 mL from the actual volume.

\section*{Implications}

The results of this study demonstrate that bladder ultrasound volume is a relatively accurate prediction of actual postvoid residual volume. This technology is an acceptable alternative to postvoid catheterization for determining residual volume and avoids the risks of infection associated with catheterization procedures. Use of ultrasound bladder scanning may increase patient comfort, decrease length of stay, decrease nursing time, and decrease the incidence of nosocomial infections associated with catheterization.
ing, and assisting the patient with the use of the bathroom or commode, rather than a bedpan, to provide a more natural setting for voiding. The male patient may stand beside the bed while using the urinal; most men find this position more comfortable and natural.

Additional measures include applying warmth to relax the sphincters (ie, sitz baths, warm compresses to the perineum, showers), giving the patient hot tea, and offering encouragement and reassurance. Simple trigger techniques, such as turning on the water faucet while the patient is trying to void, may also be used. Other examples of trigger techniques are stroking the abdomen or inner thighs, tapping above the pubic area, and dipping the patient's hands in warm water. A combination of techniques may be necessary to initiate voiding.

After surgery, the prescribed analgesic should be administered because pain in the incisional area can make voiding difficult.

\section*{PROMOTING URINARY ELIMINATION}

When the patient cannot void, catheterization is used to prevent overdistention of the bladder (see later discussion of neurogenic bladder and catheterization). In the case of prostatic obstruction, attempts at catheterization (by the urologist) may not be successful,
requiring insertion of a suprapubic catheter. After urinary drainage is restored, bladder retraining is initiated for the patient who cannot void spontaneously.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Modifying the home environment is a simple and effective way to treat urinary incontinence. In adapting the home environment to provide easy, safe access to the bathroom, the patient may need to remove barriers, such as throw rugs or other objects, from the route. Other modifications that the nurse may recommend include installing support bars in the bathroom and placing a bedpan or urinal within easy reach. Leaving a light on in the bedroom and bathroom and wearing clothing that is easy to remove when using the toilet are other recommendations (see Chart 44-4).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

If nurses and other health care providers accept incontinence as an inevitable part of illness or aging or consider it irreversible and untreatable at any age, it cannot be treated successfully. Collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts are essential in assessing and effectively treating urinary incontinence.

\section*{NEUROGENIC BLADDER}

Neurogenic bladder is a dysfunction that results from a lesion of the nervous system. It may be caused by spinal cord injury, spinal tumor, herniated vertebral disk, multiple sclerosis, congenital anomalies (spina bifida or myelomeningocele), infection, or diabetes mellitus.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The two types of neurogenic bladder are spastic (or reflex) bladder and flaccid bladder. Spastic bladder is the more common type and is caused by any spinal cord lesion above the voiding reflex arc (upper motor neuron lesion). The result is a loss of conscious sensation and cerebral motor control. A spastic bladder empties on reflex, with minimal or no controlling influence to regulate its activity.

Flaccid bladder is caused by a lower motor neuron lesion, commonly resulting from trauma. This form of neurogenic bladder has increasingly been recognized as a problem in patients with diabetes mellitus. The bladder continues to fill and becomes greatly distended, and overflow incontinence occurs. The bladder muscle does not contract forcefully at any time. Because sensory loss may accompany a flaccid bladder, the patient feels no discomfort.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Evaluation for neurogenic bladder involves measurement of fluid intake, urine output, and residual urine volume; urinalysis; and assessment of sensory awareness of bladder fullness and degree of motor control. Comprehensive urodynamic studies are also performed.

\section*{Complications}

The most common complication of neurogenic bladder is infection resulting from urinary stasis and catheterization. Urolithiasis (stones in the urinary tract) may develop from urinary stasis, infection, or demineralization of bone from prolonged immobi-
lization. Renal failure can also occur from vesicoureteral reflux (backward flow of retained urine from the bladder into the ureters) with eventual hydronephrosis (dilation of the pelvis of the kidney resulting from obstruction to the flow of urine) and atrophy of the kidney. Indeed, renal failure is the major cause of death of patients with neurologic impairment of the bladder.

\section*{Medical Management}

The problems resulting from neurogenic bladder disorders vary considerably from patient to patient and are a major challenge to the health care team. There are several long-term objectives appropriate for all types of neurogenic bladders:
- Preventing overdistention of the bladder
- Emptying the bladder regularly and completely
- Maintaining urine sterility with no stone formation
- Maintaining adequate bladder capacity with no reflux

Specific interventions include continuous, intermittent, or self-catheterization (discussed later in this chapter), use of an external condom-type catheter, a diet low in calcium (to prevent calculi), and encouragement of mobility and ambulation. A liberal fluid intake is encouraged to reduce the urinary bacterial count, reduce stasis, decrease the concentration of calcium in the urine, and minimize the precipitation of urinary crystals and subsequent stone formation.

To further enhance bladder emptying of a flaccid bladder, the individual may try "double voiding." After each voiding, the individual remains on the toilet, relaxes for 1 to 2 minutes, and then attempts to void again in an effort to further empty the bladder. This can be effective in patients with disorders characterized by neurogenic bladder (eg, multiple sclerosis) (Halper, 1998).

Use of timed, or habit, voiding is also considered. For example, a 2 -hour voiding schedule may be established to prevent overdistention. A bladder retraining program may be effective in treating a spastic bladder or urine retention (Davies et al., 2000; Joseph, 1999).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Parasympathomimetic medications, such as bethanechol (Urecholine), may help to increase the contraction of the detrusor muscle.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In some cases, surgery may be carried out to correct bladder neck contractures or vesicoureteral reflux or to perform some type of urinary diversion procedure.

\section*{CATHETERIZATION}

In patients with a urologic disorder or with marginal kidney function, care must be taken to ensure that urinary drainage is adequate and that kidney function is preserved. When urine cannot be eliminated naturally and must be drained artificially, catheters may be inserted directly into the bladder, the ureter, or the renal pelvis. Catheters vary in size, shape, length, material, and configuration. The type of catheter used depends on its purpose.

NURSING ALERT Latex catheters and drainage systems must not be used with patients who have known or possible latex allergy.

Catheterization is performed to achieve the following:
- Relieve urinary tract obstruction
- Assist with postoperative drainage in urologic and other surgeries
- Provide a means to monitor accurate urine output in critically ill patients
- Promote urinary drainage in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction or urine retention
- Prevent urinary leakage in patients with stage III to IV pressure ulcers

A patient should be catheterized only if necessary because catheterization commonly leads to urinary tract infection. In addition, urinary catheters have been associated with other complications, such as bladder spasms, urethral strictures, and pressure necrosis.

Indwelling Devices and Infections. When an indwelling catheter cannot be avoided, a closed drainage system is essential. This drainage system is designed to prevent any disconnections, thereby reducing the risk of contamination. One common system consists of an indwelling catheter, a connecting tube, and a collecting bag with an antireflux chamber emptied by a drainage spout. Another common system has a triple-lumen indwelling urethral catheter attached to a closed sterile drainage system. With the triple-lumen catheter, urinary drainage occurs through one channel. The retention balloon of the catheter is inflated with water or air through the second channel, and the bladder is continuously irrigated with sterile irrigating solution through the third channel. Triple-lumen catheters are commonly used after transurethral prostate surgery.

An indwelling catheter can lead to infection. Bacterial colonization (bacteriuria) occurs within 2 weeks in half of catheterized patients and within 4 to 6 weeks in almost all patients after insertion of a catheter-even if recommendations for infection control and catheter care are followed carefully.

Urinary tract infections are the most commonly occurring nosocomial infections, accounting for $40 \%$ of them. Every year, about 1 million patients in acute-care hospitals develop nosocomial urinary tract infections, and about $80 \%$ of these are associated with the use of indwelling urinary catheters (Phillips, 2000). Most urinary tract infections follow instrumentation of the urinary tract, usually catheterization. The pathogens responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infections include Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Candida species. Many of these organisms are part of the patient's endogenous or normal bowel flora or are acquired through cross-contamination by patients or health care personnel or through exposure to nonsterile equipment.

Catheters impede most of the natural defenses of the lower urinary tract by obstructing the periurethral ducts, irritating the bladder mucosa, and providing an artificial route for organisms to enter the bladder. Organisms may be introduced from the urethra into the bladder during catheterization, or they may migrate along the epithelial surface of the urethra or external surface of the catheter.

The spout of the urinary drainage bag can become contaminated when opened to drain the bag. Bacteria enter the urinary drainage bag, multiply rapidly, and then migrate to the drainage tubing, catheter, and bladder. Scanning electron microscopy has demonstrated that thick layers (biofilms) of organisms often colonize the internal surfaces of catheters and drainage systems (Doyle et al., 2001; Godfrey \& Evans, 2000; Phillips, 2000).

Suprapubic Catheterization. Suprapubic catheterization allows bladder drainage by inserting a catheter or tube into the bladder through a suprapubic (above the pubis) incision or puncture (Fig. 44-2). It may be a temporary measure to divert the flow of

\begin{figure}

\caption{EIGURE 44-2 Suprapubic bladder drainage. A trocar cannula is used to puncture the abdominal and bladder walls.

\end{figure}
urine from the urethra when the urethral route is impassable (because of injuries, strictures, prostatic obstruction), after gynecologic or other abdominal surgery when bladder dysfunction is likely to occur, and occasionally after pelvic fractures. Suprapubic catheters may also be used on a long-term basis for women with urethral destruction secondary to long-term indwelling urethral catheters (Addison, 1999a, 1999b).

For insertion of the suprapubic catheter, the patient is placed in a supine position and the bladder distended by administering oral or intravenous fluids or by instilling sterile saline solution into the bladder through a urethral catheter. These measures make it easier to locate the bladder. The suprapubic area is prepared as for surgery and the puncture site located about $5 \mathrm{~cm}(2 \mathrm{in})$ above the symphysis pubis. The bladder is entered through an incision or through a puncture made by a small trocar (pointed instrument). The catheter or suprapubic drainage tube is threaded into the bladder and secured with sutures or tape; the area around the catheter is covered with a sterile dressing. The catheter is connected to a sterile closed drainage system, and the tubing is secured to prevent tension on the catheter.

Suprapubic bladder drainage may be maintained continuously for several weeks. When the patient's ability to void is to be tested, the catheter is clamped for 4 hours, during which time the patient attempts to void. After the patient voids, the catheter is unclamped, and the residual urine (the amount of urine remaining) is measured. If the amount of residual urine is less than 100 mL on two separate occasions (morning and evening), the catheter is usually removed. If the patient complains of pain or discomfort, however, the suprapubic catheter is usually left in place until the patient can void successfully. When a suprapubic catheter remains in place indefinitely, it is changed regularly at 6 - to 12 -week intervals (Gujral et al., 1999).

Suprapubic drainage offers certain advantages. Patients can usually void sooner after surgery than those with urethral catheters, and they may be more comfortable. The catheter allows greater mobility, permits measurement of residual urine without urethral instrumentation, and presents less risk of bladder infection. The suprapubic catheter is removed when it is no longer necessary, and a sterile dressing is placed over the site.

The patient requires liberal amounts of fluid to prevent encrustation around the catheter. Other potential problems include the formation of bladder stones, acute and chronic infections, and problems collecting urine. An enterostomal therapist may be consulted to assist the patient and family in selecting the most suitable urine collection system and to teach them about its use and care.

\section*{Nursing Management During Catheterization}

\section*{ASSESSING THE PATIENT AND THE SYSTEM}

For patients with indwelling catheters, the nurse assesses the drainage system to ensure that it provides adequate urinary drainage. The color, odor, and volume of urine are also monitored. An accurate record of fluid intake and urine output provides essential information about the adequacy of renal function and urinary drainage.

The nurse observes the catheter to make sure that it is properly anchored, to prevent pressure on the urethra at the penoscrotal junction in male patients, and to prevent tension and traction on the bladder in both male and female patients.

Patients at high risk for urinary tract infection from catheterization need to be identified and monitored carefully. These include women, older adults, and patients who are debilitated, malnourished, chronically ill, immunosuppressed, or diabetic. They are observed for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection: cloudy malodorous urine, hematuria, fever, chills, anorexia, and malaise. The area around the urethral orifice is observed for drainage and excoriation. Urine cultures provide the most accurate means of assessing a patient for infection.

Bladder ultrasonography can be used for noninvasive measurement of bladder volume. A portable bladder scan can be performed to assess the volume of urine in the bladder, the degree of bladder emptying, and therefore the need for catheterization (Phillips, 2000; Schott-Baer \& Reaume, 2001).

\section*{ASSESSING FOR AGE-RELATED COMPLICATIONS}

Elderly patients with an indwelling catheter may not exhibit the typical signs and symptoms of infection. Therefore, any subtle change in physical condition or mental status must be considered a possible indication of infection and promptly investigated because sepsis may occur before the infection is diagnosed. Figure 44-3 summarizes the sequence of events leading to infection and leakage of urine that often follow long-term use of an indwelling catheter in elderly patients.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Certain principles of care are essential to prevent infection in patients with a closed urinary drainage system (Chart 44-5). The catheter is a foreign body in the urethra and produces a reaction in the urethral mucosa with some urethral discharge. Vigorous cleaning of the meatus while the catheter is in place is discouraged, however, because the cleaning action can move the catheter to and fro, increasing the risk of infection. To remove obvious encrustations from the external catheter surface, the area can be washed gently with soap during the daily bath. The catheter is anchored as securely as possible to prevent it from moving in the
urethra. Encrustations arising from urinary salts may serve as a nucleus for stone formation; however, using silicone catheters results in significantly less crust formation.

A liberal fluid intake, within the limits of the patient's cardiac and renal reserve, and an increased urine output must be ensured to flush the catheter and to dilute urinary substances that might form encrustations.

NURSING ALERT Hand hygiene is essential when moving from one patient to another to provide care and before and after handling any part of the catheter or drainage system.

Urine cultures are obtained as prescribed or indicated in monitoring the patient for infection; many catheters have an aspiration (puncture) port from which a specimen can be obtained.

Controversy exists about the usefulness of taking cultures and treating bacteriuria in patients who have symptoms of infection and who have indwelling catheters. Bacteriuria is considered to be inevitable, and overtreatment may lead to resistant strains of bacteria (Suchinski et al., 1999).

\section*{MINIMIZING TRAUMA}

Trauma to the urethra can be minimized by:
- Using an appropriate-sized catheter
- Lubricating the catheter adequately with a water-soluble lubricant during insertion
- Inserting the catheter far enough into the bladder to prevent trauma to the urethral tissues when the retention balloon of the catheter is inflated

Manipulation of the catheter is the most common cause of trauma to the bladder mucosa in the catheterized patient. Infection then inevitably occurs when urine invades the damaged mucosa.

The catheter is secured properly to prevent it from moving, causing traction on the urethra, or being unintentionally removed, and care is taken to ensure that the catheter position permits leg movement. In male patients, the drainage tube (not the catheter) is taped laterally to the thigh to prevent pressure on the urethra at the penoscrotal junction, which can eventually lead to formation of a urethrocutaneous fistula. In female patients, the drainage tubing attached to the catheter is taped to the thigh to prevent tension and traction on the bladder.

Care is taken to ensure that any patient who is confused does not remove the catheter with the retention balloon still inflated. This could cause bleeding and considerable injury to the urethra (Phillips, 2000).

\section*{RETRAINING THE BLADDER}

When an indwelling urinary catheter is in place, the detrusor muscle does not actively contract the bladder wall to stimulate emptying, because urine is continuously draining from the bladder. As a result, the detrusor may not immediately respond to bladder filling when the catheter is removed, resulting in either urine retention or urinary incontinence. This condition, known as postcatheterization detrusor instability, can be managed with bladder retraining (Chart 44-6).

Immediately after the indwelling catheter is removed, the patient is placed on a timed voiding schedule, usually every 2 to 3 hours. At the given time interval, the patient is instructed to void. The bladder is then scanned using a portable ultrasonic bladder scanner. If 100 mL or more of urine remains in the bladder, straight catheterization may be performed for complete bladder

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

\end{figure}
- Use scrupulous aseptic technique during insertion of the catheter. Use a preassembled, sterile, closed urinary drainage system.
- To prevent contamination of the closed system, never disconnect the tubing. The drainage bag must never touch the floor. The bag and collecting tubing are changed if contamination occurs, if urine flow becomes obstructed, or if tubing junctions start to leak at the connections.
- If the collection bag must be raised above the level of the patient's bladder, clamp the drainage tube. This prevents backflow of contaminated urine into the patient's bladder from the bag.
- Ensure a free flow of urine to prevent infection. Improper drainage occurs when the tubing is kinked or twisted, allowing pools of urine to collect in the tubing loops.
- To reduce the risk of bacterial proliferation, empty the collection bag at least every 8 hours through the drainage spout-more frequently if there is a large volume of urine.
- Avoid contamination of the drainage spout. A receptacle in which to empty the bag is provided for each patient.
- Never irrigate the catheter routinely. If the patient is prone to obstruction from clots or large amounts of sediment, use a threeway system with continuous irrigation.
- Never disconnect the tubing to obtain urine samples, to irrigate the catheter, or to ambulate or transport the patient.
- Never leave the catheter in place longer than is necessary.
- Avoid routine catheter changes. The catheter is changed only to correct problems such as leakage, blockage, or encrustations.
- Avoid unnecessary handling or manipulation of the catheter by the patient or staff.
- Carry out hand hygiene before and after handling the catheter, tubing, or drainage bag.
- Wash the perineal area with soap and water at least twice a day; avoid a to-and-fro motion of the catheter. Dry the area well, but avoid applying powder because it may irritate the perineum.
- Monitor the patient's voiding when the catheter is removed. The patient must void within 8 hours; if unable to void, the patient may require catheterization with a straight catheter.
- Obtain a urine specimen for culture at the first sign of infection.
emptying. After a few days, as the nerve endings in the bladder wall become aware of bladder filling and emptying, bladder function usually returns to normal. If the individual has had an indwelling catheter in place for an extended period, bladder retraining will take much longer; in some cases, function may never return to normal. If this occurs, long-term intermittent catheterization may become necessary (Phillips, 2000).

\section*{ASSISTING WITH INTERMITTENT SELF-CATHETERIZATION}

Intermittent self-catheterization provides periodic drainage of urine from the bladder. By promoting drainage and eliminating excessive residual urine, intermittent catheterization protects the kidneys, reduces the incidence of urinary tract infections, and im-

\section*{Chart 44-6 - PATIENT EDUCATION \\ Bladder Retraining After \\ Indwelling Catheterization}
- Instruct the patient to drink a measured amount of fluid from 8 AM to 10 PM to avoid bladder overdistention. Offer no fluids (except sips) after 10 PM .
- At specified times, ask the patient to void by applying pressure over the bladder, tapping the abdomen, or stretching the anal sphincter with a finger to trigger the bladder.
- Immediately after the voiding attempt, catheterize the patient to determine the amount of residual urine.
- Measure the volumes of urine voided and obtained by catheterization.
- Palpate the bladder at repeated intervals to assess for distention.
- Instruct the patient without usual sensation to be alert for any signs that indicate a full bladder, such as perspiration, cold hands or feet, and feelings of anxiety.
- Lengthen the intervals between catheterizations as the volume of residual urine decreases. Catheterization is usually discontinued when the volume of residual urine is at an acceptable level.
proves continence. It is the treatment of choice in patients with spinal cord injury and other neurologic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, when the ability to empty the bladder is impaired. Self-catheterization promotes independence, results in few complications, and enhances self-esteem and quality of life.

When teaching the patient how to perform self-catheterization, the nurse must use aseptic technique to minimize the risk of crosscontamination. The patient, however, may use a "clean" (nonsterile) technique at home, where the risk of cross-contamination is reduced. Either antibacterial liquid soap or povidone-iodine (Betadine) solution is recommended for cleaning urinary catheters at home. The catheter is thoroughly rinsed with tap water after soaking in the cleaning solution. It must dry before reuse. It should be kept in its own container, such as a plastic foodstorage bag.

In teaching the patient, the nurse emphasizes the importance of frequent catheterization and emptying the bladder at the prescribed time. The average daytime clean intermittent catheterization schedule is every 4 to 6 hours and just before bedtime. If the patient is awakened at night with an urge to void, catheterization may be performed after an attempt to void (Reilly, 2001).

The female patient assumes a Fowler's position and uses a mirror to help locate the urinary meatus. She inserts the catheter 7.5 cm ( 3 in ) into the urethra, in a downward and backward direction. The male patient assumes a Fowler's or sitting position, lubricates the catheter and retracts the foreskin of the penis with one hand while grasping the penis and holding it at a right angle to the body. (This maneuver straightens the urethra and makes it easier to insert the catheter.) He inserts the catheter 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in ) until urine begins to flow. After removal, the catheter is cleaned, rinsed, and wrapped in a paper towel or placed in a plastic bag or case. Patients following this routine should consult a primary health care provider at regular intervals to assess urinary function and to detect complications.

If the patient cannot perform intermittent self-catheterization, a family member may be taught to carry out the procedure at regular intervals during the day.

Another self-catheterization option is creation of the Mitrofanoff umbilical appendicovesicostomy, which provides easy ac-
cess to the bladder. In this procedure, the bladder neck is closed and the appendix is used to gain access to the bladder from the skin surface. A submucosal tunnel is created with the appendix; one end of the appendix is brought to the skin surface and used as a stoma and the other end is tunneled into the bladder. The appendix may be used as an artificial urinary sphincter when an alternative is necessary to empty the bladder. In children, the most common reason for the procedure is spina bifida. In adults, a surgically prepared continent urine reservoir with a sphincter mechanism is required in cases of bladder cancer, severe interstitial cystitis, or in males, bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex when a radical cystectomy (surgical removal of the bladder) is necessary. This procedure for surgically creating a sphincter, which is attached to an internal pouch reservoir that can be catheterized, is possible only in individuals who have a healthy appendix (Kajbafzadeh \& Chubak, 2001; Uygur et al., 2001).

\section*{Dialysis}

Dialysis is used to remove fluid and uremic waste products from the body when the kidneys cannot do so. It may also be used to treat patients with edema that does not respond to treatment, hepatic coma, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, hypertension, and uremia. Methods of therapy include hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT; discussed later), and various forms of peritoneal dialysis. The need for dialysis may be acute or chronic.

Acute dialysis is indicated when there is a high and rising level of serum potassium, fluid overload, or impending pulmonary edema, increasing acidosis, pericarditis, and severe confusion. It may also be used to remove certain medications or other toxins (poisoning or medication overdose) from the blood.

Chronic or maintenance dialysis is indicated in chronic renal failure, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in the following instances: the presence of uremic signs and symptoms affecting all body systems (nausea and vomiting, severe anorexia, increasing lethargy, mental confusion), hyperkalemia, fluid overload not responsive to diuretics and fluid restriction, and a general lack of well-being. An urgent indication for dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure is pericardial friction rub.

Patients with no renal function can be maintained by dialysis for years. Although the costs of dialysis are usually reimbursable, limitations on the patient's ability to work resulting from illness and dialysis usually impose a great financial burden on patients and families.

The decision to initiate dialysis should be reached only after thoughtful discussion among the patient, family, physician, and others as appropriate. Many potentially life-threatening issues are associated with the need for dialysis. The nurse can assist the patient and family by answering their questions, clarifying the information provided, and supporting their decision. The lifestyle changes that patients needing hemodialysis eventually need to make are often overwhelming. Sometimes the news that a donor kidney is available for transplantation can be so disruptive to the changes in lifestyle that were made to accommodate hemodialysis that the patient may stall the process required for transplantation or refuse the kidney when it becomes available, choosing instead to continue with hemodialysis.

No "gold standard" is available to assess the compliance of hemodialysis patients (Kaveh \& Kimmel, 2001), and methods to do so vary from one dialysis facility to the next. Therefore, it is
difficult to assess how many deaths are due to natural causes and how many are due to patients' noncompliance with treatment.

Successful kidney transplantation eliminates the need for dialysis. Not only is the quality of life much improved in patients with ESRD who undergo transplantation, but physiologic function, such as heart rate variability, is improved as well (Hathaway, Wicks, Cashion, et al., 2000). Patients who undergo renal transplantation from living donors before dialysis is initiated generally have longer survival of the transplanted kidney than patients who receive transplantation after dialysis treatment is initiated (Mange, Joffe \& Feldman, 2001).

\section*{HEMODIALYSIS}

Hemodialysis is the most commonly used method of dialysis: more than 300,000 Americans currently receive hemodialysis (Parker, Bliwise \& Rye, 2000). It is used for patients who are acutely ill and require short-term dialysis (days to weeks) and for patients with ESRD who require long-term or permanent therapy. A dialyzer (once referred to as an artificial kidney) serves as a synthetic semipermeable membrane, replacing the renal glomeruli and tubules as the filter for the impaired kidneys.

For patients with chronic renal failure, hemodialysis prevents death, although it does not cure renal disease and does not compensate for the loss of endocrine or metabolic activities of the kidneys. Patients receiving hemodialysis must undergo treatment for the rest of their lives or until they undergo a successful kidney transplant. Treatments usually occur three times a week for at least 3 to 4 hours per treatment (some patients undergo short-daily hemodialysis; Chart 44-7). Patients receive chronic or maintenance dialysis when they require dialysis therapy for survival and control of uremic symptoms. The trend in managing ESRD is to initiate treatment before the signs and symptoms associated with uremia become severe.

\section*{Principles of Hemodialysis}

The objectives of hemodialysis are to extract toxic nitrogenous substances from the blood and to remove excess water. In hemodialysis, the blood, laden with toxins and nitrogenous wastes, is diverted from the patient to a machine, a dialyzer, in which the blood is cleansed and then returned to the patient.

Diffusion, osmosis, and ultrafiltration are the principles on which hemodialysis is based. The toxins and wastes in the blood are removed by diffusion-that is, they move from an area of higher concentration in the blood to an area of lower concentration in the dialysate. The dialysate is a solution made up of all the important electrolytes in their ideal extracellular concentrations. The electrolyte level in the patient's blood can be brought under control by properly adjusting the dialysate bath. The semipermeable membrane impedes the diffusion of large molecules, such as red blood cells and proteins.

Excess water is removed from the blood by osmosis, in which water moves from an area of higher solute concentration (the blood) to an area of lower solute concentration (the dialysate bath). Ultrafiltration is defined as water moving under high pressure to an area of lower pressure. This process is much more efficient at water removal than osmosis. Ultrafiltration is accomplished by applying negative pressure or a suctioning force to the dialysis membrane. Because patients with renal disease usually cannot excrete water, this force is necessary to remove fluid to achieve fluid balance.

> Short, Daily Hemodialysis
> With an increasing number of individuals receiving hemodialysis, cost issues continue to be of concern to both insurance companies and patients. Some think that daily hemodialysis may improve clinical outcomes and reduce hospital days, thereby justifying the cost of daily dialysis. Daily dialysis can be safely delivered in the clinical setting by health professionals or in the home setting by patients and family members trained in the procedure. Although short, daily hemodialysis was originally described in 1969, it lost favor when large clinical dialysis centers emerged in the 1970s.

> Daily hemodialysis can be completed by the short, high-efficiency method or the slow, nocturnal method. To date, there are no studies demonstrating that one method is superior to the other. Patients in both groups have a higher success rate than those receiving three traditional hemodialysis treatments per week, and quality of life is significantly increased as well. Anemia is reduced, thus decreasing the need for Epogen. Blood pressure and volume management is better with daily dialysis. Although the economic impact of daily dialysis is yet unknown, the general premise appears to be that the higher dialysis costs will be offset by lower morbidity rates, including fewer acute hospitalizations and lower overall medication costs (Fagugli et al., 2001; Lindsay \& Kortas, 2001; Mohr et al., 2001).

The body's buffer system is maintained using a dialysate bath made up of bicarbonate (most common) or acetate, which is metabolized to form bicarbonate. The anticoagulant heparin is administered to keep blood from clotting in the dialysis circuit. Cleansed blood is returned to the body. By the end of the dialysis treatment, many waste products have been removed, the elec-
trolyte balance has been restored to normal, and the buffer system has been replenished.

\section*{Equipment: Dialyzers}

Most dialyzers, or artificial kidneys, are either flat-plate dialyzers or hollow-fiber artificial kidneys that contain thousands of tiny cellophane tubules that act as semipermeable membranes. The blood flows through the tubules, while a solution (the dialysate) circulates around the tubules. The exchange of wastes from the blood to the dialysate occurs through the semipermeable membrane of the tubules (Fig. 44-4).

Dialyzers have undergone many technological changes. The difference between flat-plate dialyzers and hollow-fiber dialyzers lies in performance and biocompatibility. Biocompatibility refers to the ability of the dialyzer to accomplish its objectives without causing hypersensitive, allergic, or adverse reactions. Some dialyzers remove middle-weight molecules at a faster rate and ultrafiltrate at higher rates, which is thought to reduce neuropathy of the lower extremities, a complication of long-term hemodialysis. In general, the more efficient the dialyzer, the higher the cost.

Another technological advance is high-flux dialysis, which uses highly permeable membranes that increase the clearance of low- and mid-molecular-weight molecules. These special membranes are used with higher-than-traditional rates of flow for the blood entering and exiting the dialyzer ( 500 to $800 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ). High-flux dialysis requires the use of precise volumetric ultrafiltration control systems, and not every dialysis unit can perform this type of dialysis. High-flux dialysis increases the efficiency of treatments while shortening their duration and reducing the need for heparin.

The waste products in the blood diffuse through the semipermeable membrane into the dialysate.}
\end{figure}

Because of the costs associated with hemodialysis, hemodialyzers are commonly reused in dialysis centers in the United States. Recent studies have raised concerns about the mortality risks associated with some hemodialyzer reuse practices. Results from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study demonstrated differences in mortality rate with the reuse of certain hemodialyzers. Among all membranes, mortality is lowest for patients treated with high-flux synthetic membranes. The bleaching process to reuse high-flux synthetic membrane dialyzers may account for the lower mortality rate: with this process, clearance of larger molecules is still possible, even though the hemodialyzer is not new. These findings are important because high-flux hemodialyzers are very efficient and are used in most dialysis centers (Port, Wolfe, Hulbert-Shearson et al., 2001).

\section*{Vascular Access}

Access to the patient's vascular system must be established to allow blood to be removed, cleansed, and returned to the patient's vascular system at rates between 200 and $800 \mathrm{~mL} /$ minute. Several types of access are available.

\section*{SUBCLAVIAN, INTERNAL, JUGULAR, AND FEMORAL CATHETERS}

Immediate access to the patient's circulation for acute hemodialysis is achieved by inserting a double-lumen or multilumen catheter into the subclavian, internal jugular, or femoral vein. Although this method of vascular access involves some risk (eg, hematoma, pneumothorax, infection, thrombosis of the subclavian vein, and inadequate flow), it can be used for several weeks. The catheters are removed when no longer needed, because the patient's condition has improved or another type of access has been established. Double-lumen, cuffed catheters may also be surgically inserted into the subclavian vein of patients requiring a central venous catheter for dialysis (Fig. 44-5).

\section*{FISTULA}

A more permanent access, known as a fistula, is created surgically (usually in the forearm) by joining (anastomosing) an artery to a vein, either side to side or end to side (Fig. 44-6). Needles are inserted into the vessel to obtain blood flow adequate to pass through the dialyzer. The arterial segment of the fistula is used for arterial flow and the venous segment for reinfusion of the dialyzed blood. The fistula takes 4 to 6 weeks to mature before it is ready for use. This gives time for healing and for the venous segment of the fistula to dilate to accommodate two large-bore (14or 16-gauge) needles. The patient is encouraged to perform exercises to increase the size of these vessels (ie, squeezing a rubber ball for forearm fistulas) and thereby to accommodate the large-bore needles used in hemodialysis.

\section*{GRAFT}

An arteriovenous graft can be created by subcutaneously interposing a biologic, semibiologic, or synthetic graft material between an artery and vein (see Fig. 44-6). The most commonly used synthetic graft material is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Usually, a graft is created when the patient's vessels are not suitable for a fistula. Patients with compromised vascular systems (eg, from diabetes) often need to have a graft to undergo hemodialysis. Grafts are usually placed in the forearm, upper arm, or upper thigh. Infection and thrombosis are the most common complications of arteriovenous grafts.

\end{figure}

> NURSING ALERT Failure of the permanent dialysis access (fistula or graft) accounts for most hospital admissions of patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Thus, protection of the access is of high priority.

\section*{Complications of Hemodialysis}

Although hemodialysis can prolong life indefinitely, it does not alter the natural course of the underlying kidney disease, nor does it completely replace kidney function. The patient is subject to a number of problems and complications. One leading cause of death among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Disturbances of lipid metabolism (hypertriglyceridemia) appear to be accentuated by hemodialysis. Heart failure, coronary heart disease and anginal pain, stroke, and peripheral vascular insufficiency may occur and may incapacitate the patient. Anemia and fatigue contribute to diminished physical and emotional well-being, lack of energy and drive, and loss of interest, although the use of erythropoietin (Epogen) before the start of dialysis has been shown to have a significant effect on hematocrit values for the first 19 months after starting dialysis (Fink et al., 2001). Increased dialyzer clotting may occur, which is prevented by adjusting heparin doses, and dialyzer solute clearances may decrease slightly (Eschbach \& Adamson, 1989).

Gastric ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems occur from the physiologic stress of chronic illness, medication, and related problems. Disturbed calcium metabolism leads to renal osteodystrophy that produces bone pain and fractures. Other problems

\end{figure}
include fluid overload associated with heart failure, malnutrition, infection, neuropathy, and pruritus.

Up to $85 \%$ of people undergoing hemodialysis experience major sleep problems that further complicate their overall health status. Recent studies suggest that early-morning or late-afternoon dialysis may be a risk factor for developing sleep abnormalities. Researchers suggest such interventions as changing the temperature of the dialysate bath to prevent temperature elevation and limiting napping during dialysis as strategies to reduce sleep problems in individuals receiving hemodialysis (Parker et al., 2000). Other complications of dialysis treatment may include the following:
- Hypotension may occur during the treatment as fluid is removed. Nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and dizziness are common signs of hypotension.
- Painful muscle cramping may occur, usually late in dialysis as fluid and electrolytes rapidly leave the extracellular space.
- Exsanguination may occur if blood lines separate or dialysis needles accidentally become dislodged.
- Dysrhythmias may result from electrolyte and pH changes or from removal of antiarrhythmic medications during dialysis.
- Air embolism is rare but can occur if air enters the vascular system.
- Chest pain may occur in patients with anemia or arteriosclerotic heart disease.
- Dialysis disequilibrium results from cerebral fluid shifts. Signs and symptoms include headache, nausea and vomiting, restlessness, decreased level of consciousness, and seizures. It is more likely to occur in acute renal failure or when blood urea nitrogen levels are very high (exceeding $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

\section*{Long-Term Management}

During dialysis, the patient, the dialyzer, and the dialysate bath require constant monitoring because numerous complications are possible, including air embolism, inadequate or excessive ultra-
filtration (hypotension, cramping, vomiting), blood leaks, contamination, and access complications. The nurse in the dialysis unit has an important role in monitoring, supporting, assessing, and educating the patient. Nursing care of the patient and maintenance of the access device are discussed under "Care of the Hospitalized Dialysis Patient."

\section*{Pharmacologic Therapy}

Just as many medications are excreted wholly or in part by the kidneys, many medications are removed from the blood during hemodialysis; therefore, the physician may need to adjust the dosage. Metabolites of drugs that are bound to protein are not removed during dialysis. Removal of other drug metabolites depends on the weight and size of the molecule.

Patients undergoing hemodialysis who require medications (eg, cardiac glycosides, antibiotic agents, antiarrhythmic medications, antihypertensive agents) are monitored closely to ensure that blood and tissue levels of these medications are maintained without toxic accumulation.

In patients receiving dialysis, all medications and their dosages must be carefully evaluated. Antihypertensive therapy, often part of the dialysis patient's regimen, is one example in which communication, teaching, and evaluation can make a difference in patient outcomes. The patient must know when and when not to take the medication. For example, if an antihypertensive agent is taken on a dialysis day, a hypotensive effect may occur during dialysis, causing dangerously low blood pressure. Many medications that are taken once daily can be held until after the dialysis treatment.

\section*{Nutritional and Fluid Therapy}

When damaged kidneys cannot excrete end products of metabolism, these substances accumulate in the serum as toxins. The resulting symptoms, collectively known as uremic symptoms or uremic syndrome, affect every body system. The more toxins that accumulate, the more severe the symptoms.

Diet is an important factor for patients on hemodialysis because of the effects of uremia. Goals of nutritional therapy are to minimize uremic symptoms and fluid and electrolyte imbalances; to maintain good nutritional status through adequate protein, calorie, vitamin, and mineral intake; and to enable the patient to eat a palatable and enjoyable diet. Restricting dietary protein decreases the accumulation of nitrogenous wastes, reduces uremic symptoms, and may even postpone the initiation of dialysis for a few months. Restriction of fluid is also part of the dietary prescription because fluid accumulation may occur, leading to weight gain, heart failure, and pulmonary edema.

With the initiation of hemodialysis, the patient's dietary intake usually still requires some restriction of dietary protein, sodium, potassium, and fluid intake. Protein intake is restricted to about $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ ideal body weight per day; therefore, protein must be of high biologic quality and consist of the essential amino acids to prevent poor protein use and to maintain a positive nitrogen balance. Examples of foods high in biologic protein content include eggs, meat, milk, poultry, and fish. Sodium is usually restricted to 2 to $3 \mathrm{~g} /$ day; fluids are restricted to an amount equal to the daily urine output plus $500 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day. The goal for hemodialysis patients is to keep their interdialytic (between dialysis treatments) weight gain under 1.5 kg . Potassium restriction (average 1.5 to $2.5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day) depends on the amount of residual renal function and the frequency of dialysis (National Kidney Foundation, 2000).

Dietary restriction is an unwelcome change in lifestyle for many patients with chronic renal failure. Patients often feel stigmatized in social situations because there may be few food selections available for their diet. If the restrictions are ignored, life-threatening complications, such as hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema, may result. Thus, the patient may feel punished for responding to basic human drives to eat and drink. The nurse who encounters a patient with symptoms or complications resulting from dietary indiscretion must avoid harsh, judgmental, or punitive tones when communicating with him or her.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients requiring long-term hemodialysis are often concerned about the unpredictability of the illness and the disruption of their lives. They often have financial problems, difficulty holding a job, waning sexual desire and impotence, depression from being chronically ill, and fear of dying. Younger patients worry about marriage, having children, and the burden that they bring to their families. The regimented lifestyle that frequent dialysis treatments and restrictions in food and fluid intake impose is often demoralizing to the patient and family.

\section*{MEETING PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS}

Dialysis alters the lifestyle of the patient and family. The amount of time required for dialysis and physician visits and being chronically ill can create conflict, frustration, guilt, and depression. It may be difficult for the patient, spouse, and family to express anger and negative feelings.

The nurse needs to give the patient and family the opportunity to express feelings of anger and concern over the limitations that the disease and treatment impose and over possible financial problems and job insecurity. If anger is not expressed, it may be directed inward and lead to depression, despair, and attempts at suicide (suicide is more prevalent in dialysis patients); however, if anger is projected outward to other people, it may destroy already threatened family relationships.

Although normal in this situation, these feelings are often profound and overwhelming. Counseling and psychotherapy may be necessary. Depression may require treatment with antidepressant agents. Referring the patient and family to a mental health provider with expertise in the care of patients receiving dialysis may also be helpful. Clinical nurse specialists, psychologists, and social workers may be helpful in assisting the patient and family to cope with the changes brought about by renal failure and its treatment.

The sense of loss that the patient experiences cannot be underestimated because every aspect of a "normal life" is disrupted. Some patients use denial to deal with the overwhelming array of medical problems (eg, infections, hypertension, anemia, neuropathy). Staff who are tempted to label the patient as noncompliant must consider the impact of renal failure and its treatment on the patient and family and the coping strategies that they may use. The nurse helps the patient to identify safe, effective coping strategies to cope with these ever-present problems and fears (Tonelli et al., 2001).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Preparing a patient for hemodialysis is challenging. Often the patient does not fully comprehend the impact of dialysis, and learning needs may go unrecognized. Good communication between the dialysis staff (in the hospital and outpatient clinic), unit staff, and home care nurses is essential for providing sound, continuous care.

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Assessment helps identify the learning needs of the patient and family members. In many cases, the patient is home before learning needs and readiness to learn can be thoroughly evaluated; therefore, hospital-based nurses, dialysis staff, and home care nurses must work together to provide appropriate teaching that meets the patient's and family's changing needs and readiness to learn.

The diagnosis of chronic renal failure and the need for dialysis often overwhelm the patient and family. In addition, many patients with ESRD have depressed mentation, a shortened attention span, a decreased level of concentration, and altered perceptual states. Therefore, teaching must occur in brief, 10 - to 15 -minute sessions, with time added for clarification, repetition, reinforcement, and questions from the patient and family. The nurse needs to convey a nonjudgmental attitude to enable the patient and family to discuss options and their feelings about those options. Team conferences are helpful for sharing information and providing every team member the opportunity to discuss the needs of the patient and family.

Teaching Patients About Hemodialysis. Although most patients who require hemodialysis undergo the procedure in an outpatient setting, home hemodialysis is an option for some. Home hemodialysis requires a highly motivated patient who is willing to take responsibility for the procedure and is able to adjust each treatment to meet the body's changing needs. It also requires the commitment and cooperation of a family member to assist the patient. Many patients, however, are not comfortable imposing on others in that way and do not wish to subject family members to the feeling that their home is being turned into a clinic.

The health care team should never force a patient into using home hemodialysis. Because this treatment requires many significant changes in the home and family, home hemodialysis must be the patient's and family's decision.

The patient undergoing home hemodialysis and the caregiver assisting that patient must be trained to prepare, operate, and disassemble the dialysis machine; maintain and clean the equipment; administer medications (eg, heparin) into the machine lines; and handle emergency problems (hemodialysis dialyzer rupture, electrical or mechanical problems, hypotension, shock, and seizures). Because home hemodialysis places primary responsibility for the treatment on the patient and the family member, they must understand and be capable of performing all aspects of the hemodialysis procedure (Chart 44-8).

Before home hemodialysis is initiated, the home environment, household and community resources, and ability and willingness of the patient and family to carry out this treatment are assessed. The home is surveyed to see if electrical outlets, plumbing facilities, and storage space are adequate. Modifications may be needed to enable the patient and assistant to perform dialysis safely and to deal with emergencies.

Once home dialysis is initiated, the home care nurse must visit periodically to evaluate compliance with the recommended techniques, to assess the patient for complications, to reinforce previous teaching, and to provide reassurance.

Continuing Care. The health care team's goal in treating patients with chronic renal failure is to maximize their vocational potential, functional status, and quality of life. To facilitate renal rehabilitation, appropriate follow-up and monitoring by members of the health care team (physicians, dialysis nurses, social workers, psychologist, home care nurses, and others as appropriate) are
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-299.jpg?height=805&width=1780&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=109)
essential to identify and resolve problems early on. Many patients with chronic renal failure can resume relatively normal lives, doing the things that are important to them: traveling, exercising, working, or actively participating in family activities. If appropriate interventions are available early in the course of dialysis, the potential for better health improves, and the patient can remain active in family and community life. Chart 44-9 outlines the essential elements identified by the Life Options Rehabilitation Advisory Council for the rehabilitation of dialysis patients. Outcome goals for renal rehabilitation include employment for those able to work, improved physical functioning of all patients, improved understanding about adaptation and options for living well, increased control over the effects of kidney disease and dialysis, and resumption of activities enjoyed before dialysis.

\section*{CONTINUOUS RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPIES}

Several types of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are available and are widely used in critical care units. CRRT may be indicated for patients who have acute or chronic renal failure and who are too clinically unstable for traditional hemodialysis, for patients with fluid overload secondary to oliguric (low urine output) renal failure, and for patients whose kidneys cannot handle their acutely high metabolic or nutritional needs. CRRT does not produce rapid fluid shifts, does not require dialysis machines or dialysis personnel to carry out the procedures, and can be initiated quickly in hospitals without dialysis facilities.

CRRT methods are similar to hemodialysis methods in that they require access to the circulation and blood to pass through an artificial filter. A hemofilter (an extremely porous blood filter containing a semipermeable membrane) is used in all CRRT methods, which are described below (Astle, 2001).

\section*{Continuous Arteriovenous Hemofiltration}

Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) was first used in 1977 to treat fluid overload. Blood is circulated through a small-volume, low-resistance filter, using the patient's arterial pressure rather than that of the blood pump as is used in hemodialysis. Blood flows from an artery (usually by an arterial catheter in the femoral artery) to a hemofilter. A pressure gradient is necessary for optimal filtration; cannulation of the femoral artery and vein provides the necessary gradient (difference) in arterial and venous pressures. The filtered blood then returns to the patient's circulation through a venous catheter. Intravenous fluids may be administered to replace fluid removed by the procedure. With CAVH, there is no concentration gradient, so only fluid is filtered. Electrolytes are eliminated only as they are pulled along and removed with the fluid. Ultrafiltrate is collected in a drainage bag, measured, and discarded. CAVH is usually set up and initiated by trained dialysis staff and then maintained and monitored by critical care personnel.

\section*{Continuous Arteriovenous Hemodialysis}

Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) has many of the characteristics of CAVH but offers the advantage of a concentration gradient for faster clearance of urea. This is accomplished by the circulation of dialysate on one side of a semipermeable membrane. The blood flow through the system depends on the patient's arterial pressure, as in CAVH; a blood pump is not used as it is in standard hemodialysis. CAVHD is usually set up and initiated by trained dialysis staff and then maintained and monitored by critical care personnel.

\section*{Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration}

Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) is increasingly being used in managing acute renal failure. Blood from a double-lumen venous catheter is pumped (using a small blood pump) through a hemofilter and then returned to the patient through the same catheter (Fig. 44-7). CVVH provides continuous slow fluid removal (ultrafiltration); therefore, hemodynamic effects are mild and better tolerated by patients with unstable conditions. CVVH has several other benefits over CAVH in that no arterial access is required and critical care nurses can set up, initiate, maintain, and terminate the system.

\section*{Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis}

Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) is similar to CVVH. Blood is pumped from a double-lumen venous catheter through a hemofilter and returned to the patient through the same catheter. In addition to the benefits of ultrafiltration, CVVHD uses a concentration gradient to facilitate the removal of uremic toxins. Therefore, no arterial access is required, hemodynamic effects are usually mild, and critical care nurses can set up, initiate, maintain, and terminate the system.

\section*{PERITONEAL DIALYSIS}

The goals of peritoneal dialysis are to remove toxic substances and metabolic wastes and to re-establish normal fluid and electrolyte balance. Peritoneal dialysis may be the treatment of choice for patients with renal failure who are unable or unwilling to undergo hemodialysis or renal transplantation. Patients who are susceptible to the rapid fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic changes that occur during hemodialysis experience fewer of these problems with the slower rate of peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease, many older patients, and those who may be at risk for adverse effects of systemic heparin are likely candidates for peritoneal dialysis.

hypertension, heart failure, and pulmonary edema not responsive to usual treatment regimens have been successfully treated with peritoneal dialysis.

Peritoneal dialysis can be performed using several different approaches: acute, intermittent peritoneal dialysis; continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); and continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). These three methods are discussed later in this chapter. As with other forms of treatment, the decision to begin peritoneal dialysis is made by the patient and family in consultation with the physician.

Although specific patient populations do benefit from peritoneal dialysis, it is not as efficient as hemodialysis (Lindsay \& Kortas, 2001). Because cardiovascular disease is the cause of death in half of all patients with ESRD, the adequacy of dialysis must be defined, in part, by its potential to reduce cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure, volume, left ventricular hypertrophy, and dyslipidemias are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Chatoth, Golper \& Gokal, 1999).

\section*{Underlying Principles}

In peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum, a serous membrane that covers the abdominal organs and lines the abdominal wall, serves as the semipermeable membrane. The surface of the peritoneum constitutes a body surface area of about $22,000 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Sterile dialysate fluid is introduced into the peritoneal cavity through an abdominal catheter at intervals (Fig. 44-8). Urea and creatinine, metabolic end products normally excreted by the kidneys, are cleared from the blood by diffusion and ossmosis as waste products

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 44-8 In peritoneal dialysis and in acute intermittent peritoneal dialysis, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal cavity by gravity, after which the clamp on the infusion line is closed. After a dwell time (when the dialysate is in the peritoneal cavity), the drainage tube is unclamped and the fluid drains from the peritoneal cavity, again by gravity. A new container of dialysate is infused as soon as drainage is complete. The duration of the dwell time depends on the type of peritoneal dialysis.}
\end{figure}
move from an area of higher concentration (the peritoneal blood supply) to an area of lower concentration (the peritoneal cavity) across a semipermeable membrane (the peritoneal membrane). Urea is cleared at a rate of 15 to $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, whereas creatinine is removed at a slower rate. It usually takes 36 to 48 hours to achieve with peritoneal dialysis what hemodialysis accomplishes in 6 to 8 hours. Ultrafiltration (water removal) occurs in peritoneal dialysis through an osmotic gradient created by using a dialysate fluid with a higher glucose concentration.

\section*{Procedure}

The patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis may be acutely ill, thus requiring short-term treatment to correct severe disturbances in fluid and electrolyte status, or may have chronic renal failure and need to receive ongoing treatments.

\section*{PREPARING THE PATIENT}

The nurse's preparation of the patient and family for peritoneal dialysis depends on the patient's physical and psychological status, level of alertness, previous experience with dialysis, and understanding of and familiarity with the procedure.

The nurse explains the procedure to the patient and obtains signed consent for it. Baseline vital signs, weight, and serum electrolyte levels are recorded. The patient is encouraged to empty the bladder and bowel to reduce the risk of puncturing internal organs. The nurse also assesses the patient's anxiety about the procedure and provides support and instruction. Broad-spectrum antibiotic agents may be administered to prevent infection. If the peritoneal catheter is to be inserted in the operating room, this is explained to the patient and family.

\section*{PREPARING THE EQUIPMENT}

In addition to assembling the equipment for peritoneal dialysis, the nurse consults with the physician to determine the concentration of dialysate to be used and the medications to be added to it. Heparin may be added to prevent blood clotting and resultant occlusion of the peritoneal catheter. Potassium chloride may be prescribed to prevent hypokalemia. Antibiotics may be added to treat peritonitis. Insulin may be added for diabetic patients; a larger-than-normal dose may be needed, however, because about $10 \%$ of the insulin binds to the dialysate container. All medications are added immediately before the solution is instilled. Aseptic technique is crucial.

Before medications are added, the dialysate is warmed to body temperature to prevent patient discomfort and abdominal pain and to dilate the vessels of the peritoneum to increase urea clearance. Solutions that are too cold cause pain and vasoconstriction and reduce clearance. Solutions that are too hot burn the peritoneum. Dry heating is recommended (heating cabinet, incubator, or heating pad). Microwave heating of the fluid is not recommended because of the danger of burning the peritoneum.

Immediately before initiating dialysis, the nurse assembles the administration set and tubing. The tubing is filled with the prepared dialysate to reduce the amount of air entering the catheter and peritoneal cavity, which could increase abdominal discomfort and interfere with instillation and drainage of the fluid.

\section*{INSERTING THE CATHETER}

Ideally, the peritoneal catheter is inserted in the operating room to maintain surgical asepsis and minimize the risk of contamination. In some circumstances, however, the physician inserts the catheter at the bedside under strict asepsis.

A rigid stylet catheter is inserted for acute peritoneal dialysis use only. Before the procedure, the skin is prepared with a local antiseptic to reduce skin bacteria and the risk of contamination and infection. The physician anesthetizes the site with a local anesthetic agent before making a small incision or stab wound in the lower abdomen, 3 to 5 cm below the umbilicus. Because this area is relatively free from large blood vessels, little bleeding occurs. A trocar is used to puncture the peritoneum as the patient tightens the abdominal muscles by raising the head. The catheter is threaded through the trocar and positioned. Previously prepared dialysate is infused into the peritoneal cavity, pushing the omentum (peritoneal lining extending from the abdominal organs) away from the catheter. The physician may then secure the catheter with a purse-string suture and apply antibacterial ointment and a sterile dressing over the site.

Catheters for long-term use (Tenckhoff, Swan, Cruz) are usually made of silicone and are radiopaque to permit visualization on x-ray. These catheters have three sections: (1) an intraperitoneal section, with numerous openings and an open tip to let dialysate flow freely; (2) a subcutaneous section that passes from the peritoneal membrane and tunnels through muscle and subcutaneous fat to the skin; and (3) an external section for connection to the dialysate system. Most of these catheters have two cuffs, which are made of Dacron polyester. The cuffs stabilize the catheter, limit movement, prevent leaks, and provide a barrier against microorganisms. One cuff is placed just distal to the peritoneum, and the other cuff is placed subcutaneously. The subcutaneous tunnel ( 5 to 10 cm long) further protects against bacterial infection (Fig. 44-9).

\section*{PERFORMING THE EXCHANGE}

Peritoneal dialysis involves a series of exchanges or cycles. An exchange is defined as the infusion, dwell, and drainage of the dialysate. This cycle is repeated throughout the course of the dialysis. The dialysate is infused by gravity into the peritoneal cavity. A period of about 5 to 10 minutes is usually required to infuse 2 L of fluid. The prescribed dwell, or equilibration, time allows diffusion and osmosis to occur. Diffusion of small molecules, such as urea and creatinine, peaks in the first 5 to 10 minutes of the dwell time. At the end of the dwell time, the drainage portion of the exchange begins. The tube is unclamped and the solution drains from the peritoneal cavity by gravity through a closed system. Drainage is usually completed in 10 to 30 minutes. The drainage fluid is normally colorless or straw-colored and should not be cloudy. Bloody drainage may be seen in the first few exchanges after insertion of a new catheter but should not occur after that time. The entire exchange (infusion, dwell time, and drainage) takes 1 to 4 hours, depending on the prescribed dwell time. The number of cycles or exchanges and their frequency are prescribed based on the patient's physical status and acuity of illness.

The removal of excess water during peritoneal dialysis is achieved by using a hypertonic dialysate with a high dextrose concentration that creates an osmotic gradient. Dextrose solutions of $1.5 \%, 2.5 \%$, and $4.25 \%$ are available in several volumes, from 500 mL to $3,000 \mathrm{~mL}$, allowing the dialysate selection to fit the patient's tolerance, size, and physiologic needs. The higher the dextrose concentration, the greater the osmotic gradient and the more water removed. Selection of the appropriate solution is based on the patient's fluid status.

\section*{Complications of Peritoneal Dialysis}

Peritoneal dialysis is not without complications. Most are minor, but several, if unattended, can have serious consequences.

\section*{PERITONITIS}

Peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum) is the most common and most serious complication of peritoneal dialysis. The organism responsible for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis is an important factor in clinical outcome and the basis of treatment guidelines. There has been a significant decrease in the rate of cases of peritonitis, from 1.37 episodes/patient-year in 1991 to 0.55 episodes/patient-year in 1998. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis remain the most common Gram-positive organisms responsible for peritonitis, although the rates of each have decreased. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, and Klebsiella species are the most common causes of Gram-negative peritonitis. Resistance to antibacterial agents (ie, ciprofloxacin, methicillin) used in their treatment increased dramatically from 1991 to 1998 (Zelenitsky et al., 2000).

Peritonitis is characterized by cloudy dialysate drainage, diffuse abdominal pain, and rebound tenderness. Hypotension and other signs of shock may occur if $S$. aureus is the responsible organism. The patient with peritonitis may be treated as an inpatient or outpatient (most common), depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's clinical status. Initially, one to three rapid exchanges with a $1.5 \%$ dextrose solution without added medications are completed to wash out mediators of inflammation and to reduce abdominal pain. Drainage fluid is examined for cell count, and Gram's stain and culture are used to identify the organism and guide treatment. Antibiotic agents (aminoglycosides or cephalosporins) are usually added to subsequent exchanges until the Gram's stain or culture results are available for appropriate antibiotic determination. Intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics is as effective as intravenous administration. Antibiotic therapy continues for 10 to 14 days. Careful calculation of the antibiotic dosage helps prevent nephrotoxicity and further compromise of renal function.

Heparin (500 to $1,000 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{L}$ ) may be added to the dialysate to prevent fibrin clot formation; oral administration of low-dose warfarin (Coumadin) is also effective in decreasing coagulation factors and preventing thrombosis without increasing the risk of bleeding (Kim, Lee, Park et al., 2001).

Peritonitis that is unresolved after 4 days of appropriate therapy necessitates catheter removal. The patient is maintained on hemodialysis for about 1 month before a new catheter is inserted. In patients with fungal peritonitis, the peritoneal catheter must be removed if there is no response to therapy in 4 to 7 days. Tunnel infections and fecal peritonitis also necessitate catheter removal. Systemic antibiotics should continue for 5 to 7 days after catheter removal.

Regardless of which organism causes peritonitis, the patient with peritonitis loses large amounts of protein through the peritoneum. Acute malnutrition and delayed healing may result. Therefore, attention must be given to detecting and promptly treating the infections.

\section*{LEAKAGE}

Leakage of dialysate through the catheter site may occur immediately after the catheter is inserted. Usually, the leak stops spontaneously if dialysis is withheld for several days to give the incision and exit site time to heal. During this time, it is important to re-
duce factors that might delay healing, such as undue abdominal muscle activity and straining during bowel movement. Leakage through the exit site or into the abdominal wall can occur for months or years after catheter placement. In many cases, leakage can be avoided by using small volumes ( 100 to 200 mL ) of dialysate, gradually increasing the volume up to $2,000 \mathrm{~mL}$.

\section*{BLEEDING}

A bloody effluent (drainage) may be observed occasionally, especially in young, menstruating women. (The hypertonic fluid pulls blood from the uterus, through the opening in the fallopian tubes, and into the peritoneal cavity.) Bleeding is common during the first few exchanges after a new catheter insertion because some blood exists in the abdominal cavity from the procedure. In many cases, no cause can be found for the bleeding, although catheter displacement from the pelvis has occasionally been associated with bleeding. Some patients have had bloody effluent after an enema or from minor trauma. Invariably, bleeding stops in 1 to 2 days and requires no specific intervention. More frequent exchanges during this time may be necessary to prevent blood clots from obstructing the catheter.

\section*{LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS}

Hypertriglyceridemia is common in patients undergoing long-term peritoneal dialysis, suggesting that this therapy may accelerate atherogenesis. Despite this, the use of cardioprotective medications is relatively low, and many patients have suboptimal blood pressure control. Given the high burden of disease in these patients, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used to control hypertension or protect the heart; the use of aspirin and statins should be considered. In general, health care providers need to be better educated in this area of dialysis management (Tonelli et al., 2001).

Other complications that may occur with long-term peritoneal dialysis include abdominal hernias (incisional, inguinal, diaphragmatic, and umbilical), probably resulting from continuously increased intra-abdominal pressure. The persistently elevated intra-abdominal pressure also aggravates symptoms of hiatal hernia and hemorrhoids. Low back pain and anorexia from fluid in the abdomen and a constant sweet taste related to glucose absorption may also occur.

Mechanical problems occasionally occur and may interfere with instillation or drainage of the dialysate. Formation of clots in the peritoneal catheter and constipation are factors that may contribute to these problems.

\section*{Acute Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis}

Indications for acute intermittent peritoneal dialysis, a variation of peritoneal dialysis, include uremic signs and symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, altered mental status), fluid overload, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. Although peritoneal dialysis is not as efficient as hemodialysis in removing solute and fluid, it permits a more gradual change in the patient's fluid volume status and in waste product removal. Therefore, it may be the treatment of choice for the hemodynamically unstable patient. It can be carried out manually (the nurse warms, spikes, and hangs each container of dialysate) or by a cycler machine. Exchange times range from 30 minutes to 2 hours. A common routine is hourly exchanges consisting of a 10 -minute infusion, a 30 -minute dwell time, and a 20 -minute drain time.

Maintaining the peritoneal dialysis cycle is a nursing responsibility. Strict aseptic technique is maintained when changing solution containers and emptying drainage containers. Vital signs, weight, intake and output, laboratory values, and patient status are frequently monitored. The nurse uses a flow sheet to document each exchange and records vital signs, dialysate concentration, medications added, exchange volume, dwell time, dialysate fluid balance for the exchange (fluid lost or gained), and cumulative fluid balance. The nurse also carefully assesses skin turgor and mucous membranes to evaluate fluid status and monitor the patient for edema.

If the peritoneal fluid does not drain properly, the nurse can facilitate drainage by turning the patient from side to side or raising the head of the bed. The catheter should never be pushed in. Other measures to promote drainage include checking the patency of the catheter by inspecting for kinks, closed clamps, or an air lock. The nurse always monitors for complications, including peritonitis, bleeding, respiratory difficulty, and leakage of peritoneal fluid. Abdominal girth may be measured periodically to determine if the patient is retaining large amounts of dialysis solution. Additionally, the nurse must ensure that the peritoneal dialysis catheter remains secure and that the dressing remains dry. Physical comfort measures, frequent turning, and skin care are provided. The patient and family are educated about the procedure and are kept informed about progress (fluid loss, weight loss, laboratory values). Emotional support and encouragement are given to the patient and family during this stressful and uncertain time.

\section*{Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis}

CAPD is a form of dialysis used for many patients with ESRD. CAPD is performed at home by the patient or a trained caregiver, who is usually a family member; the procedure allows the patient reasonable freedom and control of daily activities (Chart 44-10).

\section*{UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES}

CAPD works on the same principles as other forms of peritoneal dialysis: diffusion and osmosis. Less extreme fluctuations in the patient's laboratory results occur with CAPD than with intermittent peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis because the dialysis is constantly in progress. The serum electrolyte levels usually remain in the normal range.

\section*{PROCEDURE}

The patient performs exchanges four or five times a day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at intervals scheduled throughout the day (before meals and bedtime). After infusing the dialysate into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter (over about 10 minutes), the patient can fold the bag and tuck it underneath the clothing during the dwell time. This provides the patient with some freedom and reduces the number of connections and disconnections necessary at the catheter end of the tubing, thereby reducing the risk of contamination and peritonitis.

The longer the dwell time, the better the clearance of middlesized molecules. It is thought that these molecules may be significant uremic toxins. At the end of the dwell time, the dialysate is drained from the peritoneal cavity by unfolding the empty bag, opening the clamp, and placing the bag lower than the abdomen near the floor. This allows the peritoneal fluid to drain out by gravity. When drainage ends, the patient repeats the procedure by spiking a new bag containing dialysate and infusing the solution into the peritoneal cavity. Other systems are available that allow the catheter to be clamped, disconnected, and capped, thus allowing the patient freedom from wearing an empty dialysate bag. Before the next exchange, however, an empty drainage bag must be attached to permit drainage of the dwell solution.

\section*{Chart 44-10 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Assessing Suitability for CAPD}

Although CAPD is not suitable for all patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), it is a viable therapy for those who can perform self-care and exchanges and who can fit therapy into their own routines. Often, patients report having more energy and feeling healthier once they begin CAPD. Nurses can be instrumental in helping patients with ESRD find the dialysis therapy that best suits their lifestyle. Those considering CAPD need to investigate the advantages and disadvantages along with the indications and contraindications for this form of therapy.

\section*{Advantages}
- Freedom from a dialysis machine
- Control over daily activities
- Opportunities to avoid dietary restrictions, increase fluid intake, raise serum hematocrit values, improve blood pressure control, avoid venipuncture, and gain a sense of well-being.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Continuous dialysis 24 hours a day, 7 days a week

\section*{Indications}
- Patient's willingness, motivation, and ability to perform dialysis at home
- Strong family or community support system (essential for success), particularly if the patient is an older adult
- Special problems with long-term hemodialysis, such as dysfunctional or failing vascular access devices, excessive thirst, severe
hypertension, postdialysis headaches, and severe anemia requiring frequent transfusion
- Interim therapy while awaiting kidney transplantation
- ESRD secondary to diabetes because hypertension, uremia, and hyperglycemia are easier to manage with CAPD than with hemodialysis

\section*{Contraindications}
- Adhesions from previous surgery (adhesions reduce clearance of solutes) or systemic inflammatory disease
- Chronic backache and preexisting disk disease, which could be aggravated by the continuous pressure of dialysis fluid in the abdomen
- Risk of complications, for example, in patients receiving immunosuppressive medications, which impede healing of the catheter site, and in patients with a colostomy, ileostomy, nephrostomy, or ileal conduit because of the risk of peritonitis. The risk for complications is not an absolute contraindication for CAPD therapy.
- Diverticulitis because CAPD has been associated with rupture of the diverticulum
- Severe arthritis or poor hand strength necessitating assistance in performing the exchange. However, blind or partially blind patients and those with other physical limitations can learn to perform CAPD.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

To reduce the risk of peritonitis, the patient takes meticulous care to avoid contaminating the catheter, fluid, or tubing and accidentally disconnecting the catheter from the tubing. The catheter is protected from manipulation, and the catheter entry site is meticulously cared for according to a standardized protocol.

\section*{Nursing Management}

In addition to the complications of peritoneal dialysis previously described, patients who elect to use CAPD may experience altered body image because of the abdominal catheter and the bag and tubing. Waist size increases from 1 to 2 inches (or more) with fluid in the abdomen. This affects clothing selection and may make the patient feel "fat." Body image may be so altered that patients do not want to look at or care for the catheter for days or weeks. The nurse may arrange for the patient to talk with other patients who have adapted well to CAPD. Although some patients have no psychological problems with the catheter-they think of it as their lifeline and as a life-sustaining device-other patients feel they are doing exchanges all day long and have no free time, particularly in the beginning. They may experience depression because they feel overwhelmed with the responsibility of self-care.

Patients undergoing CAPD may also experience altered sexuality patterns and sexual dysfunction. The patient and partner may be reluctant to engage in sexual activities, partly because of the catheter being psychologically "in the way" of sexual performance. The peritoneal catheter, drainage bag, and about 2 L of dialysate may interfere with the patient's sexual function and body image as well. Although these problems may resolve with time, some problems may warrant special counseling. Questions by the nurse about concerns related to sexuality and sexual func-
tion often provide the patient with a welcome opportunity to discuss these issues and a first step toward their resolution.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Patients are taught as inpatients or outpatients to perform CAPD once their condition is medically stable. Training usually takes 5 days to 2 weeks. Patients are taught according to their own learning ability and knowledge level, and only as much at one time as they can handle without feeling uncomfortable or becoming overwhelmed. Education topics for the patient and family who will be performing peritoneal dialysis at home are described in Chart 44-11.

Because of protein loss with continuous peritoneal dialysis, patients are instructed to eat a high-protein, well-balanced diet. They are also encouraged to increase their daily fiber intake to help prevent constipation, which can impede the flow of dialysate into or out of the peritoneal cavity. Many patients gain 3 to 5 lb within a month of initiating CAPD, so they may be asked to limit their carbohydrate intake to avoid excessive weight gain. Potassium, sodium, and fluid restrictions are not usually needed. Patients commonly lose about 2 L of fluid over and above the 8 L of dialysate infused into the abdomen during a 24 -hour period, permitting a normal fluid intake even in an anephric patient (a patient without kidneys). Greater small-solute clearances are associated with better dietary intake and better nutrition (Wang, Sea, Ip et al., 2001).

Continuing Care. Follow-up care through phone calls, visits to the outpatient department, and continuing home care assists patients in the transition to home and promotes their active participation in their own health care. Patients often depend on checking with the nurse to see if they are making the right choices

\section*{Chart 44-11 \\ Home Care Checklist Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD or CCPD)}

about dialysate or control of blood pressure, or simply to discuss a problem.

Patients may be seen by the CAPD team as outpatients once a month or more often if needed. The exchange procedure is evaluated at that time to see that strict aseptic technique is being used. The CAPD nurse may change the tubing used to instill the dialysate every 4 to 8 weeks. Long-life tubing now lasts up to 6 months before tubing changes are necessary. Infrequent tubing changes decrease the risk of contamination. Blood chemistry values are followed closely to make certain the therapy is adequate for the patient.

If a referral is made for home care, the home care nurse assesses the home environment and suggests modifications to accommodate the equipment and facilities needed to carry out CAPD. In addition, the nurse assesses the patient's and family's understanding of CAPD and their use of safe technique in performing CAPD. Additional assessments include checking for changes related to renal disease, complications such as peritonitis, and treatmentrelated problems such as heart failure, inadequate drainage, and weight gain or loss. The nurse continues to reinforce and clarify teaching about CAPD and renal disease and assesses the patient's and family's progress in coping with the procedure. In addition, the patient is reminded about the need to participate in health promotion activities and health screening.

Due to the projected high numbers of elderly patients who will develop ESRD in the future, the nursing home or extendedcare facility will become an increasingly important site for both rehabilitation and long-term management of patients with renal failure. Although few such sites currently provide dialysis, highly structured educational programs for personnel in these environments by nephrology staff will likely make these effective sites of care for patients requiring continuous peritoneal dialysis (Carey, Chorney, Pherson et al., 2001).

\section*{Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis}

CCPD combines overnight intermittent peritoneal dialysis with a prolonged dwell time during the day. The peritoneal catheter is connected to a cycler machine every evening, and the patient receives three to five $2-\mathrm{L}$ exchanges during the night. In the morning, the patient caps off the catheter after infusing 1 to 2 L of fresh dialysate. This dialysate remains in the abdominal cavity until the tubing is reattached to the cycler machine at bedtime. Because the machine is very quiet, the patient can sleep. Moreover, the extralong tubing allows the patient to move and turn normally during sleep.

CCPD has a lower infection rate than other forms of peritoneal dialysis because there are fewer opportunities for contamination with bag changes and tubing disconnections. It also allows the patient to be free from exchanges throughout the day, making it possible to work more freely and carry out activities of daily living.

\section*{SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: CARE OF THE HOSPITALIZED DIALYSIS PATIENT}

Whether undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the patient may be hospitalized for treatment of complications related to the dialysis treatment, the underlying renal disorder, or health problems not related to renal dysfunction or its treatment.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PROTECTING THE VASCULAR ACCESS}

When the hemodialysis patient is hospitalized for any reason, care must be taken to protect the vascular access from damage. The nurse assesses the vascular access for patency and takes precautions to ensure that the extremity with the vascular access is not used for measuring blood pressure or for obtaining blood specimens; tight dressings, restraints, or jewelry over the vascular access are to be avoided as well.

The bruit, or "thrill," over the venous access site must be evaluated at least every 8 hours. Absence of a palpable thrill or audible bruit may indicate blockage or clotting in the access device. Clotting can occur if the patient has an infection anywhere in the body (serum viscosity is increased) or if the blood pressure has dropped. When blood flow is reduced through the access for any reason (hypotension, application of blood pressure cuff or tourniquet), the access can clot or become infected. The nurse observes the patient for signs and symptoms of infection, such as redness, swelling, drainage from the site, and fever. Patients with renal disease are more prone to infection; therefore, infection control measures must be used for all procedures.

\section*{TAKING PRECAUTIONS DURING INTRAVENOUS THERAPY}

When the patient needs intravenous therapy, the rate of administration must be as slow as possible and should be strictly controlled by a volumetric infusion pump. Because dialysis patients cannot excrete water, rapid or excessive administration of intravenous fluid can result in pulmonary edema. Accurate intake and output records are essential.

\section*{MONITORING SYMPTOMS OF UREMIA}

As metabolic end products accumulate, uremic symptoms worsen. Patients whose metabolic rate accelerates (those on corticosteroid medications or parenteral nutrition, those with infections or bleeding disorders, those undergoing surgery) accumulate waste products more quickly and may require daily dialysis. These same patients are more likely to experience complications than other dialysis patients.

\section*{DETECTING CARDIAC AND RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS}

Cardiac and respiratory assessment must be conducted frequently. As fluid builds up, fluid overload, heart failure, and pulmonary edema develop. Crackles in the bases of the lungs may indicate pulmonary edema.

Pericarditis may result from the accumulation of uremic toxins. If not detected and treated promptly, this serious complication may progress to pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. Pericarditis is detected by the patient's report of substernal chest pain (if the patient can communicate), low-grade fever (often overlooked), and pericardial friction rub. A pulsus paradoxus (a decrease in blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration) is often present. When pericarditis progresses to effusion, the friction rub disappears, heart sounds become distant and muffled, electrocardiographic waves show very low voltage, and the pulsus paradoxus worsens.

The effusion may progress to life-threatening cardiac tamponade, noted by narrowing of the pulse pressure in addition to muffled or inaudible heart sounds, crushing chest pain, dyspnea, and hypotension. Although pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade can be detected by chest x-ray, they should also be detected through astute nursing assessment. Because of
their clinical significance, assessment of the patient for cardiac complications is a priority.

\section*{CONTROLLING ELECTROLYTE LEVELS AND DIET}

Electrolyte alterations are common, and potassium changes can be life threatening. All intravenous solutions and medications to be administered are evaluated for their electrolyte content. Serum laboratory values are assessed daily. If blood transfusions are required, they may be administered during hemodialysis, if possible, so that excess potassium can be removed. Dietary intake must also be monitored. The patient's frustrations related to dietary restrictions typically increase if the hospital food is unappetizing. The nurse needs to recognize that this may lead to dietary indiscretion and hyperkalemia.

Hypoalbuminemia is an indicator of malnutrition in patients undergoing long-term or maintenance dialysis. Although some patients can be treated with adequate nutrition alone, some patients remain hypoalbuminemic for reasons that are poorly understood.

\section*{MANAGING DISCOMFORT AND PAIN}

Complications such as pruritus and pain secondary to neuropathy must be managed. Antihistamine agents, such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl), are commonly used, and analgesic medications may be prescribed. Because elimination of the metabolites of medications occurs through dialysis rather than through renal excretion, however, medication dosages may need to be adjusted. Keeping the skin clean and well moisturized using bath oils, superfatted soap, and creams or lotions helps to promote comfort and reduce itching. Teaching the patient to keep the nails trimmed to avoid scratching and excoriation and to rub lotion into the skin instead of scratching also promotes comfort.

\section*{MONITORING BLOOD PRESSURE}

Hypertension in renal failure is common. It is usually the result of fluid overload and, in part, oversecretion of renin. Many dialysis patients receive some form of antihypertensive therapy and require intense teaching about its purpose and adverse effects. The trial-and-error approach that may be necessary to identify the most effective antihypertensive agent and dosage may confuse or alarm the patient if no explanation is provided. Antihypertensive agents must be withheld on dialysis days to avoid hypotension due to the combined effect of the dialysis and the medication.

Typically these patients require single or multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve normal blood pressure, thus adding to the total number of medications needed on an ongoing basis. Research has demonstrated that by maintaining strict volume control via absolute dietary salt restrictions, thorough explanation of the rationale behind the sodium restriction to the patient and family, and increased ultrafiltration by using more hypertonic peritoneal dialysis solution, most persons can maintain a normal blood pressure without the use of antihypertensive agents (Gunal, Duman, Ozkahya et al., 2001).

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Patients with ESRD commonly have low white blood cell counts (and decreased phagocytic ability), low red blood cell counts (anemia), and impaired platelet function. Together, these pose a high risk for infection and potential for bleeding after even minor trauma. Preventing and controlling infection are essential because the incidence of infection is high. Infection of the vascular access site and pneumonia are common.

\section*{CARING FOR THE CATHETER SITE}

Patients receiving CAPD usually know how to care for the catheter site; however, the hospital stay should be an opportunity to assess compliance with recommended catheter care and to correct any misperceptions or deviations from correct technique. Recommended daily or three-or-four-times-weekly routine catheter site care is typically performed during showering or bathing. The exit site should not be submerged in bath water. The most common cleaning method is soap and water; liquid soap is recommended. During care, the nurse and patient need to make sure that the catheter remains secure to avoid tension and trauma. The patient may wear a gauze or semitransparent dressing over the exit site.

\section*{ADMINISTERING MEDICATIONS}

The medications prescribed for any dialysis patient must be closely monitored to avoid those that are toxic to the kidneys and may threaten remaining renal function. All medications must be monitored, and alterations in dosages may be necessary to prevent either toxic effects on the kidney or overdosage because of impaired renal excretion. Care must be taken to evaluate all problems and symptoms that the patient reports without automatically attributing them to renal failure or to dialysis therapy.

\section*{PROVIDING PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT}

Patients undergoing dialysis for a while may begin to re-evaluate their status, the treatment modality, their satisfaction with life, and the impact of these factors on their families and support systems. Nurses must provide opportunities for these patients to express their feelings and reactions and to explore options.

The decision to begin dialysis does not require that dialysis be continued indefinitely, and it is not uncommon for patients to consider discontinuing treatment. These feelings and reactions must be taken seriously, and the patient should have the opportunity to discuss them with the dialysis team as well as with a psychologist, psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, trusted friend, or spiritual advisor. The patient's informed decision about discontinuing treatment, after thoughtful deliberation, should be respected.

\section*{Kidney Surgery}

A patient may undergo surgery to remove obstructions that affect the kidney (tumors or calculi), to insert a tube for draining the kidney (nephrostomy, ureterostomy), or to remove the kidney involved in unilateral kidney disease, renal carcinoma, or kidney transplantation.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS}

Surgery is performed only after a thorough evaluation of renal function. Patient preparation to ensure that optimal renal function is maintained is mandatory. Fluids are encouraged to promote increased excretion of waste products before surgery, unless contraindicated because of preexisting renal or cardiac dysfunction. If kidney infection is present preoperatively, wide-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be prescribed to prevent bacteremia. Antibiotic agents must be given with extreme care because many are toxic to the kidneys. Coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count) may be indicated if the patient has a history of bruising and bleeding. The general preoperative preparation is similar to that described in Chapter 18.

Because many patients facing kidney surgery are apprehensive, the nurse encourages the patient to recognize and express any
feelings of anxiety. Confidence is reinforced by establishing a relationship of trust and by providing expert care. Patients faced with the prospect of losing a kidney may think that they will be dependent on dialysis for the rest of their life. It is important to teach the patient and family that normal function may be maintained by a single healthy kidney.

\section*{PERIOPERATIVE CONCERNS}

Renal surgery requires various patient positions to expose the surgical site adequately. Three surgical approaches are common: flank, lumbar, and thoracoabdominal (Fig. 44-10). During surgery, plans are carried out for managing altered urinary drainage and drainage systems. Plans may include inserting a nephrostomy or other drainage tube or using ureteral stents.

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

Because the kidney is a highly vascular organ, hemorrhage and shock are the chief complications of renal surgery. Fluid and blood component replacement is frequently necessary in the immediate postoperative period to treat intraoperative blood loss.

Abdominal distention and paralytic ileus are fairly common after renal and ureter surgery and are thought to be due to a reflex paralysis of intestinal peristalsis and manipulation of the colon or duodenum during surgery. Abdominal distention is relieved by decompression through a nasogastric tube (see Chap. 38 for treatment of paralytic ileus). Oral fluids are permitted when the passage of flatus is noted.

If infection occurs, antibiotic agents are prescribed after a culture reveals the causative organism. The toxic effects that antibiotic agents have on the kidneys (nephrotoxicity) must be kept in mind when assessing the patient. Low-dose heparin therapy may be initiated postoperatively to prevent thromboembolism in patients who had any type of urologic surgery.

\section*{Drainage Tubes}

Almost all patients undergoing kidney and urologic surgery, as well as patients with other kidney and urologic disturbances, have drains, tubes, or catheters in place. All catheters and tubes must be kept patent (eg, draining) to prevent obstruction by blood clots, which can cause infection, kidney damage, or severe pain (similar to renal colic) when they pass along the ureter.

\section*{Nephrostomy Drainage}

A nephrostomy tube is inserted directly into the kidney for temporary or permanent urinary diversion. It can be inserted either percutaneously or through a surgical incision. A single tube or a self-retaining U loop or circular nephrostomy tube may be used and is attached to a closed drainage system or to a urostomy appliance. Nephrostomy drainage may be required to provide drainage from the kidney after surgery or to bypass an obstruction in the ureter or lower urinary tract. Permanent nephrostomy tubes are usually changed every 3 months.

Percutaneous nephrostomy is the insertion of a tube through the skin into the renal pelvis. This procedure is performed to provide external drainage of urine from an obstructed ureter, to create a route for inserting a ureteral stent (see following discussion), to dilate strictures, to close fistulas, to administer medications, to allow insertion of a brush biopsy instrument and nephroscope, or to perform selected surgical procedures.

The skin site is prepared and anesthetized, and the patient is asked to inhale and hold his or her breath while a spinal needle is advanced into the renal pelvis. Urine is aspirated for culture, and a contrast agent may be injected into the pyelocalyceal system. An angiographic catheter guide wire is introduced through the needle to the kidney. The needle is withdrawn and the tract dilated by the passage of tubes or guide wires. The nephrostomy tube is introduced and positioned within the kidney or ureter, fixed by skin sutures, and connected to a closed drainage system.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 44-10 Patient positioning and incisional approaches ( $\mathbf{A}$, flank; $\mathbf{B}$, lumbar; $\mathbf{C}$, thoracoabdominal) for kidney surgery are associated with significant postoperative discomfort.}
\end{figure}

Before a percutaneous nephrostomy tube is inserted, several precautions should be taken. The patient should receive a broadspectrum antibiotic to prevent infection. Bleeding disorders and uncontrolled hypertension should be corrected. Also, anticoagulant agents and aspirin should be discontinued and bleeding study results (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count) should be normal to decrease the chance of developing a perirenal hematoma or renal hemorrhage. Chart 44-12 describes postsurgical nursing care of the patient with a nephrostomy tube (also see Chart 44-13).

\section*{Ureteral Stents}

A ureteral stent is a self-retaining tubular device that helps maintain the position and patency of the ureter. Stents are used to maintain urine flow in patients with ureteral obstruction (from edema, stricture, fibrosis, calculi, or tumors), to divert urine, to promote healing, and to maintain the caliber and patency of the ureter after surgery (Fig. 44-11). Stents are usually removed 4 to 6 weeks after surgery in an outpatient setting without the need for general anesthesia or risk of ureteral injury.

The stent, usually made of soft, flexible silicone, may be inserted through a cystoscope or nephrostomy tube or by open surgery. Complications include infection, inflammation secondary to a foreign body in the genitourinary tract, tube encrustation, bleeding or clot obstruction within the stent, and migration or displacement of the stent (Lehmann \& Dietz, 2002).

Several stents are designed to avoid some of these problems. The double-J ureteral stent has a J-shaped curve molded into each end that prevents upward or downward migration. This stent can be used in place of a nephrostomy for short- or long-term urinary drainage. The double-pigtail ureteral stent has a pigtail coil at each end; this permits placement of the upper coil (pigtail) in the renal pelvis, with the lower coil at the ureteral orifice. The coils prevent the stent from moving and allow free body movement.

Nursing interventions related to the care of a patient with a ureteral stent include monitoring the patient for bleeding, assessing and measuring urine output, assessing the patient for signs of

\section*{Patient Care After a Nephrostomy}
- Assess patient for complications: bleeding at nephrostomy site (main complication) or hematuria, fistula formation, infection.
- Assess skin at nephrostomy exit site for bleeding, signs of inflammation or infection, leakage of urine, and skin irritation.
- Ensure unobstructed drainage of nephrostomy tube or catheter. Obstruction causes pain, trauma, pressure, infection, and stress on suture lines.
- If the tube dislodges, report immediately. The surgeon must replace the tube immediately to prevent the opening from contracting.
- Never clamp a nephrostomy tube, which could cause obstruction and resultant pyelonephritis.
- Never irrigate a nephrostomy tube without specific orders.
- Encourage fluid intake to promote natural flushing of the kidney and nephrostomy tube.
- Using aseptic technique, apply dry dressing at nephrostomy exit site; replace dressing as needed.
- Measure urine output from the nephrostomy tube. If both kidneys have a tube in place, measure output from each tube separately.
urinary tract infection or retroperitoneal infection from leakage of urine, and monitoring the patient for stent displacement, which is evidenced by colicky pain and a decrease in urine output. An indwelling stent may produce a local ureteral reaction, including mucosal edema, which can cause temporary obstruction of the ureter and intense pain.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING KIDNEY SURGERY}

\section*{Assessment}

Immediate care of the patient who has undergone surgery of the kidney includes assessment of all body systems. Respiratory and circulatory status, pain level, fluid and electrolyte status, and patency and adequacy of urinary drainage systems are assessed.

\section*{RESPIRATORY STATUS}

As with any surgery, the use of anesthesia increases the risk of respiratory complications. Noting the location of the surgical incision assists the nurse in anticipating respiratory problems and pain. Respiratory status is assessed by monitoring the rate, depth, and pattern of respirations. The location of the incision frequently causes pain on inspiration and coughing; therefore, the patient tends to splint the chest wall and take shallow respirations. Auscultation is performed to assess normal and adventitious breath sounds.

\section*{CIRCULATORY STATUS AND BLOOD LOSS}

The vital signs and arterial or central venous pressure are monitored. Skin color and temperature and urine output provide information about circulatory status. The surgical incision and drainage tubes are observed frequently to help detect unexpected blood loss and hemorrhage.

\section*{PAIN}

Postoperative pain is a major problem for the patient because of the location of the surgical incision and the position the patient assumed on the operating table to permit access to the kidney. The location and severity of pain are assessed before and after analgesic medications are administered. Abdominal distention, which increases discomfort, is also noted.

\section*{URINARY DRAINAGE}

Urine output and drainage from tubes inserted during surgery are monitored for amount, color, and type or characteristics. Decreased or absent drainage is promptly reported to the physician because it may indicate obstruction that could cause pain, infection, and disruption of the suture lines.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the history and assessment data and the type of surgical procedure performed, some major nursing diagnoses for the patient include the following (additional diagnoses and interventions appear in the Plan of Nursing Care):
- Ineffective airway clearance related to the location of the surgical incision
- Ineffective breathing pattern related to surgical incision and general anesthesia

\section*{Chart 44-13 - PATIENT EDUCATION}

\section*{Caring for Nephrostomy Equipment at Home}

Review the following recommendations with patients going home with a percutaneous nephrostomy tube:
- Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day (unless otherwise directed by the physician).
- Avoid kinking, clamping, or twisting the nephrostomy tube.
- Always keep the drainage bag below the waist.
- During the day, connect the nephrostomy tube to a leg bag (left) and wear it under clothing. At night, connect it to a large bedside drainage bag.
- When connecting to the leg bag or large drainage bag (right), wear gloves and clean the ends of the nephrostomy tube and connecting tube with alcohol.
- Change the dressing around the nephrostomy tube at least once a week. It may be changed daily if preferred.
- Avoid getting the dressing wet during showering or bathing.
- Clean the drainage tube and bag daily after each use with warm soapy water. Rinse well to remove the soap. The bag may be disinfected and deodorized using a solution of 1 tablespoon bleach and 2 cups water.
- Notify the physician immediately if the nephrostomy tube comes out, if large amounts of urine leak around the tube, if urine volume decreases, or if fever, back pain, or cloudy, foulsmelling urine develops.

- Acute pain related to the location of the surgical incision, the position the patient assumed on the operating table during surgery, and abdominal distention
- Urine retention related to pain, immobility, and anesthesia

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Bleeding
- Pneumonia
- Infection
- Fluid disturbances (deficit or excess)
- Deep vein thrombosis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include maintenance of effective airway clearance and breathing pattern, relief of pain and discomfort, maintenance of urinary elimination, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{MAINTAINING AIRWAY CLEARANCE AND BREATHING PATTERNS}

The surgical approaches to the kidney predispose the patient to respiratory complications and paralytic ileus. If the pleural cavity has been entered during surgery, a pneumothorax may occur, necessitating insertion of a chest tube. The incision is generally close to the diaphragm, and with a substernal incision, the nerves may be stretched and bruised. These factors can lead to pain and limited chest movement during inspiration; breathing patterns are altered or ineffective when the chest cannot fully expand. If the patient cannot generate an effective cough, either because of pain at the incision site and restricted movement or because of anesthesia, ineffective airway clearance may result.

Adequate use of analgesic medications is necessary to relieve pain so that the patient can take deep breaths and cough. When the analgesia is administered at regular, frequent intervals, the patient can perform deep-breathing and coughing exercises more effectively. The incentive spirometer (see Chap. 25) may be used to help maximize lung inflation. The patient is encouraged to cough after each deep breath to loosen secretions.

\end{figure}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

In addition to pain at the incision site, the patient may experience pain and discomfort from distention of the renal capsule (by tumor or blood clot), ischemia (from occlusion of blood vessels), and stretching of the intrarenal blood vessels. Muscle aches and pain stemming from the position the patient assumed on the operating table, which places anatomic and physiologic stresses on the body, are also common. Massage, moist heat, and analgesic medications provide relief. Patient-controlled analgesia may be effective in controlling pain and enabling the patient to ambulate, cough, and breathe deeply (see Chap. 13 for discussion of patient-controlled analgesia).

\section*{PROMOTING URINARY ELIMINATION}

The nurse closely monitors urine output and drainage to identify complications and to preserve and protect remaining kidney function (by preventing obstruction and infection). The output from each urinary drainage tube is recorded separately; accurate output measurements are essential in monitoring renal function and ensuring the patency of the urinary drainage system.

Strict asepsis is used when manipulating the drainage catheter and tube. Hand hygiene is mandatory before and after touching any parts of the system. Use of closed drainage systems is essential to avoid contamination of the system and infection. Urinary drainage is monitored closely for changes in volume, color, odor, and components. Urinalysis and urine cultures are indicated to follow the patient's progress. Care is taken to ensure that the collection bag is suspended below the bladder to prevent reflux of urine into the urinary tract. The bag must be kept off the floor to prevent contamination.

Most urinary drainage systems do not require routine irrigation. If irrigation is necessary and prescribed, however, it should be performed carefully, with the use of sterile solution; with minimal pressure, consistent with the physician's instructions; and with strict asepsis without interruption of the closed drainage system.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Bleeding is a major complication of kidney surgery. If undetected and untreated, bleeding can result in hypovolemia and hemorrhagic shock. The nurse's role is to observe for these complications, to report their signs and symptoms, and to administer prescribed parenteral fluids and blood and blood components if complications occur. Monitoring of vital signs, skin condition, urinary drainage system, surgical incision, and level of consciousness is necessary to detect evidence of bleeding, decreased circulating blood, and fluid volume and cardiac output. Frequent monitoring of vital signs (initially monitored at least at hourly intervals) and urinary output is necessary for early detection of these complications.

If bleeding goes undetected or is late in being detected, the patient may lose significant amounts of blood and may experience hypoxemia. In addition to hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage, this type of blood loss may precipitate a myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack. Bleeding may be suspected when the patient experiences fatigue and when urine output is less than 30 mL per hour. As bleeding persists, late signs of hypovolemia occur, such as cool skin, flat neck veins, and change in level of consciousness or responsiveness. Transfusions of blood components are indicated, along with surgical repair of the bleeding vessel.

Pneumonia may be prevented through use of an incentive spirometer, adequate pain control, and early ambulation. Early signs of pneumonia include fever, increased heart and respiratory rates, and adventitious breath sounds.

Preventing infection is the rationale for using asepsis when changing dressings and preparing catheters, other drainage tubes, central venous catheters, and intravenous catheters for administration of fluids. Insertion sites are monitored closely for signs and symptoms of inflammation: redness, drainage, heat, and pain. Special care must be taken to prevent urinary tract infection, which is associated with the use of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheters and other invasive tubes are removed as soon they are no longer needed.

Antibiotic agents are commonly administered postoperatively to prevent infection. If antibiotic agents are prescribed, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels must be monitored closely because many antibiotic agents are toxic to the kidney or can accumulate to toxic levels if renal function is decreased.

Preventing fluid imbalance is critical when caring for a patient undergoing kidney surgery, because both fluid loss and fluid excess are possible adverse effects of the surgery. Fluid loss may occur during surgery as a result of excessive urinary drainage when the obstruction is removed, or it may occur if diuretic agents are used. Such loss may also occur with gastrointestinal losses, with diarrhea resulting from antibiotic use or with nasogastric drainage. When postoperative intravenous therapy is inadequate to match the output or fluids lost, a fluid deficit results. Fluid excess, or overload, may result from cardiac effects of anesthesia, administration of excessive amounts of fluids, or the patient's inability to excrete fluid because of changes in renal function. Decreased urine output may be an indication of fluid excess.

Astute assessment skills are needed to detect early signs of fluid excess (such as weight gain, pedal edema, urine output below

Fluid excess may be treated with fluid restriction and administration of furosemide (Lasix) or other diuretic agents. If renal insufficiency is present, these medications may prove ineffective; therefore, dialysis may be necessary to prevent heart failure and pulmonary edema.

Deep vein thrombosis may occur postoperatively because of surgical manipulation of the iliac vessels during surgery. Elastic compression stockings are applied, and the patient is monitored closely for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and encouraged to exercise the legs. Heparin may be administered postoperatively to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Specific nursing interventions for the patient undergoing kidney surgery are presented in the Plan of Nursing Care.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

If the patient has a drainage system in place, measures are taken to ensure that both patient and family understand the importance of maintaining the system correctly at home and preventing infection. Verbal and written instructions and guidelines are provided to the patient and family at the time of hospital discharge. The patient may be asked to demonstrate management of the drainage system to ensure understanding. The importance of strategies to prevent postoperative complications (urinary tract infection and
obstruction, deep vein thrombosis, atelectasis, and pneumonia) is stressed to the patient and family. Those signs, symptoms, problems, and questions that should be referred to the physician or other primary health care provider are reviewed by the nurse with the patient and family.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The need for postoperative assessment and care after renal surgery continues regardless of setting: the home, subacute care unit, outpatient clinic or office, or rehabilitation setting. Referral for home care is indicated for the patient going home with a urinary drainage system in place. During the home visit, the home care nurse reviews the instructions and guidelines given to the patient at hospital discharge. The nurse assesses the patient's ability to carry out the instructions in the home and answers questions that the patient or family has about management of the drainage system and the surgical incision.

Additionally, the home care nurse obtains vital signs and assesses the patient for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection and obstruction. The nurse also ensures that pain is adequately controlled and that the patient is complying with recommendations. The home care nurse encourages adequate fluid intake and increased levels of activity. Together the nurse, patient, and family review the signs, symptoms, problems, and questions that should be referred to the physician or other primary health care provider. If the patient has a drainage tube in place, the nurse assesses the site and the patency of the system and monitors the patient for complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, bleeding, or pneumonia.

Because it is easy for the patient, family, and health care team to focus on the patient's immediate disorder to the exclusion of other health issues, reminding the patient and family about the importance of participating in health promotion activities, including health screening, is key.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 50-year-old woman comes in for her annual pelvic checkup with complaints of occasional urinary urgency, sometimes with "near incontinence" just as she is reaching the toilet. She denies intake of any potentially bladderirritating substances, such as beverages containing caffeine or synthetic sweeteners. She also mentions that she is having difficulty with decreased lubrication during intercourse and that her menses are very irregular. On physical examination,
you notice some thinning of the vaginal mucosa. Based on your understanding of the major role that estrogen plays in maintaining continence, discuss your plan for patient education.
2. You are a staff nurse in an outpatient dialysis facility. A middle-aged man with renal failure secondary to poorly controlled diabetes is scheduled to be seen in the clinic; it is anticipated that he will need dialysis in the near future. The physician has asked you to teach the patient and his wife about his dialysis options. Describe how you would develop a teaching plan to explain the different types of dialysis, their goals, and the level of involvement on the part of the patient and family. How would you modify your approach if the patient is distraught and does not seem to hear what you are saying?
3. A 45-year-old married woman with three teenage children visits the nephrology department to discuss options for dealing with her ESRD. Her healthy twin sister has begun the workup to donate one of her kidneys to her sister, and the preliminary reports show that a match is possible. The patient states that she does not want her sister to go through the process of kidney donation if dialysis is a possibility. As the nurse educator, you know that research demonstrates much higher rates of allograft success in individuals who have never undergone dialysis. Discuss the emotional aspects that are important to address in communication with this woman.
4. You are taking phone triage as one of the nurses in a busy urology practice. A 62-year-old man who has just been seen in consultation for increasing urinary frequency, including several awakenings at night, phones to report increasing abdominal pain. He notes that he has not voided for over 12 hours, although he has made several unsuccessful attempts. Based on your understanding of benign prostatic hyperplasia, explain the instructions you would provide to him. What medical and nursing interventions would you anticipate?

\title{
Management of Patients With Urinary Disorders
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}
on completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Identify factors contributing to urinary tract infections.
2. Develop a teaching plan for the patient with urinary tract infection.
3. Compare and contrast pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, and the nephrotic syndrome: causes, pathophysiologic changes, clinical manifestations, management, and nursing care.
4. Describe causes of acute and chronic renal failure.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for the care of patients with acute renal failure.
6. Use the nursing process as a framework for the care of patients with chronic renal failure.
7. Develop a postoperative plan of nursing care and teaching plan for the patient undergoing kidney transplantation.
8. Describe management strategies for renal calculi (kidney stones).
9. Develop a teaching plan for the patient undergoing treatment for renal calculi (kidney stones).
10. Formulate preoperative and postoperative nursing diagnoses for the patient undergoing surgery for urinary diversion.
11. Describe interstitial cystitis and its physical and psychological effects on the patient.

Disorders of the lower and upper urinary tracts range from easily treated infections to life-threatening disorders that necessitate organ replacement or long-term treatment with dialysis. Recent advances in pharmacotherapeutics and technology have improved the diagnostic and treatment possibilities for these disorders. Additionally, many disorders that once required surgical intervention and prolonged recuperation can now be treated with noninvasive, nonsurgical techniques.

\section*{Infections of the Urinary Tract}

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by pathogenic microorganisms in the urinary tract (the normal urinary tract is sterile above the urethra). UTIs are generally classified as infections involving the upper or lower urinary tract (Chart 45-1).

Lower UTIs include bacterial cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder), bacterial prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland), and bacterial urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). There can be acute or chronic nonbacterial causes of inflammation in any of these areas that can be misdiagnosed as bacterial infections. Upper UTIs are much less common and include acute or chronic pyelonephritis (inflammation of the renal pelvis), interstitial nephritis (inflammation of the kidney), and renal abscesses. Upper and lower UTIs are further classified as uncomplicated or complicated, depending on other patient-related conditions (for example, whether the UTI is recurrent and the duration of the infection). Most uncomplicated UTIs are community-acquired. Complicated UTIs usually occur in people with urologic abnormalities or recent catheterization and are often hospital-acquired. Bacteriuria and UTIs are more common in persons older than 65 years of age than in younger adults. Conservative estimates suggest that $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of ambulatory women and $10 \%$ of men in this age group have asymptomatic bacteriuria; the incidence rises to $50 \%$ in women over the age of 80 (Gomolin \& McCue, 2000).

A UTI is one of the most common reasons patients seek health care. Most cases occur in women, with one of every five women in the United States developing a UTI sometime during her lifetime. The urinary tract is the most common site of nosocomial infection, accounting for greater than $40 \%$ of the total number

\section*{Chemp 45-1 Classifying Urinary Tract Infections}

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are classified by location: the lower urinary tract (which includes the bladder and structures below the bladder) or the upper urinary tract (which includes the kidneys and ureters). They can also be classified as uncomplicated or complicated UTI.
Lower UTI
Cystitis, prostatitis, urethritis
Upper UTI
Acute pyelonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis, renal abscess, interstitial nephritis, perirenal abscess
Uncomplicated Lower or Upper UTI
Community-acquired infection; common in young women
Complicated Lower or Upper UTI
Often nosocomial (acquired in the hospital) and related to catheterization; occurs in patients with urologic abnormalities, pregnancy, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, obstructions
reported by hospitals and affecting about 600,000 patients each year. In most of these hospital-acquired UTIs, instrumentation of the urinary tract or catheterization is the precipitating cause. More than 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis occur in the United States each year, with 100,000 of these patients requiring hospitalization. In general, 7 to 8 million UTIs are diagnosed in the United States annually, representing an expenditure of about $\$ 1$ billion in direct heath care costs. This amount does not include the indirect costs associated with time lost from work and the negative impact on the individual's lifestyle (Foxman, 2002).

\section*{LOWER URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS}

Several mechanisms maintain the sterility of the bladder: the physical barrier of the urethra, urine flow, ureterovesical junction competence, various antibacterial enzymes and antibodies, and antiadherent effects mediated by the mucosal cells of the bladder. Abnormalities or dysfunctions of these mechanisms are contributing factors to lower UTIs (Chart 45-2).
acute tubular necrosis: type of acute renal failure in which there is actual damage to the kidney tubules
bacteriuria: more than $10^{5}$ colonies of bacteria per milliliter of urine
continent urinary diversion (Koch, Indiana, Charleston pouch): transplantation of the ureters to a segment of bowel with construction of an effective continence mechanism or valve
cutaneous ureterostomy: procedure in which the distal ureter is detached from the bladder, brought through the abdominal wall, and attached to an opening in the skin
cystectomy: removal of the urinary bladder
cystitis: inflammation of the urinary bladder
end-stage renal disease (ESRD): progressive, irreversible deterioration in renal
function that results in retention of uremic waste products
glomerulonephritis: inflammation of the glomerular capillaries
ileal conduit: transplantation of the ureters to an isolated section of the terminal ileum, with one end of the ureters brought to the abdominal wall
interstitial cystitis: inflammation of the bladder wall that eventually causes disintegration of the lining and loss of bladder elasticity
interstitial nephritis: inflammation of the renal interstitial tissue, often due to use of medications or exposure to chemicals
nephrosclerosis: hardening, or sclerosis, of the arteries of the kidney due to prolonged hypertension
nephrotic syndrome: disorder characterized by proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminuria, and hyperlipidemia
prostatitis: inflammation of the prostate gland
pyelonephritis: inflammation of the renal pelvis
pyuria: white blood cells in the urine
urethritis: inflammation of the urethra
ureterosigmoidostomy: transplantation of the ureters into the sigmoid colon, allowing urine to flow through the colon and out the rectum
ureterovesical or vesicoureteral reflux: backward flow of urine from the bladder into one or both ureters
urethrovesical reflux: backward flow of urine from the urethra into the bladder
urinary casts: protein plugs secreted by damaged kidney tubules

\section*{Pathophysiology}

For infection to occur, bacteria must gain access to the bladder, attach to and colonize the epithelium of the urinary tract to avoid being washed out with voiding, evade host defense mechanisms, and initiate inflammation. Most UTIs result from fecal organisms that ascend from the perineum to the urethra and the bladder and then adhere to the mucosal surfaces.

\section*{BACTERIAL INVASION OF THE URINARY TRACT}

By increasing the normal slow shedding of bladder epithelial cells (resulting in bacteria removal), the bladder can clear itself of even large numbers of bacteria. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG), a hydrophilic protein, normally exerts a nonadherent protective effect against various bacteria. The GAG molecule attracts water molecules, forming a water barrier that serves as a defensive layer between the bladder and the urine. GAG may be impaired by certain agents (cyclamate, saccharin, aspartame, and tryptophan metabolites). The normal bacterial flora of the vagina and urethral area also interfere with adherence of Escherichia coli (the most common microorganism causing UTI). Urinary immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the urethra may also provide a barrier to bacteria.

\section*{REFLUX}

An obstruction to free-flowing urine is a problem known as urethrovesical reflux, which is the reflux (backward flow) of urine from the urethra into the bladder (Fig. 45-1). With coughing, sneezing, or straining, the bladder pressure rises, which may force urine from the bladder into the urethra. When the pressure returns to normal, the urine flows back into the bladder, bringing into the bladder bacteria from the anterior portions of the urethra. Urethrovesical reflux is also caused by dysfunction of the bladder neck or urethra. The urethrovesical angle and urethral closure pressure may be altered with menopause, increasing the incidence of infection in postmenopausal women. Reflux is most often noted, however, in young children. Treatment is based on its severity.

Ureterovesical or vesicoureteral reflux refers to the backward flow of urine from the bladder into one or both ureters (see Fig. 45-1). Normally, the ureterovesical junction prevents urine from traveling back into the ureter. The ureters tunnel into the

bladder wall so that the bladder musculature compresses a small portion of the ureter during normal voiding. When the ureterovesical valve is impaired by congenital causes or ureteral abnormalities, the bacteria may reach and eventually destroy the kidneys.

\section*{UROPATHOGENIC BACTERIA}

Bacteriuria is generally defined as more than $10^{5}$ colonies of bacteria per milliliter of urine. Because urine samples (especially in women) are commonly contaminated by the bacteria normally present in the urethral area, a bacterial count exceeding $10^{5}$ colonies $/ \mathrm{mL}$ of clean-catch midstream urine is the measure that distinguishes true bacteriuria from contamination. In men, contamination of the collected urine sample occurs less frequently; hence, bacteriuria can be defined as $10^{4}$ colonies $/ \mathrm{mL}$ urine. Community-acquired UTIs are among the most common bacterial infections in women (Gupta, Hooton \& Stamm, 2001).

The organisms most frequently responsible for UTIs are those normally found in the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In a largescale study of the types and prevalence of organisms of patients with UTIs in both the community and hospital setting, E. coli was responsible for $54.7 \%$ of urinary tract infections. Isolation of E. coli is decreasing in comparison to previous observations, especially in males and in patients with indwelling bladder catheters, who instead had higher rates of Pseudomonas and Enterococcus organisms than females and noncatheterized patients (Bonadio, Meini, Spitaleri \& Gigli, 2001).

\section*{ROUTES OF INFECTION}

There are three well-recognized routes by which bacteria enter the urinary tract: up the urethra (ascending infection), through the bloodstream, (hematogenous spread), or by means of a fistula from the intestine (direct extension).

The most common route of infection is transurethral, in which bacteria (often from fecal contamination) colonize the periurethral area and subsequently enter the bladder by means of the urethra. In women, the short urethra offers little resistance to the movement of uropathogenic bacteria. Sexual intercourse or massage of the urethra forces the bacteria up into the bladder. This accounts for the increased incidence of UTIs in sexually active women. Bacteria may also enter the urinary tract by means of the blood (hematogenous spread) from a distant site of infection or through direct extension by way of a fistula from the intestinal tract.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

A variety of signs and symptoms are associated with UTI. About half of all patients with bacteriuria have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms of uncomplicated lower UTI (cystitis) include frequent pain and burning on urination, frequency, urgency, nocturia, incontinence, and suprapubic or pelvic pain. Hematuria and back pain may also be present. In older individuals, these typical symptoms are seldom noted (see Gerontologic Considerations, below).

Signs and symptoms of upper UTI (pyelonephritis) include fever, chills, flank or low back pain, nausea and vomiting, headache, malaise, and painful urination. Physical examination reveals pain and tenderness in the area of the costovertebral angles (CVA), which are the angles formed on each side of the body by the bottom rib of the rib cage and the vertebral column (Fig. 45-2).

In patients with complicated UTIs, such as those with indwelling catheters, manifestations can range from asymptomatic bacteriuria to a gram-negative sepsis with shock. Complicated UTIs often are due to a broader spectrum of organisms, have a lower response rate to treatment, and tend to recur. Many patients with catheter-associated UTIs are asymptomatic; however,

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-321.jpg?height=936&width=795&top_left_y=1615&top_left_x=138}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 45-2 Location of the costovertebral angle.}
\end{figure}
any patient who suddenly develops signs and symptoms of septic shock should be evaluated for urosepsis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Results of various tests, such as colony counts, cellular studies, and urine cultures, help confirm the UTI diagnosis. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all pregnant women be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria since pregnancy itself is a risk factor for UTI because the bladder does not empty as well as it normally does. In an uncomplicated UTI, the strain of bacteria will determine the antibiotic of choice.

\section*{COLONY COUNTS}

UTI is diagnosed by bacteria in the urine. A colony count of at least $10^{5}$ colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of urine on a clean-catch midstream or catheterized specimen is a major criterion for infection. However, UTI and subsequent sepsis have occurred with lower bacterial colony counts. About one third of women with symptoms of acute infections have negative midstream urine culture results and may go untreated if $10^{5} \mathrm{CFU} / \mathrm{mL}$ is used as the criterion for infection. The presence of any bacteria in specimens obtained by suprapubic needle aspiration of the urinary bladder or catheterization is considered indicative of infection.

\section*{CELLULAR STUDIES}

Microscopic hematuria (greater than 4 red blood cells [RBCs] per high-power field) is present in about half of patients with acute infection. Pyuria (greater than 4 white blood cells [WBCs] per high-power field) occurs in all patients with UTI; however, it is not specific for bacterial infection. Pyuria can also be seen with kidney stones, interstitial nephritis, and renal tuberculosis.

\section*{URINE CULTURES}

Urine cultures remain the gold standard in documenting a UTI and can identify the specific organism present. Because of the high probability that the organism in young women with their first UTI is E. coli, cultures are often omitted. The following groups of patients should have urine cultures obtained when bacteriuria is present:
- All men (because of the likelihood of structural or functional abnormalities)
- All children
- Women with a history of compromised immune function or renal problems
- Patients with diabetes mellitus
- Patients who have undergone recent instrumentation (including catheterization) of the urinary tract
- Patients who were hospitalized recently
- Patients with prolonged or persistent symptoms
- Patients with three or more UTIs in the past year
- Pregnant women
- Postmenopausal women
- Women who are sexually active or have new partners

\section*{TESTING METHODS}

Multistrip dipstick testing for WBCs, known as the leukocyte esterase test, and nitrite testing (Griess nitrate reduction test) are common. If the leukocyte esterase test is positive, it is assumed that the patient has pyuria (WBCs in the urine) and should be
treated. The Griess nitrate reduction test is considered positive if bacteria that reduce normal urinary nitrates to nitrites are present.

Tests for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) may be performed because acute urethritis caused by sexually transmitted organisms (ie, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, herpes simplex) or acute vaginitis infections (caused by Trichomonas or Candida species) may be responsible for symptoms similar to those of UTI. Therefore, evaluation for STDs may be performed (see Chap. 70).

Historically, intravenous pyelography (IVP) was used to detect abnormalities in patients at high risk for complicated or recurring UTI. Today, diagnostic studies such as computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography are preferred detection methods for several reasons: CT scans may detect areas of pyelonephritis or abscesses, and ultrasonography is extremely sensitive for detecting obstruction, abscesses, tumors, and cysts. Transrectal ultrasonography (to assess the prostate and bladder) is the procedure of choice for men with recurrent or complicated UTIs. An IVP may be indicated to visualize the ureters or to detect strictures or stones and is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of reflux nephropathy. It is generally accepted that the first episode of UTI in women does not require urologic evaluation (Hooton, Scholes, Stapleton et al., 2000).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The incidence of bacteriuria in the elderly differs from that in younger adults. Bacteriuria increases with age and disability, and women are affected more frequently than men. UTI is the most common cause of acute bacterial sepsis in patients older than 65 years of age, in whom gram-negative sepsis carries a mortality rate exceeding 50\%. Urologists see many asymptomatic older patients with bacteriuria, and these individuals represent $20 \%$ of women over the age of 65 . In the nursing home environment, up to $50 \%$ of females have asymptomatic bacteriuria (Foxman, 2002).

In the elderly population at large, structural abnormalities and neurogenic bladder secondary to strokes or autonomic neuropathy of diabetes may prevent complete emptying of the bladder and increase the risk for UTI. When indwelling catheters are used, the risk for UTI rises dramatically as two or more different strains of bacteria can be found in the urine of catheterized patients: in the urine itself, and on the surface of the catheter. Elderly women often have incomplete emptying of the bladder and urinary stasis. In the absence of estrogen, postmenopausal women are susceptible to colonization and increased adherence of bacteria to the vagina and urethra. Oral or topical estrogen has been used to restore the glycogen content of vaginal epithelial cells and an acidic pH for some postmenopausal women with recurrent cystitis. Local estrogen replacement may reduce the rate of UTIs in postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs (Raz, 2001).

The antibacterial activity of prostatic secretions that protects men from bacterial colonization of the urethra and bladder decreases with aging. Although UTIs are rare in men, the prevalence of infection in men older than 50 years of age approaches that of women in the same age group. The dramatic rise in UTI in men as they age is due largely to prostatic hyperplasia or carcinoma, strictures of the urethra, and neuropathic bladder. The use of catheterization or cystoscopy in evaluation or treatment may contribute further to the higher incidence of UTI. The incidence of bacteriuria rises in men with confusion, dementia, or bowel or bladder incontinence. The most common cause of recurrent UTI in the elderly male patient is chronic bacterial prostatitis.

Transurethral resection of the prostate gland may help to reduce its incidence (see Chap. 49).

In institutionalized elderly patients, such as those in nursing homes, infecting pathogens are often resistant to many antibiotics. Factors that may contribute to UTI in elderly nursing home patients include: high incidence of chronic illness; frequent use of antimicrobial agents; infected pressure ulcers; immobility and incomplete emptying of the bladder; and use of a bedpan rather than a commode or toilet (Chart 45-3).

Diligent hand hygiene, careful perineal care, and frequent toileting may decrease the incidence of UTIs in nursing home patients. The organisms responsible for UTIs in the institutionalized elderly may differ from those found in patients residing in the community; this is thought to be due in part to the frequent use of antibiotic agents by patients in nursing homes. E. coli is the most common organism seen in elderly patients in the community or hospital. Patients with indwelling catheters, however, are more likely to be infected with Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, or Staphylococcus species. Patients who have been previously treated with antibiotics may be infected with Enterococcus species. Frequent reinfections are common in older adults.

The most common subjective presenting symptom of UTI in older adults is generalized fatigue. The most common objective finding is a change in cognitive functioning, especially in those with dementia, because these patients usually exhibit even more profound cognitive changes with the onset of a UTI.

> NURSING ALERT Elderly patients often lack the typical symptoms of UTI and sepsis. Although frequency, urgency, and dysuria may occur, nonspecific symptoms, such as altered sensorium, lethargy, anorexia, new incontinence, hyperventilation, and lowgrade fever, may be the only clues.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of UTIs typically involves pharmacologic therapy and patient education. The nurse is a key figure in teaching the patient about medication regimens and infection prevention measures.

Controversy continues about the need for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in the institutionalized elderly patient because resulting antibiotic-resistant organisms and sepsis may be greater threats to the patient. Most experts now recommend withholding antibiotics unless symptoms develop. Treatment regimens, however, are generally the same as those for younger adults, although age-related changes in the intestinal absorption of medications and decreased renal function and hepatic flow may necessitate alterations in the antimicrobial regimen. Renal function must be monitored and the dosage of medications altered accordingly.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Factors Contributing to Urinary Tract Infection in Older Adults
- High incidence of chronic illness
- Frequent use of antimicrobial agents
- Presence of infected pressure ulcers
- Immobility and incomplete emptying of bladder
- Use of a bedpan rather than a commode or toilet

\section*{ACUTE PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

The ideal treatment of UTI is an antibacterial agent that eradicates bacteria from the urinary tract with minimal effects on fecal and vaginal flora, thereby minimizing the incidence of vaginal yeast infections. (Yeast vaginitis occurs in as many as $25 \%$ of patients treated with antimicrobial agents that affect vaginal flora. Yeast vaginitis often causes more symptoms and is more difficult and costly to treat than the original UTI.) Additionally, the antibacterial agent should be affordable and should produce few adverse effects and low resistance. Because the organism in initial, uncomplicated UTIs in women is most likely E. coli or other fecal flora, the agent should be effective against these organisms. Various treatment regimens have been successful in treating uncomplicated lower UTIs in women: single-dose administration, short-course ( 3 to 4 days) medication regimens, or 7- to 10-day therapeutic courses. The trend is toward a shortened course of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated UTIs because about $80 \%$ of cases are cured after 3 days of treatment.

In a complicated UTI (ie, pyelonephritis), the general treatment of choice is usually a cephalosporin or an ampicillin/aminoglycoside combination. Patients in institutional settings may require 7 to 10 days of medication for the treatment to be effective. Other commonly used medications include trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ, Bactrim, Septra) and nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin, Furadantin). Occasionally, medications such as ampicillin or amoxicillin are used, but E. coli organisms have developed resistance to these agents. Recent clinical trials comparing the use of TMP-SMZ and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (Cipro) found ciprofloxacin to be significantly more effective in community-based patients and in nursing home residents (Gomolin \& McCue, 2000; Talan et al., 2000).

Levofloxacin (Levaquin), another fluoroquinolone, is a good choice for short-course therapy of uncomplicated, mild to moderate UTI. Clinical trial data show high patient compliance with the 3-day regimen ( $95.6 \%$ ) and a high eradication rate for all pathogens ( $96.4 \%$ ). Before using levofloxacin in patients with complicated UTIs, the causative pathogen should be identified. Levofloxacin is used only when generic and less costly antibiotics are likely to be ineffective (Bonapace et al., 2000).

Nitrofurantoin should not be used in patients with renal insufficiency because it is ineffective at glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) of less than $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ and may cause peripheral neuropathy. Phenazopyridine (Pyridium), a urinary analgesic, may be prescribed to relieve the discomfort associated with the infection.

Regardless of the regimen prescribed, the patient is instructed to take all the doses prescribed, even if relief of symptoms occurs promptly. Longer medication courses are indicated for men, pregnant women, and women with pyelonephritis and other types of complicated UTIs. In pregnant women, amoxicillin, ampicillin, or an oral cephalosporin is used for 7 to 10 days.

\section*{LONG-TERM PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Although brief pharmacologic treatment of UTI for 3 days is usually adequate in women, infection recurs in about $20 \%$ of women treated for uncomplicated UTI. Infections that recur within 2 weeks after therapy (referred to as a relapse) do so because organisms of the original offending strain remain in the vagina. Relapses suggest that the source of bacteriuria may be the upper urinary tract or that initial treatment was inadequate or administered for too short a time. Recurrent infections in men are usually due to persistence of the same organism; further evaluation and treatment are indicated (Gupta et al., 2001; Hooton et al., 2000; Stamm, 2001).

Reinfection of the female patient with new bacteria is the reason for more than $90 \%$ of recurrent UTIs in women. If the diagnostic evaluation reveals no structural abnormalities in the urinary tract, the woman with recurrent UTIs may be instructed to begin treatment on her own whenever symptoms occur and to contact the health care provider only when symptoms persist, fever occurs, or the number of treatment episodes exceeds four in a 6 -month period. This patient may be taught to use dip-slide culture devices to detect bacteria.

If infection recurs after completing antimicrobial therapy, another short course ( 3 to 4 days) of full-dose antimicrobial therapy followed by a regular bedtime dose of an antimicrobial agent may be prescribed. If there is no recurrence, medication is taken every other night for 6 to 7 months. Other options include a dose of an antimicrobial agent after sexual intercourse, a dose at bedtime, or a dose every other night or three times per week. Long-term use of antimicrobial agents decreases the risk of reinfection and may be indicated in patients with recurrent infections.

If recurrence is caused by persistent bacteria from preceding infections, the cause (ie, kidney stone, abscess), if known, must be treated. After treatment and sterilization of the urine, low-dose preventive therapy (trimethoprim with or without sulfamethoxazole) each night at bedtime is often prescribed.

Evidence about the effectiveness of daily intake of cranberry extract or cranberry juice to prevent UTIs in women is conflicting, although most randomized studies point to a decrease in UTIs in women consuming daily cranberry juice (Kontiokari, Sundqvist \& Nuutinen, 2001).

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH LOWER URINARY TRACT INFECTION}

Nursing care of the patient with lower UTI focuses on treating the underlying infection and preventing its recurrence.

\section*{Assessment}

A history of signs and symptoms related to UTI is obtained from the patient with a suspected UTI. The presence of pain, frequency, urgency, and hesitancy and changes in urine are assessed, documented, and reported. The patient's usual pattern of voiding is assessed to detect factors that may predispose him or her to UTI. Infrequent emptying of the bladder, the association of symptoms of UTI with sexual intercourse, contraceptive practices, and personal hygiene are assessed. The patient's knowledge about prescribed antimicrobial medications and preventive health care measures is also assessed. Additionally, the urine is assessed for volume, color, concentration, cloudiness, and odor, all of which are altered by bacteria in the urinary tract.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to inflammation and infection of the urethra, bladder, and other urinary tract structures
- Deficient knowledge related to factors predisposing the patient to infection and recurrence, detection and prevention of recurrence, and pharmacologic therapy

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, the following complications may develop:
- Renal failure due to extensive damage of kidney
- Sepsis

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Major goals for the patient may include relief of pain and discomfort; increased knowledge of preventive measures and treatment modalities; and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The pain associated with UTI is quickly relieved once effective antimicrobial therapy is initiated. Antispasmodic agents may also be useful in relieving bladder irritability and pain. Aspirin and applying heat to the perineum help relieve pain and spasm. The patient is encouraged to drink liberal amounts of fluids (water is the best choice) to promote renal blood flow and to flush the bacteria from the urinary tract. Urinary tract irritants (eg, coffee, tea, citrus, spices, colas, alcohol) are avoided. Frequent voiding (every 2 to 3 hours) is encouraged to empty the bladder completely because this can significantly lower urine bacterial counts, reduce urinary stasis, and prevent reinfection.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Early recognition of UTI and prompt treatment are essential to prevent recurrent infection and the possibility of complications, such as renal failure and sepsis. The goal of treatment is to prevent infection from progressing and causing permanent renal damage and renal failure. Thus, the patient must be taught to recognize early signs and symptoms, to test for bacteriuria, and to initiate treatment as prescribed. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy, liberal fluid intake, frequent voiding, and hygienic measures are commonly prescribed for managing UTI. The patient is instructed to notify the physician if fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or pruritus occurs. Periodic monitoring of renal function (creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and serum creatinine levels) may be indicated for patients with repeated UTIs. If extensive renal damage does occur, dialysis may be necessary.

Patients with UTI, especially catheter-associated infection, are at increased risk for Gram-negative sepsis. Indwelling catheters should be avoided if possible and removed at the earliest opportunity (Thees \& Dreblow, 1999). If an indwelling catheter is necessary, however, specific nursing interventions are initiated to prevent infection (see Chap. 44). These include the following:
- Using strict aseptic technique during insertion of the smallest catheter possible
- Securing the catheter with tape to prevent movement
- Frequently inspecting urine color, odor, and consistency
- Performing meticulous daily perineal care with soap and water
- Maintaining a closed system
- Using the catheter's port to obtain urine specimens

Careful assessment of vital signs and level of consciousness may warn of impending sepsis. Blood cultures that are positive for infection and elevated WBC counts are reported to the physician. At the same time, appropriate antibiotic therapy and increased fluid
intake are prescribed (intravenous antibiotic therapy and fluids may be required). Preventing sepsis is key because the mortality rate for Gram-negative sepsis is significant, especially in elderly patients.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

In helping patients learn about and prevent or manage a recurrent UTI, the nurse needs to implement teaching that meets individual patient needs. For a detailed discussion of patient teaching interventions, see Chart 45-4.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Experiences relief of pain
a. Reports absence of pain, urgency, dysuria, or hesitancy on voiding
b. Takes analgesic and antibiotic agents as prescribed
2. Explains UTIs and their treatment
a. Demonstrates knowledge of preventive measures and prescribed treatments
b. Drinks 8 to 10 glasses of fluids daily
c. Voids every 2 to 3 hours
d. Voids urine that is clear and odorless
3. Experiences no complications
a. Reports no symptoms of infection (fever, dysuria, frequency) or renal failure (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, pruritus)
b. Has normal BUN and serum creatinine levels, negative urine and blood cultures
c. Exhibits normal vital signs and temperature; no signs or symptoms of sepsis
d. Maintains adequate urine output more than 30 mL per hour

\section*{UPPER URINARY TRACT INFECTION: ACUTE PYELONEPHRITIS}

Pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the renal pelvis, tubules, and interstitial tissue of one or both kidneys. Upper UTIs are associated with the antibody coating of the bacteria in the urine. (This occurs in the renal medulla; when the bacteria are excreted in the urine, the immunofluorescent test can detect the antibody coating.) Bacteria reach the bladder by means of the urethra and ascend to the kidney. Although the kidneys receive $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of the cardiac output, bacteria rarely reach the kidneys from the blood: fewer than $3 \%$ of cases are due to hematogenous spread (Warren et al., 1999).

Pyelonephritis is frequently secondary to ureterovesical reflux, in which an incompetent ureterovesical valve allows the urine to back up (reflux) into the ureters (see Fig. 45-1). Urinary tract obstruction (which increases the susceptibility of the kidneys to infection), bladder tumors, strictures, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary stones are some of the other causes. Pyelonephritis may be acute or chronic.

Patients with acute pyelonephritis usually have enlarged kidneys with interstitial infiltrations of inflammatory cells. Abscesses may be noted on the renal capsule and at the corticomedullary junction. Eventually, atrophy and destruction of tubules and the glomeruli may result. When pyelonephritis becomes chronic, the kidneys become scarred, contracted, and nonfunctioning.

\section*{Chart 45-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION}

Preventing Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections

An objective of teaching about recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) is their prevention. Health-related behaviors that help prevent recurrent UTIs include implementing careful personal hygiene, increasing fluid intake to promote voiding and dilution of urine, urinating regularly and more frequently, and adhering to the therapeutic regimen.
Hygiene
- Shower rather than bathe in tub because bacteria in the bath water may enter the urethra.
- After each bowel movement, clean the perineum and urethral meatus from front to back. This will help reduce concentrations of pathogens at the urethral opening and, in women, the vaginal opening.
Fluid Intake
- Drink liberal amounts of fluids daily to flush out bacteria.
- Avoid coffee, tea, colas, alcohol, and other fluids that are urinary tract irritants.

Voiding Habits
- Void every 2 to 3 hours during the day and completely empty the bladder. This prevents overdistention of the bladder and compromised blood supply to the bladder wall. Both predispose the patient to UTI. Precautions expressly for women include the following: Void immediately after sexual intercourse. Take the prescribed single dose of an oral antimicrobial agent after sexual intercourse.

\section*{Therapy}
- Take medication exactly as prescribed.
- If bacteria continue to appear in the urine, long-term antimicrobial therapy may be required to prevent colonization of the periurethral area and recurrence of infection. The medication should be taken after emptying the bladder just before going to bed to ensure adequate concentration of the medication during the overnight period.
- For recurrent infection, consider acidification of the urine through ascorbic acid (vitamin C), $1,000 \mathrm{mg}$ daily, or cranberry juice.
- If prescribed, test urine for bacteria with recommended test devices, such as dip-slides (Microstix), as follows:
1. Wash around the urethral meatus several times, using different washcloths.
2. Collect a midstream urine specimen.
3. Remove a slide from its container, dip it into the urine sample, and return it to the container.
4. Incubate the slide at room temperature according to product directions.
5. Read the results by comparing the slide with the colony density chart provided with the product.
6. Begin therapy as directed, and complete the full prescribed course of medication.
7. Notify the health care provider if fever occurs or if signs and symptoms persist.
- Consult the health care provider regularly for follow-up, recurrence of symptoms, or infections nonresponsive to treatment.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient with acute pyelonephritis appears acutely ill with chills and fever, leukocytosis, bacteriuria and pyuria, flank pain, and CVA tenderness. In addition, symptoms of lower urinary tract involvement, such as dysuria and frequency, are common.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

An ultrasound study or a CT scan may be performed to locate any obstruction in the urinary tract. Relief of obstruction is essential to save the kidney from destruction. An IVP is rarely indicated during acute pyelonephritis because findings are normal in up to $75 \%$ of patients. Radionuclide imaging with gallium citrate and indium-111 ( $\mathrm{In}^{111}$ )-labeled WBCs may be useful to identify sites of infection that may not be visualized on CT scan or ultrasound. Urine culture and sensitivity tests are performed to determine the causative organism so that appropriate antimicrobial agents can be prescribed.

\section*{Medical Management}

Patients with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are usually treated as outpatients if they are not dehydrated, not experiencing nausea or vomiting, and not showing signs or symptoms of sepsis. In addition, they must be responsible and reliable to ensure that all medications are taken as prescribed. Other patients, including all pregnant women, may be hospitalized for at least 2 or 3 days of parenteral therapy. Oral agents may be substituted once the patient is afebrile and showing clinical improvement.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

For outpatients, a 2-week course of antibiotics is recommended because renal parenchymal disease is more difficult to eradicate than mucosal bladder infections. Commonly prescribed agents include TMP-SMZ, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin (Warren et al., 1999). These medications must be used with great caution if the patient has renal or liver dysfunction.

A possible problem in acute pyelonephritis treatment is a chronic or recurring symptomless infection persisting for months or years. After the initial antibiotic regimen, the patient may need antibiotic therapy for up to 6 weeks if evidence of a relapse is seen. A follow-up urine culture is done 2 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy to document clearing of the infection.

\section*{UPPER URINARY TRACT INFECTION: CHRONIC PYELONEPHRITIS}

Repeated bouts of acute pyelonephritis may lead to chronic pyelonephritis. Recent evidence suggests that chronic pyelonephritis is decreasing as a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), while renovascular disease is increasing as one of the most common causes for ESRD (Fatica, Port \& Young, 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient with chronic pyelonephritis usually has no symptoms of infection unless an acute exacerbation occurs. Noticeable signs and symptoms may include fatigue, headache, poor appetite, polyuria, excessive thirst, and weight loss. Persistent and recur-
ring infection may produce progressive scarring of the kidney, with renal failure the end result.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The extent of the disease is assessed by an intravenous urogram and measurements of creatinine clearance and BUN and creatinine levels. Bacteria, if detected in the urine, are eradicated if possible.

\section*{Complications}

Complications of chronic pyelonephritis include ESRD (from progressive loss of nephrons secondary to chronic inflammation and scarring), hypertension, and formation of kidney stones (from chronic infection with urea-splitting organisms).

\section*{Medical Management}

The choice of antimicrobial agent is based on which pathogen is identified through urine culture. If the urine cannot be made bacteria-free, nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMZ may be used to suppress bacterial growth. Impaired renal function alters the excretion of antimicrobial agents and necessitates careful monitoring of renal function, especially if the medications are potentially toxic to the kidneys.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient may require hospitalization or may be treated as an outpatient. When the patient is hospitalized, fluid intake and output are carefully measured and recorded. Unless contraindicated, fluids are encouraged (3 to $4 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) to dilute the urine, decrease burning on urination, and prevent dehydration. The nurse assesses the patient's temperature every 4 hours and administers antipyretic and antibiotic agents as prescribed. Often the patient is more comfortable on bed rest during the acute phase of the illness.

Patient teaching focuses on prevention of UTIs by consuming adequate fluids, emptying the bladder regularly, and performing recommended perineal hygiene. The importance of taking antimicrobial medications exactly as prescribed is stressed to the patient, as is the need for keeping follow-up appointments.

\section*{Primary Glomerular Diseases}

A variety of diseases can affect the glomerular capillaries, including acute and chronic glomerulonephritis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and nephrotic syndrome. In all of these disorders, the glomerular capillaries are primarily involved. Antigenantibody complexes form in the blood and become trapped in the glomerular capillaries (the filtering portion of the kidney), inducing an inflammatory response. IgG, the major immunoglobulin (antibody) found in the blood, can be detected in the glomerular capillary walls. The major clinical manifestations of glomerular injury include proteinuria, hematuria, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and alterations in excretion of sodium (leading to edema and hypertension).

\section*{ACUTE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS}

Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomerular capillaries. Acute glomerulonephritis is primarily a disease of children older than 2 years of age, but it can occur at nearly any age.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In most cases of acute glomerulonephritis, a group A betahemolytic streptococcal infection of the throat precedes the onset of glomerulonephritis by 2 to 3 weeks (Fig. 45-3). It may also follow impetigo (infection of the skin) and acute viral infections (upper respiratory tract infections, mumps, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B, and human immunodeficiency virus infection). In some patients, antigens outside the body (eg, medications, foreign serum) initiate the process, resulting in antigen-antibody complexes being deposited in the glomeruli. In other patients, the kidney tissue itself serves as the inciting antigen.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The primary presenting feature of acute glomerulonephritis is hematuria (blood in the urine), which may be microscopic (identifiable through microscopic examination) or macroscopic or gross (visible to the eye). The urine may appear cola-colored because of RBCs and protein plugs or casts. (RBC casts indicate glomerular injury.) Glomerulonephritis may be so mild, however, that hematuria is discovered incidentally through a routine microscopic urinalysis, or the disease may be so severe that the patient has acute renal failure with oliguria. Acute glomerulonephritis typically has

\end{figure}
an abrupt onset preceded by a latent period between the streptococcal infection and the first indications of renal involvement averaging 10 days.

Proteinuria (primarily albumin), which is present, is due to the increased permeability of the glomerular membrane. BUN and serum creatinine levels may rise as urine output drops. The patient may be anemic.

Some degree of edema and hypertension is noted in $75 \%$ of patients. In the more severe form of the disease, the patient also complains of headache, malaise, and flank pain. Tenderness over the CVA is common. Elderly patients may experience circulatory overload with dyspnea, engorged neck veins, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary edema. Atypical symptoms include confusion, somnolence, and seizures, which are often confused with the symptoms of a primary neurologic disorder.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In acute glomerulonephritis, the kidneys become large, swollen, and congested. All renal tissues-glomeruli, tubules, and blood vessels-are affected to varying degrees. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescent analysis help identify the nature of the lesion; however, a kidney biopsy may be needed for definitive diagnosis.

Serial determinations of antistreptolysin O or anti-DNase B titers are usually elevated in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Serum complement levels may be decreased but generally return to normal within 2 to 8 weeks. More than half of patients with IgA nephropathy (the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis) have an elevated serum IgA and a normal complement level.

If the patient improves, the amount of urine increases and the urinary protein and sediment diminish. Usually, more than $90 \%$ of children recover. The percentage of adults who recover is not well established but is probably about $70 \%$. Some patients become severely uremic within weeks and require dialysis for survival. Others, after a period of apparent recovery, insidiously develop chronic glomerulonephritis.

\section*{Complications}

Complications of acute glomerulonephritis include hypertensive encephalopathy, heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency, and therapy is directed toward reducing the blood pressure without impairing renal function (Tonelli et al., 2001). Although rare, optic neuropathy in uremia is a medical emergency requiring the immediate institution of dialysis, corticosteroid therapy, and correction of anemia (Winkelmayer et al., 2001).

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is a rapid and progressive decline in renal function. Without treatment, it results in ESRD in a matter of weeks or months. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of acute glomerulonephritis (hematuria and proteinuria), but the course of the disease is more severe and rapid. Crescent-shaped cells accumulate in Bowman's space, disrupting the filtering surface. Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) and treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents have been used to reduce the inflammatory response. Dialysis is initiated in acute glomerulonephritis if signs and symptoms of uremia are severe. With aggressive treatment, the prognosis for patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is greatly improved.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management consists primarily of treating symptoms, attempting to preserve kidney function, and treating complications promptly. Pharmacologic therapy depends on the cause of acute glomerulonephritis. If residual streptococcal infection is suspected, penicillin is the agent of choice; however, other antibiotic agents may be prescribed. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressant medications may be prescribed for patients with rapidly progressive acute glomerulonephritis, but in most cases of poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis, these medications are of no value and may actually worsen the fluid retention and hypertension.

Dietary protein is restricted when renal insufficiency and nitrogen retention (elevated BUN) develop. Sodium is restricted when the patient has hypertension, edema, and heart failure. Loop diuretic medications and antihypertensive agents may be prescribed to control hypertension. Prolonged bed rest has little value and does not alter long-term outcomes.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Although most patients with acute uncomplicated glomerulonephritis are treated as outpatients, nursing care is important no matter what the setting. In a hospital setting, carbohydrates are given liberally to provide energy and reduce the catabolism of protein. Intake and output are carefully measured and recorded. Fluids are given according to the patient's fluid losses and daily body weight. Insensible fluid loss through the respiratory and GI tracts ( 500 to $1,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ ) is considered when estimating fluid loss. Diuresis begins about 1 week after the onset of symptoms with a decrease in edema and blood pressure. Proteinuria and microscopic hematuria may persist for many months, and some patients may go on to develop chronic glomerulonephritis. Other nursing interventions focus primarily on patient education for safe and effective self-care at home.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Patient education is directed toward maintaining kidney function and preventing complications. Fluid and diet restrictions must be reviewed with the patient to avoid worsening of edema and hypertension. The patient is instructed to notify the physician if symptoms of renal failure occur (eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diminishing urine output) or at the first sign of any infection. Information is given verbally and in writing.

Continuing Care. The importance of follow-up evaluations of blood pressure, urinalysis for protein, and serum BUN and creatinine levels to determine if the disease has progressed is stressed to the patient. A referral for home care may be indicated; a visit from a home care nurse provides an opportunity for careful assessment of the patient's progress and detection of early signs and symptoms of renal insufficiency. If corticosteroids, immunosuppressant agents, or antibiotic medications are prescribed, the home care nurse or nurse in the outpatient setting uses the opportunity to review the dosage, desired actions, and adverse effects of medications and the precautions to be followed.

\section*{CHRONIC GLOMERULONEPHRITIS}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Chronic glomerulonephritis may be due to repeated episodes of acute glomerulonephritis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, chronic tubulointerstitial injury, or hemodynamically mediated glomerular sclerosis. The kidneys are reduced to as little as one-fifth their normal size (consisting largely of fibrous tissue). The cortex shrinks to a layer 1 to 2 mm thick or less. Bands of scar tissue distort the remaining cortex, making the surface of the kidney rough and irregular. Numerous glomeruli and their tubules become scarred, and the branches of the renal artery are thickened. The result is severe glomerular damage that results in ESRD.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The symptoms of chronic glomerulonephritis vary. Some patients with severe disease have no symptoms at all for many years. Their condition may be discovered when hypertension or elevated BUN and serum creatinine levels are detected. The diagnosis may be suggested during a routine eye examination when vascular changes or retinal hemorrhages are found. The first indication of disease may be a sudden, severe nosebleed, a stroke, or a seizure. Many patients report that their feet are slightly swollen at night. Most patients also have general symptoms, such as loss of weight and strength, increasing irritability, and an increased need to urinate at night (nocturia). Headaches, dizziness, and digestive disturbances are common.

As chronic glomerulonephritis progresses, signs and symptoms of renal insufficiency and chronic renal failure may develop. The patient appears poorly nourished, with a yellow-gray pigmentation of the skin and periorbital and peripheral (dependent) edema. Blood pressure may be normal or severely elevated. Retinal findings include hemorrhage, exudate, narrowed tortuous arterioles, and papilledema. Mucous membranes are pale because of anemia. Cardiomegaly, a gallop rhythm, distended neck veins, and other signs and symptoms of heart failure may be present. Crackles can be heard in the lungs.

Peripheral neuropathy with diminished deep tendon reflexes and neurosensory changes occurs late in the disease. The patient becomes confused and demonstrates a limited attention span. An additional late finding includes evidence of pericarditis with a pericardial friction rub and pulsus paradoxus (difference in blood pressure during inspiration and expiration of greater than 10 mm Hg ).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A number of laboratory abnormalities occur. Urinalysis reveals a fixed specific gravity of about 1.010 , variable proteinuria, and urinary casts (protein plugs secreted by damaged kidney tubules). As renal failure progresses and the GFR falls below $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, the following changes occur:
- Hyperkalemia due to decreased potassium excretion, acidosis, catabolism, and excessive potassium intake from food and medications
- Metabolic acidosis from decreased acid secretion by the kidney and inability to regenerate bicarbonate
- Anemia secondary to decreased erythropoiesis (production of RBCs)
- Hypoalbuminemia with edema secondary to protein loss through the damaged glomerular membrane
- Increased serum phosphorus level due to decreased renal excretion of phosphorus
- Decreased serum calcium level (calcium binds to phosphorus to compensate for elevated serum phosphorus levels)
- Hypermagnesemia from decreased excretion and inadvertent ingestion of antacids containing magnesium
- Impaired nerve conduction due to electrolyte abnormalities and uremia

Chest x-rays may show cardiac enlargement and pulmonary edema. The electrocardiogram may be normal or may indicate left ventricular hypertrophy associated with hypertension and signs of electrolyte disturbances, such as tall, tented (or peaked) T waves associated with hyperkalemia. Serum markers, including vascular endothelial growth factor and thrombospondin-1, are being evaluated for their reliability in assessing renal disease (Kang et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Symptoms guide the course of treatment for the patient with chronic glomerulonephritis. If the patient has hypertension, the blood pressure is reduced with sodium and water restriction, antihypertensive agents, or both. Weight is monitored daily, and diuretic medications are prescribed to treat fluid overload. Proteins of high biologic value (dairy products, eggs, meats) are provided to promote good nutritional status. Adequate calories are also important to spare protein for tissue growth and repair. UTIs must be treated promptly to prevent further renal damage.

Initiation of dialysis is considered early in the course of the disease to keep the patient in optimal physical condition, prevent fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and minimize the risk of complications of renal failure. The course of dialysis is smoother if treatment begins before the patient develops significant complications.

\section*{Nursing Management}

If the patient is hospitalized or seen by the nurse in the home, the nurse observes the patient for changes in fluid and electrolyte status and for signs and symptoms of deterioration of renal function. Changes in fluid and electrolyte status and in cardiac and neurologic status are reported promptly to the physician. Anxiety levels are often extremely high for both the patient and family. Throughout the course of the disease and treatment, the nurse gives emotional support by providing opportunities for the patient and family to verbalize their concerns, have their questions answered, and explore their options.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse has a major role in teaching the patient and family about the prescribed treatment plan and the risks associated with noncompliance. Instructions to the patient include explanations and scheduling for follow-up evaluations: blood pressure, urinalysis for protein and casts, and blood studies of BUN and creatinine levels. If long-term dialysis is needed, the patient and family are taught about the procedure, how to care for the access site, dietary restrictions, and other necessary lifestyle modifications. See Chapter 44 for a detailed checklist of teaching topics for the dialysis patient.

Periodic hospitalization, visits to the outpatient clinic or office, and home care referrals provide the nurse in each setting with the opportunity for careful assessment of the patient's progress
and continued education about changes to report to the primary health care provider (worsening signs and symptoms of renal failure, such as nausea, vomiting, and diminished urine output). Specific teaching may include explanations about recommended diet and fluid modifications and medications (purpose, desired effects, adverse effects, dosage, and administration schedule).

Continuing Care. Periodic evaluation of creatinine clearance and serum BUN and creatinine levels is carried out to assess residual renal function and the need for dialysis or transplantation. If dialysis is initiated, the patient and family will require considerable assistance and support in dealing with therapy and its long-term implications. See Chapter 44 for a discussion of dialysis. (Kidney transplantation is discussed later in this chapter.) The patient and family are reminded of the importance of participation in health promotion activities, including health screening. The patient is instructed to inform all health care providers about the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis so that all medical management, including pharmacologic therapy, is based on altered renal function.

\section*{NEPHROTIC SYNDROME}

Nephrotic syndrome is a primary glomerular disease characterized by the following:
- Marked increase in protein in the urine (proteinuria)
- Decrease in albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia)
- Edema
- High serum cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (hyperlipidemia)
The syndrome is apparent in any condition that seriously damages the glomerular capillary membrane and results in increased glomerular permeability.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Nephrotic syndrome can occur with almost any intrinsic renal disease or systemic disease that affects the glomerulus. Although generally considered a disorder of childhood, nephrotic syndrome does occur in adults, including the elderly. Causes include chronic glomerulonephritis, diabetes mellitus with intercapillary glomerulosclerosis, amyloidosis of the kidney, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, and renal vein thrombosis.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the loss of plasma protein, particularly albumin, in the urine. Although the liver is capable of increasing the production of albumin, it cannot keep up with the daily loss of albumin through the kidneys. Thus, hypoalbuminemia results (Fig. 45-4).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The major manifestation of nephrotic syndrome is edema. It is usually soft and pitting and most commonly occurs around the eyes (periorbital), in dependent areas (sacrum, ankles, and hands), and in the abdomen (ascites). Other symptoms, including malaise, headache, irritability, and fatigue, are common (Fogo, 2000).

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 45-4 Sequence of events in nephrotic syndrome.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Proteinuria (predominately albumin) exceeding 3 to $3.5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day is sufficient for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis may be performed on the urine to categorize the type of proteinuria. The urine may also contain increased WBCs as well as granular and epithelial casts. A needle biopsy of the kidney may be performed for histologic examination of renal tissue to confirm the diagnosis. Recent studies have confirmed the usefulness of serum markers as a means of assessing the disease process. Anti-C1q antibodies are the most reliable markers for assessing disease activity in lupus nephritis (Moroni et al., 2001).

\section*{Complications}

Complications of nephrotic syndrome include infection (due to a deficient immune response), thromboembolism (especially of the renal vein), pulmonary emboli, acute renal failure (due to hypovolemia), and accelerated atherosclerosis (due to hyperlipidemia).

\section*{Medical Management}

The objective of management is to preserve renal function. Diuretic agents may be prescribed for the patient with severe edema; however, caution must be used because of the risk of reducing the plasma volume to the point of impaired circulation with subsequent prerenal acute renal failure. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in combination with diuretics often reduces the degree of proteinuria but may take 4 to 6 weeks to be effective.

Other medications used in treating nephrotic syndrome include antineoplastic agents (cyclophosphamide [Cytoxan]) or immunosuppressant medications (azathioprine [Imuran], chlorambucil [Leukeran], or cyclosporine). It may be necessary to repeat treatment with corticosteroids if relapse occurs. Treatment of the associated hyperlipidemia is controversial. The usual medications used to treat hyperlipidemia are often ineffective or have serious consequences, including muscle injury.

The patient may be placed on a low-sodium, liberal-potassium diet to enhance the sodium/potassium pump mechanism, thereby assisting in elimination of sodium to reduce edema. Protein intake should be about $0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day , with emphasis on high biologic proteins (dairy products, eggs, meats), and the diet should be low in saturated fats (Deschenes \& Doucet, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Management}

In the early stages of the disease, the nursing management is similar to that of the patient with acute glomerulonephritis, but as the disease worsens, management is similar to that of the patient with chronic renal failure (see the section that follows). The patient who is receiving corticosteroids or cyclosporine requires instructions about the medications and signs and symptoms that should be reported to the physician. Dietary instructions may also be necessary.

Patients with nephrotic syndrome need adequate instruction about the importance of following all medication and dietary regimens so that their condition can remain stable as long as possible. The patient must be made aware of the importance of communicating any health-related change to the health care provider as soon as possible so that appropriate medication and dietary changes can be made before further changes occur within the
glomeruli. When indications of an acute infection, such as an acute respiratory tract infection, are first apparent, increased doses of maintenance corticosteroids have been found to decrease the risk of relapse (Mattoo \& Mahmoud, 2000).

\section*{Renal Failure}

Renal failure results when the kidneys cannot remove the body's metabolic wastes or perform their regulatory functions. The substances normally eliminated in the urine accumulate in the body fluids as a result of impaired renal excretion, leading to a disruption in endocrine and metabolic functions as well as fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base disturbances. Renal failure is a systemic disease and is a final common pathway of many different kidney and urinary tract diseases. Each year, the number of deaths from irreversible renal failure increases (U.S. Renal Data System, 2001).

\section*{ACUTE RENAL FAILURE}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Acute renal failure (ARF) is a sudden and almost complete loss of kidney function (decreased GFR) over a period of hours to days. Although ARF is often thought of as a problem seen only in hospitalized patients, it may occur in the outpatient setting as well. ARF manifests with oliguria, anuria, or normal urine volume. Oliguria (less than $400 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day of urine) is the most common clinical situation seen in ARF; anuria (less than $50 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day of urine) and normal urine output are not as common. Regardless of the volume of urine excreted, the patient with ARF experiences rising serum creatinine and BUN levels and retention of other metabolic waste products (azotemia) normally excreted by the kidneys.

\section*{CATEGORIES OF ACUTE RENAL FAILURE}

Three major categories of conditions cause ARF: prerenal (hypoperfusion of kidney), intrarenal (actual damage to kidney tissue), and postrenal (obstruction to urine flow).
- Prerenal conditions occur as a result of impaired blood flow that leads to hypoperfusion of the kidney and a drop in the GFR. Common clinical situations are volume-depletion states (hemorrhage or GI losses), impaired cardiac performance (myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock), and vasodilation (sepsis or anaphylaxis).
- Intrarenal causes of ARF are the result of actual parenchymal damage to the glomeruli or kidney tubules. Conditions such as burns, crush injuries, and infections, as well as nephrotoxic agents, may lead to acute tubular necrosis and cessation of renal function. With burns and crush injuries, myoglobin (a protein released from muscle when injury occurs) and hemoglobin are liberated, causing renal toxicity, ischemia, or both. Severe transfusion reactions may also cause intrarenal failure; hemoglobin is released through hemolysis, filters through the glomeruli, and becomes concentrated in the kidney tubules to such a degree that precipitation of hemoglobin occurs. Medications may also predispose a patient to intrarenal damage, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and ACE inhibitors. These medications interfere with the normal autoregulatory mechanisms of the kidney and may cause hypoperfusion and eventual ischemia. Other potential causes of intrarenal or intrinsic

ARF include rhabdomyolysis, which results in accumulation of myoglobin in the glomeruli secondary to damage to skeletal muscle, and nephrotoxicity secondary to herbal remedies (Myhre, 2000).
- Postrenal causes of ARF are usually the result of an obstruction somewhere distal to the kidney. Pressure rises in the kidney tubules; eventually, the GFR decreases.

Common causes of ARF are summarized in Chart 45-5.
Although the exact pathogenesis of ARF and oliguria is not always known, many times there is a specific underlying problem. Some of the factors may be reversible if identified and treated promptly, before kidney function is impaired. This is true of the following conditions that reduce blood flow to the kidney and impair kidney function: (1) hypovolemia; (2) hypotension; (3) reduced cardiac output and heart failure; (4) obstruction of the kidney or lower urinary tract by tumor, blood clot, or kidney stone; and (5) bilateral obstruction of the renal arteries or veins. If these conditions are treated and corrected before the kidneys

are permanently damaged, the increased BUN and creatinine levels, oliguria, and other signs associated with ARF may be reversed.

Although not a common cause of ARF, some types of renal stones may increase the risk for ARF more than others. Hereditary stone diseases (cystinuria, primary hyperoxaluria, Dent's disease), primary struvite stones, and infection-related urolithiasis associated with anatomic and functional urinary tract anomalies and spinal cord injury may cause recurrent bouts of obstruction as well as crystal-specific effects on tubular epithelial cells and interstitial renal cells. This in turn may activate the fibrogenic cascade responsible for the loss of renal parenchyma (Gambaro, Favaro \& D'Angelo, 2001).

\section*{PHASES OF ACUTE RENAL FAILURE}

There are four clinical phases of ARF: initiation, oliguria, diuresis, and recovery. The initiation period begins with the initial insult and ends when oliguria develops. The oliguria period is accompanied by a rise in the serum concentration of substances usually excreted by the kidneys (urea, creatinine, uric acid, organic acids, and the intracellular cations [potassium and magnesium]). The minimum amount of urine needed to rid the body of normal metabolic waste products is 400 mL . In this phase uremic symptoms first appear and life-threatening conditions such as hyperkalemia develop.

Some patients have decreased renal function with increasing nitrogen retention, yet actually excrete normal amounts of urine ( $2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day or more). This is the nonoliguric form of renal failure and occurs predominantly after nephrotoxic antibiotic agents are administered to the patient; it may occur with burns, traumatic injury, and the use of halogenated anesthetic agents.

In the diuresis period, the third phase, the patient experiences gradually increasing urine output, which signals that glomerular filtration has started to recover. Laboratory values stop rising and eventually decrease. Although the volume of urinary output may reach normal or elevated levels, renal function may still be markedly abnormal. Because uremic symptoms may still be present, the need for expert medical and nursing management continues. The patient must be observed closely for dehydration during this phase; if dehydration occurs, the uremic symptoms are likely to increase.

The recovery period signals the improvement of renal function and may take 3 to 12 months. Laboratory values return to the patient's normal level. Although a permanent $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ reduction in the GFR is common, it is not clinically significant.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Almost every system of the body is affected when there is failure of the normal renal regulatory mechanisms. The patient may appear critically ill and lethargic, with persistent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The skin and mucous membranes are dry from dehydration, and the breath may have the odor of urine (uremic fetor). Central nervous system signs and symptoms include drowsiness, headache, muscle twitching, and seizures. Table 45-1 summarizes common clinical findings for all three categories of ARF.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

\section*{CHANGES IN URINE}

Urine output varies (scanty to normal volume), hematuria may be present, and the urine has a low specific gravity ( 1.010 or less, compared with a normal value of 1.015 to 1.025 ). Patients with

\end{table}
prerenal azotemia have a decreased amount of sodium in the urine (below $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and normal urinary sediment. Patients with intrarenal azotemia usually have urinary sodium levels greater than $40 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ with casts and other cellular debris. Urinary casts are mucoproteins secreted by the renal tubules whenever inflammation is present.

\section*{CHANGE IN KIDNEY CONTOUR}

Ultrasonography is a critical component of the evaluation of both acute and chronic renal failure. Although many sonographic findings are nonspecific, their diagnostic utility is greatly enhanced by a familiarity with the clinical presentation and a thorough understanding of renal pathophysiology (O'Neill, 2000).

\section*{INCREASED BUN AND CREATININE LEVELS (AZOTEMIA)}

The BUN level rises steadily at a rate dependent on the degree of catabolism (breakdown of protein), renal perfusion, and protein intake. Serum creatinine rises in conjunction with glomerular damage. Serum creatinine levels are useful in monitoring kidney function and disease progression.

\section*{HYPERKALEMIA}

With a decline in the GFR, the patient cannot excrete potassium normally. Patients with oliguria and anuria are at greater risk for hyperkalemia than those without oliguria. Protein catabolism results in the release of cellular potassium into the body fluids, causing severe hyperkalemia (high serum $\mathrm{K}^{+}$levels). Hyperkalemia may lead to dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Sources of potassium include normal tissue catabolism, dietary intake, blood in the GI tract, or blood transfusion and other sources (intravenous infusions, potassium penicillin, and extracellular shift in response to metabolic acidosis).

\section*{METABOLIC ACIDOSIS}

Patients with acute oliguria cannot eliminate the daily metabolic load of acid-type substances produced by the normal metabolic processes. In addition, normal renal buffering mechanisms fail. This is reflected by a fall in the serum $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-combining power and blood pH. Thus, progressive metabolic acidosis accompanies renal failure.

\section*{CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS ABNORMALITIES}

There may be an increase in serum phosphate concentrations; serum calcium levels may be low in response to decreased absorption of calcium from the intestine and as a compensatory mechanism for the elevated serum phosphate levels.

\section*{ANEMIA}

Anemia inevitably accompanies ARF due to reduced erythropoietin production, uremic GI lesions, reduced RBC life span, and blood loss, usually from the GI tract. With use of the parenteral form of erythropoietin (Epogen), anemia is not the major problem it once was.

\section*{Prevention}

A careful history is obtained to determine whether the patient has been taking potentially nephrotoxic antibiotic agents or has been exposed to environmental toxins. The kidneys are especially susceptible to the adverse effects of medications because the kidneys are repeatedly exposed to substances in the blood. They receive a large blood flow ( $25 \%$ of the cardiac output at rest; the entire blood volume circulates through the kidneys about 14 times a minute). In addition, the kidney is the major excretory organ for many toxic substances, and during the normal urine concentration process, these substances increase in concentration and can be toxic to the kidneys. Therefore, in patients taking potentially nephrotoxic medications (aminoglycosides, gentamicin, tobramycin, colistimethate, polymyxin B, amphotericin B, vancomycin, amikacin, cyclosporine), renal function should be monitored closely. Serum BUN and creatinine levels should be obtained at baseline by 24 hours after initiation of these medications and at least twice a week while the patient is receiving them.

Any agent that reduces renal blood flow (eg, chronic analgesic use) may cause renal insufficiency. Chronic analgesic use, particularly with NSAIDs, may cause interstitial nephritis and papillary necrosis. Patients with heart failure or cirrhosis with ascites are at particular risk for NSAID-induced renal failure. Increased age, preexisting renal disease, and the administration of several nephrotoxic agents simultaneously increase the risk for kidney damage.

Management of ARF is expensive and complex, and even when optimal, the mortality rate remains high. Therefore, prevention of ARF is key (Chart 45-6).

\section*{Medical Management}

The kidney has a remarkable ability to recover from insult. Therefore, the objectives of treatment of ARF are to restore normal chemical balance and prevent complications until repair of renal tissue and restoration of renal function can take place. Any possible cause of damage is identified, treated, and eliminated. Prerenal azotemia is treated by optimizing renal perfusion, whereas postrenal failure is treated by relieving the obstruction. Treatment of intrarenal azotemia is supportive, with removal of causative agents, aggressive management of prerenal and postrenal failure, and avoidance of associated risk factors. Shock and infection, if present, are treated promptly. Overall, medical management includes maintaining fluid balance, avoiding fluid excesses, or possibly performing dialysis.

Maintenance of fluid balance is based on daily body weight, serial measurements of central venous pressure, serum and urine concentrations, fluid losses, blood pressure, and the clinical status of the patient. The parenteral and oral intake and the output of urine, gastric drainage, stools, wound drainage, and perspiration are calculated and are used as the basis for fluid replacement. The insensible fluid lost through the skin and lungs and produced through the normal metabolic processes is also considered in fluid management.

Fluid excesses can be detected by the clinical findings of dyspnea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins. The lungs are auscul-

tated for moist crackles. Because pulmonary edema may be caused by excessive administration of parenteral fluids, extreme caution must be used to prevent fluid overload. The development of generalized edema is assessed by examining the presacral and pretibial areas several times daily. Mannitol, furosemide, or ethacrynic acid may be prescribed to initiate a diuresis and prevent or minimize subsequent renal failure.

Adequate blood flow to the kidneys in patients with prerenal causes of ARF may be restored by intravenous fluids or blood product transfusions. If ARF is caused by hypovolemia secondary to hypoproteinemia, an infusion of albumin may be prescribed. Dialysis may be initiated to prevent serious complications of ARF, such as hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, pericarditis, and pulmonary edema. Dialysis corrects many biochemical abnormalities; allows for liberalization of fluid, protein, and sodium intake; diminishes bleeding tendencies; and may help wound healing. Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or any of the new continuous renal replacement therapies may be performed. These forms of dialysis are discussed in Chapter 44, which presents treatment modalities for patients with renal dysfunction.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Because hyperkalemia is the most life-threatening of the fluid and electrolyte disturbances, the patient is monitored for hyperkalemia through serial serum electrolyte levels (potassium value more than $5.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}[5.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}]$ ), electrocardiogram changes (tall, tented, or peaked T waves), and changes in clinical status.

The elevated potassium levels may be reduced by administering cation-exchange resins (sodium polystyrene sulfonate [Kayexalate]) orally or by retention enema. Kayexalate works by exchanging a sodium ion for a potassium ion in the intestinal tract. Sorbitol is often administered in combination with Kayexalate to induce a diarrhea-type effect (it induces water loss in the GI tract).

If a retention enema is administered (the colon is the major site for potassium exchange), a rectal catheter with a balloon may be used to facilitate retention if necessary. The patient should retain the resin 30 to 45 minutes to promote potassium removal. Afterward, a cleansing enema may be prescribed to remove the Kayexalate resin as a precaution against fecal impaction.

> NURSING ALERT Intravenous glucose and insulin or calcium gluconate may be used as emergency and temporary measures to treat hyperkalemia. Glucose and insulin drive potassium into the cells, thereby lowering serum potassium levels temporarily. Potassium will move out of the cells and rise again to a dangerous level unless removed by dialysis. The administration of calcium gluconate helps protect the heart from the effects of the high potassium levels.

NURSING ALERT Sodium bicarbonate may be administered to elevate the plasma pH. Sodium bicarbonate increases the pH, which causes potassium to move into the cell, and the result is lowering of the serum potassium level. This is short-term therapy and is used with other long-term measures, such as dietary restriction and dialysis.

NURSING ALERT All external sources of potassium (foods, salt substitutes, medications) are eliminated or reduced.

Because many medications are eliminated through the kidneys, medication dosages must be reduced when a patient has ARF. Examples of commonly used medications that require adjustment are antibiotic agents (especially aminoglycosides), digoxin, ACE inhibitors, and medications containing magnesium.

Many medications have been used in patients with ARF in an attempt to improve patient outcomes. Diuretic agents are often used to control fluid volume, but they have not been shown to hasten the recovery from ARF.

Low-dose dopamine ( 1 to $3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) is often used to dilate the renal arteries through stimulation of dopaminergic receptors; however, research has not definitely demonstrated that dopamine prevents ARF or improves outcome in patients with established renal failure.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), an endogenous hormone synthesized by the cardiac atria, has been shown to improve renal function in multiple animal models of ARF. It has also decreased the need for dialysis in patients with oliguric acute tubular necrosis in a multisite clinical trial of patients. Patients with nonoliguric acute tubular necrosis did not benefit (Lewis, Salem, Chertow et al., 2000). Further research on ANP use is underway.

In patients with severe acidosis, the arterial blood gases or serum bicarbonate levels ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-combining power) must be monitored because the patient may require sodium bicarbonate therapy or dialysis. If respiratory problems develop, appropriate ventilatory measures must be instituted. The elevated serum phosphate level may be controlled with phosphate-binding agents (aluminum hydroxide). These agents help prevent a continuing rise in serum phosphate levels by decreasing the absorption of phosphate from the intestinal tract.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

ARF causes severe nutritional imbalances (because nausea and vomiting contribute to inadequate dietary intake), impaired glucose use and protein synthesis, and increased tissue catabolism. The patient is weighed daily and can be expected to lose 0.2 to 0.5 kg ( 0.5 to 1 lb ) daily if the nitrogen balance is negative (ie, the patient's caloric intake falls below caloric requirements). If the patient gains or does not lose weight or develops hypertension, fluid retention should be suspected.

Dietary proteins are limited to about $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ during the oliguric phase to minimize protein breakdown and to prevent accumulation of toxic end products. Caloric requirements are met with high-carbohydrate meals because carbohydrates have a proteinsparing effect (ie, in a high-carbohydrate diet, protein is not used for meeting energy requirements but is "spared" for growth and tissue healing). Foods and fluids containing potassium or phosphorus (bananas, citrus fruits and juices, coffee) are restricted. Potassium intake is usually restricted to 40 to $60 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day , and sodium is usually restricted to $2 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. The patient may require parenteral nutrition.

The oliguric phase of ARF may last 10 to 20 days and is followed by the diuretic phase, at which time urine output begins to increase, signaling that kidney function is returning. Blood chemistry evaluations are made to determine the amounts of sodium, potassium, and water needed for replacement, along with assessment for overhydration or underhydration. After the diuretic phase, the patient is placed on a high-protein, high-calorie diet and is encouraged to resume activities gradually.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse has an important role in caring for the patient with $A R F$. In addition to directing attention to the patient's primary disorder (which may be a factor in the development of ARF), the nurse monitors for complications, participates in emergency treatment of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, assesses progress and response to treatment, and provides physical and emotional support. Additionally, the nurse keeps family members informed about the patient's condition, helps them understand the treatments, and provides psychological support. Although the development of ARF may be the most serious problem, the nurse must continue to include in the plan of care those nursing measures indicated for the primary disorder (eg, burns, shock, trauma, obstruction of the urinary tract).

\section*{MONITORING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}

Because of the serious fluid and electrolyte imbalances that can occur with ARF, the nurse monitors the patient's serum electrolyte levels and physical indicators of these complications during all phases of the disorder. Hyperkalemia is the most immediate lifethreatening imbalance seen in ARF. Parenteral fluids, all oral intake, and all medications are screened carefully to ensure that hidden sources of potassium are not inadvertently administered or consumed. Intravenous solutions must be carefully selected according to the patient's fluid and electrolyte status. The patient's cardiac function and musculoskeletal status are monitored closely for signs of hyperkalemia.

The nurse monitors fluid status by paying careful attention to fluid intake (intravenous medications should be administered in the smallest volume possible), urine output, apparent edema, distention of the jugular veins, alterations in heart sounds and breath sounds, and increasing difficulty in breathing. Accurate daily weights, as well as intake and output records, are essential.

Indicators of deteriorating fluid and electrolyte status are reported immediately to the physician, and preparation is made for emergency treatment. Hyperkalemia is treated with glucose and insulin, calcium gluconate, cation-exchange resins (Kayexalate), or dialysis. Fluid and other electrolyte disturbances are often treated with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or other continuous renal replacement therapies.

\section*{REDUCING METABOLIC RATE}

The nurse also directs attention to reducing the patient's metabolic rate during the acute stage of renal failure to reduce catabolism and the subsequent release of potassium and accumulation of endogenous waste products (urea and creatinine). Bed rest may be indicated to reduce exertion and the metabolic rate during the most acute stage of the disorder. Fever and infection, both of which increase the metabolic rate and catabolism, are prevented or treated promptly.

\section*{PROMOTING PULMONARY FUNCTION}

Attention is given to pulmonary function, and the patient is assisted to turn, cough, and take deep breaths frequently to prevent atelectasis and respiratory tract infection. Drowsiness and lethargy may prevent the patient from moving and turning without encouragement and assistance.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Asepsis is essential with invasive lines and catheters to minimize the risk of infection and increased metabolism. An indwelling urinary catheter is avoided whenever possible because of the high risk for UTI associated with its use.

\section*{PROVIDING SKIN CARE}

The skin may be dry or susceptible to breakdown as a result of edema; therefore, meticulous skin care is important. Additionally, excoriation and itching of the skin may result from the deposit of irritating toxins in the patient's tissues. Massaging bony prominences, turning the patient frequently, and bathing the patient with cool water are often comforting and prevent skin breakdown.

\section*{PROVIDING SUPPORT}

The patient with ARF requires treatment with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapies to prevent serious complications (see Chap. 44); the length of time that these treatments are necessary varies with the cause and extent of damage to the kidneys. The patient and family need assistance, explanation, and support during this time. The purpose and rationale of the treatments are explained to the patient and family by the physician. High levels of anxiety and fear, however, may necessitate repeated explanation and clarification by the nurse. The family members may initially be afraid to touch and talk to the patient during the procedure but should be encouraged and assisted to do so.

Although many of the nurse's functions are devoted to the technical aspects of the procedure, the psychological needs and concerns of the patient and family cannot be ignored. Continued assessment of the patient for complications of ARF and of its precipitating cause is essential.

\section*{CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE (END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE)}

Chronic renal failure, or ESRD, is a progressive, irreversible deterioration in renal function in which the body's ability to maintain metabolic and fluid and electrolyte balance fails, resulting in uremia or azotemia (retention of urea and other nitrogenous wastes in the blood).

The incidence of ESRD has increased by almost $8 \%$ per year for the past 5 years, with more than 300,000 patients being treated in the United States (USRDS, 2001).

ESRD may be caused by systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus (leading cause); hypertension; chronic glomerulonephritis; pyelonephritis; obstruction of the urinary tract; hereditary lesions, as in polycystic kidney disease; vascular disorders; infections; medications; or toxic agents.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease accounts for $8 \%$ to $10 \%$ of cases of ESRD in the United States and Europe (Perrone, Ruthazer \& Terrin, 2001). Comorbid conditions that develop during chronic renal insufficiency contribute to the high morbidity and mortality among patients with ESRD (Kausz et al., 2001).

Environmental and occupational agents that have been implicated in chronic renal failure include lead, cadmium, mercury, and chromium. Dialysis or kidney transplantation eventually becomes necessary for patient survival. Dialysis is an effective means of correcting metabolic toxicities at any age, although the mortality rate in infants and young children is greater than adults in the presence of other, nonrenal diseases and in the presence of anuria or oliguria (Wood et al., 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

As renal function declines, the end products of protein metabolism (which are normally excreted in urine) accumulate in the blood. Uremia develops and adversely affects every system in
the body. The greater the buildup of waste products, the more severe the symptoms. There are three well-recognized stages of chronic renal disease: reduced renal reserve, renal insufficiency, and ESRD (Chart 45-7).

The rate of decline in renal function and progression of chronic renal failure is related to the underlying disorder, the urinary excretion of protein, and the presence of hypertension. The disease tends to progress more rapidly in patients who excrete significant amounts of protein or have elevated blood pressure than in those without these conditions.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Because virtually every body system is affected by the uremia of chronic renal failure, patients exhibit a number of signs and symptoms. The severity of these signs and symptoms depends in part on the degree of renal impairment, other underlying conditions, and the patient's age.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR MANIFESTATIONS}

Hypertension (due to sodium and water retention or from activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system), heart failure and pulmonary edema (due to fluid overload), and pericarditis (due to irritation of the pericardial lining by uremic toxins) are among the cardiovascular problems manifested in ESRD. Strict fluid volume control has been found to normalize hypertension in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (Gunal, Duman, Ozkahya et al., 2001).

Cardiovascular disease is the predominant cause of death in patients with ESRD. In chronic hemodialysis patients, approximately 45\% of overall mortality is attributable to cardiac disease, and about $20 \%$ of these cardiac deaths are due to acute myocardial infarction (USRDS, 2001).

\section*{DERMATOLOGIC SYMPTOMS}

Severe itching (pruritus) is common. Uremic frost, the deposit of urea crystals on the skin, is uncommon today because of early and aggressive treatment of ESRD with dialysis.

\section*{Cheert $45-7$}

\section*{Stages of Chronic Renal Disease}

Stage 1
Reduced renal reserve, characterized by a 40\% to 75\% loss of nephron function. The patient usually does not have symptoms because the remaining nephrons are able to carry out the normal functions of the kidney.

\section*{Stage 2}

Renal insufficiency occurs when 75\% to 90\% of nephron function is lost. At this point, the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen rise, the kidney loses its ability to concentrate urine and anemia develops. The patient may report polyuria and nocturia.

\section*{Stage 3}

End-stage renal disease (ESRD), the final stage of chronic renal failure, occurs when there is less than $10 \%$ nephron function remaining. All of the normal regulatory, excretory, and hormonal functions of the kidney are severely impaired. ESRD is evidenced by elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels as well as electrolyte imbalances. Once the patient reaches this point, dialysis is usually indicated. Many of the symptoms of uremia are reversible with dialysis.

\section*{OTHER SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS}

GI signs and symptoms are common and include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and hiccups. Neurologic changes, including altered levels of consciousness, inability to concentrate, muscle twitching, and seizures, have been observed. The precise mechanisms for many of these diverse signs and symptoms have not been identified. It is generally thought, however, that the accumulation of uremic waste products is the probable cause. Chart 45-8 summarizes the signs and symptoms often seen in chronic renal failure.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

\section*{GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE}

Decreased GFR can be detected by obtaining a 24-hour urinalysis for creatinine clearance. As glomerular filtration decreases (due to nonfunctioning glomeruli), the creatinine clearance value decreases, whereas the serum creatinine and BUN levels increase. Serum creatinine is the more sensitive indicator of renal function because of its constant production in the body. The BUN is affected not only by renal disease but also by protein intake in the diet, catabolism (tissue and RBC breakdown), parenteral nutrition, and medications such as corticosteroids.

\section*{SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION}

The kidney cannot concentrate or dilute the urine normally in ESRD. Appropriate responses by the kidney to changes in the daily intake of water and electrolytes, therefore, do not occur. Some patients retain sodium and water, increasing the risk for edema, heart failure, and hypertension. Hypertension may also result from activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and the concomitant increased aldosterone secretion. Other patients have a tendency to lose salt and run the risk of developing hypotension and hypovolemia. Episodes of vomiting and diarrhea may produce sodium and water depletion, which worsens the uremic state.

\section*{ACIDOSIS}

With advanced renal disease, metabolic acidosis occurs because the kidney cannot excrete increased loads of acid. Decreased acid secretion primarily results from inability of the kidney tubules to excrete ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{-}\right)$and to reabsorb sodium bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$. There is also decreased excretion of phosphates and other organic acids.

\section*{ANEMIA}

Anemia develops as a result of inadequate erythropoietin production, the shortened life span of RBCs, nutritional deficiencies,

and the patient's tendency to bleed, particularly from the GI tract. Erythropoietin, a substance normally produced by the kidney, stimulates bone marrow to produce RBCs. In renal failure, erythropoietin production decreases and profound anemia results, producing fatigue, angina, and shortness of breath.

\section*{CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS IMBALANCE}

Another major abnormality seen in chronic renal failure is a disorder in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Serum calcium and phosphate levels have a reciprocal relationship in the body: as one rises, the other decreases. With decreased filtration through the glomerulus of the kidney, there is an increase in the serum phosphate level and a reciprocal or corresponding decrease in the serum calcium level. The decreased serum calcium level causes increased secretion of parathormone from the parathyroid glands. In renal failure, however, the body does not respond normally to the increased secretion of parathormone; as a result, calcium leaves the bone, often producing bone changes and bone disease. In addition, the active metabolite of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) normally manufactured by the kidney decreases as renal failure progresses. Uremic bone disease, often called renal osteodystrophy, develops from the complex changes in calcium, phosphate, and parathormone balance (Barnas, Schmidt, Seidl et al., 2001).

\section*{Complications}

Potential complications of chronic renal failure that concern the nurse and that necessitate a collaborative approach to care include the following:
- Hyperkalemia due to decreased excretion, metabolic acidosis, catabolism, and excessive intake (diet, medications, fluids)
- Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and pericardial tamponade due to retention of uremic waste products and inadequate dialysis
- Hypertension due to sodium and water retention and malfunction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
- Anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production, decreased RBC life span, bleeding in the GI tract from irritating toxins, and blood loss during hemodialysis
- Bone disease and metastatic calcifications due to retention of phosphorus, low serum calcium levels, abnormal vitamin D metabolism, and elevated aluminum levels

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of management is to maintain kidney function and homeostasis for as long as possible. All factors that contribute to ESRD and all factors that are reversible (eg, obstruction) are identified and treated. Management is accomplished primarily with medications and diet therapy, although dialysis may also be needed to decrease the level of uremic waste products in the blood (Fink et al., 2001).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Complications can be prevented or delayed by administering prescribed antihypertensives, erythropoietin (Epogen), iron supplements, phosphate-binding agents, and calcium supplements.

Antacids. Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia are treated with aluminum-based antacids that bind dietary phosphorus in the GI tract. However, concerns about the potential long-term
toxicity of aluminum and the association of high aluminum levels with neurologic symptoms and osteomalacia have led some physicians to prescribe calcium carbonate in place of high doses of aluminum-based antacids. This medication also binds dietary phosphorus in the intestinal tract and permits the use of smaller doses of antacids. Both calcium carbonate and phosphorusbinding antacids must be administered with food to be effective. Magnesium-based antacids must be avoided to prevent magnesium toxicity.

Antihypertensive and Cardiovascular Agents. Hypertension is managed by intravascular volume control and a variety of antihypertensive agents. Heart failure and pulmonary edema may also require treatment with fluid restriction, low-sodium diets, diuretic agents, inotropic agents such as digitalis or dobutamine, and dialysis. The metabolic acidosis of chronic renal failure usually produces no symptoms and requires no treatment; however, sodium bicarbonate supplements or dialysis may be needed to correct the acidosis if it causes symptoms (Tonelli et al., 2001).

Antiseizure Agents. Neurologic abnormalities may occur, so the patient must be observed for early evidence of slight twitching, headache, delirium, or seizure activity. If seizures occur, the onset of the seizure is recorded along with the type, duration, and general effect on the patient. The physician is notified immediately. Intravenous diazepam (Valium) or phenytoin (Dilantin) is usually administered to control seizures. The side rails of the bed should be padded to protect the patient. The nursing management of the patient with seizures is discussed in Chapter 61.

Erythropoietin. Anemia associated with chronic renal failure is treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (Epogen). Anemic patients (hematocrit less than $30 \%$ ) present with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise, general fatigability, and decreased activity tolerance. Epogen therapy is initiated to achieve a hematocrit of $33 \%$ to $38 \%$, which generally alleviates the symptoms of anemia. Epogen is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously three times a week. It may take 2 to 6 weeks for the hematocrit to rise; therefore, Epogen is not indicated for patients who need immediate correction of severe anemia. Adverse effects seen with Epogen therapy include hypertension (especially during early stages of treatment), increased clotting of vascular access sites, seizures, and depletion of body iron stores (Fink et al., 2001).

The patient receiving Epogen may experience influenza-like symptoms with initiation of therapy; these tend to subside with repeated doses. Management involves adjustment of heparin to prevent clotting of the dialysis lines during hemodialysis treatments, frequent monitoring of hematocrit, and periodic assessment of serum iron and transferrin levels. Because adequate stores of iron are necessary for an adequate response to erythropoietin, supplementary iron may be prescribed. In addition, the patient's blood pressure and serum potassium level are monitored to detect hypertension and rising serum potassium levels, which may occur with therapy and the increasing RBC mass. The occurrence of hypertension requires initiation or adjustment of the patient's antihypertensive therapy. Hypertension that cannot be controlled is a contraindication to recombinant erythropoietin therapy.

Patients who have received Epogen have reported decreased levels of fatigue, an increased feeling of well-being, better tolerance of dialysis, higher energy levels, and improved exercise tolerance. Additionally, this therapy has decreased the need for transfusion and its associated risks, including bloodborne infectious disease, antibody formation, and iron overload (Fink et al., 2001).

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

Dietary intervention is necessary with deterioration of renal function and includes careful regulation of protein intake, fluid intake to balance fluid losses, sodium intake to balance sodium losses, and some restriction of potassium. At the same time, adequate caloric intake and vitamin supplementation must be ensured. Protein is restricted because urea, uric acid, and organic acids-the breakdown products of dietary and tissue proteins-accumulate rapidly in the blood when there is impaired renal clearance. The allowed protein must be of high biologic value (dairy products, eggs, meats). High-biologic-value proteins are those that are complete proteins and supply the essential amino acids necessary for growth and cell repair.

Usually, the fluid allowance is 500 to 600 mL more than the previous day's 24 -hour urine output. Calories are supplied by carbohydrates and fat to prevent wasting. Vitamin supplementation is necessary because a protein-restricted diet does not provide the necessary complement of vitamins. Additionally, the patient on dialysis may lose water-soluble vitamins from the blood during the dialysis treatment.

\section*{OTHER THERAPY: DIALYSIS}

Hyperkalemia is usually prevented by ensuring adequate dialysis treatments with potassium removal and careful monitoring of all medications, both oral and intravenous, for their potassium content. The patient is placed on a potassium-restricted diet. Occasionally, Kayexalate, a cation-exchange resin, administered orally, may be needed. The patient with increasing symptoms of chronic renal failure is referred to a dialysis and transplantation center early in the course of progressive renal disease. Dialysis is usually initiated when the patient cannot maintain a reasonable lifestyle with conservative treatment. The details of dialysis treatment can be found in Chapter 44.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with chronic renal failure requires astute nursing care to avoid the complications of reduced renal function and the stresses and anxieties of dealing with a life-threatening illness. Examples of potential nursing diagnoses for these patients include the following:
- Excess fluid volume related to decreased urine output, dietary excesses, and retention of sodium and water
- Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to anorexia, nausea and vomiting, dietary restrictions, and altered oral mucous membranes
- Deficient knowledge regarding condition and treatment regimen
- Activity intolerance related to fatigue, anemia, retention of waste products, and dialysis procedure
- Low self-esteem related to dependency, role changes, changes in body image, and sexual dysfunction

Nursing care is directed toward assessing fluid status and identifying potential sources of imbalance, implementing a dietary program to ensure proper nutritional intake within the limits of the treatment regimen, and promoting positive feelings by encouraging increased self-care and greater independence. It is extremely important to provide explanations and information to the patient and family concerning ESRD, treatment options, and potential complications. A great deal of emotional support is needed by the patient and family because of the numerous changes experienced. Specific interventions, along with rationale
and evaluation criteria, are presented in more detail in the Plan of Nursing Care.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse plays an extremely important role in teaching the patient with ESRD. Because of the extensive teaching needed, the home care nurse, dialysis nurse, and nurse in the outpatient setting all provide ongoing education and reinforcement while monitoring the patient's progress and compliance with the treatment regimen.

A nutritional referral and explanations of nutritional needs are helpful because of the numerous dietary changes required. The patient is taught how to check the vascular access device for patency and how to take precautions, such as avoiding venipunctures and blood pressure measurements on the arm with the access device.

Additionally, the patient and family require considerable assistance and support in dealing with the need for dialysis and its long-term implications. For instance, they need to know what problems to report to the health care provider, including the following:
- Worsening signs and symptoms of renal failure (nausea, vomiting, change in usual urine output [if any], ammonia odor on breath)
- Signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia (muscle weakness, diarrhea, abdominal cramps)
- Signs and symptoms of access problems (clotted fistula or graft, infection)

These signs and symptoms of decreasing renal function, in addition to increasing BUN and serum creatinine levels, may indicate a need to alter the dialysis prescription. The dialysis nurses also provide ongoing education and support at each treatment visit.

Continuing Care. The importance of follow-up examinations and treatment is stressed to the patient and family because of changing physical status, renal function, and dialysis requirements. Referral for home care provides the home care nurse with the opportunity to assess the patient's environment, emotional status, and the coping strategies used by the patient and family to deal with the changes in family roles often associated with chronic illness.

The home care nurse also assesses the patient for further deterioration of renal function and signs and symptoms of complications resulting from the primary renal disorder, the resulting renal failure, and effects of treatment strategies (eg, dialysis, medications, dietary restrictions). Many patients need ongoing education and reinforcement on the multiple dietary restrictions required, including fluid, sodium, potassium, and protein restriction. Reminders about the need for health promotion activities and health screening are an important part of nursing care for the patient with renal failure.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Changes in kidney function with normal aging increase the susceptibility of elderly patients to kidney dysfunction and renal failure. Because alterations in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and renal clearance increase the risk for medication-associated changes in renal function, precautions are indicated with all

medications. This is because of the frequent use of multipleprescription and over-the-counter medications by elderly patients. The incidence of systemic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, and cancer, increases with advancing age, predisposing older adults to renal disease associated with these disorders. Therefore, nurses in all settings need to be alert for signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction in elderly patients.

With age, the kidney is less able to respond to acute fluid and electrolyte changes. Therefore, acute problems need to be prevented if possible or recognized and treated quickly to avoid kidney damage. When the elderly patient must undergo extensive diagnostic tests, or when new medications (eg, diuretic agents) are added, precautions must be taken to prevent dehydration, which can compromise marginal renal function and lead to ARF.

The elderly patient may develop atypical and nonspecific signs and symptoms of disturbed renal function and fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Recognition of these problems is further hampered by their association with preexisting disorders and the misconception that they are normal changes of aging.

\section*{ACUTE RENAL FAILURE IN OLDER ADULTS}

The incidence of ARF is increasing in older, hospitalized patients. About half of patients who develop ARF during hospitalization for a medical or surgical problem are older than 60 years of age. Evidence also demonstrates that ARF is often seen in the community setting. Nurses in the ambulatory setting need to be cognizant of the risk for ARF in their elderly patients, especially those undergoing diagnostic testing or procedures that can result in dehydration. The mortality rate is slightly higher for ARF in elderly patients than for their younger counterparts.

The etiology of ARF in older adults includes prerenal causes, such as dehydration, and intrarenal causes, such as nephrotoxic agents (medications, contrast agents). Diabetes mellitus increases the risk for contrast agent-induced renal failure because of preexisting renal insufficiency and the imposed fluid restriction needed for many tests. Suppression of thirst, enforced bed rest, lack of drinking water, and confusion all contribute to the older patient's failure to consume adequate fluids and may lead to dehydration and compromise of already decreased renal function.

\section*{CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE IN OLDER ADULTS}

Historically, the age of patients developing ESRD steadily rose each year, but it appears to have stabilized since 1993 at a mean age of 60 years. In the past, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulonephritis, and nephrosclerosis were the most common causes of chronic renal failure in the elderly. Today, however, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are the leading causes of chronic renal failure in the elderly (Bakris et al., 2000). Other common causes of chronic renal failure in the elderly population are interstitial nephritis and urinary tract obstruction. The signs and symptoms of renal disease in the elderly are commonly nonspecific. The occurrence of symptoms of other disorders (heart failure, dementia) can mask the symptoms of renal disease and delay or prevent diagnosis and treatment. The patient often develops signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, such as edema and proteinuria.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have been used effectively in treating elderly patients (Carey et al., 2001). Although there is no specific age limitation for renal transplantation, concomitant disorders (ie, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease) have made it a less common treatment for the elderly.

The outcome, however, is comparable to that of younger patients. Some elderly patients elect not to participate in these treatment strategies. Conservative management, including nutritional therapy, fluid control, and medications, such as phosphate binders, may be considered in patients who are not suitable for or elect not to participate in dialysis or transplantation.

\section*{KidneyTransplantation}

Kidney transplantation has become the treatment of choice for most patients with ESRD. During the past 40 years, more than 380,000 kidney transplantations have been performed worldwide, and more than 174,000 have been performed in the United States. This number includes over 10,000 kidney-pancreas transplantations. In January 2003 there were almost 54,000 persons on the waiting list for kidney transplantation (http://www.unos.org., December 25, 2002). Patients choose kidney transplantation for various reasons, such as the desire to avoid dialysis or to improve their sense of well-being and the wish to lead a more normal life. Additionally, the cost of maintaining a successful transplantation is one-third the cost of treating a dialysis patient.

Kidney transplantation involves transplanting a kidney from a living donor or human cadaver to a recipient who has ESRD (Chart 45-9). Kidney transplants from well-matched living donors who are related to the patient (those with compatible ABO and HLA antigens) are slightly more successful than those from cadaver donors. The success rate increases if kidney transplantation from a living donor is performed before dialysis is initiated (Mange, Joffe \& Feldman, 2001). Due to the overwhelming numbers of persons on kidney transplant waiting lists, new techniques for matching nonrelated living donors are being developed (Gridelli \& Remuzzi, 2000).

A nephrectomy of the patient's own native kidneys may be performed before transplantation. The transplanted kidney is placed in the patient's iliac fossa anterior to the iliac crest. The ureter of the newly transplanted kidney is transplanted into the bladder or anastomosed to the ureter of the recipient (Fig. 45-5).

\section*{Organ Donation}

An inadequate number of available kidneys remains the greatest limitation to treating patients with end-stage renal disease successfully. For those interested in donating a kidney, the National Kidney Foundation provides written information describing the organ donation program and a card specifying the organs to be donated in the event of death.

The organ donation card is signed by the donor and two witnesses and should be carried by the donor at all times. Procurement of an adequate number of kidneys for potential recipients is still a major problem, despite national legislation that requires relatives of deceased patients or patients declared brain-dead to be asked if they would consider organ donation.

In some states in the United States, drivers can indicate their desire to be organ donors on their driver's license application or renewal.

\end{figure}

\section*{PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

Preoperative management goals include bringing the patient's metabolic state to a level as close to normal as possible, making sure that the patient is free of infection, and preparing the patient for surgery and the postoperative course.

\section*{Medical Management}

A complete physical examination is performed to detect and treat any conditions that could cause complications after transplantation. Tissue typing, blood typing, and antibody screening are performed to determine compatibility of the tissues and cells of the donor and recipient. Other diagnostic tests must be completed to identify conditions requiring treatment before transplantation. The lower urinary tract is studied to assess bladder neck function and to detect ureteral reflux.

The patient must be free of infection at the time of renal transplantation because after surgery the patient will receive medications to prevent transplant rejection. These medications suppress the immune response, leaving the patient immunosuppressed and at risk for infection. Therefore, the patient is evaluated and treated for any infections, including gingival (gum) disease and dental caries.

A psychosocial evaluation is conducted to assess the patient's ability to adjust to the transplant, coping styles, social history, social support available, and financial resources. A history of psychiatric illness is important to ascertain because psychiatric conditions are often aggravated by the corticosteroids needed for immunosuppression after transplantation.

Hemodialysis is often performed the day before the scheduled transplantation procedure to optimize the patient's physical status if a dialysis routine had already been established. However, it is preferable to avoid initiation of dialysis before transplantation when a donor kidney is available (Mange et al., 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nursing aspects of preoperative care are similar to those for patients undergoing other elective abdominal surgery. Preoperative teaching can be conducted in a variety of settings, including the outpatient preadmission area, the hospital, or the transplantation clinic during the preliminary workup phase. Patient teaching addresses postoperative pulmonary hygiene, pain management options, dietary restrictions, intravenous and arterial lines, tubes (indwelling catheter and possibly a nasogastric tube), and early ambulation. The patient who receives a kidney from a living related donor may be concerned about the donor and how the donor will tolerate the surgical procedure.

Most patients have been on dialysis for months or years before transplantation. Many have waited months to years for a kidney transplant and are anxious about the surgery, possible rejection, and the need to return to dialysis. Helping the patient to deal with these concerns is part of the nurse's role in preoperative management, as is teaching the patient about what to expect after surgery.

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

The goal of care is to maintain homeostasis until the transplanted kidney is functioning well. The patient whose kidney functions immediately has a more favorable prognosis than the patient whose kidney does not.

\section*{Immunosuppressive Therapy}

The survival of a transplanted kidney depends on the ability to block the body's immune response to the transplanted kidney. To overcome or minimize the body's defense mechanism, immunosuppressant agents such as azathioprine (Imuran), corticosteroids (prednisone), cyclosporine, and OKT-3 (a monoclonal antibody) are administered (Shapiro, 2000b).

Cyclosporine is available in a microemulsion form (Neoral), which delivers the medication reliably, thus producing a steady-state serum concentration. Tacrolimus (Prograf, formerly called FK506) is similar to cyclosporine and about 100 times more potent. Mycophenolate (CellCept, RS-61433) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) solely for the prevention of renal transplant rejection. It may be used in patients who have failed to respond to the standard corticosteroid pulse therapy or OKT-3. Antilymphocyte globulin is occasionally used to modify the immune response. Leukapheresis, lymph drainage, and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) are other methods of immunosuppression, but they are rarely used.

Treatment with combinations of these new agents has dramatically improved survival rates. The newest class of agents, the first of which is sirolimus, is called target of rapamycin (TOR) inhibitors; these agents are used with cyclosporine for maintenance therapy. Immunosuppressive drug therapy after kidney transplantation continues to evolve (Chan, Gaston \& Hariharan, 2001).

Doses of immunosuppressant agents are gradually reduced (tapered) over a period of several weeks, depending on the patient's immunologic response to the transplant. The patient will, however, take some form of antirejection medication for the entire time that he or she has the transplanted kidney (Chart 45-10).

The clinical profile of neurotoxicity caused by immunosuppression has changed. When toxic levels are reached, both cyclosporine and tacrolimus may produce a clinical spectrum that varies from tremor and acute confusional state to status epilepticus and major speech or language abnormalities. Coma has become an unusual manifestation (Baan et al., 2001; Shapiro, 2000; Wijdicks, 2001).

\section*{Chemet \\ 45-10}

\section*{Renal Transplant Rejection and Infection}

Renal graft rejection and failure may occur within 24 hours (hyperacute), within 3 to 14 days (acute), or after many years (chronic). It is not uncommon for rejection to occur during the first year after transplantation.

\section*{Detecting Rejection}

Ultrasonography may be used to detect enlargement of the kidney; percutaneous renal biopsy (most reliable) and x-ray techniques are used to evaluate transplant rejection. If the body rejects the transplanted kidney, the patient needs to return to dialysis. The rejected kidney may or may not be removed, depending on when the rejection occurs (acute versus chronic) and the risk for infection if the kidney is left in place.

\section*{Potential Infection}

About 75\% of kidney transplant recipients have at least one episode of infection in the first year after transplantation because of immunosuppressant therapy. Immunosuppressants of the past made the transplant recipient more vulnerable to opportunistic infections (candidiasis, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) and infection with other relatively nonpathogenic viruses, fungi, and protozoa, which can be a major hazard. Cyclosporine therapy has reduced the incidence of opportunistic infections because it selectively exerts its effect, sparing $T$ cells that protect the patient from life-threatening infections. In addition, combination immunosuppressant therapy and improved clinical care have produced 1-year patient survival rates approaching 100\% and graft survival exceeding $90 \%$. Infections, however, remain a major cause of death at all points in time for kidney transplant recipients (Chan, Gaston \& Hariharan, 2001).

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Management}

\section*{ASSESSING THE PATIENT FOR TRANSPLANT REJECTION}

After kidney transplantation, the nurse assesses the patient for signs and symptoms of transplant rejection: oliguria, edema, fever, increasing blood pressure, weight gain, and swelling or tenderness over the transplanted kidney or graft. Patients receiving cyclosporine may not exhibit the usual signs and symptoms of acute rejection. In these patients, the only sign may be an asymptomatic rise in the serum creatinine level (more than a $20 \%$ rise is considered acute rejection).

The results of blood chemistry tests (BUN and creatinine) and leukocyte and platelet counts are monitored closely because immunosuppression depresses the formation of leukocytes and platelets. The patient is closely monitored for infection because of susceptibility to impaired healing and infection related to immunosuppressive therapy and complications of renal failure.

NURSING ALERT A distinction must be made between infection and rejection because impaired renal function and fever are evidence of both infection and rejection, and their treatments differ.

Clinical manifestations of infection include shaking chills, fever, rapid heartbeat and respirations (tachycardia and tachypnea), and either an increase or a decrease in WBCs (leukocytosis or leukopenia).

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION}

Infection may be introduced through the urinary tract, the respiratory tract, the surgical site, or other sources. Urine cultures are performed frequently because of the high incidence of bacteriuria during early and late stages of transplantation. Any type of wound drainage should be viewed as a potential source of infection because drainage is an excellent culture medium for bacteria. Catheter and drain tips may be cultured when removed by cutting off the tip of the catheter or drain (using aseptic technique) and placing the cut portion in a sterile container to be taken to the laboratory for culture.

The nurse ensures that the patient is protected from exposure to infection by hospital staff, visitors, and other patients with active infections. Careful hand hygiene is imperative; facemasks may be worn by hospital staff and visitors to reduce the risk for transmitting infectious agents while the patient is receiving high doses of immunosuppressants.

\section*{MONITORING URINARY FUNCTION}

The vascular access for hemodialysis is monitored to ensure patency and to evaluate for evidence of infection. After successful renal transplantation, the vascular access device may clot, possibly from improved coagulation with the return of renal function. Hemodialysis may be necessary postoperatively to maintain homeostasis until the transplanted kidney is functioning well.

A kidney from a living donor related to the patient usually begins to function immediately after surgery and may produce large quantities of dilute urine. A kidney from a cadaver donor may undergo acute tubular necrosis and therefore may not function for 2 or 3 weeks, during which time anuria, oliguria, or polyuria may be present. During this stage, the patient may experience significant changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Therefore, careful monitoring is indicated. The output from the urinary catheter (connected to a closed drainage system) is measured every hour. Intravenous fluids are administered on the basis of urine volume and serum electrolyte levels and as prescribed by the physician.

Hemodialysis may be required if fluid overload and hyperkalemia occur (Gridelli \& Remuzzi, 2000).

\section*{ADDRESSING PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCERNS}

The rejection of a transplanted kidney remains a matter of great concern to the patient, the family, and the health care team for many months. The fears of kidney rejection and the complications of immunosuppressive therapy (Cushing's syndrome, diabetes, capillary fragility, osteoporosis, glaucoma, cataracts, acne) place tremendous psychological stresses on the patient. Anxiety and uncertainty about the future and difficult posttransplantation adjustment are often sources of stress for the patient and family.

An important nursing function is the assessment of the patient's stress and coping. The nurse uses each visit with the patient to determine if the patient and family are coping effectively and the patient is complying with the prescribed medication regimen. If indicated or requested, the nurse refers the patient for counseling.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

The patient undergoing kidney transplantation is at risk for the postoperative complications that are associated with any surgical procedure. In addition, the patient's physical condition may be compromised because of the complications associated with longstanding renal failure and its treatment. Therefore, careful assessment for the complications related to renal failure and those associated with a major surgical procedure are important aspects of nursing care. Strategies to promote surgical recovery (breathing exercises, early ambulation, care of the surgical incision) are important aspects of postoperative care.

GI ulceration and corticosteroid-induced bleeding may occur. Fungal colonization of the GI tract (especially the mouth) and urinary bladder may occur secondary to corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy. Closely monitoring the patient and notifying the physician about the occurrence of these complications are important nursing interventions. In addition, the patient is monitored closely for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency if the treatment has included use of corticosteroids.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The nurse works closely with the patient and family to be sure that they understand the need for continuing the immunosuppressive therapy as prescribed. Additionally, the patient and family are instructed to assess for and report signs and symptoms of transplant rejection, infection, or significant adverse effects of the immunosuppressant regimen. These include decreased urine output; weight gain; malaise; fever; respiratory distress; tenderness over the transplanted kidney; anxiety; depression; changes in eating, drinking, or other habits; and changes in blood pressure readings. The patient is instructed to inform other health care providers (eg, dentist) about the kidney transplant and the use of immunosuppressive agents.

Continuing Care. The patient needs to know that follow-up care after transplantation is a lifelong necessity. Individual verbal and written instructions are provided concerning diet, medication, fluids, daily weight, daily measurement of urine, management of intake and output, prevention of infection, resumption of activity, and avoidance of contact sports in which the transplanted kidney may be injured. Because of the risk of other potential complications, the patient is followed closely. Cardiovascular disease is now the major cause of morbidity and mortality after
transplantation, due in part to the increasing age of transplantation patients. An additional problem is possible malignancy; patients receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy have been found to develop cancers more frequently than the general population. Because of the usual need for health promotion along with the increased risks for malignancy because of immunosuppressive therapy, the patient is reminded of the importance of health promotion and health screening.

The American Association of Kidney Patients (listed at the end of this chapter) is a nonprofit organization that serves the needs of those with kidney disease. It has many helpful suggestions for patients and family members learning to cope with dialysis and transplantation.

\section*{Urolithiasis}

Urolithiasis refers to stones (calculi) in the urinary tract. Stones are formed in the urinary tract when urinary concentrations of substances such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid increase. This is referred to as supersaturation and is dependent on the amount of the substance, ionic strength, and pH of the urine.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Stones can also form when there is a deficiency of substances that normally prevent crystallization in the urine, such as citrate, magnesium, nephrocalcin, and uropontin. The fluid volume status of the patient (stones tend to occur more often in dehydrated patients) is another factor playing a key role in stone development.

Calculi may be found anywhere from the kidney to the bladder. They vary in size from minute granular deposits, called sand or gravel, to bladder stones as large as an orange. The different sites of calculi formation in the urinary tract are shown in Figure 45-6.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-346.jpg?height=837&width=639&top_left_y=1688&top_left_x=1239}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 45-6 Various sites of calculi formation in the urinary tract (urolithiasis).}
\end{figure}

Certain factors favor the formation of stones, including infection, urinary stasis, and periods of immobility (slows renal drainage and alters calcium metabolism). In addition, increased calcium concentrations in blood and urine promote precipitation of calcium and formation of stones (about $75 \%$ of all renal stones are calcium-based). Causes of hypercalcemia (high serum calcium) and hypercalciuria (high urine calcium) include the following:
- Hyperparathyroidism
- Renal tubular acidosis
- Cancers
- Granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis), which may cause increased vitamin D production by the granulomatous tissue
- Excessive intake of vitamin D
- Excessive intake of milk and alkali
- Myeloproliferative diseases (leukemia, polycythemia vera, multiple myeloma), which produce an unusual proliferation of blood cells from the bone marrow

For patients with stones containing uric acid, struvite, or cystine, a thorough physical examination and metabolic workup are indicated because of associated disturbances contributing to the stone formation. Uric acid stones ( $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of all stones) may be seen in patients with gout or myeloproliferative disorders. Struvite stones account for 15\% of urinary calculi and form in persistently alkaline, ammonia-rich urine caused by the presence of ureasesplitting bacteria such as Proteus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, or Mycoplasma species. Predisposing factors for struvite stones (commonly called infection stones) include neurogenic bladder, foreign bodies, and recurrent UTIs. Cystine stones (1\% to $2 \%$ of all stones) occur exclusively in patients with a rare inherited defect in renal absorption of cystine (an amino acid).

Urinary stone formation may also occur with inflammatory bowel disease and in patients with an ileostomy or bowel resection because these patients absorb more oxalate. Some medications that are known to cause stones in some patients include antacids, acetazolamide (Diamox), vitamin D, laxatives, and high doses of aspirin. In many patients, however, no cause may be found.

Urinary stones account for about 328,000 hospital admissions each year. The occurrence of urinary stones occurs predominantly in the third to fifth decades of life and affects men more than women. About half of patients with a single renal stone have another episode within 5 years. Most stones contain calcium or magnesium in combination with phosphorus or oxalate. Most stones are radiopaque and can be detected by x-ray studies (Bihl \& Meyers, 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Signs and symptoms of stones in the urinary tract depend on obstruction, infection, and edema. When the stones block the flow of urine, obstruction develops, producing an increase in hydrostatic pressure and distending the renal pelvis and proximal ureter. Infection (pyelonephritis and cystitis with chills, fever, and dysuria) can occur from constant irritation by the stone. Some stones cause few, if any, symptoms while slowly destroying the functional units (nephrons) of the kidney; others cause excruciating pain and discomfort.

Stones in the renal pelvis may be associated with an intense, deep ache in the costovertebral region. Hematuria is often present; pyuria may also be noted. Pain originating in the renal area radi-
ates anteriorly and downward toward the bladder in the female and toward the testis in the male. If the pain suddenly becomes acute, with tenderness over the costovertebral area, and nausea and vomiting appear, the patient is having an episode of renal colic. Diarrhea and abdominal discomfort may occur. These GI symptoms are due to renointestinal reflexes and the anatomic proximity of the kidneys to the stomach, pancreas, and large intestine.

Stones lodged in the ureter (ureteral obstruction) cause acute, excruciating, colicky, wavelike pain, radiating down the thigh and to the genitalia. Often, the patient has a desire to void, but little urine is passed, and it usually contains blood because of the abrasive action of the stone. This group of symptoms is called ureteral colic. Colic is mediated by prostaglandin E, a substance that increases ureteral contractility and renal blood flow and that leads to increased intraureteral pressure and pain. In general, the patient spontaneously passes stones 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. Stones larger than 1 cm in diameter usually must be removed or fragmented (broken up by lithotripsy) so that they can be removed or passed spontaneously.

Stones lodged in the bladder usually produce symptoms of irritation and may be associated with UTI and hematuria. If the stone obstructs the bladder neck, urinary retention occurs. If infection is associated with a stone, the condition is far more serious, with sepsis threatening the patient's life.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis is confirmed by x-ray films of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (KUB) or by ultrasonography, intravenous urography, or retrograde pyelography. Blood chemistries and a 24-hour urine test for measurement of calcium, uric acid, creatinine, sodium, pH , and total volume are part of the diagnostic workup. Dietary and medication histories and family history of renal stones are obtained to identify factors predisposing the patient to the formation of stones.

When stones are recovered (stones may be freely passed by the patient or removed through special procedures), chemical analysis is carried out to determine their composition. Stone analysis can provide a clear indication of the underlying disorder. For example, calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones usually indicate disorders of oxalate or calcium metabolism, whereas urate stones suggest a disturbance in uric acid metabolism.

\section*{Medical Management}

The basic goals of management are to eradicate the stone, to determine the stone type, to prevent nephron destruction, to control infection, and to relieve any obstruction that may be present. The immediate objective of treatment of renal or ureteral colic is to relieve the pain until its cause can be eliminated. Opioid analgesics are administered to prevent shock and syncope that may result from the excruciating pain. NSAIDs may be as effective as other analgesics in treating renal stone pain. They provide specific pain relief because they inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin $E$.

Hot baths or moist heat to the flank areas may also be useful. Unless the patient is vomiting or has heart failure or any other condition requiring fluid restriction, fluids are encouraged. This increases the hydrostatic pressure behind the stone, assisting it in its downward passage. A high, around-the-clock fluid intake reduces the concentration of urinary crystalloids, dilutes the urine, and ensures a high urine output.

Nutritional therapy plays an important role in preventing renal stones. Fluid intake is the mainstay of most medical therapy for renal stones. Unless contraindicated, any patient with renal stones should drink at least eight 8 -ounce glasses of water daily to keep the urine dilute. A urine output exceeding 2 L a day is advisable (Chart 45-11).

Calcium Stones. Historically, patients with calcium-based renal stones were advised to restrict calcium in their diet. Recent evidence, however, has questioned the advisability of this practice, except for patients with type II absorptive hypercalciuria (half of all patients with calcium stones), in whom stones are clearly due to excess dietary calcium. Current research supports a liberal fluid intake along with dietary restriction of protein and sodium. It is thought that a high-protein diet is associated with increased urinary excretion of calcium and uric acid, thereby causing a supersaturation of these substances in the urine. Similarly, a high sodium intake has been shown in some studies to increase the amount of calcium in the urine. The urine may be acidified by use of medications such as ammonium chloride or acetohydroxamic acid (Lithostat) (Trinchieri, Zanetti, Curro \& Lizzano, 2001; Williams, Child, Hudson et al., 2001).

Cellulose sodium phosphate (Calcibind) may be effective in preventing calcium stones. It binds calcium from food in the intestinal tract, reducing the amount of calcium absorbed into the circulation. If increased parathormone production (resulting in increased serum calcium levels in blood and urine) is a factor in the formation of stones, therapy with thiazide diuretics may be beneficial in reducing the calcium loss in the urine and lowering the elevated parathormone levels.

Uric Acid Stones. For uric acid stones, the patient is placed on a low-purine diet to reduce the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Foods high in purine (shellfish, anchovies, asparagus, mushrooms, and organ meats) are avoided, and other proteins may be limited. Allopurinol (Zyloprim) may be prescribed to reduce serum uric acid levels and urinary uric acid excretion. The urine is alkalinized. For cystine stones, a low-protein diet is prescribed, the urine is alkalinized, and penicillamine is administered to reduce the amount of cystine in the urine.

0xalate Stones. For oxalate stones, a dilute urine is maintained and the intake of oxalate is limited. Many foods contain oxalate; however, only certain foods have been proved to increase the uri-

\section*{Dietary Recommendations for Prevention of Kidney Stones}
- Restricting protein to $60 \mathrm{~g} /$ day is recommended to decrease urinary excretion of calcium and uric acid.
- A sodium restriction of $3-4 \mathrm{~g} /$ day is recommended. Table salt and high-sodium foods should be reduced because sodium competes with calcium for reabsorption in the kidneys.
- Low-calcium diets are not generally recommended, except for true absorptive hypercalciuria. Evidence shows that limiting calcium, especially in women, can lead to osteoporosis and does not prevent renal stones.
- Oxalate-containing foods (spinach, strawberries, rhubarb, tea, peanuts, wheat bran) may be restricted.
nary excretion of oxalate significantly. These include spinach, strawberries, rhubarb, chocolate, tea, peanuts, and wheat bran.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

If the stone is not passed spontaneously or if complications occur, treatment modalities may include surgical, endoscopic, or other procedures-for example, ureteroscopy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), or endourologic (percutaneous) stone removal.

Ureteroscopy (Fig. 45-7) involves first visualizing the stone and then destroying it. Access to the stone is accomplished by inserting a ureteroscope into the ureter and then inserting a laser, electrohydraulic lithotriptor, or ultrasound device through the ureteroscope to fragment and remove the stones. A stent may be inserted and left in place for 48 hours or more after the procedure to keep the ureter patent. Hospital stays are generally brief, and some patients can be treated as outpatients.

ESWL is a noninvasive procedure used to break up stones in the calyx of the kidney (see Fig. 45-7B). After the stones are fragmented to the size of grains of sand, the remnants of the stones are spontaneously voided. In ESWL, a high-energy amplitude of pressure, or shock wave, is generated by the abrupt release of energy and transmitted through water and soft tissues. When the shock wave encounters a substance of different intensity (a renal stone), a compression wave causes the surface of the stone to fragment. Repeated shock waves focused on the stone eventually reduce it to many small pieces. These small pieces are excreted in the urine, usually without difficulty.

The need for anesthesia for the procedure depends on the type of lithotriptor used, which determines the number and intensity of shock waves delivered. An average treatment comprises between 1,000 and 3,000 shocks. The first-generation lithotriptors required use of either regional or general anesthesia. Second- and thirdgeneration lithotriptors, many of which also employ ultrasound guidance, require little to no anesthesia (Tombolini, Ruoppolo, Bellorofonte et al., 2000).

Although the shock waves usually do not damage other tissue, discomfort from the multiple shocks may occur. The patient is observed for obstruction and infection resulting from blockage of the urinary tract by stone fragments. All urine is strained after the procedure; voided gravel or sand is sent to the laboratory for chemical analysis. Several treatments may be necessary to ensure disintegration of stones. Although lithotripsy is a costly treatment, the length of hospital stay is decreased, as is expense, because an invasive surgical procedure to remove the renal stone is avoided.

Endourologic methods of stone removal (see Fig. 45-7C) may be used to extract renal calculi that cannot be removed by other procedures. A percutaneous nephrostomy or a percutaneous nephrolithotomy (which are similar procedures) may be performed, and a nephroscope is introduced through the dilated percutaneous tract into the renal parenchyma. Depending on its size, the stone may be extracted with forceps or by a stone retrieval basket. Alternatively, an ultrasound probe may be introduced through the nephrostomy tube. Then, ultrasonic waves are used to pulverize the stone. Small stone fragments and stone dust are irrigated and suctioned out of the collecting system. Larger stones may be further reduced by ultrasonic disintegration and then removed with forceps or a stone retrieval basket (Streem, 2000).

Electrohydraulic lithotripsy is a similar method in which an electrical discharge is used to create a hydraulic shock wave to break up the stone. A probe is passed through the cystoscope, and

\caption{EIGURE 45-7 Methods of treating renal stones. (A) During a cystoscopy, which is used for removing small renal stones located close to the bladder, a ureteroscope is inserted into the ureter to visualize the stone. The stone is then fragmented or captured and removed. (B) Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is used for most symptomatic nonpassable upper urinary tract stones. Electromagnetically generated shock waves are focused over the area of the renal stone. The high-energy dry shock waves pass through the skin and fragment the stone.

\end{figure}
the tip of the lithotriptor is placed near the stone. The strength of the discharge and pulse frequency can be varied. This procedure is performed under topical anesthesia. After the stone is extracted, the percutaneous nephrostomy tube is left in place for a time to ensure that the ureter is not obstructed by edema or blood clots. The most common complications are hemorrhage, infection, and urinary extravasation. After the tube is removed, the nephrostomy tract closes spontaneously.

Chemolysis, stone dissolution using infusions of chemical solutions (eg, alkylating agents, acidifying agents) for the purpose of dissolving the stone, is an alternative treatment sometimes used in patients who are at risk for complications of other types of therapy, who refuse to undergo other methods, or who have stones (struvite) that dissolve easily. A percutaneous nephrostomy is performed, and the warm irrigating solution is allowed to flow continuously onto the stone. The irrigating solution exits the renal collecting system by means of the ureter or the nephrostomy tube. The pressure inside the renal pelvis is monitored during the procedure.

Several of these treatment modalities may be used in combination to ensure removal of the stones (Bihl \& Meyers, 2001; Joshi, Kumar \& Timoney, 2001; Liou \& Streem, 2001).

Surgical removal was the major mode of therapy before the advent of lithotripsy. Today, however, surgery is performed in only $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of patients. Surgical intervention is indicated if the stone does not respond to other forms of treatment. It may also be performed to correct anatomic abnormalities within the kidney to improve urinary drainage. If the stone is in the kidney, the surgery performed may be a nephrolithotomy (incision into the kidney with removal of the stone) or a nephrectomy, if the kidney is nonfunctional secondary to infection or hydronephrosis. Stones in the kidney pelvis are removed by a pyelolithotomy, those in the ureter by ureterolithotomy, and those in the bladder by cystotomy. If the stone is in the bladder, an instrument may be inserted through the urethra into the bladder, and the stone is crushed in the jaws of this instrument. Such a procedure is called a cystolitholapaxy (Maheshwari, Oswal \& Bansal, 1999; Monga \& Oglevie, 2000; Streem, 2000). Nursing management following kidney surgery is discussed in Chapter 44.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH KIDNEY STONES}

\section*{Assessment}

The patient with suspected renal stones is assessed for pain and discomfort as well as associated symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distention. The severity and location of pain are determined, along with any radiation of the pain. Nursing assessment also includes observing for signs and symptoms of UTI (chills, fever, dysuria, frequency, and hesitancy) and obstruction (frequent urination of small amounts, oliguria, or anuria). The urine is inspected for blood and is strained for stones or gravel.

The history focuses on factors that predispose the patient to urinary tract stones or that may have precipitated the current episode of renal or ureteral colic. Predisposing factors include family history of stones, the presence of cancer or bone marrow disorders or the use of chemotherapeutic agents, inflammatory bowel disease, or a diet high in calcium or purines. Factors that may precipitate stone formation in the patient predisposed to renal calculi include episodes of dehydration, prolonged immobilization, and infection. The patient's knowledge about renal
stones and measures to prevent their occurrence or recurrence is also assessed.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses in the patient with renal stones may include the following:
- Acute pain related to inflammation, obstruction, and abrasion of the urinary tract
- Deficient knowledge regarding prevention of recurrence of renal stones

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Infection and sepsis (from UTI and pyelonephritis)
- Obstruction of the urinary tract by a stone or edema with subsequent acute renal failure

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of pain and discomfort, prevention of recurrence of renal stones, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Immediate relief of the severe pain from renal or ureteral colic is accomplished with the administration of opioid analgesic agents (intravenous or intramuscular administration may be prescribed to provide rapid relief) or NSAIDs (ie, ketorolac). The patient is encouraged and assisted to assume a position of comfort. If activity brings some pain relief, the patient is assisted to ambulate. The pain level is monitored closely, and increases in severity are reported promptly to the physician so that relief can be provided and additional treatment initiated. The patient is prepared for other treatment (eg, lithotripsy, percutaneous stone removal, ureteroscopy, or surgery) if severe pain is unrelieved and the stone is not passed spontaneously.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Because renal stones increase the risk for infection, sepsis, and obstruction of the urinary tract, the patient is instructed to report decreased urine volume and bloody or cloudy urine. The total urine output and patterns of voiding are monitored. Increased fluid intake is encouraged to prevent dehydration and increase hydrostatic pressure within the urinary tract to promote passage of the stone. If the patient cannot take adequate fluids orally, intravenous fluids are prescribed. Ambulation is encouraged as a means of moving the stone through the urinary tract.

Patients with calculi require frequent nursing observation to detect the spontaneous passage of a stone. All urine is strained through gauze because uric acid stones may crumble. Any blood clots passed in the urine should be crushed and the sides of the urinal and bedpan inspected for clinging stones. The patient is instructed to report any sudden increases in pain immediately because of the possibility of a stone fragment obstructing a ureter. Analgesic medications are administered as prescribed for the relief of pain and discomfort.

Vital signs, including temperature, are monitored closely to detect early signs of infection. UTIs may be associated with renal stones due to an obstruction from the stone or from the stone itself. All infections should be treated with the appropriate antibiotic agent before efforts are made to dissolve the stone (DeLeskey \& Massi-Ventura, 2000).

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Because the risk of recurring renal stones is high, the nurse provides education about the causes of kidney stones and ways to prevent their recurrence (Chart 45-12). The patient is encouraged to follow a regimen to avoid further stone formation. One facet of prevention is to maintain a high fluid intake because stones form more readily in concentrated urine. A patient who has shown a tendency to form stones should drink enough fluid to excrete greater than $2,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ of urine every 24 hours (preferably 3,000 to $4,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ ), should adhere to the prescribed diet, and should avoid sudden increases in environmental temperatures, which may cause a fall in urinary volume. Occupations and activities that produce excessive sweating can lead to severe temporary dehydration; therefore, fluid intake should be increased. Sufficient fluids should be taken in the evening to prevent urine from becoming too concentrated at night.

Urine cultures may be performed every 1 to 2 months the first year and periodically thereafter. Recurrent UTI is treated vigorously. Because prolonged immobilization slows renal drainage and alters calcium metabolism, increased mobility is encouraged whenever possible. In addition, excessive ingestion of vitamins (especially vitamin D ) and minerals is discouraged.

If lithotripsy, percutaneous stone removal, ureteroscopy, or other surgical procedures for stone removal have been performed, the patient is instructed about the signs and symptoms of complications that need to be reported to the physician. The importance of follow-up to assess kidney function and to ensure the eradication or removal of all kidney stones is emphasized to the patient and family.

If the patient underwent ESWL, the nurse must provide instructions for home care and necessary follow-up. The patient is encouraged to increase fluid intake to assist in the passage of stone fragments, which may occur for 6 weeks to several months after the procedure. The patient and family are instructed about signs and symptoms that indicate complications, such as fever, decreas-

ing urine output, and pain. It is also important to tell the patient to expect hematuria (it is anticipated in all patients), but it should disappear within 4 to 5 days. If the patient has a stent in the ureter, hematuria may be expected until it is removed. The patient is instructed to notify the physician if nausea or vomiting, a temperature greater than $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (about $101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ), or pain unrelieved by the prescribed medication occurs. The patient is also informed that a bruise may be observed on the treated side of the back.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The patient is monitored closely in follow-up care to ensure that treatment has been effective and that no complications, such as obstruction, infection, renal hematoma, or hypertension, have developed. During the patient's visits to the clinic or physician's office, the nurse has the opportunity to assess the patient's understanding of ESWL and possible complications. Additionally, the nurse has the opportunity to assess the patient's understanding of factors that increase the risk for recurrence of renal calculi and strategies to reduce those risks.

The patient's ability to monitor urinary pH and interpret the results is assessed during follow-up visits to the clinic or physician's office. Because of the high risk for recurrence, the patient with renal stones needs to understand the signs and symptoms of stone formation, obstruction, and infection and the importance of reporting these signs promptly. If medications are prescribed for the prevention of stone formation, the actions and importance of the medications are explained to the patient.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Reports relief of pain
2. States increased knowledge of health-seeking behaviors to prevent recurrence
a. Consumes increased fluid intake (at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day)
b. Participates in appropriate activity
c. Consumes diet prescribed to reduce dietary factors predisposing to stone formation
d. Recognizes symptoms to be reported to health care provider (fever, chills, flank pain, hematuria)
e. Monitors urinary pH as directed
f. Takes prescribed medication as directed to reduce stone formation
3. Experiences no complications
a. Reports no signs or symptoms of sepsis or infection
b. Voids 200 to 400 mL per voiding of clear urine without evidence of bleeding
c. Experiences absence of dysuria, frequency, and hesitancy
d. Maintains normal body temperature

\section*{GenitourinaryTrauma}

Various types of injuries of the flank, back, or upper abdomen may result in trauma to the kidney, ureter, bladder, or urethra. Trauma to the kidney accounts for about half of all cases of genitourinary trauma (Dreitlein, Suner \& Basler, 2001).

\section*{RENAL TRAUMA}

Normally, the kidneys are protected by the rib cage and musculature of the back posteriorly and by a cushion of abdominal wall and viscera anteriorly. They are highly mobile and are fixed only at the renal pedicle (stem of renal blood vessels and the ureter). With traumatic injury, the kidney can be thrust against the lower ribs, resulting in contusion and rupture. Rib fractures or fractures of the transverse process of the upper lumbar vertebrae may be associated with renal contusion or laceration. Injuries may be blunt (automobile and motorcycle crashes, falls, athletic injuries, assaults) or penetrating (gunshot wounds, stabbings). Failure to wear seat belts contributes to the incidence of renal trauma in motor vehicle crashes. Up to $80 \%$ of patients with renal trauma have associated injuries of other internal organs.

Renal trauma may be classified by the mechanism of injury: blunt or penetrating. Blunt renal trauma accounts for $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of all renal injuries; penetrating renal trauma accounts for the remaining 10\% to 20\% (Bayerstock, Simons \& McLoughlin, 2001). Blunt renal trauma is classified into one of four groups, as follows:
- Contusion: bruises or hemorrhages under the renal capsule; capsule and collecting system intact
- Minor laceration: superficial disruption of the cortex; renal medulla and collecting system are not involved
- Major laceration: parenchymal disruption extending into cortex and medulla, possibly involving the collecting system
- Vascular injury: tears of renal artery or vein

The most common renal injuries are contusions, lacerations, ruptures, and renal pedicle injuries or small internal lacerations of the kidney (Fig. 45-8). The kidneys receive half of the blood

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
flow from the abdominal aorta; therefore, even a fairly small renal laceration can produce massive bleeding. About $70 \%$ of patients are in shock when admitted to the hospital (Dreitlein et al., 2001).

Clinical manifestations include pain, renal colic (due to blood clots or fragments obstructing the collecting system), hematuria, mass or swelling in the flank, ecchymoses, and lacerations or wounds of the lateral abdomen and flank. Hematuria is the most common manifestation of renal trauma; its presence after trauma suggests renal injury. There is no relationship between the degree of hematuria and the degree of injury. Hematuria may not occur, or it may be detectable only on microscopic examination. Signs and symptoms of hypovolemia and shock are likely with significant hemorrhage.

\section*{URETERAL TRAUMA}

Penetrating trauma and unintentional injury during surgery are the major causes of trauma to the ureters. Gunshot wounds account for $95 \%$ of ureteral injuries, which may range from contusions to complete transection. Unintentional injury to the ureter may occur during gynecologic or urologic surgery (Mathevet, Valencia, Cousin et al., 2001; Perez-Brayfield, Keane, Krishnan et al., 2001). There are no specific signs or symptoms of ureteral injury; many traumatic injuries are discovered during exploratory surgery. If the ureteral trauma is not detected and urine leakage continues, fistulas are likely to develop.

Intravenous urography detects $90 \%$ of ureteral injuries and can be performed on the operating table in patients undergoing emergent surgery. Surgical repair with placement of stents (to divert urine away from the anastomoses) is usually necessary.

\section*{BLADDER TRAUMA}

Injury to the bladder may occur with pelvic fractures and multiple trauma or from a blow to the lower abdomen when the bladder is full. Blunt trauma may result in contusion evident as an ecchymosis-a large, discolored bruise resulting from escape of blood into the tissues and involving a segment of the bladder wallor in rupture of the bladder extraperitoneally, intraperitoneally, or both. Complications from these injuries include hemorrhage, shock, sepsis, and extravasation of blood into the tissues, which must be treated promptly (Morey, Iverson, Swan et al., 2001).

\section*{URETHRAL TRAUMA}

Urethral injuries usually occur with blunt trauma to the lower abdomen or pelvic region. Many patients also have associated pelvic fractures. The classic triad of symptoms comprises blood at the urinary meatus, inability to void, and a distended bladder (Jordan, Jezior \& Rosenstein, 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of management in patients with genitourinary trauma are to control hemorrhage, pain, and infection; to preserve and restore renal function; and to maintain urinary drainage. In renal trauma, all urine is saved and sent to the laboratory for analysis to detect RBCs and to evaluate the course of bleeding. Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are monitored closely; decreasing values indicate hemorrhage.

The patient is monitored for oliguria and signs of hemorrhagic shock because a pedicle injury or shattered kidney can lead to rapid exsanguination (lethal blood loss). An expanding hematoma may cause rupture of the kidney capsule. To detect hematoma, the area around the lower ribs, upper lumbar vertebrae, flank, and abdomen is palpated for tenderness. A palpable flank or abdominal mass with local tenderness, swelling, and ecchymosis suggests renal hemorrhage. The area of the original mass can be outlined with a marking pencil so that the examiner can evaluate the area for change.

Renal trauma is often associated with other injuries to the abdominal organs (liver, colon, small intestines); therefore, the patient is assessed for skin abrasions, lacerations, and entry and exit wounds of the upper abdomen and lower thorax because these may be associated with renal injury.

With renal trauma, such as a contusion of the kidney, healing may take place with conservative measures. If the patient has microscopic hematuria and a normal intravenous urogram, outpatient management is possible. If gross hematuria or a minor laceration is present, the patient is hospitalized and kept on bed rest until hematuria clears. Antimicrobial medications may be prescribed to prevent infection from perirenal hematoma or urinoma (a cyst containing urine). Patients with retroperitoneal hematomas may develop low-grade fever as absorption of the clot takes place.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In renal trauma, any sudden change in the patient's condition may indicate hemorrhage and requires surgical intervention.

> NURSING ALERT Vital signs, urine output, and level of consciousness are monitored to detect bleeding and shock. Opioid analgesia is avoided because this may mask accompanying abdominal symptoms.

NURSING ALERT The patient is prepared for immediate surgery in cases of increasing pulse rate, hypotension, and impending shock.

Depending on the patient's condition and the nature of the injury, major lacerations may be treated through surgical intervention or conservatively (bed rest, no surgery). Vascular injuries require immediate exploratory surgery because of the high incidence of involvement of other organ systems and the serious complications that may result if these injuries are untreated. The patient is often in shock and requires aggressive fluid resuscitation. The damaged kidney may have to be removed (nephrectomy).

Early postoperative complications (within 6 months) include rebleeding, perinephritic abscess formation, sepsis, urine extravasation, and fistula formation. Other complications include stone formation, infection, cysts, vascular aneurysms, and loss of renal function. Hypertension can be a complication of any renal surgery but usually is a late complication of renal injury.

In bladder trauma, treatment for rupture of the bladder involves immediate exploratory surgery and repair of the laceration, suprapubic drainage of the bladder and the perivesical space (around the bladder), and insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter. In addition to the usual care following urologic surgery, the drainage systems (suprapubic, indwelling urethral catheter, and perivesical drains) are closely monitored to ensure adequate drainage until healing takes place. The patient with a ruptured bladder may have gross bleeding for several days after repair.

In urethral trauma, unstable patients who need monitoring of urine output may need a suprapubic catheter inserted.

NURSING ALERT If blood is seen at the urinary meatus, urethral catheterization should not be attempted until an emergency retrograde urethrogram can be performed.

The patient is catheterized after urethrography is performed to minimize the risk of urethral disruption and extensive, long-term complications, such as stricture, incontinence, and impotence. Surgical repair may be performed immediately or at a later time. Delayed surgical repair tends to be the favored procedure because it is associated with fewer long-term complications, such as impotence, strictures, and incontinence. After surgery, an indwelling urinary catheter may remain in place for up to 1 month.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with genitourinary trauma (particularly renal trauma) should be assessed frequently during the first few days after injury to detect flank and abdominal pain, muscle spasm, and swelling over the flank.

During this time, patients can be instructed about care of the incision and the importance of an adequate fluid intake. In addition, instructions about changes that should be reported to the physician, such as fever, hematuria, flank pain, or any signs and symptoms of decreasing kidney function, are provided. Guidelines for increasing activity gradually, lifting, and driving are also provided in accordance with the physician's prescription.

Follow-up nursing care includes monitoring the blood pressure to detect hypertension and advising the patient to restrict activities for about 1 month after trauma to minimize the incidence of delayed or secondary bleeding. The patient should be advised to schedule periodic follow-up assessments of renal function (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine analyses). If a nephrectomy was necessary, the patient is advised to wear medical identification.

\section*{Urinary Tract Cancers}

The American Cancer Society (2002) estimates increases in both the incidence and death rates of all urinary tract cancers over previous reports; however, while the rate of estimated new cases of bladder cancer has increased, there has been a slight decrease in the rate of new cases of kidney and renal pelvis cancer in the last few years. Urinary tract cancers include those of the urinary bladder, kidney and renal pelvis, ureter, and other urinary structures, such as the prostate. Prostate cancer is discussed in Chapter 49. Tobacco use continues to be a leading cause of all urinary tract cancers.

\section*{CANCER OF THE KIDNEY}

Cancer of the kidney accounts for about $3.7 \%$ of all cancers in adults in the United States. It affects almost twice as many men as women. The most common type of renal tumor is renal cell or renal adenocarcinoma, accounting for more than $85 \%$ of all kidney tumors (Hock et al., 2002). These tumors may metastasize early to the lungs, bone, liver, brain, and contralateral kidney. One third of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The incidence of all stages of kidney cancer has increased
in the last two decades in the United States. Although enhanced imaging techniques account for improved detection of early-stage kidney cancer, it is unknown why the rate of late-stage kidney cancers is higher (Hock, Lynch \& Balaji, 2002) (Chart 45-13).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Many renal tumors produce no symptoms and are discovered on a routine physical examination as a palpable abdominal mass. The classic triad of signs and symptoms, which occurs in only $10 \%$ of patients, comprises hematuria, pain, and a mass in the flank. The usual sign that first calls attention to the tumor is painless hematuria, which may be either intermittent and microscopic or continuous and gross. There may be a dull pain in the back from the pressure produced by compression of the ureter, extension of the tumor into the perirenal area, or hemorrhage into the kidney tissue. Colicky pains occur if a clot or mass of tumor cells passes down the ureter. Symptoms from metastasis may be the first manifestations of renal tumor and may include unexplained weight loss, increasing weakness, and anemia.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of a renal tumor may require intravenous urography, cystoscopic examination, nephrotomograms, renal angiograms, ultrasonography, or a CT scan. These tests may be exhausting for patients already debilitated by the systemic effects of a tumor as well as for elderly patients and those who are anxious about the diagnosis and outcome. The nurse assists the patient to prepare physically and psychologically for these procedures and monitors carefully for signs and symptoms of dehydration and exhaustion.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of management is to eradicate the tumor before metastasis occurs (Kirkali, Tuzel \& Munga, 2002).

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

A radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment if the tumor can be removed. This includes removal of the kidney (and tumor), adrenal gland, surrounding perinephric fat and Gerota's fascia, and lymph nodes. Radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy may be used along with surgery. Immunotherapy may also be helpful. For patients with bilateral tumors or cancer of a functional single kidney, nephron-sparing surgery (partial nephrectomy) may be considered. Favorable results have been achieved in patients with small local tumors and a normal contralateral kidney.

Nephron-sparing surgery is increasingly being used to treat patients with solid renal lesions. The technical success rate of
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-354.jpg?height=428&width=864&top_left_y=2182&top_left_x=202)
nephron-sparing surgery is excellent, and operative morbidity and mortality are low. For renal cell carcinoma, long-term cancerfree survival is comparable to that after radical nephrectomy, particularly for low-stage disease (Uzzo \& Novick, 2001). Although laparoscopic nephroureterectomy is a lengthier surgical procedure, it has the same efficacy and is better tolerated by patients than open nephroureterectomy for upper tract transitional cell carcinoma. As more experience is gained with this type of surgery, surgical time will be reduced (Chen \& Bagley, 2000; Jabbour, Desgrandchamps, Cazin et al., 2000; Shalhav, Dunn, Portis et al., 2000).

Renal Artery Embolization. In patients with metastatic renal carcinoma, the renal artery may be occluded to impede the blood supply to the tumor and thus kill the tumor cells. After angiographic studies are completed, a catheter is advanced into the renal artery, and embolizing materials (Gelfoam, autologous blood clot, steel coils) are injected into the artery and carried with the arterial blood flow to occlude the tumor vessels mechanically. This decreases the local blood supply, making removal of the kidney (nephrectomy) easier. It also stimulates an immune response because infarction of the renal cell carcinoma releases tumorassociated antigens that enhance the patient's response to metastatic lesions. The procedure may also reduce the number of tumor cells entering the venous circulation during surgical manipulation.

After renal artery embolization and tumor infarction, a characteristic symptom complex called postinfarction syndrome occurs, lasting 2 to 3 days. The patient has pain localized to the flank and abdomen, elevated temperature, and GI symptoms. Pain is treated with parenteral analgesic agents, and acetaminophen is administered to control fever. Antiemetic medications, restriction of oral intake, and intravenous fluids are used to treat the GI symptoms.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Currently, no pharmacologic agents are in widespread use for treating renal cell carcinoma. Depending on the stage of the tumor, percutaneous partial or radical nephrectomy may be followed by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The use of biologic response modifiers such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and topical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in the renal pelvis continue to be studied, with both treatments currently used in clinical practice (Hvarness, Krarup \& Eldrup, 2001; Nonomura, Ono, Nozawa et al., 2000; Okubo, Ichioka, Matsuta et al., 2001).

Patients may be treated with IL-2, a protein that regulates cell growth. This may be used alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells, which are WBCs that have been stimulated by IL-2 to increase their ability to kill cancer cells. Interferon, another biologic response modifier, appears to have a direct antiproliferative effect on renal tumors. The study of these biologic agents and new biologic response modifiers is a priority because nearly half of all patients with renal cell carcinoma die within 5 years of diagnosis (Pizza, De Vinci, LoConte et al., 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with a renal tumor usually undergoes extensive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including surgery, radiation therapy, and medication (or systemic) therapy. After surgery, the patient usually has catheters and drains in place to maintain a patent urinary tract, to remove drainage, and to permit accurate measurement of urine output. Because of the location of the surgical incision, the position of the patient during surgery, and the
nature of the surgical procedure, pain and muscle soreness are common.

The patient requires frequent analgesia during the postoperative period and assistance with turning. Turning, coughing, use of incentive spirometry, and deep breathing are encouraged to prevent atelectasis and other pulmonary complications. The patient and family require assistance and support to cope with the diagnosis and uncertainties about the prognosis. (See Chap. 44 for a discussion of postoperative care of the patient undergoing kidney surgery and Chap. 16 for discussion of care of the patient with cancer.)

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient is taught to inspect and care for the incision and perform other general postoperative care. Additionally, the patient learns about activity and lifting restrictions, driving, and use of pain medications. Instructions are provided about follow-up care and when to notify the physician about problems (fever, breathing difficulty, wound drainage, blood in the urine, pain or swelling of the legs).

The patient is encouraged to eat a well-balanced diet and to drink adequate liquids to avoid constipation and to maintain an adequate urine volume. Education and emotional support are provided related to the disease process, treatment plan, and continuing care because many patients are concerned about the loss of the other kidney, the possible need for dialysis, or the recurrence of cancer.

Continuing Care. Follow-up care is essential to detect signs of metastases and to reassure the patient and family about the patient's status and well-being. The patient who has had surgery for renal carcinoma should have a yearly physical examination and chest x-ray because late metastases are not uncommon. All subsequent symptoms should be evaluated with possible metastases in mind.

If follow-up chemotherapy is necessary, the patient and family are informed about the entire treatment plan or chemotherapy protocol, what to expect with each visit, and how to notify the physician. Periodic evaluation of remaining renal function (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine levels) may also be carried out periodically. A home care nurse may monitor the patient's physical status and psychological well-being and coordinate other services and resources needed by the patient.

\section*{CANCER OF THE BLADDER}

Cancer of the urinary bladder is more common in people aged 50 to 70 years. It affects men more than women ( $3: 1$ ) and is more common in whites than in African Americans. Bladder cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer in American men, accounting for more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S. annually (American Cancer Society, 2002). Bladder cancer has a high worldwide incidence (Amling, 2001). Bladder tumors account for nearly 1 in 25 cancers diagnosed in the United States. There are two forms of bladder cancer: superficial (which tends to recur) and invasive. About $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of all bladder cancers are transitional cell (which means they arise from the transitional cells of the bladder); the remaining types of tumors are squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. Research has demonstrated that many individuals with bladder cancer for which a total cystectomy is required go on to develop upper urinary tract tumors (Amling, 2001; Huguet-Perez, Palui, Millan-Rodriguez et al., 2001).

The predominant cause of bladder cancer today is cigarette smoking. Cancers arising from the prostate, colon, and rectum in males and from the lower gynecologic tract in females may metastasize to the bladder (Chart 45-14).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Bladder tumors usually arise at the base of the bladder and involve the ureteral orifices and bladder neck. Visible, painless hematuria is the most common symptom of bladder cancer. Infection of the urinary tract is a common complication, producing frequency, urgency, and dysuria. Any alteration in voiding or change in the urine, however, may indicate cancer of the bladder. Pelvic or back pain may occur with metastasis.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnostic evaluation includes cystoscopy (the mainstay of diagnosis), excretory urography, a CT scan, ultrasonography, and bimanual examination with the patient anesthetized. Biopsies of the tumor and adjacent mucosa are the definitive diagnostic procedures. Transitional cell carcinomas and carcinomas in situ shed recognizable cancer cells. Cytologic examination of fresh urine and saline bladder washings provide information about the prognosis, especially for patients at high risk for recurrence of primary bladder tumors (Amling, 2001).

Although mainstay diagnostic tools such as cytology and CT scanning have a high detection rate, they are costly. Newer diagnostic indicators are being studied. Bladder tumor antigens, nuclear matrix proteins, adhesion molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, and growth factors are being studied to support the early detection and diagnosis of bladder cancer. There are an increasing number of molecular assays available for the detection of bladder cancer (Saad, Hanbury, McNicholas et al., 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of bladder cancer depends on the grade of the tumor (the degree of cellular differentiation), the stage of tumor growth (the degree of local invasion and the presence or absence of metastasis), and the multicentricity (having many centers) of the tumor. The patient's age and physical, mental, and emotional status are considered when determining treatment modalities.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Transurethral resection or fulguration (cauterization) may be performed for simple papillomas (benign epithelial tumors). These procedures, described in more detail in Chapter 49, eradicate the

\section*{Risk Factors for Bladder Cancer}
- Cigarette smoking: risk proportional to number of packs smoked daily and number of years of smoking
- Environmental carcinogens: dyes, rubber, leather, ink, or paint
- Recurrent or chronic bacterial infection of the urinary tract
- Bladder stones
- High urinary pH
- High cholesterol intake
- Pelvic radiation therapy
- Cancers arising from the prostate, colon, and rectum in males
tumors through surgical incision or electrical current with the use of instruments inserted through the urethra. After this bladdersparing surgery, intravesical administration of BCG is the treatment of choice.

Management of superficial bladder cancers presents a challenge because there are usually widespread abnormalities in the bladder mucosa. The entire lining of the urinary tract, or urothelium, is at risk because carcinomatous changes can occur in the mucosa of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, and urethra. About $25 \%$ to $40 \%$ of superficial tumors recur after transurethral resection or fulguration. Patients with benign papillomas should undergo cytology and cystoscopy periodically for the rest of their lives because aggressive malignancies may develop from these tumors.

A simple cystectomy (removal of the bladder) or a radical cystectomy is performed for invasive or multifocal bladder cancer. Radical cystectomy in men involves removal of the bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles and immediate adjacent perivesical tissues. In women, radical cystectomy involves removal of the bladder, lower ureter, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, anterior vagina, and urethra. It may include removal of pelvic lymph nodes. Removal of the bladder requires a urinary diversion procedure.

Although radical cystectomy remains the standard of care for invasive bladder cancer in the United States, researchers are exploring trimodality therapy: transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, radiation, and chemotherapy. This is in an effort to spare patients the need for cystectomy. A trimodality approach to transitional cell bladder cancer mandates lifelong surveillance with cystoscopy. Although most completely responding patients retain their bladders free from invasive relapse, one quarter develop superficial disease. This may be managed with transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and intravesical therapies but carries an additional risk that late cystectomy will be required (Zietman, Grocela \& Zehr, 2001; Zietman, Shipley \& Kaufman, 2000).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Chemotherapy with a combination of methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cisplatin has been effective in producing partial remission of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in some patients. Intravenous chemotherapy may be accompanied by radiation therapy. The development of new chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine and the taxanes has opened up promising new perspectives in the treatment of bladder cancer. However, the preliminary phase II data must be confirmed in adequately conducted phase III trials (Bellmunt \& Albiol, 2001).

Topical chemotherapy (intravesical chemotherapy or instillation of antineoplastic agents into the bladder, resulting in contact of the agent with the bladder wall) is considered when there is a high risk for recurrence, when cancer in situ is present, or when tumor resection has been incomplete. Topical chemotherapy delivers a high concentration of medication (thiotepa, doxorubicin, mitomycin, ethoglucid, and BCG) to the tumor to promote tumor destruction. BCG is now considered the most effective intravesical agent for recurrent bladder cancer because it enhances the body's immune response to cancer.

Intravesical BCG is an immunotherapeutic agent that is given intravesically and is effective in the treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma. BCG has a $43 \%$ advantage in preventing tumor recurrence, a significantly better rate than the $16 \%$ to $21 \%$ advantage of intravesical chemotherapy. In addition, BCG is particularly effective in the treatment of carcinoma in situ, eradicating it in more than $80 \%$ of cases. In contrast to intravesical
chemotherapy, BCG has also been shown to decrease the risk of tumor progression.

The optimal course of BCG appears to be a 6-week course of weekly instillations, followed by a 3 -week course at 3 months in tumors that do not respond. In high-risk cancers, maintenance BCG administered for 3 weeks every 6 months may limit recurrence and prevent progression (Amling, 2001). The adverse effects associated with this prolonged therapy, however, may limit its widespread applicability.

The patient is allowed to eat and drink before the instillation procedure, but once the bladder is full, the patient must retain the intravesical solution for 2 hours before voiding. At the end of the procedure, the patient is encouraged to void and to drink liberal amounts of fluid to flush the medication from the bladder.

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

Radiation of the tumor may be performed preoperatively to reduce microextension of the neoplasm and viability of tumor cells, thus reducing the chances that the cancer may recur in the immediate area or spread through the circulatory or lymphatic systems. Radiation therapy is also used in combination with surgery or to control the disease in patients with an inoperable tumor. The transitional cell variety of bladder cancer responds poorly to chemotherapy. Cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide have been administered in various doses and schedules and appear most effective.

Bladder cancer may also be treated by direct infusion of the cytotoxic agent through the bladder's arterial blood supply to achieve a higher concentration of the chemotherapeutic agent with fewer systemic toxic effects. For more advanced bladder cancer or for patients with intractable hematuria (especially after radiation therapy), a large, water-filled balloon placed in the bladder produces tumor necrosis by reducing the blood supply of the bladder wall (hydrostatic therapy). The instillation of formalin, phenol, or silver nitrate relieves hematuria and strangury (slow and painful discharge of urine) in some patients.

\section*{INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPY}

The use of photodynamic techniques in treating superficial bladder cancer is under investigation. This procedure involves systemic injection of a photosensitizing material (hematoporphyrin), which the cancer cell picks up. A laser-generated light then changes the hematoporphyrin in the cancer cell into a toxic medication. This process is being investigated for patients in whom intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy has failed (Amling, 2001).

\section*{Urinary Diversions}

Urinary diversion procedures are performed to divert urine from the bladder to a new exit site, usually through a surgically created opening (stoma) in the skin. These procedures are primarily performed when a bladder tumor necessitates removal of the entire bladder (cystectomy). Urinary diversion has also been used in managing pelvic malignancy, birth defects, strictures, trauma to ureters and urethra, neurogenic bladder, chronic infection causing severe ureteral and renal damage, and intractable interstitial cystitis and as a last resort in managing incontinence.

Controversy exists about the best method of establishing permanent diversion of the urinary tract. New techniques are frequently introduced in an effort to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. The age of the patient, condition of the bladder, body build, degree of obesity, degree of ureteral dilation, status of renal function, and the patient's learning ability and willingness
to participate in postoperative care are all taken into consideration when determining the appropriate surgical procedure. Creating a reliable continence mechanism for a continent reservoir is a great challenge. The ability of urinary diversions to be continent devices for both ease of emptying and better quality of life has been the focus of research during recent years (Abol-Enein \& Ghoneim, 2001; Deliveliotis, Alargoff, Skolarikos et al., 2001; Kane, 2000; Yachia \& Erlich, 2001; Zinman, 1999).

The extent to which the patient accepts urinary diversion depends to a large degree on the location or position of the stoma, whether the drainage device (pouch or bag) establishes a watertight seal to the skin, and the patient's ability to manage the pouch and drainage apparatus. Paying attention to these considerations helps to promote a positive outcome (Kane, 2000).

There are two categories of urinary diversion: cutaneous urinary diversion, in which urine drains through an opening created in the abdominal wall and skin (Fig. 45-9), and continent urinary diversion, in which a portion of the intestine is used to create a new reservoir for urine (Fig. 45-10).

\section*{CUTANEOUS URINARY DIVERSIONS}

\section*{lleal Conduit (lleal Loop)}

The ileal conduit, the oldest of the urinary diversion procedures, is considered the gold standard because of the low number of complications and surgeons' familiarity with the procedure. In an ileal conduit, the urine is diverted by implanting the ureter into
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-357.jpg?height=616&width=471&top_left_y=854&top_left_x=112)

Conventional ileal conduit. The surgeon transplants the ureters to an isolated section of the terminal ileum (ileal conduit), bringing one end to the abdominal wall. The ureter may also be transplanted into the transverse sigmoid colon (colon conduit) or proximal jejunum (jejunal conduit).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-357.jpg?height=619&width=477&top_left_y=1829&top_left_x=108)

Vesicostomy. The surgeon sutures the bladder to the abdominal wall and creates an opening (stoma) through the abdominal and bladder walls for urinary drainage.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-357.jpg?height=612&width=503&top_left_y=849&top_left_x=726)

Cutaneous ureterostomy. The surgeon brings the detached ureter through the abdominal wall and attaches it to an opening in the skin.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-357.jpg?height=618&width=509&top_left_y=1808&top_left_x=747)

Nephrostomy. The surgeon inserts a catheter into the renal pelvis via an incision into the flank or, by percutaneous catheter placement, into the kidney.

FIGURE 45-9 Types of cutaneous diversions include (A) the conventional ileal conduit, (B) cutaneous ureterostomy, (C) vesicostomy, and (D) nephrostomy.

EIGURE 45-10 Types of continent urinary diversions include $(\mathbf{A})$ the Indiana pouch, (B and C) the Koch pouch, also called a continent ileal diversion, and (D) a ureterosigmoidostomy.

In male patients, the Koch pouch can be modified by attaching one end of the pouch to the urethra, allowing more normal voiding. The female urethra is too short for this modification.

Ureterosigmoidostomy. The surgeon introduces the ureters into the sigmoid, thereby allowing urine to flow through the colon and out of the rectum.
a $12-\mathrm{cm}$ loop of ileum that is led out through the abdominal wall. This loop of ileum is a simple conduit (passageway) for urine from the ureters to the surface. A loop of the sigmoid colon may also be used. An ileostomy bag is used to collect the urine. The resected (cut) ends of the remaining intestine are anastomosed (connected) to provide an intact bowel.

Stents, usually made of thin, pliable tubing, are placed in the ureters to prevent occlusion secondary to postsurgical edema. The bilateral ureteral stents allow urine to drain from the kidney to the stoma and provide a method for accurate measurement of urine output. They may be left in place 10 to 21 days postoperatively. Jackson-Pratt tubes or other types of drains are inserted to prevent the accumulation of fluid in the space created by removal of the bladder.

After surgery, a skin barrier and a transparent, disposable urinary drainage bag are applied around the conduit and connected to drainage. A custom-cut appliance is used until the edema subsides and the stoma shrinks to normal size. The clear bag allows the stoma to be seen and the patency of the stent and the urine output to be monitored. The ileal bag drains urine constantly
(not feces). The appliance (bag) usually remains in place as long as it is watertight; it is changed when necessary to prevent leakage of urine.

Complications that may follow placement of an ileal conduit include wound infection or wound dehiscence, urinary leakage, ureteral obstruction, hyperchloremic acidosis, small bowel obstruction, ileus, and stomal gangrene. Delayed complications include ureteral obstruction, contraction or narrowing of the stoma (stomal stenosis), renal deterioration due to chronic reflux, pyelonephritis, and renal calculi.

\section*{Nursing Management}

In the immediate postoperative period, urine volumes are monitored hourly. An output below $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ may indicate dehydration or an obstruction in the ileal conduit, with possible backflow or leakage from the ureteroileal anastomosis. Throughout the patient's hospitalization, the nurse monitors closely for complications, reports signs and symptoms of them promptly, and intervenes quickly to prevent their progression.

\section*{PROMOTING URINE OUTPUT}

A catheter may be inserted through the urinary conduit if prescribed to monitor the patient for possible stasis or residual urine from a constricted stoma. Urine may drain through the bilateral ureteral stents as well as around the stents. If the ureteral stents are not draining, the nurse may be instructed to irrigate them with 5 to 10 mL of sterile normal saline solution. It is important to avoid any tension on the stents because this may dislodge them. Hematuria may be noted in the first 48 hours after surgery but usually resolves spontaneously.

\section*{PROVIDING STOMA AND SKIN CARE}

Because the patient requires specialized care, a consultation is initiated with an enterostomal therapist or clinical nurse specialist in skin care. The stoma is inspected frequently for color and viability. A healthy stoma is beefy red. A change from this normal color to a dark purplish color suggests that the vascular supply may be compromised. If cyanosis and a compromised blood supply persist, surgical intervention may be necessary. The stoma is not sensitive to touch, but the skin around the stoma becomes sensitive if urine or the appliance irritates it. The skin is inspected for (1) signs of irritation and bleeding of the stomal mucosa, (2) encrustation and skin irritation around the stoma (from alkaline urine coming in contact with exposed skin), and (3) wound infections.

\section*{TESTING URINE AND CARING FOR THE OSTOMY}

Moisture in bed linens or clothing or the odor of urine around the patient should alert the nurse to the possibility of leakage from the appliance, potential infection, or a problem in hygienic management. Because severe alkaline encrustation can accumulate rapidly around the stoma, the urine pH is kept below 6.5 by administration of ascorbic acid by mouth. Urine pH can be determined by testing the urine draining from the stoma, not from the collecting appliance. A properly fitted appliance is essential to prevent exposure of the peristomal skin (skin around the stoma) to urine. If the urine is foul-smelling, the stoma is catheterized, if prescribed, to obtain a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity testing.

\section*{ENCOURAGING FLUIDS AND RELIEVING ANXIETY}

Because mucous membrane is used in forming the conduit, the patient may excrete a large amount of mucus mixed with urine. This causes many patients to feel anxious. To help relieve this anxiety, the nurse reassures the patient that this is a normal occurrence after an ileal conduit procedure. The nurse encourages adequate fluid intake to flush the ileal conduit and decrease the accumulation of mucus.

\section*{SELECTING THE OSTOMY APPLIANCE}

Various urine collection appliances are available, and the nurse is instrumental in selecting an appropriate one. The urinary appliance may consist of one or two pieces and may be disposable (usually used once and discarded) or reusable. The choice of appliance is determined by the location of the stoma and by the patient's normal activity, manual dexterity, visual function, body build, economic resources, and preference.

A reusable appliance has a faceplate that is attached to the skin surface with cement or adhesive. Either reusable pouches or disposable pouches may be used with the reusable faceplate. Disposable appliances have the advantages of having a surface that is already prepared for application to the skin and of being lightweight and easy to conceal. A skin barrier must be used to protect the skin from excoriation due to exposure to the urine.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Patient education begins in the hospital but continues into the home setting because patients are usually discharged within days of surgery. The nurse teaches the patient how to assess and manage the urinary diversion as well as how to deal with body image changes. An enterostomal therapist is invaluable in consulting with the nurse on various aspects of care and patient education.

Changing the Appliance. The patient and family are taught to apply and change the appliance so that they are comfortable carrying out the procedure and can do so proficiently. Ideally, the appliance system is changed before the system leaks and at a time that is convenient for the patient. Many patients find early morning most convenient because the urine output is reduced. A variety of appliances are available; an average collecting appliance lasts 3 to 7 days before leakage occurs.

Regardless of the type of appliance used, a skin barrier is essential to protect the skin from irritation and excoriation. To maintain peristomal skin integrity, a skin barrier or leaking pouch is never patched with tape to prevent accumulation of urine under the skin barrier or faceplate. The patient is instructed to avoid moisturizing soaps when cleaning the area because they interfere with the adhesion of the pouch. Because the degree to which the stoma protrudes is not the same in all patients, there are various accessories and custom-made appliances to solve individual problems. Guidelines for applying reusable and disposable systems are presented in Chart 45-15.

Controlling Odor. The patient is instructed to avoid foods that give the urine a strong odor (eg, asparagus, cheese, eggs). Today, most appliances contain odor barriers, but a few drops of liquid deodorizer or diluted white vinegar may be introduced through the drain spout into the bottom of the pouch with a syringe or eyedropper to reduce odors. Ascorbic acid by mouth helps acidify the urine and suppress urine odor. Patients should be cautioned about putting aspirin tablets in the pouch to control odor because they may ulcerate the stoma. Also, the patient is reminded that odor will develop if the pouch is worn too long and not cared for properly.

Managing the Ostomy Appliance. The patient is instructed to empty the pouch by means of a drain valve when it is one-third full because the weight of the urine will cause the pouch to separate from the skin if filled more. Some patients prefer wearing a leg bag attached with an adapter to the drainage apparatus. To promote uninterrupted sleep, a collecting bottle and tubing (one unit) are snapped onto an adapter that connects to the ileal appliance. A small amount of urine is left in the bag when the adapter is attached to prevent the bag from collapsing against itself. The tubing may be threaded down the pajama or pants leg to prevent kinking. The collecting bottle and tubing are rinsed daily with cool water and once a week with a $3: 1$ solution of water and white vinegar.

Cleaning and Deodorizing the Appliance. Usually, the reusable appliance is rinsed in warm water and soaked in a $3: 1$ solution of water and white vinegar or a commercial deodorizing solution for

8. Center opening of skin barrier over stoma and apply with firm, gentle pressure to attain a watertight seal.
9. If using a two-piece system, snap pouch onto the flanged wafer that adheres to skin.
10. Close drainage tap or spout at bottom of pouch.
11. A pouch cover can be used or cornstarch applied under pouch to prevent perspiration and skin irritation.
12. Apply hypoallergenic tape around the skin barrier in a pictureframe manner.
13. Dispose of soiled appliance.

30 minutes. It is rinsed with tepid water and air-dried away from direct sunlight. (Hot water and exposure to direct sunlight dry the pouch and increase the incidence of cracking.) After drying, the appliance may be powdered with cornstarch and stored. Two appliances are necessary-one to be worn while the other is airdrying.

Continuing Care. Follow-up care is essential to determine how the patient has adapted to the body image changes and lifestyle changes. Referral for home care is indicated to determine how well the patient and family are coping with the changes necessitated by altered urinary drainage. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical status and emotional response to urinary diversion. Additionally, the nurse assesses the ability of the patient and family to manage the urinary diversion and appliance, reinforces previous teaching, and provides additional information (eg, community resources, sources of ostomy supplies, insurance coverage for supplies).

As the postoperative edema subsides, the home care nurse assists in determining the appropriate changes needed in the ostomy appliance. The stoma opening is recalibrated every 3 to 6 weeks for the first few months postoperatively. The correct appliance size is determined by measuring the widest part of the stoma with a ruler. The permanent appliance should be no more
than $1.6 \mathrm{~mm}(1 / 8 \mathrm{inch})$ larger than the diameter of the stoma and the same shape as the stoma to prevent contact of the skin with drainage.

The nurse encourages the patient and family to contact the United Ostomy Association and local ostomy association for visits, reassurance, and practical information. In addition, the local division of the American Cancer Society can provide medical equipment and supplies and other resources for the patient who has undergone ostomy surgery for cancer.

The home care nurse also assesses the patient for potential long-term complications, such as ureteral obstruction, stomal stenosis, hernias, or deterioration of renal function, and reinforces previous teaching about these complications.

The nurse also needs to remind the patient who has had surgery for carcinoma to have a yearly physical examination and chest x-ray to assess for metastases. Periodic evaluation of remaining renal function (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine levels) is also essential. Long-term monitoring for anemia is performed to identify a vitamin B deficiency that may occur when a significant portion of the terminal ileum is removed. This may take several years to develop and can be treated with vitamin B injections. Additionally, the patient is reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

\section*{Cutaneous Ureterostomy}

A cutaneous ureterostomy (see Fig. 45-9), in which the ureters are directed through the abdominal wall and attached to an opening in the skin, is used for selected patients with ureteral obstruction (advanced pelvic cancer); for poor-risk patients, because it requires less extensive surgery than other urinary diversion procedures; and for patients who have had previous abdominal irradiation.

A urinary appliance is fitted immediately after surgery. The management of the patient with a cutaneous ureterostomy is similar to the care of the patient with an ileal conduit, although the stomas are usually flush with the skin or retracted.

\section*{Other Cutaneous Urinary Diversions}

Other cutaneous urinary diversions are used less frequently and are most often used to bypass obstructions. Suprapubic bladder drainage (cystostomy) and nephrostomy are discussed further in Chapter 44.

\section*{CONTINENT URINARY DIVERSIONS}

\section*{Continent lleal Urinary Reservoir (Indiana Pouch)}

The most common continent urinary diversion is the Indiana pouch, created for patients whose bladder is removed or can no longer function (neurogenic bladder). The Indiana pouch uses a
segment of the ileum and cecum to form the reservoir for urine (see Fig. 45-10A). The ureters are tunneled through the muscular bands of the intestinal pouch and anastomosed. The reservoir is made continent by narrowing the efferent portion of the ileum and sewing the terminal ileum to the subcutaneous tissue, forming a continent stoma flush with the skin. The pouch is sewn to the anterior abdominal wall around a cecostomy tube. Urine can collect in the pouch until a catheter is inserted and the urine is drained.

The pouch must be drained at regular intervals by a catheter to prevent absorption of metabolic waste products from the urine, reflux of urine to the ureters, and UTI. Postoperative nursing care of the patient with a continent ileal urinary pouch is similar to nursing care of the patient with an ileal conduit. However, these patients usually have additional drainage tubes (cecostomy catheter from the pouch, stoma catheter exiting from the stoma, ureteral stents, Penrose drain, as well as a urethral catheter), as depicted in Figure 45-11. All drainage tubes must be carefully monitored for patency and amount and type of drainage. The cecostomy tube is irrigated two or three times daily to remove mucus from the pouch and prevent blockage.

Other variations of continent urinary reservoirs include the Kock pouch (U-shaped pouch constructed of ileum, with a nipplelike one-way valve; see Fig. $45-10 B$ and $C$ ) and the Charleston pouch (uses the ileum and ascending colon as the pouch, with the appendix and colon junction serving as the one-way valve mechanism). With both of these methods, the pouch must be drained at regular intervals by a catheter.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 45-11 After surgery to create a continent ileal urinary reservoir (Indiana pouch), the patient will have many drains and catheter devices in place.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Ureterosigmoidostomy}

Ureterosigmoidostomy, another form of continent urinary diversion, is an implantation of the ureters into the sigmoid colon (see Fig. 45-10D). It is usually performed in patients who have had extensive pelvic irradiation, previous small bowel resection, or coexisting small bowel disease.

After surgery, voiding occurs from the rectum (for life), and an adjustment in lifestyle will be necessary because of urinary frequency (as often as every 2 hours). Drainage has a consistency equivalent to watery diarrhea, and the patient has some degree of nocturia. Patients usually need to plan activities around the frequent need to urinate, which in turn may affect the patient's social life. Patients have the advantage, however, of urinary control without having to wear an external appliance.

\section*{Nursing Management}

In addition to the usual preoperative regimen, the patient may be placed on a liquid diet for several days preoperatively to reduce residue in the colon. Antibiotic agents (neomycin, kanamycin) are administered to disinfect the bowel. Ureterosigmoidostomy requires a competent anal sphincter, adequate renal function, and active renal peristalsis. The degree of anal sphincter control may be determined by assessing the patient's ability to retain enemas.

The postoperative regimen initially includes placing a catheter in the rectum to drain the urine and prevent reflux of urine into the ureters and kidneys. The tube is taped to the buttocks, and special skin care is given around the anus to prevent excoriation. Irrigations of the rectal tube may be prescribed, but force is never used because of the danger of introducing bacteria into the newly implanted ureters.

\section*{MONITORING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTES}

In ureterosigmoidostomy, larger areas of the bowel mucosa are exposed to urine and electrolyte reabsorption. As a result, electrolyte imbalance and acidosis may occur. Potassium and magnesium in the urine may cause diarrhea. Fluid and electrolyte balance is maintained in the immediate postoperative period by closely monitoring the serum electrolyte levels and administering appropriate intravenous infusions. Acidosis may be prevented by placing the patient on a low-chloride diet supplemented with sodium potassium citrate.

The patient should be instructed never to wait longer than 2 to 3 hours before emptying urine from the intestine. This keeps rectal pressure low and minimizes the absorption of urinary constituents from the colon. It is essential to teach the patient about the symptoms of UTI: fever, flank pain, and frequency.

\section*{RETRAINING THE ANAL SPHINCTER}

After the rectal catheter is removed, the patient learns to control the anal sphincter through special sphincter exercises. At first, urination is frequent. With reassurance and encouragement and the passage of time, the patient gains greater control and learns to differentiate between the need to void and the need to defecate.

\section*{PROMOTING DIETARY MEASURES}

Specific dietary instructions include avoidance of gas-forming foods (flatus can cause stress incontinence and offensive odors). Other ways to avoid gas are to avoid chewing gum, smoking, and any other activity that involves swallowing air. Salt intake may be restricted to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis. Potassium intake is increased through foods and medication because potassium may be lost in acidosis.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Pyelonephritis (upper UTI) due to reflux of bacteria from the colon is fairly common. Long-term antibiotic therapy may be prescribed to prevent infection. A late complication is adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, possibly from cellular changes due to exposure of the colonic mucosa to urine.

Urinary carcinogens promote late malignant transformation of the colon after a ureterosigmoidostomy. Therefore, diligent patient teaching regarding the need for life-long medical followup is essential (Guy et al, 2001; Huang \& McPherson, 2000).

\section*{OTHER URINARY DIVERSION PROCEDURES}

Variations on urinary diversion surgical procedures are devised frequently in an effort to identify and perfect procedures that will improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of postoperative problems. These include cecal, patched cecal, and Mainz reservoirs. These techniques involve isolating a part of the large intestine to form a reservoir for urine and creating an abdominal stoma. Another surgical procedure, the Camey procedure, uses a portion of the ileum as a bladder substitute. In this procedure, the isolated ileum serves as the reservoir for urine; it is anastomosed directly to the portion of the remaining urethra after cystectomy. This procedure permits emptying of the bladder through the urethra. The Camey procedure, however, applies only to men because the entire urethra is removed when a cystectomy is performed in women.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING URINARY DIVERSION SURGERY}

\section*{Preoperative Assessment}

The following are key preoperative nursing assessment concerns:
- Cardiopulmonary function assessments are performed because patients undergoing cystectomy (excision of the urinary bladder) are often older people who may not be able to tolerate a lengthy, complex surgical procedure.
- A nutritional status assessment is important because of possible poor nutritional intake related to underlying health problems.
- Learning needs are assessed to evaluate the patient's and the family's understanding of the procedure and the changes in physical structure and function that result from the surgery. The patient's self-concept and self-esteem are assessed, in addition to methods for coping with stress and loss. The patient's mental status, manual dexterity and coordination, and preferred method of learning are noted because they will affect postoperative self-care.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the preoperative nursing diagnoses for the patient undergoing urinary diversion surgery may include the following:
- Anxiety related to anticipated losses associated with the surgical procedure
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements related to inadequate nutritional intake
- Deficient knowledge about the surgical procedure and postoperative care

\section*{Preoperative Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of anxiety, improved preoperative nutritional status, and increased knowledge about the surgical procedure, expected outcomes, and postoperative care.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING ANXIETY}

The threat of cancer and removal of the bladder create fears related to body image and security. The patient faces problems in adapting to an external appliance, a stoma, a surgical incision, and altered toileting habits. The male patient must also adapt to sexual impotency. (A penile implant is considered if the patient is a candidate for the procedure.) Women also fear altered appearance, body image, and self-esteem. A supportive approach, both physical and psychosocial, is needed and includes assessing the patient's self-concept and manner of coping with stress and loss; helping the patient to identify ways to maintain his or her lifestyle and independence with as few changes as possible; and encouraging the patient to express fears and anxieties about the ramifications of the upcoming surgery. A visitor from the Ostomy Visitation Program of the American Cancer Society can provide emotional support and make adaptation easier both before and after surgery.

\section*{ENSURING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

In addition to cleansing the bowel to minimize fecal stasis, decompress the bowel, and minimize postoperative ileus, a low-residue diet is prescribed and antibiotic medications are administered to reduce pathogenic flora in the bowel and to reduce the risk of infection. Because the patient undergoing a urinary diversion procedure for cancer may be severely malnourished due to the tumor, radiation enteritis, and anorexia, enteral or parenteral nutrition may be prescribed to promote healing. Adequate preoperative hydration is imperative to ensure urine flow during surgery and to prevent hypovolemia during the prolonged surgical procedure.

\section*{EXPLAINING SURGERY AND ITS EFFECTS}

An enterostomal therapist is invaluable in preoperative teaching and in planning postoperative care. Explanations of the surgical procedure, the appearance of the stoma, the rationale for preoperative bowel preparation, the reasons for wearing a collection device, and the anticipated effects of the surgery on sexual functioning are part of patient teaching. The placement of the stoma site is planned preoperatively with the patient standing, sitting, or lying down to locate the stoma away from bony prominences, skin creases, and fat folds. The stoma should also be placed away from old scars, the umbilicus, and the belt line.

For ease of self-care, the patient must be able to see and reach the site comfortably. The site is marked with indelible ink so that it can be located easily during surgery. The patient is assessed for allergies or sensitivity to tape or adhesives. (Patch testing of certain appliances may be necessary before the ostomy equipment is selected. This is particularly important if the patient may be or is allergic to latex.) It may be helpful to have the patient practice wearing an appliance partially filled with water before surgery (Krupski \& Theodorescu, 2001).

\section*{Preoperative Evaluation}

To measure the effectiveness of care, the nurse evaluates the preoperative patient's anxiety level and nutritional status as well as his or her knowledge and expectations of surgery.

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Exhibits reduced anxiety about surgery and expected losses
a. Verbalizes fears with health care team and family
b. Expresses positive attitude about outcome of surgery
2. Exhibits adequate nutritional status
a. Maintains adequate intake before surgery
b. Maintains body weight
c. States rationale for enteral or parenteral nutrition if needed
d. Exhibits normal skin turgor, moist mucous membranes, adequate urine output, and absence of excessive thirst
3. Demonstrates knowledge about the surgical procedure and postoperative course
a. Identifies limitations expected after surgery
b. Discusses expected immediate postoperative environment (tubes, machines, nursing surveillance)
c. Practices deep breathing, coughing, and foot exercises

\section*{Postoperative Assessment}

The role of the nurse in the immediate postoperative period is to prevent complications and to assess the patient carefully for any signs and symptoms of complications. The catheters and any drainage devices are monitored closely. Urine volume, patency of the drainage system, and color of the drainage are assessed. A sudden decrease in urine volume or increase in drainage is reported promptly to the physician because these may indicate obstruction of the urinary tract, inadequate blood volume, or bleeding. In addition, the patient's needs for pain control are assessed (Colwell, Goldberg \& Cramel, 2001).

\section*{Postoperative Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the major postoperative nursing diagnoses for the patient following urinary diversion surgery may include the following:
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to problems in managing the urine collection appliance
- Acute pain related to surgical incision
- Disturbed body image related to urinary diversion
- Potential for sexual dysfunction related to structural and physiologic alterations
- Deficient knowledge about management of urinary function

\section*{Collaborative Problems/ Potential Complications}

Potential complications may include the following:
- Peritonitis due to disruption of anastomosis
- Stomal ischemia and necrosis due to compromised blood supply to stoma
- Stoma retraction and separation of mucocutaneous border due to tension or trauma

\section*{Postoperative Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include maintaining peristomal skin integrity, relieving pain, increasing self-esteem, developing appropriate coping mechanisms to accept and deal with
altered urinary function and sexuality, increasing knowledge about management of urinary function, and preventing potential complications (Krupski \& Theodorescu, 2001; O'Shea, 2001).

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Interventions}

Postoperative management focuses on monitoring urinary function, preventing postoperative complications (infection and sepsis, respiratory complications, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, fistula formation, and urine leakage), and promoting patient comfort. Catheters or drainage systems are observed, and urine output is monitored carefully. A nasogastric tube is inserted during surgery to decompress the GI tract and to relieve pressure on the intestinal anastomosis. It is usually kept in place for several days after surgery. As soon as bowel function resumes, as indicated by bowel sounds, the passage of flatus, and a soft abdomen, oral fluids are permitted. Until that time, intravenous fluids and electrolytes are administered. The patient is assisted to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent complications of immobility.

\section*{MAINTAINING PERISTOMAL SKIN INTEGRITY}

Strategies to promote skin integrity begin with reducing and controlling those factors that increase the patient's risk for poor nutrition and poor healing. As indicated previously, meticulous skin care and management of the drainage system are provided by the nurse until the patient can manage them and is comfortable doing so. Care is taken to keep the drainage system intact to protect the skin from exposure to drainage. Supplies must be readily available to manage the drainage in the immediate postoperative period. Consistency in implementing the skin care program throughout the postoperative period will result in maintenance of skin integrity and patient comfort. Additionally, maintenance of skin integrity around the stoma will enable the patient and family to adjust more easily to the alterations in urinary function and will help them to learn skin care techniques.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Analgesic medications are administered liberally postoperatively to relieve pain and promote comfort, thereby allowing the patient to turn, cough, and do deep-breathing exercises. Patient-controlled analgesia and administration of analgesic agents regularly around the clock are two options that may be used to ensure adequate pain relief. A pain-intensity scale is used to evaluate the adequacy of the medication and the approach to pain management.

\section*{IMPROVING BODY IMAGE}

The patient's ability to cope with the changes associated with the surgery depends to some degree on his or her body image and selfesteem before the surgery and the support and reaction of others. Allowing the patient to express concerns and anxious feelings can help, especially in adjusting to the changes in toileting habits. The nurse can also help improve the patient's self-concept by teaching the skills needed to be independent in managing the urinary drainage devices. Education about ostomy care is conducted in a private setting to encourage the patient to ask questions without fear of embarrassment. Explaining why the nurse must wear gloves when performing ostomy care can prevent the patient from misinterpreting the use of gloves as a sign of aversion to the stoma.

\section*{EXPLORING SEXUALITY ISSUES}

Patients who experience altered sexual function as a result of the surgical procedure may mourn for this loss. Encouraging the pa-
tient and partner to share their feelings about this loss with each other and acknowledging the importance of sexual function and expression may encourage the patient and partner to seek sexual counseling and to explore alternative ways of expressing sexuality. A visit from another "ostomate" who is functioning fully in society and family life may also assist the patient and family in recognizing that full recovery is possible.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Complications are not unusual because of the complexity of the surgery, the underlying reason (cancer, trauma) for the urinary diversion procedure, and the patient's frequently less-than-optimal nutritional status. Complications may include the usual postoperative complications (eg, respiratory problems, such as atelectasis, fluid and electrolyte imbalances) as well as breakdown of the anastomoses, sepsis, fistula formation, fecal or urine leakage, and skin irritation. If these occur, the patient will remain hospitalized for an extended length of time and will probably require parenteral nutrition, GI decompression by means of nasogastric suction, and further surgery. The goals of management are to establish drainage, provide adequate nutrition for healing to occur, and prevent sepsis.

\section*{Peritonitis}

Peritonitis can occur postoperatively if urine leaks at the anastomosis. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain and distention, muscle rigidity with guarding, nausea and vomiting, paralytic ileus (absence of bowel sounds), fever, and leukocytosis.

Urine output must be monitored closely because a sudden decrease in amount with a corresponding increase in drainage from the incision or drains may indicate urine leakage. In addition, the urine drainage device is observed for leakage. The pouch is changed if a leak is observed. Small leaks in the anastomosis may seal themselves, but surgery may be needed for larger leaks.

Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, temperature) are monitored. Changes in vital signs, as well as increasing pain, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal distention, are reported to the physician and may indicate peritonitis.

\section*{Stomal Ischemia and Necrosis}

The stoma is monitored because stomal ischemia and necrosis can result from tension on the mesentery blood vessels, twisting of the bowel segment (conduit) during surgery, or arterial insufficiency. The new stoma must be inspected at least every 4 hours to assess the adequacy of its blood supply. The stoma should be red or pink. If the blood supply to the stoma is compromised, the color changes to purple, brown, or black. These changes are reported immediately to the physician. The physician or enterostomal therapist may insert a small, lubricated tube into the stoma and shine a flashlight into the lumen of the tube to assess for superficial ischemia or necrosis. A necrotic stoma requires surgical intervention. If the ischemia is superficial, the dusky stoma is observed and may slough its outer layer in several days.

\section*{Stomal Retraction and Separation}

Stoma retraction and separation of the mucocutaneous border can occur as a result of trauma or tension on the internal bowel segment used for creation of the stoma. In addition, mucocutaneous separation can occur if the stoma does not heal as a result of accumulation of urine on the stoma and mucocutaneous border. Using a collection drainage pouch with an antireflux valve is helpful because the valve prevents urine from pooling on the
stoma and mucocutaneous border. Meticulous skin care to keep the area around the stoma clean and dry promotes healing. If a separation of the mucocutaneous border occurs, surgery is not usually needed. The separated area is protected by applying karaya powder, stoma adhesive paste, and a properly fitted skin barrier and pouch. By protecting the separation, healing is promoted. If the stoma retracts into the peritoneum, surgical intervention is mandatory.

If surgery is needed to manage these complications, the nurse provides explanations to the patient and family. The need for additional surgery is usually perceived as a setback by the patient and family. Emotional support of the patient and family is provided along with physical preparation of the patient for surgery.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

A major postoperative objective is to assist the patient to achieve the highest level of independence and self-care possible. The primary nurse and enterostomal therapist work closely with the patient and family to instruct and assist them in all phases of managing the ostomy. Adequate supplies and complete instruction are necessary to enable the patient and a family member to develop competence and confidence in their skills. Written and verbal instructions are provided, and the patient is encouraged to contact the nurse or physician with follow-up questions. Followup telephone calls from the nurse to the patient and family after discharge may provide added support and provide another opportunity to answer their questions. Follow-up visits and reinforcement of correct skin care and appliance management techniques also promote skin integrity. Specific techniques for managing the appliance are described in Chart 45-15.

The patient is encouraged to participate in decisions regarding the type of collecting appliance and the time of day to change the appliance. The patient is assisted and encouraged to look at and touch the stoma early to overcome any fears. The patient and family need to know the characteristics of a normal stoma, as follows:
- Pink and moist, like the inside of the mouth
- Insensitive to pain because it has no nerve endings
- Vascular and may bleed when cleaned

Additionally, if a segment of the GI tract was used to create the urinary diversion, mucus may be visible in the urine. By learning what is normal, the patient and family become familiar with what signs and symptoms they should report to the physician or nurse and what problems they can handle themselves.

Information provided to the patient and the extent of involvement in self-care are determined by the patient's physical recovery and ability to accept and acquire the knowledge and skill needed for independence. Verbal and written instructions are provided, and the patient is given the opportunity to practice and demonstrate the knowledge and skills needed to manage urinary drainage.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Follow-up care is essential to determine how the patient has adapted to the body image changes and lifestyle adjustments. Visits from a home care nurse are important to assess the patient's adaptation to the home setting and management of the ostomy. Teaching and reinforcement may assist the patient and family to cope with altered urinary function. It is also necessary to assess for long-term complications that may occur, such as pouch leakage
or rupture, stone formation, stomal stenosis, deterioration in renal function, or incontinence (Baker, 2001).

The following procedures are recommended for patients with a continent urinary diversion: pouch-o-gram (x-rays taken after a radioactive agent is instilled into the pouch) between 3 and 6 months, 9 and 12 months, 24 months, then every other year; renal function tests (BUN, serum creatinine) 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, then twice yearly; and pouchoscopy (endoscopic examination of the pouch) every year starting 5 to 7 years after surgery (Colwell, Goldberg \& Cramel, 2001). The patient who has had surgery for carcinoma should have a yearly physical examination and chest x-ray to assess for metastases. In addition, the patient and family are reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and recommended health screening.

Long-term monitoring for anemia is performed to identify vitamin B deficiency, which may occur when a significant portion of the terminal ileum is removed. This may take several years to develop and can be treated with vitamin B injections. The patient and family are informed of the United Ostomy Association and any local ostomy support groups to provide ongoing support, assistance, and education.

\section*{Other UrinaryTract Disorders}

\section*{NEPHROSCLEROSIS}

Nephrosclerosis is hardening, or sclerosis, of the arteries of the kidney due to prolonged hypertension. This causes decreased blood flow to the kidney and patchy necrosis of the renal parenchyma. Eventually, fibrosis occurs and glomeruli are destroyed. Nephrosclerosis is a major cause of ESRD (Segura, Campo, Rodicio \& Ruilope, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

There are two forms of nephrosclerosis: malignant (accelerated) and benign. Malignant nephrosclerosis is often associated with malignant hypertension (diastolic blood pressure higher than 130 mm Hg ). It usually occurs in young adults, and men are affected twice as often as women. The disease process progresses rapidly. Without dialysis, more than half of patients die from uremia in a few years. Benign nephrosclerosis is usually found in older adults and is often associated with atherosclerosis and hypertension.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Symptoms are rare early in the disease, even though the urine usually contains protein and occasional casts. Renal insufficiency and associated signs and symptoms occur late in the disease.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of nephrosclerosis is aggressive antihypertensive therapy. In hypertensive nephrosclerosis, therapy containing an ACE inhibitor, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications, significantly reduces the incidence of renal events. This effect is independent of blood pressure control (Segura et al., 2001).

\section*{HYDRONEPHROSIS}

Hydronephrosis is dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces of one or both kidneys due to an obstruction.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Obstruction to the normal flow of urine causes the urine to back up, resulting in increased pressure in the kidney. If the obstruction is in the urethra or the bladder, the back pressure affects both kidneys, but if the obstruction is in one of the ureters because of a stone or kink, only one kidney is damaged.

Partial or intermittent obstruction may be caused by a renal stone that has formed in the renal pelvis but has moved into the ureter and blocked it. The obstruction may be due to a tumor pressing on the ureter or to bands of scar tissue resulting from an abscess or inflammation near the ureter that pinches it. The disorder may be due to an odd angle of the ureter as it leaves the renal pelvis or to an unusual position of the kidney, favoring a ureteral twist or kink. In elderly men, the most common cause is
urethral obstruction at the bladder outlet by an enlarged prostate gland. Hydronephrosis can also occur in pregnancy because of the enlarged uterus. High pressure in the bladder during the filling phase, generally $15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or higher, has been found to result in hydronephrosis, due to the high pressure radiating to one or both kidneys via the ureter (Ghobish, 2001).

Whatever the cause, as the urine accumulates in the renal pelvis, it distends the pelvis and its calyces. In time, atrophy of the kidney results. As one kidney undergoes gradual destruction, the other kidney gradually enlarges (compensatory hypertrophy). Ultimately, renal function is impaired.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The patient may not have symptoms if the onset is gradual. Acute obstruction may produce aching in the flank and back. If infection is present, dysuria, chills, fever, tenderness, and pyuria may occur. Hematuria and pyuria may be present. If both kidneys are affected, signs and symptoms of chronic renal failure may develop.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of management are to identify and correct the cause of the obstruction, to treat infection, and to restore and conserve renal function. To relieve the obstruction, the urine may have to be diverted by nephrostomy (see Chap. 44) or another type of diversion. The infection is treated with antibiotic agents because residual urine in the calyces leads to infection and pyelonephritis. The patient is prepared for surgical removal of obstructive lesions (calculus, tumor, obstruction of the ureter). If one kidney is severely damaged and its function is destroyed, nephrectomy (removal of the kidney) may be performed.

\section*{URETHRITIS}

Urethritis (inflammation of the urethra) is usually an ascending infection and may be classified as gonococcal or nongonococcal. Both conditions may be present in the same patient. Gonococcal urethritis and nongonococcal urethritis are the most common STDs in men in developed countries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001).

Gonococcal urethritis is caused by N. gonorrhoeae and is transmitted by sexual contact. In men, inflammation of the urethral meatus or orifice occurs, with burning on urination. A purulent urethral discharge appears 3 to 14 days (or longer) after sexual exposure, although the disease is asymptomatic in up to $10 \%$ of men. The infection involves the tissues around the urethra, causing periurethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, and urethral stricture. Sterility may occur as a result of vasoepididymal obstruction. Gonorrhea in women is frequently not diagnosed and reported because a urethral discharge is not always present and the disease may be asymptomatic. Treatment of gonorrhea is discussed and patient education information is provided in Chapter 70.

Nongonococcal urethritis is usually caused by C. trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum. Male patients with symptoms usually complain of mild to severe dysuria and scant to moderate urethral discharge. Nongonococcal urethritis requires prompt treatment with tetracycline or doxycycline. In patients who do not respond to or who are allergic to the tetracyclines, erythromycin may be substituted. Follow-up care is necessary to make certain that a cure is achieved. All sexual partners of patients with
nongonococcal urethritis should be examined for STDs and treated.

\section*{RENAL ABSCESS}

Renal abscesses may be localized to the renal cortex (renal carbuncle) or extend into the fatty tissue around the kidney (perinephric abscess). The incidence of renal abscesses ranges from 1 to 10 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A renal abscess may be caused by an infection of the kidney (pyelonephritis) or may occur as a hematogenous (spread through the bloodstream) infection originating elsewhere in the body. Offending organisms include Staphylococcus and Proteus species and E. coli. Occasionally, infection spreads from adjacent areas, such as with diverticulitis or appendicitis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The manifestations of a perinephritic abscess often are acute in onset, with chills, fever, leukocytosis, a dull ache or palpable mass in the flank, abdominal pain with guarding, and CVA tenderness on palpation. The patient usually appears seriously ill.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient with a renal abscess may report a recent history of a cutaneous boil or carbuncle and may complain of malaise, fever, chills, anorexia, weight loss, and a dull pain over the kidney. Leukocytosis and sterile urine (no microorganisms seen because the infection does not extend into the urinary collection system) are present with renal abscesses localized to the renal cortex. The CT examination results are important both in the diagnostic phase to establish the extent of the lesions and in the follow-up phase to assess the effectiveness of treatment (Dalla Palma, PozziMucelli \& Ene, 1999).

\section*{Management}

Small localized abscesses are usually cured by intravenous antibiotic medications alone but may require incision and drainage. Perinephritic abscesses require percutaneous drainage of the abscess. Culture and sensitivity tests are performed, and appropriate antibiotic therapy is prescribed. Drains are usually inserted and left in the perinephric space until all significant drainage has ceased. Because the drainage is often profuse, frequent changes of the outer dressings may be necessary. As in treating an abscess in any site, the patient is monitored for sepsis, fluid intake and output, and general response to treatment. Surgery may be indicated for extensive perinephritic abscesses.

\section*{TUBERCULOSIS OF THE URINARY TRACT}

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Tuberculosis of the urinary tract is caused by the organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is relatively rare in developed countries. The organism usually travels from the lungs by means of the bloodstream to the kidneys. On arrival in the kidney, the microorganism may lie dormant for years. After the organism reaches the kidney, a low-grade inflammation and the characteristic tubercles are seen.

If the organism continues to multiply, the tubercles enlarge to form cavities, with eventual destruction of parenchymal tissue. The organism spreads down the urinary tract into the bladder and may also infect the prostate, epididymis, and testicles in men.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

At first, the signs and symptoms of renal tuberculosis are mild; there is usually a slight afternoon fever, weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite, and general malaise. Hematuria (microscopic or gross) and pyuria may be present. Pain, dysuria, and urinary frequency, when they occur, are due to bladder involvement. Cavity formations and calcifications may be noted on an intravenous urogram.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A search for tuberculosis elsewhere in the body is conducted when tuberculosis of the kidney or urinary tract is found. The patient is asked about possible exposure to tuberculosis. Three or more clean-catch, first-morning urine specimens are obtained for culture for M. tuberculosis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually elevated and is helpful in monitoring response to treatment.

Other diagnostic studies include intravenous urography, biopsy, and urine culture for acid-fast bacilli. Recent studies have shown that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a much faster diagnosis of urinary M. tuberculosis. It is a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic method and avoids a delay in starting treatment (Hemal, Gupta, Rajeev et al., 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of treatment is to eradicate the offending organism. Combinations of ethambutol, isoniazid, and rifampin are used to delay the emergence of resistant organisms. Shorter-course chemotherapy (4 months) has been effective in eradicating the organism and in penetrating renal tissue. Surgical intervention may be necessary to treat obstruction and to remove an extensively diseased kidney. Because renal tuberculosis is a manifestation of a systemic disease, all measures to promote the general health of the patient are taken, including proper nutrition, adequate rest, and good hygiene practices. A scrotal support may be used by male patients with genital swelling.

\section*{Nursing Management}

For the most part, nursing interventions focus on patient education to promote effective self-care at home and to prevent active recurrence or transmission of disease.

Instructions are provided about taking prescribed medications properly, recognizing adverse effects, and understanding the importance of completing the course of therapy. Instructions are also given regarding the nature of tuberculosis; its cause, spread, and treatment; and necessary follow-up care. Men are instructed to use condoms during sexual intercourse to prevent spread of the organisms; those with penile or urethral tuberculosis are instructed to abstain from intercourse during treatment. The patient is encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle with a well-balanced diet, adequate intake of fluids, and exercise.

Follow-up care is essential to reinforce the importance of taking medications exactly as prescribed (many patients do not take
them correctly). The patient is counseled about the need for follow-up examinations (urine cultures, intravenous urograms), usually for 1 year. Treatment is reinstituted if a relapse occurs and the tubercle bacilli again invade the genitourinary tract. Because ureteral stenosis or bladder contractures may develop during healing, the patient is monitored for these complications.

\section*{URETHRAL STRICTURES}

A urethral stricture is a narrowing of the lumen of the urethra as a result of scar tissue and contraction.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Common causes of strictures are urethral injury (caused by insertion of surgical instruments during transurethral surgery, indwelling catheters, or cystoscopic procedures), straddle injuries, and injuries associated with automobile crashes, untreated gonorrheal urethritis, and congenital abnormalities.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient reports that the force and volume of the urinary stream are diminished, and symptoms of urinary infection and retention occur. Stricture causes urine to back up, resulting in cystitis, prostatitis, and pyelonephritis.

\section*{Prevention}

An important element of prevention is to treat all urethral infections promptly. Prolonged urethral catheter drainage should be avoided and the utmost care taken in any type of instrumentation involving the urethra, including catheterization.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment may include gradual dilation of the narrowed area (with metal sounds or bougies) or surgery (internal urethrotomy). If the stricture prevents the passage of a catheter, the urologist uses several small filiform bougies in search of the opening. When one bougie passes beyond the stricture into the bladder, it is fixed in place, and urine drains from the bladder. The opening then can be dilated, bypassing a larger sound (a dilating instrument), with the filiform then acting as a guide. After dilation, hot sitz baths and nonopioid analgesic agents are administered to control pain. Antibiotic medications are prescribed for several days after dilation to prevent infection.

Surgical excision or urethroplasty may be necessary for severe cases. A suprapubic cystostomy may be necessary in some patients. The postoperative management for cystostomy is described earlier in this chapter. Research studies using the diode laser to treat urethral strictures suggest that it is safe and reliable, especially as the first line of treatment (Kamal, 2001).

\section*{RENAL CYSTS}

Renal cysts are abnormal, fluid-filled sacs that arise from the kidney tissue. They may be genetic in origin, acquired, or associated with a host of unrelated conditions. Cysts of the kidney may be single or multiple (polycystic), involving one or both kidneys. Polycystic disease of the adult is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and affects men and women equally.

\section*{Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease}

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited condition, occurring in between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000 of the population. After diagnosis, patients are usually treated by nephrologists because of the risk of progression to ESRD. Almost two thirds (64\%) of people with adult polycystic kidney disease also develop hematuria. Most episodes are due to UTIs and rupture of renal cysts that relate to the underlying anatomic abnormalities. The symptoms are usually short-lived and resolve with conservative measures such as rest and antibiotic treatment. Renal stone disease is also common, occurring in $20 \%$ of patients. Frank hematuria is also a presenting symptom of common, but unrelated, disorders that may occur coincidentally. These patients must be evaluated to rule out a genitourinary cancer because hematuria is also a presenting symptom of urinary tract cancer. Simple noninvasive diagnostic studies such as transabdominal ultrasound and urine cytology may demonstrate additional pathology that needs treatment to reduce further morbidity (Dedi, Bhandari, Turney et al., 2001).

Polycystic renal disease is also associated with cystic diseases of other organs (liver, pancreas, spleen) and aneurysms of the cerebral arteries. It has long been recognized that patients on longterm dialysis (both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) develop multiple cysts on their nonfunctioning kidneys. Many of these cysts contain cancer cells.

\section*{Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease}

An acquired form of polycystic disease occurring as a result of ESRD associated with dialysis is called acquired cystic kidney disease. While most of the cysts remain benign, serious complications can develop. Acquired cystic kidney disease has been associated with cyst infection, cyst hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and spontaneous rupture of the kidney; therefore, it is important for the nurse to be aware of this variation of cystic kidney disease (Dedi, Bhandari, Turney et al., 2001; Headley \& Wall, 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The kidney gradually enlarges, with signs and symptoms becoming apparent in the fourth or fifth decade of life. The patient reports abdominal or lumbar pain. Hematuria, hypertension, palpable renal masses, and recurrent UTIs are additional manifestations. Renal insufficiency and failure usually develop in the end stages. Diagnosis of renal cysts is confirmed either by intravenous urography or CT scan.

\section*{Management}

Because there is no specific treatment for polycystic renal disease, patient care focuses on relief of pain, symptoms, and complications. Hypertension and UTIs are treated aggressively. Dialysis (see Chap. 44) is initiated when signs and symptoms of renal insufficiency and failure occur. Genetic counseling is part of management with polycystic kidney disease that is genetic in origin. The patient is advised to avoid sports and occupations that present a risk for trauma to the kidney. Simple cysts of the kidney usually occur unilaterally and differ clinically and pathophysiologically from polycystic kidney disease. In such cases, the cyst may be drained percutaneously.

\section*{CONGENITAL ANOMALIES}

Congenital anomalies of the kidney are not uncommon. Occasionally, there is fusion of the two kidneys, forming what is called a horseshoe kidney. One kidney may be small and deformed and is often nonfunctioning. The patient may have a double ureter or congenital stricture of the ureter. Treating these anomalies is necessary only if they cause symptoms, but it is essential to determine that the other kidney is present and functioning before surgery is undertaken.

\section*{INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS}

Interstitial cystitis, a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder wall, frequently remains undiagnosed. The cause is unknown and no treatment is effective for all patients, although several treatments are available and most patients obtain some relief. More than 700,000 Americans have interstitial cystitis. It can occur at any age and in all ethnic groups and both genders, although $90 \%$ of those affected are women. The average age at onset is 40 , although one in four people affected is under age 30 at onset of symptoms. Preliminary results of studies of men with nonbacterial prostatitis indicate that many of them may also have interstitial cystitis (Interstitial Cystitis Association, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Although no single theory can explain the disorder, several pathophysiologic mechanisms may cause it, including changes in epithelial permeability, pelvic floor dysfunction, mastocytosis, activation of C-fibers, increase of nerve growth factors, and bradykinin. A decrease in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer on the urothelium is thought to be a possible cause (DoggweilerWiygul, Blankenship \& MacDiarmid, 2001).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Interstitial cystitis is characterized by severe, irritable voiding symptoms (day and night frequency, nocturia, urgency), pain and discomfort (suprapubic pressure, pain with bladder filling, suprapubic or perineal pain and pressure), and a markedly diminished bladder capacity. Some patients void more than 60 times a day. Sexual intercourse is often painful (Doggweiler-Wiygul et al., 2001).

Patients commonly present with multiple health problems that may be difficult to diagnose and may be associated with changes in the immune system. Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular disorder share many clinical illness features such as myalgia, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and impaired ability to perform activities of daily living as a consequence of these symptoms. Research findings suggest that various other chronic illnesses and pain syndromes may be associated with interstitial cystitis, including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic tension-type headache (Aaron, Burke \& Buchwald, 2000).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis is made by excluding other causes of the symptoms. Diagnosis is complicated because there are no definitive diagnostic criteria. As a result, several years may pass and patients see an average of four or five physicians before the definitive diagnosis is made. The lack of more specific diagnostic criteria does
not mean that interstitial cystitis is psychologically based; rather, it is a physical disorder with psychological consequences. Many patients have difficulty coping with the lack of a diagnosis, the inability of health care professionals to provide an explanation for their symptoms, and the persistence of symptoms.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment strategies include use of medications that target pain and discomfort. Other therapies are used with the goal of repairing the bladder wall or their anti-inflammatory effects.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

In 1996, the FDA approved the use of a bladder protectant, pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron), which is given orally. Since its introduction, Elmiron has been the most effective agent; it is the only oral agent in its class. Intrabladder instillation of various compounds (eg, silver nitrate, dimethyl sulfoxide, oxychlorosene [Clorpactin]) may provide relief. About $50 \%$ of patients respond favorably to intravesicular instillation of dimethyl sulfoxide. Antispasmodic agents, such as oxybutynin (Ditropan), and urinary mucosal anesthetic agents, such as phenazopyridine (Pyridium), may be useful. Intravesicular heparin has some effect in decreasing symptoms in half of patients. Patients must be able to selfcatheterize to instill the heparin on a daily basis initially, then three or four times weekly. Tricyclic antidepressant medications (doxepin and amitriptyline), which have central and peripheral anticholinergic actions, may decrease the excitability of smooth muscle in the bladder and reduce pain and discomfort.

\section*{OTHER THERAPY}

Other treatments include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and destruction of ulcers with laser photoirradiation. Percutaneous sacral nerve stimulation is a means of neuromodulation to decrease the pelvic area pain and irritable bladder symptoms. Some women with intractable interstitial cystitis respond favorably to percutaneous sacral stimulation, with a significant improvement in pelvic pain, daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency, and average voided volume. Permanent sacral implantation can be an effective treatment modality in refractory interstitial cystitis; further long-term evaluation is required, although initial results are promising (Interstitial Cystitis Association, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Often, the patient has experienced symptoms for a prolonged time. These symptoms prevent the patient from carrying out normal activities of daily living. The patient has usually been treated by a number of health care providers, often with little relief of symptoms. As a consequence, the patient may feel depressed, anxious, distrustful, and skeptical about proposed treatments.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. As the head nurse in a nursing home, you are approached by the daughter of one of the patients. She requests that her mother, who can ambulate with assistance, have an indwelling urinary catheter inserted "for convenience sake." Based on your knowledge regarding the effects of long-term indwelling catheter use, what would be your response?
2. Your patient is a 50-year-old woman who has been on hemodialysis for 7 years. On her baseline renal ultrasound, three small cysts were noted. She was recently started on anticoagulation therapy to maintain the patency of her venous access. This morning she presents for dialysis with severe flank pain. Identify possible causes of her pain and laboratory tests that would be indicated. What nursing assessment and interventions should you take at this time? What explanations would you give the patient while awaiting the results of laboratory tests?
3. Your 60 -year-old patient has undergone a cystectomy and continent urinary diversion surgery. Your responsibility is to assist the patient in learning to manage the urinary diversion. Describe the postoperative patient teaching that you will provide to the patient and family. How will you modify the postoperative teaching if the patient and family have limited understanding of English? If the patient is blind?
4. A 35-year-old woman presents to the urinary clinic with complaints of frequent daytime urination with nearly constant voiding urgency without any incontinence, postcoital suprapubic discomfort, and nocturia (averaging three times a night). A urinalysis is negative for bacteria but reveals microscopic hematuria. A urodynamic study and office cystoscopy are scheduled to assess for interstitial cystitis. Outline the patient teaching you will provide to her about the diagnostic workup and about management of interstitial cystitis.

In such situations, the nurse assesses the patient's ability to cope with the disorder and provides psychological support. The nurse must convey a sense of acceptance to the patient and acknowledge the severity of the symptoms and their effect on the patient's lifestyle. The nurse also teaches the patient about diagnostic tests and treatment regimens (Degler, 2000).

\section*{Assessment and Management of Female Physiologic Processes}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe female reproductive function.
2. Describe approaches to effective sexual assessment.
3. Describe indicators of domestic violence and abuse of women and methods of identifying and treating women who are survivors of abuse.
4. Identify the diagnostic examinations and tests used to determine alteration in female reproductive function and describe the nurse's role before, during, and after these examinations and procedures.
5. Identify factors that cause disturbances of menstruation and related nursing implications.
6. Describe nursing care for patients with premenstrual syndrome.
7. Develop a teaching plan for women experiencing menopause.
8. Describe methods of contraception and implications for health care and education.
9. Describe the nursing management of the patient having an abortion.
10. Describe the causes and management of infertility.
11. Use the nursing process to plan for the care of patients with ectopic pregnancies.

Woomen's health is a unique specialty of health care. In addition to understanding normal female anatomy and physiology, the nurse needs to understand the physical, developmental, psychological, and social-cultural influences on women's health and use of health care. Health assessment, maintenance, and promotion across the life span must address growth and development, sexuality, contraception, preconception care, conception, prenatal care, effects of pregnancy on health, aging, perimenopause, menopause, and disorders that affect women. Further, the effects of disability on women's access to health care and the effect of disabilities and chronic illness on their health status must also be considered. Because women use the health care system more often than men and make up the majority of health care workers, addressing women's health needs and concerns will improve quality and access for all people.

\section*{Role of Nurses in Women's Health}

As their presence in the labor market has increased, women have faced major changes in their roles, lifestyles, and family patterns. Moreover, they have encountered environmental hazards and stress, prompting them to focus greater attention on health and health-promoting practices. As a result, some women are taking a greater interest in and responsibility for their own health care. Many others do not have the time, finances, or other resources to do so.

Other changes over the years have included delaying pregnancy and childbearing until well after a career is established. Various methods of contraception have made this option possible. Advances in the treatment of infertility have enabled many women previously unable to have children to become pregnant
and have extended the period of possible childbearing for couples well beyond their 40 s. As women exercise greater control over their health care options, nurses are becoming more knowledgeable about preventive care for women, particularly with regard to their unique needs. The nurse encourages women to determine their own health goals and behaviors, teaches about health and illness, offers interventional strategies, and provides support, counseling, and ongoing monitoring. Areas of special interest in health promotion include the following:
- Personal hygiene
- Strategies for detecting and preventing disease, especially sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
- Issues related to sexuality and sexual function, such as contraception; preconceptional, prenatal, and postnatal care; sexual satisfaction; and menopause
- Diet, exercise, and other health-promoting practices that maintain and enhance health
- Avoidance of stressful and abusive situations that are detrimental to health and well-being
- Maintaining a normal weight for height and avoiding substance abuse and smoking
- Avoidance of unhealthy lifestyle and risk behaviors

Nurses who promote healthy ways of living also need to model that lifestyle for their patients.

An important role of the nurse is promoting positive practices and behaviors related to the reproductive and sexual health of each patient, including the following:
- Providing information about scheduling regular examinations to promote health, detect health problems at an early
adnexa: the fallopian tubes and ovaries amenorrhea: absence of menstrual flow androgens: hormones produced by the ovaries and adrenals that affect many aspects of female health, including follicle development, libido, oiliness of hair and skin, and hair growth
cervix: bottom (inferior) part of the uterus that is located in the vagina
chandelier sign: pain on gentle movement of the cervix; associated with pelvic infection corpus luteum: site of a follicle that changes after ovulation to produce progesterone
cystocele: weakness of the anterior vaginal wall that allows the bladder to protrude into the vagina
dysmenorrhea: painful menstruation
dyspareunia: difficult or painful sexual intercourse
endometriosis: condition in which endometrial tissue implants in other areas of the pelvis; may produce dysmenorrhea or infertility
endometrium: mucous membrane lining the uterus
estrogen: hormone that develops and maintains the female reproductive system
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): hormone released by the pituitary gland
to stimulate estrogen production and ovulation
fornix: upper part of the vagina
fundus: body of the uterus
graafian follicle: cystic structure that develops on the ovary as ovulation begins
hymen: tissue that covers the vaginal opening partially or completely before vaginal penetration
hysteroscopy: a procedure performed using a long telescope-like instrument inserted through the cervix to diagnose uterine problems
introitus: opening to the vagina on the perineum
luteal phase: stage in the menstrual cycle in which the endometrium becomes thicker and more vascular
luteinizing hormone (LH): hormone released by the pituitary gland that stimulates progesterone production
menarche: beginning of menstrual function
menopause: permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from the loss of ovarian follicular activity
menstruation: sloughing and discharge of the lining of the uterus if conception does not take place
osteoporosis: a disorder in which bones lose density and become porous and fragile
ovaries: almond-shaped reproductive organs that produce eggs at ovulation and play a major role in hormone production
ovulation: discharge of a mature ovum from the ovary
perimenopause: the period immediately prior to menopause and the first year after menopause
polyp (cervical or endometrial): growth of tissue on the cervix or endometrial lining; usually benign
progesterone: hormone produced by the corpus luteum
proliferative phase: stage in the menstrual cycle before ovulation when the endometrium proliferates
rectocele: weakness of the posterior vaginal wall that allows the rectal cavity to protrude into the submucosa of the vagina
secretory phase: stage of the menstrual cycle in which the endometrium becomes thickened, more vascular, and edematous
uterine prolapse: relaxation of pelvic tone that allows the cervix and uterus to descend into the lower vagina
stage, assess problems related to gynecologic and reproductive function, and discuss questions or concerns related to sexual function and sexuality
- Providing an open, nonjudgmental environment; this is crucial if the patient is to feel comfortable discussing personal issues. The nurse must convey understanding and sensitivity when discussing these issues and must assess their effects on the patient and the patient's partner.
- Recognizing signs and symptoms of abuse and screening all patients in a private and safe environment
- Recognizing cultural differences and beliefs and respecting sexual orientation and concerns related to both

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM}

The female reproductive system consists of external and internal structures. Other anatomic structures that affect the female reproductive system include the hypothalamus and pituitary gland of the endocrine system.

\section*{External Genitalia}

The external genitalia (the vulva) include two thick folds of tissue called the labia majora and two smaller lips of delicate tissue called the labia minora, which lie within the labia majora. The upper portions of the labia minora unite, forming a partial covering for the clitoris, a highly sensitive organ composed of erectile tissue. Between the labia minora, below and posterior to the clitoris, is the urinary meatus. This is the external opening of the female urethra and is about 3 cm (1.5 inches) long. Below this orifice is a larger opening, the vaginal orifice or introitus (Fig. 46-1). On each side of the vaginal orifice is a vestibular (Bartholin's) gland, a bean-sized

structure that empties its mucous secretion through a small duct. The opening of the duct lies within the labia minora, external to the hymen. The area between the vagina and rectum is called the perineum.

\section*{Internal Reproductive Structures}

The internal structures consist of the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian or uterine tubes (Fig. 46-2).

\section*{VAGINA}

The vagina, a canal lined with mucous membrane, is 7.5 to 10 cm ( 3 to 4 inches) long and extends upward and backward from the vulva to the cervix. Anterior to it are the bladder and the urethra, and posterior to it lies the rectum. The anterior and posterior walls of the vagina normally touch each other. The upper part of the vagina, the fornix, surrounds the cervix (the inferior part of the uterus).

\section*{UTERUS}

The uterus, a pear-shaped muscular organ, is about 7.5 cm ( 3 inches) long and 5 cm ( 2 inches) wide at its upper part. Its walls are about 1.25 cm ( 0.5 inch) thick. The size of the uterus varies, depending on parity (number of viable births) and uterine abnormalities (eg, fibroids, which are a type of tumor that may distort the uterus). A nulliparous woman (one who has not completed a pregnancy to the stage of fetal viability) usually has a smaller uterus than a multiparous woman (one who has completed two or more pregnancies to the stage of fetal viability). The uterus lies posterior to the bladder and is held in position by several ligaments. The round ligaments extend anteriorly and laterally to the internal inguinal ring and down the inguinal canal, where they blend with the tissues of the labia majora. The broad ligaments are folds of peritoneum extending from the lateral pelvic walls and enveloping the fallopian tubes. The uterosacral ligaments extend posteriorly to the sacrum. The uterus has two parts: the cervix, which projects into the vagina, and a larger upper part, the fundus or body, which is covered posteriorly and partly anteriorly by peritoneum. The triangular inner portion of the fundus narrows to a small canal in the cervix that has constrictions at each end, referred to as the external os and internal os. The upper lateral parts of the uterus are called the cornua. From here, the oviducts or fallopian (or uterine) tubes extend outward, and their lumina are internally continuous with the uterine cavity.

\section*{OVARIES}

The ovaries lie behind the broad ligaments, behind and below the fallopian tubes. They are oval bodies about 3 cm ( 1.2 inches) long. At birth, they contain thousands of tiny egg cells, or ova. The ovaries and the fallopian tubes together are referred to as the adnexa.

\section*{FUNCTION OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM}

\section*{Ovulation}

At puberty (usually between ages 12 and 14, but earlier for some; 10 or 11 years of age is not uncommon), the ova begin to mature. During a period known as the follicular phase, an ovum enlarges as a type of cyst called a graafian follicle until it reaches the sur-

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
face of the ovary, where transport occurs. The ovum (or oocyte) is discharged into the peritoneal cavity. This periodic discharge of matured ovum is referred to as ovulation. The ovum usually finds its way into the fallopian tube, where it is carried to the uterus. If it meets a spermatozoon, the male reproductive cell, a union occurs and conception takes place. After the discharge of the ovum, the cells of the graafian follicle undergo a rapid change. Gradually, they become yellow (corpus luteum) and produce progesterone, a hormone that prepares the uterus for receiving the fertilized ovum. Ovulation usually occurs 2 weeks prior to the next menstrual period.

\section*{The Menstrual Cycle}

The menstrual cycle is a complex process involving the reproductive and endocrine systems. The ovaries produce steroid hormones, predominantly estrogens and progesterone. Several different estrogens are produced by the ovarian follicle, which consists of the developing ovum and its surrounding cells. The most potent of the ovarian estrogens is estradiol. Estrogens are responsible for developing and maintaining the female reproductive organs and the secondary sex characteristics associated with the adult female. Estrogens play an important role in breast development and in monthly cyclic changes in the uterus.

Progesterone is also important in regulating the changes that occur in the uterus during the menstrual cycle. It is secreted by the corpus luteum, which is the ovarian follicle after the ovum has been released. Progesterone is the most important hormone for conditioning the endometrium (the mucous membrane lining the uterus) in preparation for implantation of a fertilized ovum. If pregnancy occurs, the progesterone secretion becomes largely a function of the placenta and is essential for maintaining a normal pregnancy. In addition, progesterone, working with estrogen, prepares the breast for producing and secreting milk. Androgens are also produced by the ovaries, but only in small amounts. These
hormones are involved in the early development of the follicle and also affect the female libido.

Two gonadotropic hormones are released by the pituitary gland: FSH and LH. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is primarily responsible for stimulating the ovaries to secrete estrogen. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is primarily responsible for stimulating progesterone production. Feedback mechanisms, in part, regulate FSH and LH secretion. For example, elevated estrogen levels in the blood inhibit FSH secretion but promote LH secretion, whereas elevated progesterone levels inhibit LH secretion. In addition, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus affects the rate of FSH and LH release.

The secretion of ovarian hormones follows a cyclic pattern that results in changes in the uterine endometrium and in menstruation (Fig. 46-3; Table 46-1). This cycle is typically 28 days in length, but there are many normal variations ( 21 to 42 days). In the proliferative phase at the beginning of the cycle (just after menstruation), FSH output increases, stimulating estrogen secretion. This causes the endometrium to thicken and become more vascular. In the secretory phase near the middle portion of the cycle (day 14 in a 28 -day cycle), LH output increases, stimulating ovulation. Under the combined stimulus of estrogen and progesterone, the endometrium reaches the peak of its thickening and vascularization. The luteal phase begins after ovulation and is characterized by the secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum.

If the ovum is fertilized, estrogen and progesterone levels remain high and the complex hormonal changes of pregnancy follow. If the ovum has not been fertilized, FSH and LH output diminishes, estrogen and progesterone secretion falls, the ovum disintegrates, and the endometrium, which has become thick and congested, becomes hemorrhagic. The product consisting of old blood, mucus, and endometrial tissue is discharged through the cervix and into the vagina. After the menstrual flow stops, the cycle begins again; the endometrium proliferates and thickens from estrogenic stimulation, and ovulation recurs.

\caption{FIGURE 46-3 One menstrual cycle and the corresponding changes in the endometrium.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Menopausal Period}

The menopausal period marks the end of a woman's reproductive capacity. It usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 52 years but may occur as early as age 42 or as late as age 55 ; the median age is 51 . Menopause is not a pathologic phenomenon but a normal
part of aging and maturation. Menstruation ceases, and because the ovaries are no longer active, the reproductive organs become smaller. No more ova mature; therefore, no ovarian hormones are produced. (An artificial menopause may occur earlier if the ovaries are surgically removed or are destroyed by radiation or chemotherapy.) Besides changes in the reproductive system that reduce estrogen levels, multifaceted changes occur throughout the woman's body. These changes include neuroendocrinologic, biochemical, and metabolic alterations related to normal maturation or aging (Table 46-2).

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse who is obtaining information from the patient for the health history and performing physical assessment is in an ideal position to discuss the woman's general health issues, health promotion, and health-related concerns. Topics that are relevant would include fitness, nutrition, cardiovascular risks, health screening, sexuality, abuse, health risk behaviors, and immunizations. Recommendations for health screening are summarized in Chart 46-1.

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

In addition to obtaining a general health history, the nurse asks about past illnesses and experiences that are specific to women's health. Data should be collected about the following:
- Menstrual history (including menarche, length of cycles, length and amount of flow, presence of cramps or pain, bleeding between periods or after intercourse, bleeding after menopause)
- History of pregnancies (number of pregnancies, outcomes of pregnancies)
- History of exposure to medications (diethylstilbestrol [DES], immunosuppressive agents, others)
- Pain with menses (dysmenorrhea), pain with intercourse (dyspareunia), pelvic pain
- History of vaginal discharge and odor or itching
- History of problems with urinary function (ie, frequency or urgency); may be related to STDs or pregnancy
- History of problems with bowel or bladder control
- Sexual history
- History of sexual abuse or physical abuse
- History of surgery or other procedures on reproductive tract structures (including female genital mutilation or female circumcision)
- History of chronic illness or disability that may affect health status, reproductive health, need for health screening, or access to health care
- History of genetic disorder

In collecting data related to reproductive health, the nurse is in a unique position to teach patients about normal physiologic processes, such as menstruation and menopause, and to assess possible abnormalities. Many problems experienced by young or middle-aged women can be corrected easily. If allowed to go untreated, however, they may result in anxiety and health problems. Issues related to sexuality and sexual function are typically brought more often to the attention of the gynecologic or women's health care provider than other health care providers; any nurse, however, should consider these issues to be part of routine health assessment.

\section*{Sexual History}

A sexual assessment includes both subjective and objective data. Health and sexual histories, physical examination findings, and laboratory results are all part of the database. The purpose of a sexual history is to obtain information that provides a picture of the woman's sexuality and sexual practices and promotes sexual health. The sexual history may enable the patient to discuss sexual matters openly and to discuss sexual concerns with an informed health professional. This information can be obtained with the health history after the gynecologic-obstetric or genitourinary history is completed. By incorporating the sexual history into the general health history, the nurse can move from areas of lesser sensitivity to areas of greater sensitivity after establishing initial rapport.

Taking the sexual history becomes a dynamic process reflecting an exchange of information between the patient and the nurse and provides the opportunity to clarify myths and explore areas of concern that the patient may not have felt comfortable discussing in the past. In obtaining a sexual history, the nurse must not assume the patient's sexual preference until clarified. When asking about sexual health, the nurse also cannot assume that the patient is married or unmarried. Asking a woman to label herself as single, married, widowed, or divorced may be seen as an inappropriate inquiry by the patient. Asking about a partner or about current meaningful relationships may be a less offensive way to initiate a sexual history.

The PLISSIT (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, Intensive Therapy) model of sexual assessment and intervention may be used to provide a framework for nursing interventions (Annon, 1976). The assessment begins by introducing the topic and asking the woman for permission to discuss issues of sexual functioning with her.

The nurse can begin by explaining the purpose of obtaining a sexual history (eg, "I ask all my patients about their sexual health. May I ask you some questions about this?"). History taking continues by inquiring about present sexual activity and sexual orientation (eg, "Are you currently having sex with a man, a woman, or both?"). Inquiries about possible sexual dysfunction may include, "Are you having any problems related to your current sexual activity?" Such problems may be related to medication, life changes, disability, or the onset of physical or emotional illness. Patients can be asked about their thoughts on what is causing the current problem.

Limited information about sexual function may be provided to the patient. As the discussion progresses, the nurse may offer specific suggestions for interventions. For some women, a professional who specializes in sex therapy may provide more intensive therapy as needed. By initiating an assessment about sexual concerns, the nurse communicates to the patient that issues about changes in sexual functioning are valid health topics for discussion and provides a safe environment for discussing these sensitive topics.

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Reproductive Disorders}

Various reproductive disorders are influenced by genetic factors. Some examples are:
- Hereditary breast or ovarian cancer syndromes
- Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome (risk for uterine cancer)
- Müllerian aplasia
- 21-Hydroxylase deficiency (female masculinization)
- Turner syndrome $(45, \mathrm{XO})$
- Klinefelter syndrome $(47, \mathrm{XXY})$

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Assess family history for other family members with similar reproductive problems/abnormalities.
- Inquire about ethnic background (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish populations and hereditary breast/ovarian cancer mutations).
- Inquire about relatives with other cancers, including earlyonset ovarian, uterine, renal, prostate cancers.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- In females with delayed puberty or primary amenorrhea, assess for clinical features of Turner syndrome (short stature, webbing of the neck, widely spaced nipples).
- In males with delayed puberty or infertility, assess for clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome (tall stature, gynecomastia, learning disabilities).
- Assess for other congenital anomalies in females with Müllerian defect, including renal and vertebral anomalies.

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether genetic testing (DNA chromosomal, metabolic) has been carried out on affected family member(s).
- If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of genetic testing, and gene-based interventions.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to families with newly diagnosed generelated reproductive disorders.
- Participate in management and coordination of care of patients with genetic conditions, individuals predisposed to develop or pass on a genetic condition.

Risk for STDs can be assessed by asking about number of partners in the past year or in the patient's lifetime. An open-ended question related to the patient's need for further information should be included (eg, "Do you have any questions or concerns about your sexual health?"). Nurses should be aware that some women and men are using the Internet to seek partners; obtaining sexual partners this way has been associated with an increased risk for STDs (McFarlane, Bull \& Rietmeijer, 2000; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001).

Young women may be apprehensive about irregular periods, may be concerned about STDs, or may need contraception. They may want information on using tampons, emergency contraception, or issues related to pregnancy. Perimenopausal women may have concerns about irregular menses; menopausal women may be concerned about vaginal dryness and burning with intercourse. Women of any age may have concerns about sexual satisfaction, orgasm or anorgasmia (lack of orgasm).

\section*{Female Genital Mutilation}

Female genital mutilation (FGM) refers to the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to female organs. Individuals from some cultures believe that FGM promotes
hygiene, protects virginity and family honor, prevents promiscuity, improves female attractiveness and male sexual pleasure, and enhances fertility. It is viewed in some cultures as a rite of passage to womanhood. Many organizations (eg, World Health Organization, Amnesty International) are working to end this practice.

Four types of FGM are known: excision of the clitoral prepuce; total excision of the clitoral prepuce and glans with partial or total excision of the labia minora; excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching or narrowing of the vaginal opening (referred to as infibulation); and unclassified, which includes pricking, piercing, or incision of the clitoris, the labia, or both, stretching of the clitoris or surrounding tissues, and introduction of corrosive substances into the vagina (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG] Committee Opinion \#151, 1995). FGM is usually performed between 4 and 10 years of age; hemorrhage and infection may be consequences.

A growing number of women entering the U.S. health care system underwent FGM before coming to this country ( Ng , 2000). Others have undergone FGM since they arrived in the United States. Because FGM can affect sexual function, menstrual hygiene, and bladder function, the possibility of FGM is included in the sexual history, particularly for women from cultures and countries where the practice is common.

Long-term complications of FGM include urinary problems, chronic vaginitis and pelvic infections, inability to undergo pelvic examination, painful intercourse, impaired sexual response, anemia, increased risk for HIV infection due to tearing of scar tissue, and psychological and psychosexual sequelae (American Medical Association, 1995). Nurses who care for patients who have undergone FGM need to be sensitive, empathetic, knowledgeable, and nonjudgmental.

\section*{Domestic Violence}

Domestic violence is a broad term that includes child abuse, elder abuse, and abuse of women and men. Abuse can be emotional, physical, sexual, or economic. Battering involves repeated physical or sexual assault in a context of coercive control and, more broadly, emotional degradation, threats, and intimidation. Nurses need to be aware of the prevalence of abuse and violence directed against women in our society. Abuse is related to the need to maintain control of a partner and involves fear of one partner by another and control by threats, intimidation, and physical abuse. Violence is rarely a one-time occurrence in a relationship; it usually continues
and escalates in severity. This is an important point to emphasize when a woman states that her partner has hurt her but has promised to change. Batterers can change their behavior, but not without extensive counseling and motivation. If a woman states that she is being hurt, sensitive care is required (Chart 46-2). Because more than 6 million women experience domestic violence each year, battered women are encountered daily in nursing practice. By knowing about this major public health problem, being alert to abuse-related problems, and learning how to elicit information from women about abuse in their lives, nurses can offer intervention for a problem that might otherwise go undetected. Asking each woman about violence in her life in a safe environment (ie, a private room with the door closed) is part of a comprehensive assessment and universal screening. The Abuse Assessment Screen has been found effective in identifying the presence of abuse and should be included in the health history of all women (Chart 46-3).

No specific signs or symptoms are diagnostic of battering; however, nurses may see an injury that does not fit the account of how it happened (eg, a bruise on the side of the upper arm after "I walked into a door"). Manifestations of abuse may involve suicide attempts, drug and alcohol abuse, frequent emergency de-

\section*{Chart 46-2}

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Managing Reported Domestic Abuse}

\section*{ACTION}
1. Reassure the woman that she is not alone.
2. Express your belief that no one should be hurt, that abuse is the fault of the batterer and is against the law.
3. Assure the woman that her information is confidential, although it does become part of her medical record. If children are suspected of being abused or are being abused, the law requires that this be reported to the authorities. Some states require reporting of spousal or partner abuse. Domestic violence agencies and medical and nursing groups disagree with this policy and are trying to have it changed. Serious opposition is based on the fact that reporting does not and cannot currently guarantee a woman's safety and may place her in more danger. It may also interfere with a patient's willingness to discuss her personal life and concerns with care providers. This places a serious barrier in the way of comprehensive nursing care. If nurses are in doubt, they need to check with their local or state domestic violence agency.)
4. Document the woman's statement of abuse and take photographs of any visible injuries if written formal consent has been obtained. (Emergency departments usually have a camera available if one is not on the nursing unit.)
5. Provide teaching:
- Inform the woman that shelters are available to ensure safety for her and her children. (Lengths of stay in shelters vary by state but are often up to 2 months. Staff often assist with housing, jobs, and the emotional distress that accompanies the break-up of the family.) Provide list of shelters.
- Inform woman that violence gets worse, not better.
- If the woman chooses to go to a shelter, let her make the call.
- If she chooses to return to the abuser, remain nonjudgmental and provide information that will make her safer than she was before disclosing her situation.
- Make sure that she has a 24 -hour hotline telephone number that provides information and support (Spanish translation and a device for the deaf are also available), police number, and 911.
- Assist her to set up a safety plan in case she decides to return home. (A safety plan is an organized plan for departure with packed bags and important papers hidden in a safe spot.)

\section*{RATIONALE}

Many women are hurt by their partners, and nurses see them daily. Let the woman know that no one deserves to be abused.

Women are often afraid that their information will be reported to the police or protective services and their children may be taken away.

Provide documentation of injuries that may be needed for later legal or criminal proceedings.

These options may be life-saving for the woman and her children.

partment visits, vague pelvic pain, and depression. However, there may be no obvious signs or symptoms. Women in abusive situations often report that they do not feel well, due to the stress of fear and anticipation of abuse. Nurses need to be knowledgeable about abuse, ask every woman patient about abuse in her life, provide resources, and follow written protocols within their institution to ensure comprehensive care.

\section*{Incest and Childhood Sexual Abuse}

Because more than one in five women has experienced incest or childhood sexual abuse, nurses frequently encounter women who have been sexually traumatized. It has been reported that female survivors of sexual abuse have more health problems and undergo more surgery than women who were not victimized. Victims of childhood sexual abuse are reported to experience more chronic depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, morbid obesity, marital instability, gastrointestinal problems, and headaches, as well as greater use of health care services, than persons who were not victims. Chronic pelvic pain in women is often associated with physical violence, emotional neglect, and sexual abuse in childhood (ACOG Educational Bulletin \#259, 2001). Women who have experienced rape or sexual abuse may have difficulty with pelvic examinations, labor, pelvic or breast irradiation, or any treatment or examination that involves hands-on treatment or requires removal of clothing. Nurses should be prepared to offer support and referral to psychologists, community resources, and self-help groups.

\section*{Rape and Sexual Assault}

Sexual assault occurs every 6 minutes in the United States. Men, women, and children may be victims. Sexual assault nurse examiners, emergency department staff, and gynecologists perform the painstaking collection of forensic evidence that is needed for criminal prosecution. Oral, anal, and genital tissue is examined for evidence of trauma, semen, or infection. Saliva, hair, and fingernail evidence is also collected. Cultures are obtained for STDs, and prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed. HIV testing is offered and is repeated in 3 to 6 months. HIV prophylaxis is not universally recommended but is considered when mucosal exposure to contamination has occurred. Prophylaxis against chlamydia and gonorrhea are provided (Kaplan, Feinstein, Fisher et al., 2001). Emergency contraception is provided if requested. Emotional counseling is provided, and follow-up treatment visits are arranged. Rape trauma syndrome is the emotional reaction to a sexual assault and may consist of shock, sleep disturbances, nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, anger, mood swings, and depression. It is important for survivors to discuss the experience and to obtain professional counseling.

Screening for abuse, rape, and violence should be part of routine assessment because women often do not report or seek treatment
for assault. Often, the assailant is a partner, husband, or date. Nurses may encounter women with infections or pregnancies related to sexual assault that were never treated.

\section*{Health Issues of Women With Disabilities}

Studies have shown that women with disabilities receive less primary health care and preventive health screening than other women, often because of access problems and health care providers' focus on the causes of disability rather than on general health issues of concern to all women. To address these issues, the history should include questions about barriers to health care experienced by disabled women and the effect of their disability on their health status and health care. Other issues to be addressed are identified in Chart 46-4. If the patient has hearing loss, vision loss, or another disability, the nurse may need to obtain the assistance of a signer or interpreter. The nurse assessing a person with a disability may require additional time and the assistance of others to be certain that accurate information is obtained from the patient. Extra time may be needed to conduct the assessment in a sensitive and unhurried manner (Kirschner, Gill, Reis \& Welner, 1998; Smeltzer, 2000).

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

Periodic examinations and routine cancer screening are important for all women. An annual breast and pelvic examination is important for all women age 18 or older and for those who are sexually active, regardless of age. The patient deserves understanding and support because of the emotional and physical considerations associated with gynecologic examinations. Women may be sensitive or embarrassed by the usual questions asked by a gynecologist or women's health care provider. Because gynecologic conditions are of a personal and private nature to most women, such information is shared only with those directly involved in patient care (as is true with all patient information).

Throughout the examination, the nurse explains the procedures to be performed. This not only encourages the woman to relax but also provides an opportunity for her to ask questions and minimizes the negative feelings that many women associate with gynecologic examinations.

The first pelvic examination is often anxiety-producing for women; the nurse can alleviate many of these feelings with explanations and teaching (Chart 46-5). Before the examination begins, the patient is asked to empty her bladder and to provide a urine specimen if urine tests are part of the total assessment. Voiding ensures patient comfort and eases the examination because a full bladder can make palpation of pelvic organs uncomfortable for the patient and difficult for the examiner.

\section*{Positioning}

Although several positions may be used for the pelvic examination, the supine lithotomy position is used most commonly, although the upright lithotomy position (in which the woman assumes a semisitting posture) may also be used. This position offers several advantages:
- It is more comfortable for some women.
- It allows better eye contact between patient and examiner.
- It may provide an easier means for the examiner to carry out the bimanual examination.
- It enables the woman to use a mirror to see her anatomy (if she chooses) to visualize any conditions that require treatment or to learn about using certain types of contraceptive methods.

\section*{Chart 46-4 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Assessing a Woman With a Disability}

\section*{Health History}

Address questions directly to the woman herself rather than to persons accompanying her.
Self-care limitations resulting from her disability (ability to feed and dress self, use of assistive devices, transportation requirements, other assistance needed)
Sensory limitations (lack of sensation, low vision, deaf or hard of hearing)
Accessibility issues (ability to get to health care provider, transfer to examination table, accessibility of office/clinic of health care provider, previous experiences with health care providers, health screening practices; her understanding of physical examination)

Limitations secondary to disability that affect general health issues and reproductive health and health care
Sexual function and concerns (those of all women and those that may be affected by the presence of a disabling condition)

\section*{Physical Assessment}

Provide instructions directly to the woman herself rather than to persons accompanying her; provide written or audiotaped instructions.
Ask the woman what assistance she needs for the physical examination and provide assistance if needed:
-Undressing and dressing
-Providing a urine specimen
- Standing on scale to be weighed (provide alternative means of obtaining weight if she is unable to stand on scale)
-Moving on and off the examination table
-Assuming, changing, and maintaining positions
Consider the fatigue experienced by the woman during a lengthy exam and allow rest.
Provide assistive devices and other aids/methods needed to allow adequate communication with the patient (interpreters, signers, large-print written materials).
Complete examination that would be indicated for any other woman; having a disability is never justification for omitting parts of the physical examination, including the pelvic examination.

In the supine lithotomy position, the patient lies on the table with her feet on foot rests or stirrups. She is encouraged to relax so that her buttocks are positioned at the edge of the examination table, and she is asked to relax and spread her thighs as widely apart as possible.

If the patient is too ill, disabled, or neurologically impaired to lie safely on the examination table or cannot maintain the supine lithotomy position, the Sims' position may be used. In Sims' position, the patient lies on her left side with her right leg bent at a 90 -degree angle. The right labia may be retracted to gain adequate access to the vagina.

\section*{Patient Education: The Pelvic Examination}

The nurse should explain the following to the patient:
- A pelvic examination includes assessment of the appearance, size, and shape of the vulva, vagina, uterus, and ovaries to ensure reproductive health and absence of illness.
- A pelvic examination should never hurt except in the presence of a pelvic infection. Women often describe a feeling of fullness or pressure but should not feel pain. Some women who are very tense feel discomfort, so relaxation is important.
- It is normal to feel uncomfortable and apprehensive.
- A narrow, warmed speculum will be inserted to visualize the cervix.
- A Papanicolaou (Pap) smear will be obtained and should not be uncomfortable.
- The patient may watch the examination with a mirror if she chooses.
- The examination usually takes no longer than 5 minutes.
- Draping will be used to minimize exposure (despite appropriate draping, some women feel uncomfortable or embarrassed during the examination).
women make the examination easier for the woman and the clinician. The presence of a disability does not justify skipping any parts of the physical assessment, including the pelvic examination.

The following equipment is obtained and readily available: a good light source; a vaginal speculum; clean examination gloves; lubricant, spatula, cytobrush, glass slides, fixative solution or spray; and diagnostic testing supplies for screening for occult rectal blood if the woman is older than 40 . Latex-free gloves should be available if the patient or clinician is allergic to latex. This allergy is becoming more prevalent in nurses and other health care providers and patients and is potentially life-threatening. Patients should be questioned about previous reactions to latex. (See Chap. 18 for a latex screening form and Chap. 53 for more information on latex allergy.)

\section*{Inspection}

After the patient is prepared, the examiner inspects the labia majora and minora, noting the epidermal tissue of the labia majora; the skin fades to the pink mucous membrane of the vaginal introitus. Lesions of any type (eg, venereal warts, pigmented lesions [melanoma]) are evaluated. In the nulliparous woman, the labia minora come together at the opening of the vagina. In women who have delivered children vaginally, the labia minora may gape and vaginal tissue may protrude.

Trauma to the anterior vaginal wall during childbirth may have resulted in incompetency of the musculature, and a bulge caused by the bladder protruding into the submucosa of the anterior vaginal wall (cystocele) may be seen. Childbirth trauma may also have affected the posterior vaginal wall, producing a bulge caused by rectal cavity protrusion (rectocele). The cervix may descend under pressure through the vaginal canal and be seen at the introitus (uterine prolapse). See Chapter 47 for a discussion of these structural changes. To identify such protrusions, the examiner asks the patient to "bear down."

The introitus should be free of superficial mucosal lesions. The labia minora may be separated by the fingers of the gloved hand and the lower part of the vagina palpated. In virgins, a hymen of variable thickness may be felt circumferentially within 1 or 2 cm of the vaginal opening. The hymenal ring usually permits the insertion of one finger. Rarely, the hymen totally occludes the vaginal entrance (imperforate hymen).

In women who are not virgins, a rim of scar tissue representing the remnants of the hymenal ring may be felt circumferentially around the vagina near its opening. The greater vestibular glands (Bartholin's glands) lie between the labia minora and the remnants of the hymenal ring. An abscess of the Bartholin's gland can cause discomfort and requires incision and drainage.

\section*{Speculum Examination}

The bivalved speculum, either metal or plastic, is available in many sizes. Metal specula are soaked, scrubbed, and sterilized between patients. Some clinicians and some patients prefer plastic specula, which permit one-time use. The speculum should be warmed with a heating pad or warm water to make insertion more comfortable for the patient. The speculum is not lubricated because commercial lubricants interfere with cervical cytology (Papanicolaou [Pap] smear) findings.

The metal speculum has two set-screws. The one along the handle, holding the two valves of the speculum together, is kept tightened. The screw that holds the thumb rest in place is loosened. The speculum is grasped in the dominant hand, with the thumb against the back of the thumb rest to keep the tips of the valves closed. The speculum is rotated slightly counterclockwise, and the vaginal orifice is held open by the thumb and the forefinger of the gloved nondominant hand by some examiners. Other examiners find that straight insertion of a speculum with downward pressure on the vagina is more comfortable for the patient. The speculum is gently inserted into the posterior portion of the introitus and slowly advanced to the top of the vagina; this should not be painful or uncomfortable for the woman. The tip of the speculum may then be elevated and the speculum rotated to a transverse position. The speculum is then slowly opened and
the set-screw of the thumb rest is tightened to hold the speculum open (Fig. 46-4).

\section*{CERVIX}

The cervix is inspected. In nulliparous women, the cervix usually is 2 to 3 cm wide and smooth. Women who have borne children may have a laceration, usually transverse, giving the cervical os a "fishmouth" appearance. Epithelium from the endocervical canal may have grown onto the surface of the cervix, appearing as beefyred surface epithelium circumferentially around the os. Occasionally, the cervix of a woman whose mother took DES has a hooded appearance (a peaked aspect superiorly or a ridge of tissue surrounding it); this is evaluated by colposcopy when identified.

\section*{ABNORMAL GROWTH}

Malignant changes may not be obviously differentiated from the rest of the cervical mucosa. Small, benign cysts may appear on the cervical surface. These are usually bluish or white and are called nabothian cysts. A polyp of endocervical mucosa may protrude through the os and usually is dark red. Polyps can cause irregular bleeding; they are rarely malignant and usually are removed easily in an office or clinic setting. A carcinoma may appear as a cauliflower-like growth that bleeds easily when touched. Bluish coloration of the cervix is a sign of early pregnancy (Chadwick's sign).

\section*{PAP SMEAR}

During the pelvic examination, a Pap smear is obtained by rotating a small spatula at the os, followed by a cervical brush rotated in the os. The tissue obtained is spread on a glass slide and sprayed or fixed immediately, or inserted into a liquid. A small broom-like device can also be used to obtain specimens for the Pap smear.

A specimen of any purulent material appearing at the cervical os is obtained for culture. A sterile applicator is used to obtain the specimen, which is immediately placed in an appropriate medium for transfer to a laboratory. In patients at high risk for infection, routine cultures for gonococcal and chlamydial organisms are recommended because of the high incidence of both diseases and the high risk for pelvic infection, fallopian tube damage, and subsequent infertility.

Once the speculum is inserted, the blades are then spread apart (B) to reveal the cervical os (C).}
\end{figure}

Vaginal discharge, which may be normal or may result from vaginitis, may be present. Discharge caused by bacteria (bacterial vaginosis) usually appears gray and purulent. Discharge caused by Trichomonas species infection is usually frothy, copious, and malodorous. Discharge caused by Candida species infection is usually thick and white-yellow and has a cottage-cheese appearance. Table 46-3 summarizes the characteristics of vaginal discharge found in different conditions.

The vagina is inspected as the examiner withdraws the speculum. It is smooth in young girls and thickens after puberty, with many rugae (folds) and redundancy in the epithelium. In menopausal women, the vagina thins and has fewer rugae because of decreased estrogen.

\section*{Bimanual Palpation}

To complete the pelvic examination, the examiner performs a bimanual examination from a standing position. The examination is performed with the forefinger and middle finger of the gloved and lubricated hand. These fingers are placed in the vaginal orifice, while the other fingers are held tightly out of the way, with the thumb completely adducted. The fingers are advanced vertically along the vaginal canal, and the vaginal wall is palpated. Any firm part of the vaginal wall may represent old scar tissue from childbirth trauma but may also require further evaluation.

\section*{CERVICAL PALPATION}

The cervix is palpated and assessed for its consistency, mobility, size, and position. The normal cervix is uniformly firm but not hard. Softening of the cervix is a finding in early pregnancy. Hardness and immobility of the cervix may reflect invasion by a neoplasm. Pain on gentle movement of the cervix is called a positive chandelier sign or positive cervical motion tenderness (recorded as +CMT) and usually indicates a pelvic infection.

\section*{UTERINE PALPATION}

To palpate the uterus, the examiner places the opposite hand on the abdominal wall halfway between the umbilicus and the pubis and presses firmly toward the vagina (Fig. 46-5). Movement of the abdominal wall causes the body of the uterus to descend, and the pear-shaped organ becomes freely movable between the abdominal examining hand and the fingers of the pelvic examining hand. Uterine size, mobility, and contour can be estimated through palpation. Fixation of the uterus in the pelvis may be a sign of endometriosis or malignancy.

The body of the uterus is normally twice the diameter and twice the length of the cervix, curving anteriorly toward the abdominal wall. Some women have a retroverted or retroflexed

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
uterus, which tips posteriorly toward the sacrum, whereas others have a uterus that is neither anterior nor posterior but is midline.

\section*{ADNEXAL PALPATION}

Next, the right and left adnexal areas are palpated to evaluate the fallopian tubes and ovaries. The fingers of the hand examining the pelvis are moved first to one side, then to the other, while the hand palpating the abdominal area is moved correspondingly to either side of the abdomen and downward. The adnexa (ovaries and fallopian tubes) are trapped between the two hands and palpated for an obvious mass, tenderness, and mobility. Commonly, the ovaries are slightly tender, and the patient is informed that slight discomfort on palpation is normal.

\section*{VAGINAL AND RECTAL PALPATION}

Bimanual palpation of the vagina and cul-de-sac is accomplished by placing the index finger in the vagina and the middle finger in the rectum. To prevent cross-contamination between the vaginal and rectal orifices, the examiner puts on new gloves. A gentle movement of these fingers toward each other compresses the posterior vaginal wall and the anterior rectal wall and assists the examiner in identifying the integrity of these structures. During this procedure, the patient may sense an urge to defectate. The nurse assures the patient that this is unlikely to occur. Ongoing explanations are provided to reassure and educate the patient about the procedure.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Yearly examinations can help prevent problems of the reproductive tract in aging women. Some older women do not have regular gynecologic examinations. If a woman delivered her children at home, she may never have had a pelvic examination. Some regard it as an embarrassing and unpleasant procedure. An important role of the nurse is to encourage an annual gynecologic examination for all women. The nurse can make the examination a time for education and reassurance rather than a time of embarrassment.

Perineal pruritus is common in elderly women and should be evaluated because it may indicate a disease process (diabetes or malignancy). It may also indicate vulvar dystrophy, a thickened or whitish discoloration of tissue that needs biopsy to rule out abnormal cells. Topical cortisone and hormone creams may be prescribed for symptomatic relief.

With relaxing pelvic musculature, uterine prolapse and relaxation of the vaginal walls can occur. Appropriate evaluation and surgical repair can provide relief if the patient is a candidate for surgery. After surgery, the patient needs to know that tissue repair and healing may require additional time. Pessaries (latex devices that provide support) are often used if surgery is contraindicated or before surgery to see if surgery can be avoided. They are fitted by a health care provider and may reduce discomfort and pressure. Use of a pessary requires the patient to have routine gynecologic examinations to monitor for irritation or infection.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

\section*{CYTOLOGIC TEST FOR CANCER (PAP SMEAR)}

The Pap smear is performed to detect cervical cancer. Before 1940, cervical cancer was the most common cause of cancer death in women. Dr. George Papanicolaou discovered the value of examining exfoliated cells for malignancy in the 1930s. Due to the effectiveness of the Pap smear as a screening method, cervical cancer is now less common than breast or ovarian cancer.

Cervical secretions are gently removed from the cervical os (Fig. 46-6), transferred to a glass slide, and fixed immediately by spraying with a fixative. A Thin-prep Pap specimen is immersed in a solution rather than being placed on a slide. This method allows for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing if the Pap smear result is abnormal (see Chap. 47 for further discussion of HPV, a commonly transmitted STD that can cause venereal warts or cervical changes).

The patient should be instructed not to douche before this examination to avoid washing away cellular material. The Pap smear should be performed when the patient is not menstruating because blood usually interferes with interpretation. The proper technique for obtaining a cervical specimen for cytologic study is described in Chart 46-6. False-negative Pap smear results may occur, as may false positives.

The Bethesda Classification system (Chart 46-7) has been developed to promote consistency in reporting Pap smear results and to assist in standardizing management guidelines (Solomon, Davey, Kurman et al., 2001). Terminology includes the following categories:
- Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), which is equivalent to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) and to mild changes related to exposure to HPV
- High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which equates to moderate and severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (CIS), and CIN 2 and CIN 3

These terms seen on Pap smear findings encompass the precursors to invasive carcinoma of the cervix.

Pap smears that reveal mild inflammation or atypical squamous cells are usually repeated in 3 to 6 months, with findings often returning to normal. Patients are apprehensive because many women incorrectly assume that an abnormal Pap smear means cancer. If a specific infection is causing inflammation, it is treated appropriately, and the Pap smear is repeated. If the repeat Pap smear reveals atypical squamous cells, then a colposcopy is appropriate.

Thin-prep Pap specimens that show atypical cells can also be used to determine the presence of HPV DNA. If HPV DNA is present, it is more likely that HSIL is present.

If the Pap smear results are abnormal, prompt notification, evaluation, and treatment are crucial. Notification of patients is often done by nurses in women's health care. Pap smear followup is crucial as it can prevent cervical cancer. Many women do not adhere to recommendations-particularly young women, those of low socioeconomic status, minorities, women who have difficulty coping with the diagnosis, and those without social support. Fear, lack of understanding, and childcare responsibilities have all been identified by women as reasons for poor follow-up. Women with a history of abuse, obese women, and women who had a negative gynecologic experience may also find returning for follow-up difficult (Wee, McCarthy, Davis \& Phillips, 2000). Interventions are tailored to meet the needs of the particular group. Intensive telephone counseling, tracking systems, brochures, videos, and financial incentives have all been used to encourage followup. Nurses can provide clear explanations and emotional support along with a carefully designed follow-up protocol designed to meet the needs of their specific patient population (DeRemer Abercrombie, 2001).

\section*{COLPOSCOPY AND CERVICAL BIOPSY}

All suspicious Pap smears should be evaluated by colposcopy. The colposcope is a portable microscope (magnification from $10 \times$ to $25 \times$ ) that allows the examiner to visualize the cervix and obtain a sample of abnormal tissue for analysis. Nurse practitioners and gynecologists require special training in this diagnostic technique.

After inserting a speculum and visualizing the cervix and vaginal walls, the examiner applies acetic acid to the cervix. Subsequent abnormal findings that indicate the need for biopsy include leukoplakia (white plaque visible before applying acetic acid), acetowhite tissue (white epithelium after applying acetic acid), punctation (dilated capillaries occurring in a dotted or stippled pattern), mosaicism (a tile-like pattern), and atypical vascular patterns.

An endocervical curettage may be performed during colposcopy if a problem is suspected based on Pap smear findings. This analysis of tissue from the cervical canal is used to determine whether abnormal changes have occurred in the cervical canal. If these biopsy specimens show premalignant cells or CIN, the patient usually needs cryotherapy, laser therapy, or a cone biopsy (excision of an inverted tissue cone from the cervix) (ACOG Committee Opinion \#195, 1998).

\section*{CRYOTHERAPY AND LASER THERAPY}

Cryotherapy (freezing cervical tissue with nitrous oxide) and laser treatment are used in the outpatient setting. Cryotherapy may result in cramping and occasional feelings of faintness (vasovagal

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
response). A watery discharge is normal for a few weeks after the procedure as the cervix heals.

\section*{CONE BIOPSY AND LEEP}

If the endocervical curettage findings indicate abnormal changes or if the lesion extends into the canal, the patient may undergo a cone biopsy. This can be performed surgically or with a procedure called LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), which uses a laser beam.

Usually performed in the outpatient setting, LEEP is associated with a high success rate in removal of abnormal cervical tissue and has a low incidence of complications (ACOG Committee Opinion \#195, 1998). The gynecologist excises a small amount of cervical tissue, and the pathologist examines the borders of the specimen to determine if they are free of disease. A patient anes-
thetized for a surgical cone biopsy is advised to rest for 24 hours after the procedure and to leave any vaginal packing in place until the physician removes it (usually the next day). The patient is instructed to report any excessive bleeding.

Guidelines regarding postoperative sexual activity, bathing, and other activities are provided by the nurse or the physician. Because open tissue may be potentially exposed to HIV and other pathogens, the patient is usually cautioned to avoid intercourse until healing is complete and verified at follow-up. Cervical stenosis can be a complication of this procedure.

\section*{ENDOMETRIAL (ASPIRATION) BIOPSY}

A tissue sample obtained through biopsy permits diagnosis of cellular changes in the endometrium. Endometrial biopsy, a method of obtaining endometrial tissue, is performed during the pelvic ex-

\section*{Chart 46-6}

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Obtaining an Optimal Pap Smear}

\section*{NURSING ACTION}
1. Do not obtain a Pap smear if the woman is menstruating or has other frank bleeding (exception: high suspicion of neoplasia).
2. If performing more than one test (eg, Pap and GC), obtain the Pap smear first.
3. Label the frosted end of the slide with the patient's name in pencil or label Thin-prep Pap bottle.
4. Put on gloves before gently inserting the unlubricated speculum. (Speculum may be moistened with warm water.)
5. Place the longer end of the Ayre spatula in the cervical canal and rotate it in a full circle to obtain a sample from the exocervix. Spread the material obtained onto the Pap smear slide.
6. Insert a cytobrush 2 cm into the cervical canal and rotate 180 degrees. Roll the brush onto the Pap smear slide. (With Thinprep Pap smears, the brushings are not spread onto a slide. The spatula and brush are placed in a bottle of fixative and swirled.)
7. In women who have had a hysterectomy, use a cotton applicator moistened with saline solution to obtain a sampling of cells from the vaginal cuff or posterior vagina.
8. Immediately spray the slide or, if a Thin-prep, swirl the brush and spatula in the solution.

\section*{RATIONALE}

Blood obscures a proper reading of cells.
By performing the Pap smear first, the chance of a bloody smear is avoided.
Ink may rub off or blur. Labeling with a pencil prevents improper identification.
Gloves provide protection and warm water prevents discomfort. Lubricants may obscure cells on Pap smear.
This technique obtains a sampling of the exocervix and squamocolumnar junction.

This obtains endocervical cells and may sample cells from the squamocolumnar junction if it is high in the canal.

Saline solution prevents drying, which makes interpretation difficult for the cytologist and prevents absorption of cells into the cotton, increasing the yield on the slide.
Exposure to air or light causes distortion of cells.
amination when indicated as an outpatient procedure. Women undergoing this procedure may experience slight discomfort. Usually, the procedure can be performed without anesthesia; however, a paracervical block or a small injection of lidocaine into the uterus is effective if required. The examiner may apply a tenaculum (a clamp-like instrument that stabilizes the uterus) after the pelvic
examination and then inserts a thin, hollow, flexible suction tube (pipelle or sampler) through the cervix into the uterus.

Endometrial biopsy is usually indicated in cases of midlife irregular bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, and infertility (to identify changes in the uterine lining after ovulation). Women who are bleeding irregularly while receiving hormone replacement
therapy or who experience any bleeding while taking tamoxifen are usually advised to undergo endometrial biopsy.

Findings on aspiration may include normal endometrial tissue, hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. Simple hyperplasia is an overgrowth of the uterine lining and is usually treated with progesterone. Complex hyperplasia is a risk factor for uterine cancer and is treated with progesterone and careful follow-up. Women who are overweight, who are over 45, who have a history of nulliparity and infertility, and who have a family history of colon cancer seem to be at higher risk for hyperplasia (Farquhar, Lethaby, Sowter et al., 1999). Endometrial cancer is discussed in Chapter 47.

\section*{DILATION AND CURETTAGE}

A dilation and curettage ( $\mathrm{D} \& \mathrm{C}$ ) may be diagnostic (identifies the cause of irregular bleeding) or therapeutic (often temporarily stops irregular bleeding). The cervical canal is widened with a dilator and the uterine endometrium is scraped with a curette. The purpose of the procedure is to secure endometrial or endocervical tissue for cytologic examination, to control abnormal uterine bleeding, and as a therapeutic measure for incomplete abortion.

Because this procedure is usually carried out under anesthesia and requires surgical asepsis, it is usually performed in the operating room. However, it may take place in the outpatient setting with the patient receiving a local anesthetic supplemented with diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), or meperidine (Demerol). The patient who receives these medications is carefully monitored until she has fully recovered.

The nurse provides an explanation of the procedure as well as physical and psychological preparation, informing the patient about what the procedure involves and what to expect in terms of postoperative discomfort and bleeding. The perineum is not shaved, but the patient is instructed to void before the procedure. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position, the cervix is dilated with a dilating instrument, and endometrial scrapings are
obtained by a curette. A perineal pad is placed over the perineum after the procedure, and excessive bleeding is reported. No restrictions are placed on dietary intake. If pelvic discomfort or low back pain occurs, mild analgesics usually provide relief. The physician indicates when sexual intercourse may be safely resumed. To reduce the risk of infection and bleeding, most physicians advise no vaginal penetration or use of tampons for 2 weeks.

\section*{ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS}

\section*{Laparoscopy (Pelvic Peritoneoscopy)}

A laparoscopy involves inserting a laparoscope (a tube about 10 mm wide and similar to a small periscope) into the peritoneal cavity through a $2-\mathrm{cm}(0.75-\mathrm{inch})$ incision below the umbilicus to allow visualization of the pelvic structures (Fig. 46-7). Laparoscopy may be used for diagnostic purposes (eg, in cases of pelvic pain when no cause can be found) or treatment. Laparoscopy also facilitates many surgical procedures, such as tubal sterilization, ovarian biopsy, myomectomy, and lysis of adhesions (scar tissue that can cause pelvic discomfort). A surgical instrument (intrauterine sound or cannula) may be positioned inside the uterus to permit manipulation or movement during laparoscopy, affording better visualization. The pelvic organs can be visualized after the injection of a prescribed amount of carbon dioxide intraperitoneally into the cavity. Called insufflation, this technique separates the intestines from the pelvic organs. If the patient is undergoing sterilization, the fallopian or uterine tubes may be electrocoagulated, sutured, or ligated and a segment removed for histologic verification (clips are an alternative device for occluding the tubes).

After the laparoscopy is completed, the laparoscope is withdrawn, carbon dioxide is allowed to escape through the outer cannula, the small skin incision is closed with sutures or a clip, and the incision is covered with an adhesive bandage. The patient is carefully monitored for several hours to detect any untoward signs indicating bleeding (most commonly from vascular injury

FIGURE 46-7 Laparoscopy. The laparoscope (right) is inserted through a small incision in the abdomen. A forceps is inserted through the scope to grasp the fallopian tube.

to the hypogastric vessels), bowel or bladder injury, or burns from the coagulator. These complications are rare, making laparoscopy a cost-effective and safe short-stay procedure. The patient may experience abdominal or shoulder pain related to the use of carbon dioxide gas.

\section*{Hysteroscopy}

Hysteroscopy (transcervical intrauterine endoscopy) allows direct visualization of all parts of the uterine cavity by means of a lighted optical instrument. The procedure is best performed about 5 days after menstruation stops, in the estrogenic phase of the menstrual cycle. The vagina and vulva are cleansed, and a paracervical anesthetic block is performed or lidocaine spray is used. The instrument used for the procedure, a hysteroscope, is passed into the cervical canal and advanced 1 or 2 cm under direct vision. Uterine-distending fluid (normal saline solution or $5 \%$ dextrose in water) is infused through the instrument to dilate the uterine cavity and enhance visibility.

Hysteroscopy is most commonly indicated as an adjunct to a D \& C and laparoscopy in cases of infertility, unexplained bleeding, retained intrauterine device (IUD), and recurrent early pregnancy loss. Treatment for some conditions (eg, fibroid tumors) can be accomplished during this procedure. Hysteroscopy is contraindicated in patients with cervical or endometrial carcinoma or acute pelvic inflammation. Endometrial ablation (destruction of the uterine lining) is performed with a hysteroscope and laser beam in cases of severe bleeding not responsive to other therapies. Performed in an outpatient setting, this rapid procedure is an alternative to hysterectomy for some patients. Hysteroscopy, a safe procedure with few complications, has been found to be useful for evaluating endometrial pathology. Uterine perforation can occur.

\section*{OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES}

Many diagnostic procedures are helpful in evaluating pelvic conditions. These may include x-rays, barium enemas, gastrointestinal x-ray series, intravenous urography, and cystography studies. Additionally, because the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are near the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, urologic diagnostic studies, such as the KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) and pyelography are used, as are angiography and radioisotope scanning, if needed. Other diagnostic procedures include hysterosalpingography and computed tomography (CT) scanning.

\section*{Hysterosalpingography or Uterotubography}

Hysterosalpingography is an x-ray study of the uterus and the fallopian tubes after injection of a contrast agent. The diagnostic procedure is performed to evaluate infertility or tubal patency and to detect any abnormal condition in the uterine cavity. Sometimes the procedure is therapeutic because the flowing contrast agent flushes debris or loosens adhesions.

In preparation for hysterosalpingography, the intestinal tract is cleansed with cathartics and an enema so that gas shadows do not distort the x-ray findings. An analgesic agent may be prescribed. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position and the cervix is exposed with a bivalved speculum. A cannula is inserted into the cervix and the contrast agent is injected into the uterine cavity and the fallopian tubes. X-rays are taken to show the path and the distribution of the contrast agent.

Some patients experience nausea, vomiting, cramps, and faintness. After the test, the patient is advised to wear a perineal
pad for several hours because the radiopaque agent may stain clothing.

\section*{CT Scan}

CT scanning has several advantages over ultrasonography (described below), even though it involves radiation exposure and is more costly. It is more effective than ultrasonography for obese patients or patients with a distended bowel. A CT scan can also demonstrate a tumor and any extension into the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and skeletal tissue, although it has limited value in diagnosing other gynecologic abnormalities.

\section*{Ultrasonography}

Ultrasonography (or ultrasound) is a useful adjunct to the physical examination, particularly in the obstetric patient or the patient with abnormal pelvic examination findings. It is a simple procedure based on sound wave transmission that uses pulsed ultrasonic waves at frequencies exceeding $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ (formerly cycles per second). A transducer placed in contact with the abdomen (abdominal scan) or a vaginal probe (vaginal ultrasound) converts mechanical energy into electrical impulses, which in turn are amplified and recorded on an oscilloscope screen while a photograph or video recording of the patterns is taken. The entire procedure takes about 10 minutes and involves no ionizing radiation and no discomfort other than a full bladder, which is necessary for good visualization during an abdominal scan. (A vaginal ultrasound or sonogram does not require a full bladder.) Saline may be instilled into the uterus (saline infusion sonogram) to help delineate endometrial polyps or fibroids. Polyps are a frequent benign cause of bleeding in older women and can be removed by polypectomy.

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces patterns that are finer and more definitive than other imaging procedures without exposing the patient to radiation. MRI, however, is more costly.

\section*{Management of Normal and Altered Female Physiologic Processes}

Many health concerns of women are related to normal changes or abnormalities of the menstrual cycle. Many result from women's lack of understanding of the menstrual cycle, developmental changes, and factors that may affect the pattern of the menstrual cycle. Educating women about the menstrual cycle and changes over time is an important aspect of the nurse's role in providing quality care to women. Teaching should begin early, so that menstruation and the lifelong changes in the menstrual cycle can be anticipated and accepted as a normal part of life.

\section*{MENSTRUATION}

Menstruation, a cyclic vaginal flow of tissue that lines the uterus, occurs about every 28 days during the reproductive years, although normal cycles can vary from 21 to 42 days. The flow usually lasts 4 to 5 days, during which time 50 to 60 mL ( 4 to 12 teaspoons) of blood are lost.

A perineal pad is generally used to absorb menstrual discharge; deodorant-treated pads are available, but some women are allergic
or sensitive to the deodorants. Tampons are also used extensively; there is no significant evidence of untoward effects from their use, provided that there is no difficulty in inserting them. However, tampons should not be used for more than 4 to 6 hours, nor should superabsorbent tampons be used because of the association with toxic shock syndrome (see Chap. 47 for more about this syndrome). If a tampon is hard to remove, the vagina feels dry, or the tampon shreds when removed, less absorbent tampons should be used. If the string breaks or retracts, a woman should squat in a comfortable position, insert one finger into the vagina, try to locate the tampon, and remove it. If the woman feels uncomfortable attempting this maneuver or if she cannot remove the tampon, she should consult a health care provider.

\section*{Psychosocial Considerations}

Girls who are approaching menarche (the onset of menstruation) should be instructed about the normal process of the menstrual cycle before it occurs. Psychologically, it is much healthier to refer to this event as a "period" rather than as "being sick." With adequate nutrition, rest, and exercise, most women feel little discomfort, although some report breast tenderness and a feeling of fullness 1 or 2 days before menstruation begins. Others report fatigue and some discomfort in the lower back, legs, and pelvis on the first day and temperament or mood changes. Slight deviations from a usual pattern of daily living are considered normal, but excessive deviation may require evaluation. Regular exercise and a low-fat vegetarian diet have been found to decrease discomfort. Heating pads may be very effective for cramps, as may nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient with excessive cramping or dysmenorrhea is referred to a gynecologist; oral contraceptives may be prescribed following evaluation.

\section*{Cultural Considerations}

The United States is becoming more culturally diverse. Culture can be defined as the thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, and values of a racial, ethnic, religious, or social group. These aspects of culture affect many health care encounters, and these encounters can be positive if nurses understand the various cultures of their patients.

Differing cultural views and beliefs on menstruation exist. Some women believe that it is detrimental to change a pad or tampon too frequently; they think that allowing the discharge to accumulate increases the flow, which is considered desirable. Some women believe they are vulnerable to illness during menstruation. Others feel it is harmful to swim, shower, have their hair permed, have their teeth filled, or eat certain foods during menstruation. They may also avoid using contraception.

In such situations, the nurse is in a position to provide women with facts in an accepting and culturally sensitive manner. The objective is to be mindful of these unexpressed, deep-rooted beliefs and to provide the facts with care. Aspects of gynecologic problems cannot always be expressed easily. The nurse needs to convey confidence and openness and to offer facts to facilitate communication. Suggestions to improve care include overcoming language barriers, providing language-appropriate materials, asking about traditional beliefs and dietary practices, and asking patients about their fears regarding care (Mattson, 2000). Patience, sensitivity, and a desire to learn about other cultures and groups will enhance the nursing care of all women (Chart 46-8).

\section*{PERIMENOPAUSE}

Perimenopause is the period extending from the first signs of menopause-usually hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and irregular menses-to beyond the complete cessation of menses. It has also been defined as the period around menopause, lasting to 1 year after the last menstrual period. Women often have varied beliefs about aging, and these must be considered by the nurse caring for or educating perimenopausal patients.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Perimenopausal women often benefit from information about the subtle physiologic changes they are experiencing. Perimenopause has been described as an opportune time for teaching women about health promotion and disease prevention strategies. When discussing health-related concerns with midlife women, nurses should consider the following issues:
- Sexuality, fertility, contraception, STDs

\section*{Chempt 46-8 Lesbian Health Care}

Lesbians can generally be defined as women who have sex with or primary emotional partnerships with women, but there is no universally accepted definition; variability exists in relationships and sexual preferences. Lesbians are found in every ethnic group and socioeconomic class. They can be single, celibate, divorced, teens, and seniors. Most experts believe that sexual orientation is not a conscious choice.

Lesbians have often encountered insensitivity in health care encounters. When they are asked if they are sexually active and respond affirmatively, contraception is immediately urged as health care providers may assume incorrectly that they practice heterosexual intercourse. Similar to many other marginalized groups of women, they often underuse health care. Some health care providers are homophobic, and discrimination against lesbians has been found in health care (Blackwell \& Blackwell, 1999). Nurses need to consider lesbian-
ism within the continuum of human sexual behavior and need to use gender-neutral questions and terms that are non-judgmental and accepting. Lesbian teens are at risk for suicide and STDs. Many lesbians do participate in heterosexual activity and often consider themselves at low risk for STDs. Because HPV, herpes infections, and other organisms implicated in STDs are transmitted by secretions and contact, they may need information on STDs and contraception. If sex toys are used and not cleaned, pelvic infections can occur.

Lesbians may smoke and drink more alcohol, may have a higher body mass index, may bear fewer or no children, and often have fewer health preventive screenings than heterosexual women (Carroll, 1999). These factors may predispose them to colon, lung, endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Nurses need to understand the unique needs of this population and provide appropriate and sensitive care.
- Unintended pregnancy (this is possible if contraception is not used)
- Oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptives provide perimenopausal women with protection against uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, anemia, pregnancy, and fibrocystic breast changes as well as relief from perimenopausal symptoms. This option should be discussed with perimenopausal women. (Women who smoke and who are 35 or older should not take oral contraceptives because of an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.)
- Breast health. About $16 \%$ of cases of breast cancer occur in this group of women, so breast self-examination, routine physical examinations, and mammograms are essential.

Women need to be aware that diet and exercise are crucial to their health. The Women's Health Initiative study has found that the risks of long-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) outweigh the benefits. Although HRT decreases hot flashes and reduces the risk for osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer, it increases the risk for breast cancer, heart attack, stroke, and blood clots (Writing Group for Women's Health Initiative Investigators, 2002). (It has been suggested that the term "menopausal hormone therapy" be used in place of HRT.)

\section*{MENOPAUSE}

Menopause is the permanent physiologic cessation of menses associated with declining ovarian function; during this time, reproductive function diminishes and ends. Postmenopause is the period beginning from about 1 year after menses cease. Menopause is associated with some atrophy of breast tissue and genital organs, loss in bone density, and vascular changes.

Menopause starts gradually and is usually signaled by changes in menstruation. The monthly flow may increase, decrease, become irregular, and finally cease. Often, the interval between periods is longer; a lapse of several months between periods is not uncommon.

Changes signaling menopause begin to occur as early as the late 30s, when ovulation occurs less frequently, estrogen levels fluctuate, and FSH levels rise in an attempt to stimulate estrogen production.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Because of these hormonal changes, some women notice irregular menses, breast tenderness, and mood changes long before menopause occurs. The hot or warm flashes and night sweats reported by some women are directly attributable to hormonal changes. Hot flashes, which denote vasomotor instability, may vary in intensity from a barely perceptible warm feeling to a sensation of extreme warmth accompanied by profuse sweating, causing discomfort, sleep disturbances and subsequent fatigue, and embarrassment.

Other physical changes may include atrophic changes and osteoporosis (decreased bone density), resulting in decreased stature and bone fractures. About 1.5 million new fractures due to osteoporosis occur yearly in the United States (NIH Consensus Statement, 2001). The entire genitourinary system is affected by the reduced estrogen level. Changes in the vulvovaginal area may include a gradual thinning of pubic hair and a slow shrink-
age of the labia. Vaginal secretions decrease, and the woman may report dyspareunia (discomfort during intercourse). The vaginal pH rises during menopause, predisposing the woman to bacterial infections (atrophic vaginitis). Discharge, itching, and vulvar burning may result.

Some women report fatigue, dizziness, forgetfulness, weight gain, irritability, trouble sleeping, feeling "blue," and feelings of panic. Menopausal complaints need to be evaluated carefully as they may indicate other disorders.

\section*{Psychological Considerations}

Women's reactions and feelings related to loss of reproductive capacity may vary (Jacob's Institute of Women's Health, 2000). For women with grown families, menopause may result in role confusion or feelings of sexual and personal freedom. Women may be relieved that the childbearing phase of their lives is over. Each woman's circumstances will affect her response and must be considered on an individual basis. Nurses need to be aware of and sensitive to all possibilities and take their cues from the patient.

\section*{Medical Management}

As stated earlier, menopause may be characterized by decreased vaginal secretions, hot flashes, changes in the urinary tract, and mood swings. Decreased vaginal lubrication may cause dyspareunia in the menopausal woman; this may be prevented by the use of a water-soluble lubricant (eg, K-Y jelly, Replens, Astro-Glide, or contraceptive foam or jelly). A vaginal cream containing estrogen or an estrogen-containing vaginal ring may be prescribed.

Women approaching menopause often have many concerns about their health. Some have concerns based on a family history of heart disease, osteoporosis, or breast cancer. Each woman should discuss her concerns and feelings with her primary health care provider so that she can make an informed decision about managing menopausal symptoms and maintaining her health.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Hormone Replacement Therapy. HRT reduces or eliminates persistent and severe hot flashes, reduces bone loss, decreases the risk for colon cancer, and improves lipoproteins and lowers fibrinogen levels (Hulley, Grady, Bush, et al., 1998). Despite these findings, the more recent Women's Health Initiative controlled trial of HRT in over 16,600 women demonstrated that the risks of HRT outweigh the benefits (Writing Group of the Women's Health Initiative Investigators, 2002). This study was halted after 5.2 years rather than continuing it for the planned duration of 8.5 years because women receiving HRT had a higher risk for invasive breast cancer than the group receiving placebo. Although the absolute risk of breast cancer is low for an individual woman taking HRT, the risks were considered contrary to its intended effect, which is to preserve health and prevent disease. Because of these findings, many women have elected to discontinue HRT, and many of those who previously would have taken HRT have refused or are reluctant to consider it. Some women and their health care providers have elected to begin or continue use of HRT to treat menopausal symptoms because of its benefits. Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the issues associated with

HRT use if they are to provide appropriate health care to perimenopausal and menopausal women.

Risks and Benefits of HRT. The changes that occur during menopause have adverse effects on women, placing them at increased risk for atherosclerosis, angina, and coronary artery disease. The effectiveness of HRT in reducing the risk for some of these conditions has not been supported, and the American Heart Association has recommended against initiating HRT for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or stroke (American Heart Association, 2002). HRT is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, vascular thrombosis, active liver disease or chronically impaired liver function, some cases of uterine cancer, and undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding. The risk of thromboembolic phenomena is slightly elevated. Women who elect to take HRT despite these risks should be taught the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and should be instructed to report these signs and symptoms immediately. Nurses should assess for leg redness, tenderness, chest pain, and shortness of breath in patients who take HRT. Further, women taking HRT need to be informed about the need for follow-up and monitoring. For women who decide to take HRT, regular follow-up care, including a yearly physical examination and mammogram, is important. An endometrial biopsy is indicated for women with any irregular bleeding during treatment. Because the risk of complications increases the longer HRT is used, HRT should be used for the shortest time necessary (American Heart Association, 2002).

Making a Decision About HRT. The decision of whether to use HRT has been a difficult one for many women. Although the results of the Women's Health Initiative trial may make the decision easier for some women, it is likely to remain a difficult decision for those who may benefit from its use because of very disruptive symptoms of menopause and evidence of bone loss. Women often want to learn about alternatives to HRT use; therefore, nurses should address other strategies that women can use to promote their health in the perimenopausal period.

Method of HRT Administration. There are several different approaches for use of hormone replacement. Some women take both estrogen and progestin daily; others take estrogen for 25 consecutive days each month, with progestin taken in cycles (eg, 10 to 14 days of the month). Progestin is taken to prevent proliferation of the uterine lining and hyperplasia in women who have not had their uterus removed. Women who take hormones for 25 days often experience bleeding after completing the progestin. Other women take estrogen and progesterone every day and usually experience no bleeding. They occasionally have irregular spotting, which should be evaluated by their health care provider.

Estrogen patches, which are replaced once or twice weekly, are another option but require a progestin along with them if the woman still has a uterus. Vaginal treatment with an estrogen cream, suppository, or an estradiol vaginal ring (Estring) may be used for vaginal dryness or atrophic vaginitis. Estring is a small, flexible vaginal ring that slowly releases estrogen in small doses over 3 months.

Alternatives to HRT. Women may benefit from learning about alternatives to HRT, including diet, vitamins, and exercise. They need to know that these approaches to menopause have not been examined thoroughly through research. Osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterio-
ration of bone tissue, occurs with menopause and leads to enhanced bone fragility and increased risk for fracture. Other factors that increase a woman's risk for osteoporosis include a thin body frame, race (Caucasian or Asian), family history of osteoporosis, nulliparity, early menopause, moderate to heavy alcohol ingestion, smoking, caffeine use, sedentary lifestyle, and a diet low in calcium. Women should be advised to remain active or to begin an exercise program of weight-bearing activity, such as walking; to take a calcium supplement; to decrease or stop smoking; and to discuss the use of pharmacologic agents (bisphosphonates, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, HRT) to reduce bone loss with their health care provider (NIH Consensus Statement, 2001; National Osteoporosis Foundation, 1999). Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene (Evista) provide another alternative to HRT for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. These medications do not appear to increase the risk for breast cancer; indeed, the risk of breast and uterine cancer may be reduced. Their use may increase hot flashes. No long-term studies exist on these medications because of their recent development. Osteoporosis and its treatment are described in detail in Chapter 68.

Problematic hot flashes have been treated with venlafaxine (Effexor), paroxetine (Paxil), gabapentin (Neurontin), and clonidine (Catapres). These medications have been found to reduce hot flashes and are alternatives for women who do not wish to use HRT. The web site of the North American Menopause Society (http://www.menopause.org) provides additional suggestions.

Vitamin B in doses of less than 200 mg has been found to relieve some distressing menopausal symptoms. Vitamin E has been effective in decreasing hot flashes for many women. Some women are interested in alternative treatments (eg, natural estrogens and progestins, black cohosh, ginseng, dong quai, soy products, and several other herbal preparations); however, few scientific data exist about the safety or effectiveness of these remedies. Assessment of menopausal patients should include their use of complementary and alternative therapies and supplements. Medications, including alendronate (Fosamax), raloxifene (Evista), and calcitonin, for the treatment of osteoporosis have given women another option in preventing or treating this major health problem.

The American Heart Association (2002) suggests the use of established methods of treatment to lower heart disease risk in women. These include lifestyle changes and behavioral strategies. Pharmacologic therapy (eg, aspirin, beta blockers, statins, angiostatin-converting enzyme inhibitors) may be indicated in women who have cardiovascular disease or are at high risk for it. See Chapter 26 for a more detailed discussion of treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

\section*{BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES}

Regular physical exercise, including weight-bearing exercise, raises the heart rate, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and helps to maintain bone mass. It may also reduce stress, enhance well-being, and improve self-image. Loss of muscle tissue is mediated by exercise; weight-bearing exercise (eg, walking, jogging) at least four times a week is recommended.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

Women should also be encouraged to decrease caloric intake, decrease fat intake, and increase intake of whole grains, fiber, fruit, and vegetables. Women of all ages are urged to include high-calcium food in their diets daily. For example, 1 cup of milk contains about 300 mg of calcium, and 1 cup of nonfat yogurt provides 415 mg of
calcium. Other sources of dietary calcium include most green leafy vegetables, seafood, and calcium-fortified foods.

Calcium supplementation may be helpful in reducing bone loss and preventing the morbidity associated with fractures secondary to osteoporosis. Bones serve as a storehouse of the body's calcium, and bone density decreases with age. When calcium levels in the blood are low, the bones give up calcium to maintain homeostasis. Women of all age groups often ingest less than the recommended amount of calcium. The average calcium intake is 300 to $500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day , whereas the recommended amount is $1,300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for adolescents and young adults, $1,000 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for adults 19 to 50 years of age, $1,200 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for adults 51 years of age and older (including menopausal women taking HRT), and $1,500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for women who are menopausal and not taking HRT (National Osteoporosis Foundation, 1999; NIH Consensus Statement, 2001).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nurses can encourage women to view menopause as a natural change resulting in freedom from menses and symptoms related to hormonal changes. No relationship exists between menopause and mental health problems; however, social circumstances
(eg, adolescent children, ill partners, and dependent or ill parents) that usually coincide with menopause may produce stress.

Measures should be taken to promote general health. The nurse can explain to the patient that cessation of menses is a physiologic function that is rarely accompanied by nervous symptoms or illness. The current expected life span after menopause for the average woman is 30 to 35 years, which may encompass as many years as the childbearing phase of her life. Menopause is not a complete change of life, however. Normal sexual urges continue, and women retain their usual response to sex long after menopause. Many women enjoy better health after menopause than before, especially those who have experienced dysmenorrhea. The individual woman's evaluation of herself and her worth, now and in the future, is likely to affect her emotional reaction to menopause. Patient teaching and counseling regarding healthy lifestyles, health promotion, and health screening are of paramount importance (Chart 46-9).

\section*{PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME}

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of symptoms that occur before the menses and subside with the onset of menstrual flow (Chart 46-10). The cause is unknown, but serotonin

\end{tabular}
regulation is currently the most plausible theory. Other hormones may also be involved. Dietary factors may play a role because carbohydrates may affect serotonin. Severe symptoms have been labeled as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (DiCarlo, Palomba, Tommaselli et al., 2001; Morse, 1999). This severe form of PMS, which interferes with the woman's schoolwork, job, or social or family life, is uncommon.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Major symptoms of PMS include headache, fatigue, low back pain, painful breasts, and a feeling of abdominal fullness. General irritability, mood swings, fear of losing control, binge eating, and crying spells may also occur. Symptoms vary widely from one woman to another and from one cycle to the next in the same person. Great variability is found in the degree of symptoms. Many women are affected to some degree, but few are severely affected. Many women are not bothered at all, whereas some experience severe and disabling symptoms (Morse, 1999).

A generally stressful life and problematic relationships may be related to the intensity of physical symptoms. Some women report moderate to severe life disruption secondary to PMS that negatively affects their interpersonal relationships. PMS may also be a factor in reduced productivity, work-related accidents, and absenteeism.

Identifying the time when these symptoms occur helps in determining the diagnosis. Symptoms recur regularly at the same phase of each menstrual cycle, usually 1 week to a few days before menses, and subside once the menstrual flow starts.

\section*{Medical Management}

Because there is no single treatment or known cure for PMS, the woman should chart her symptoms so she can possibly anticipate and therefore cope with them. Exercise is encouraged for all patients as noncontrolled studies have shown a benefit. Many practitioners advise women to avoid caffeine, high-fat foods, and refined sugars, but there is little research to demonstrate the efficacy of dietary changes. Alternative therapies that women have used include vitamins B and E, magnesium, and oil of evening
primrose capsules. No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these therapies.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Pharmacologic remedies include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine [Prozac, Sarafem]), gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, prostaglandin inhibitors (eg, ibuprofen and naproxen [Anaprox]), and antianxiety agents. Some clinicians prescribe analgesic agents, diuretic medications, and natural and synthetic progesterones, although the long-term risks of progesterone use are unknown. Many women find over-the-counter carbohydrate products useful; they provide complex carbohydrates along with vitamins and minerals. Ratios of serum levels of tryptophan to other amino acids are elevated in patients who use tryptophan. It may relieve psychological symptoms and food cravings. Calcium ( $1,200 \mathrm{mg} /$ day $)$ has been found to be effective, as has magnesium ( 200 to $400 \mathrm{mg} /$ day ).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse should establish rapport with the patient and obtain a health history, noting the time when symptoms began and their nature and intensity. The nurse then determines whether the onset of symptoms occurs before or shortly after the menstrual flow begins. Additionally, the nurse can show the patient how to develop a chart to record the timing and intensity of symptoms. A nutritional history is also elicited to determine if the diet is high in salt, caffeine, or alcohol or low in essential nutrients.

The patient's goals may include reduction of anxiety (mood swings, crying, binge eating, fear of losing control), ability to cope with day-to-day stressors and relationships with family and coworkers, and increased knowledge about PMS with improved use of control measures.

Positive coping measures are facilitated. Partners can be advised to assist by offering support and increased involvement with childcare. The patient can try to plan her working time to accommodate the days she will be less productive because of PMS. The nurse encourages the patient to use exercise, meditation, imagery, and creative activities to reduce stress. The nurse also encourages the patient to take medications as prescribed and pro-
vides instructions about the desired effects of the medications. Enrolling in a PMS group that meets to discuss problems may help the patient learn that others recognize and understand what she is experiencing.

If the patient has severe symptoms of PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the nurse assesses her for suicidal, uncontrollable, and violent behavior. Any suggestions of suicidal tendencies must be evaluated by psychiatric consultation immediately. Uncontrollable behavior may lead to violence toward family members. If abuse of children or other members of the patient's family is suspected, reporting protocols are implemented and followed. Referral is made for immediate psychiatric or psychological care and counseling.

\section*{DYSMENORRHEA}

Primary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation, with no identifiable pelvic pathology. It occurs at the time of menarche or shortly thereafter. It is characterized by crampy pain that begins before or shortly after the onset of menstrual flow and continues for 48 to 72 hours. Pelvic examination findings are normal. Dysmenorrhea is thought to result from excessive production of prostaglandins, which causes painful contraction of the uterus and arteriolar vasospasm. Psychological factors, such as anxiety and tension, may also contribute to dysmenorrhea. As women grow older, dysmenorrhea often decreases and frequently completely resolves after childbirth.

In secondary dysmenorrhea, pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, tumor, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) exists. Patients with secondary dysmenorrhea frequently have pain that occurs several days before menses, with ovulation, and occasionally with intercourse.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A complete pelvic examination is performed to rule out possible abnormalities, such as strictures of the cervix or vagina, an imperforate hymen, or other conditions, such as endometriosis, PID, adenomyosis, and fibroid uterus. A laparoscopy is usually required to identify organic causes.

\section*{Management}

In primary dysmenorrhea, the reason for the discomfort is explained, and the patient is assured that menstruation is a normal function of the reproductive system. If the patient is young and accompanied by her mother, the mother may also need reassurance. Many young women expect to have painful periods if their mothers did. The discomfort of cramps can be treated once anxiety and concern over its cause are dispelled by adequate explanation. Symptoms usually subside with appropriate medication. Aspirin, a mild prostaglandin inhibitor, may be taken at recommended doses every 4 hours. Other useful prostaglandin antagonists include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn), and mefenamic acid (Ponstel). Rofecoxib (Vioxx), a COX-2 inhibitor, may also be used. If one medication does not provide relief, another may be recommended. Usually these medications are well tolerated, but some women experience gastrointestinal side effects. Contraindications include allergy, peptic ulcer history, sensitivity to aspirin-like medications, asthma, and pregnancy. Low-dose oral contraceptives provide relief in more than $90 \%$ of patients and are indicated in
women with dysmenorrhea who are sexually active but do not desire a pregnancy.

Continuous low-level local heat has recently been found to be effective in treating primary dysmenorrhea and may be as effective as medication (Akin, Weingand, Hengehold et al., 2001). The mechanism is not clear, but heat may counteract the activity of hormones that cause the uterus to contract. Heat is a vasodilator that increases blood flow and may counteract constriction and muscle contraction. Heat therapy and medication have been found to work well in combination.

The patient is encouraged to continue her usual activities and to increase physical exercise if possible, as this seems to relieve discomfort for some women. Taking analgesic agents before cramps start, in anticipation of discomfort, is advised.

Management of secondary dysmenorrhea is directed at diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause (eg, endometriosis or PID). The same analgesic agents used for primary dysmenorrhea may be part of the management of secondary dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis.

\section*{AMENORRHEA}

Amenorrhea (absence of menstrual flow) is a symptom of a variety of disorders and dysfunctions. Primary amenorrhea (delayed menarche) refers to the situation in which a young woman older than 16 has not begun to menstruate but otherwise shows evidence of sexual maturation, or when a young woman has not begun to menstruate and has not begun to show development of secondary sex characteristics by 14 years of age. Amenorrhea may be of considerable concern but is usually due to minor variations in body build, heredity, environment, and physical, mental, and emotional development.

The nurse allows the patient to express her concerns and anxiety about this problem, because the patient may feel that she is different from her peers. A complete physical examination, careful health history, and simple laboratory tests help to rule out possible causes, such as physiologic disorders, metabolic or endocrine difficulties, and systemic diseases. Treatment is directed toward correcting any abnormalities.

Secondary amenorrhea (an absence of menses for three cycles or 6 months after a normal menarche) may be caused by pregnancy, tension, emotional upset, or stress. In an adolescent, secondary amenorrhea is usually caused by minor emotional upset related to being away from home, attending college, tension due to schoolwork, or interpersonal problems. The second most common cause, however, is pregnancy, so a pregnancy test is almost always indicated.

Secondary nutritional disturbances may also be factors. Obesity can result in anovulation and subsequent amenorrhea. Eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, are characterized by lack of menses because the decrease in body fat and caloric intake affects hormonal function. Competitive female athletes typically experience amenorrhea and are frequently placed on HRT to prevent bone loss related to low estrogen levels. On occasion, a pituitary or thyroid dysfunction may cause amenorrhea. These dysfunctions can be treated successfully by treatment of the underlying endocrine disorder. Infrequent periods (oligomenorrhea) may be related to thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or premature ovarian failure. Again, evaluation by a primary health care provider is necessary.

\section*{ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING}

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is abnormal bleeding that does not have a known organic cause. This can occur at any age but is most common at opposite ends of the reproductive life span. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is defined as irregular, painless bleeding of endometrial origin that may be excessive, prolonged, or without pattern. It is usually secondary to anovulation (lack of ovulation) and is common in adolescents and women approaching menopause. Adolescents account for many cases of abnormal uterine bleeding since they often do not ovulate as their pituitary-ovarian axis matures. Perimenopausal women also experience this condition due to irregular ovulation because of their decreasing ovarian hormone production. The remaining causes are often related to cysts, obesity, or hypothalamic dysfunction.

Abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding that is atypical in time or amount must be evaluated because it may be a manifestation of a major, life-threatening disorder. Physical examination is performed and the patient is evaluated for conditions such as pregnancy, neoplasm, infection, anatomic abnormalities, endocrine disorders, trauma, blood dyscrasias, platelet dysfunction, and hypothalamic disorders. Women of any age require evaluation for a specific cause of uterine bleeding. Pregnancy testing and hormonal evaluation are usually part of the initial assessment. Treatment usually consists of hormones or oral contraceptives.

\section*{Menorrhagia}

Menorrhagia is defined as prolonged or excessive bleeding at the time of the regular menstrual flow. In early life the cause is usually related to endocrine disturbance, whereas in later life it usually results from inflammatory disturbances, tumors of the uterus, or hormonal imbalance. Emotional disturbances may also affect bleeding.

The nurse encourages a woman with menorrhagia to see her primary health care provider and to describe the amount of bleeding by pad count and saturation (ie, absorbency of perineal pad or tampon and number saturated hourly). Persistent heavy bleeding can result in anemia.

\section*{Metrorrhagia}

Metrorrhagia (vaginal bleeding between regular menstrual periods) is probably the most significant form of menstrual dysfunction because it may signal cancer, benign tumors of the uterus, or other gynecologic problems. This condition warrants early diagnosis and treatment. Although bleeding between menstrual periods by a woman taking oral contraceptives is usually not serious, irregular bleeding by a woman taking HRT should be evaluated. Menometrorrhagia is heavy vaginal bleeding between and during periods and requires evaluation.

\section*{Postmenopausal Bleeding}

Bleeding 1 year after menses cease at menopause must be investigated, and a malignant condition must be considered until proved otherwise. An endometrial biopsy or a D \& C is indicated. A vaginal ultrasound can also be used in postmenopausal bleeding to measure the thickness of the endometrial lining. The uterine lining in postmenopausal women should be thin because of low estrogen levels. A lining thicker than 5 mm usually warrants evaluation by endometrial biopsy.

\section*{Management of Normal and Altered Female Reproductive Function}

\section*{DYSPAREUNIA}

Dyspareunia (difficult or painful intercourse) is increasing in incidence and can be superficial, deep, primary, or secondary. This problem can be embarrassing for women to discuss because they may believe that it is their problem if their partner is not experiencing discomfort. Dyspareunia may occur at the beginning of, during, or after intercourse and may be related to injury during childbirth, lack of lubrication, a history of incest, sexual abuse, or assault, endometriosis, pelvic infection, vaginal atrophy with menopause, gastrointestinal disorders, fibroids, urinary tract infection, STDs, or vulvodynia (vulvar pain that affects women of all ages without any discernible physical cause). Because dyspareunia is often due to lack of vaginal lubrication, use of vaginal lubricants can be suggested. Depending on the cause of dyspareunia, antidepressants may be prescribed in selected patients, and surgery to expand or repair the vaginal opening is occasionally needed.

\section*{CONTRACEPTION}

Each year, more than half of the pregnancies in the United States are unintended (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999). Although unintended pregnancies occur in women of all ages, incomes, and racial and ethnic groups, the highest rates occur among adolescents, lower-income women, and AfricanAmerican women (U.S. Surgeon General, 2001). Adolescents are more likely to experience pregnancy complications and are more prone to have low-birthweight babies. Teen mothers are less likely to obtain a high school diploma and are more likely to live in poverty. Of women undergoing abortions, many did not use contraception in the month they became pregnant, while others never use any method. It seems that women often fail to use effective methods consistently or at all. Nurses can assist with information and support. Women sometimes fear that they will get cancer and fear other risks from contraception. Women often report using their contraceptive method inconsistently, which makes all methods less effective.

Many women who are sexually active or who are considering becoming sexually active can benefit from learning about contraception. Fewer unwanted pregnancies may reduce the number of abortions, abused children, stressed families, and infant mortality and morbidity. It is important that women receive unbiased and nonjudgmental information, understand the benefits and risks of each method, learn about alternatives and how to use them, and receive positive reinforcement and acceptance of their choice.

Nurses involved in helping patients make contraceptive choices need to listen, educate, spend time answering questions, and assist patients in choosing the method they prefer. Methods and practices to prevent unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and births are described in subsequent sections of this chapter.

\section*{Abstinence}

Abstinence, or celibacy, is the only completely effective means of preventing pregnancy. Abstinence may not be a desired or available option for many women because of cultural expectations and their own and their partner's values and sexual needs.

\section*{Sterilization}

After abstinence, sterilization by bilateral tubal occlusion or vasectomy is the most effective means of contraception. Both procedures must be considered permanent because neither is easily reversible. Women and men who choose these methods should be certain that they have completed their childbearing, no matter how the circumstances in their life may change. Often, decisions are made that may be regretted later. Some gynecologists suggest a waiting period to ensure that the patient is certain about a potentially irreversible decision. See Chapter 49 for a discussion of vasectomy (male sterilization).

\section*{TUBAL LIGATION}

Female sterilization by tubal ligation is one of the most common operations performed on women. More than 600,000 tubal ligations are performed in the United States every year (Jamieson, Hillis, Duerr et al., 2000). Tubal ligation is usually performed as a same-day surgical procedure. The procedure is carried out by laparoscopy, with the patient receiving a general or local anesthetic. The laparoscope, a small periscope-like optical instrument, is inserted through a small umbilical incision. Carbon dioxide is introduced to lift other abdominal organs away from the tubal area. The fallopian tubes are visualized and may be coagulated, sutured (Pomeroy procedure), or ligated with a rubber band or a spring clip, thereby disrupting their patency. Many sterilizations are performed with bipolar coagulation. Silicone bands and spring clips are also being used. Spring clips have the highest rate of pregnancy following sterilization. A new procedure, selective tubal occlusion procedure, uses a 0.6 -inch metal coil or spring that is inserted into the fallopian tubes through the cervix, thus avoiding the need for laparoscopy or a surgical incision (Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, 2002). This method works by inducing obstruction of the tubes by scar tissue.

Despite a very high rate of effectiveness, any woman who has undergone tubal ligation but misses a period should be tested for pregnancy because ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies, although rare, may occur. Ovulation and menstruation are not affected by sterilization, although some women report heavier menstrual
bleeding and more cramping after tubal ligation. Vasectomy and laparoscopic tubal ligation are compared in Chart 46-11.

Before undergoing tubal ligation, the patient should be informed that an IUD, if present, will be removed. If the patient is taking oral contraceptives, she usually continues them up to the time of the procedure. Postoperatively, women may experience abdominal or shoulder discomfort for a few days, related to the carbon dioxide gas and the manipulation of organs. The woman is instructed to report heavy bleeding, fever, or pain that persists or increases. The patient should avoid intercourse, strenuous exercise, and lifting for 2 weeks. Risks of the procedure are minimal and are more often related to the anesthesia than to the surgery itself. Risk is increased in women with diabetes, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, or obesity.

\section*{Oral Contraceptives}

Oral contraceptive preparations of synthetic estrogen (estradiol) and progesterone (desogestrel, ethynodiol diacetate, levonorgestrel, norethindrone, norethindrone acetate or norgestrel) are currently used by many women. They block ovarian stimulation by preventing the release of FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. In the absence of FSH, a follicle does not ripen, and ovulation does not occur. This is the mechanism of action of oral contraceptives. Progestins (synthetic forms of progesterone) suppress the LH surge, prevent ovulation, and also render the cervical mucus impenetrable to sperm. Synthetic estrogens and progestin, found in the many oral contraceptive variations available, differ in androgenic activity (Chart 46-12).

\section*{BENEFITS AND RISKS}

In general, no definite long-term undesirable effects have been observed with prolonged oral contraceptive use. Resumption of normal menses is delayed 2 to 3 months in about $20 \%$ of oral contraceptive users. Venous thromboembolism has occurred with use of oral contraceptives, but it occurs less now than years ago, when estrogen concentrations in oral contraceptives were higher. Venous thromboembolism is less than half as likely to occur with oral contraceptives than with pregnancy. Desogestrel, a new progestin,

There are two kinds of oral contraceptives: combined and progestin only. Combined pills consist of an estrogen and a progestin. The result of both types of medications is a lighter-than-normal menstrual flow after the contraceptives are taken for 21 days and then stopped for 7 days. The flow is actually withdrawal bleeding from discontinuing hormones because a normal period occurs only with ovulation. Most women using oral contraceptives take the combination medication.

\section*{Combined Preparations}
- Each dose contains estrogen and progestin.
- Monophasic preparations supply a constant dose of estrogen and progestin.
- Biphasic preparations are available; they contain a constant amount of estrogen, with an increase in the progestin on day 10 .
- Triphasic preparations are available; they provide varying low doses of estrogen along with progesterone during the 21-day cycle. This variation provides an effective contraceptive that mimics the normal cycle and has enough progesterone to prevent ovulation and spotting.

\section*{Progestin-Only "Mini" Preparations}
- Each dose contains progestin only (estrogen is not contained in a progestin-only preparation).
- Preparation provides less protection against conception than combined preparations.
- About $40 \%$ of women taking progestin only have ovulatory cycles.
- Progestin only is useful for women who have had estrogen-related side effects on combination pills (eg, headaches, hypertension, leg pain, chloasma or skin discoloration, weight gain, or nausea).
- Progestin-only preparations are useful for lactating women who need a hormonal contraceptive method.
may be slightly more likely to be associated with venous thromboembolism, but the risk is still very low. Gallbladder problems (eg, cholestasis) may occur. Fetal anomalies do not appear to be a concern, and normal reproductive tract function and fertility are restored after oral contraceptive use is discontinued. However, most health care providers recommend that women use a barrier contraceptive method for 1 to 2 months after stopping the pill before becoming pregnant so that the accurate date of the last menstrual period is available to date the pregnancy.

Some of the benefits of using oral contraceptives include a reduction in the incidence of benign breast disease, improvement in acne, reduced risk of uterine and ovarian cancers, anemia, and pelvic infection.

> NURSING ALERT Patients need to be aware that oral contraceptives protect them from pregnancy but not from STDs or HIV infection. In addition, sex with multiple partners or sex without a condom may also result in chlamydial and other infections, including HIV infection.

A few patients experience adverse reactions when using oral contraceptives. These include nausea, depression, headache, weight gain, leg cramps, and breast soreness. Usually, these symptoms subside after 3 or 4 months. Because such symptoms are sometimes related to sodium and water retention caused by estrogen, a smaller dose of the hormone or a different hormonal combination may alleviate the problem. Many patients experi-
ence spotting in the first month taking the pill or if they take it irregularly, so they need to be reassured and advised to take a pill every 24 hours, as prescribed. Chart 46-13 describes the benefits and risks of oral contraceptive use.

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS}

Absolute contraindications include current or past thromboembolic disorder, cerebrovascular disease, or artery disease; known or suspected breast cancer; known or suspected current or past estrogen-dependent neoplasia; pregnancy; current or past benign or malignant liver tumor; impaired liver function; congenital hyperlipidemia; and undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Relative contraindications include hypertension, bile-induced jaundice, acute phase of mononucleosis, and sickle cell disease. Women older than 35 who smoke are at risk for cardiac problems and should not use oral contraceptives. Occasionally, neuroocular complications arise, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. If visual disturbances occur, oral contraceptives should be discontinued (Chart 46-14).

Some gynecologists allow patients with migraine headaches to take oral contraceptives if the headaches do not worsen with use or so long as the patient has no neurologic symptoms. (A young woman who has blurred vision with a migraine will probably be discouraged from taking oral contraceptives.) Diabetes is also problematic, although some diabetes specialists allow their patients to use oral contraceptives with careful glucose monitoring. Leiomyomas (fibroid tumors) of the uterus can enlarge with oral contraceptive use. Patients with this condition are advised and monitored carefully; if fibroids enlarge, they are advised to discontinue oral contraceptives and choose another contraceptive method.

\section*{Injectable Contraceptives}

\section*{DEPO-PROVERA}

An intramuscular injection of Depo-Provera, a long-acting progestin, every 3 months inhibits ovulation and provides a reliable

\section*{Chart 46-13 - PHARMACOLOGY \\ Benefits and Risks of Oral Contraceptives}
- Decreased cramps and bleeding
- Regular bleeding cycle
- Decreased incidence of anemia
- Decrease in acne with some formulations
- Protection from uterine and ovarian cancer
- Decreased incidence of ectopic pregnancy
- Protection from benign breast disease
- Decreased incidence of pelvic infection

Risks
- Rare in healthy women
- Bothersome side effects (eg, breakthrough bleeding, breast tenderness)
- Nausea, weight gain, mood changes
- Small increased risk of developing blood clots, stroke, or heart attack, related more to smoking than to oral contraceptive use alone
- Possible increased incidence of benign liver tumors and gallbladder problems
- No protection from STDs (possible increased risk with unsafe sex)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-402.jpg?height=495&width=864&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=202)
and convenient contraceptive method. It can be used by lactating women and those with hypertension, liver disease, migraine headaches, heart disease, and hemoglobinopathies. Women who use this method must be prepared for irregular or no bleeding. With continued use, irregular bleeding episodes and spotting decrease, and amenorrhea usually occurs.

Advantages include reduction of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and anemia. It may reduce the risk of pelvic infection and has been associated with improvement in hematologic status in women with anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding and women with sickle cell disease; it has also been associated with a reduced frequency of seizures in women with seizure disorders. It also reduces the risk of endometrial cancer (ACOG Technical Bulletin \#198, 1995).

Potential disadvantages include irregular menstrual bleeding, bloating, headaches, hair loss, decreased sex drive, and weight loss or weight gain. Fertility may be delayed when women discontinue this method; therefore, other methods of contraception may be more appropriate for the woman who wishes to conceive within a year of discontinuing contraception.

Depo-Provera is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and those who have abnormal vaginal bleeding of unknown cause, breast or pelvic cancer, or sensitivity to synthetic progestin. The long-term effects on the infant of a nursing mother who uses DepoProvera are unknown but are thought to be negligible. DepoProvera does not protect against STDs. Bone density is temporarily decreased while using this method, but this does not seem to be a long-term health risk.

\section*{LUNELLE}

Lunelle, a contraceptive that is a combination of medroxyprogesterone (progestin) and estradiol (estrogen), has been shown to be very effective at preventing pregnancy in clinical trials. An intramuscular injection is administered every 28 to 30 days. It provides immediate efficacy if given within the first 5 days following the start of a normal menstrual period. Return to ovulation occurs more quickly than with Depo-Provera, usually within 2 to 4 months. The contraindications and cautions are the same as those for oral contraceptives. Effectiveness depends on the woman's compliance with the regimen. Similar to other nonbarrier contraceptive methods, Lunelle does not protect against HIV infection or other STDs. Light, regular monthly bleeding occurs.

\section*{Implant Contraceptive}

The Norplant system is a reversible, low-dose, progestin-only contraceptive device consisting of several soft Silastic capsules or implants that are inserted under the skin of the woman's upper
arm. The implant releases the progestin levonorgestrel over 5 years, thereby inhibiting ovulation. While still FDA-approved, it is anticipated that Norplant will not be available in the future. However, additional implant contraceptives are expected to become available in the near future. Contraindications to using these systems are acute liver disease or liver tumors, pregnancy, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer, and a history of thrombophlebitis or pulmonary embolism.

Common side effects include irregular bleeding, weight gain, acne, and hair growth or hair loss. If patients are aware of these disadvantages and side effects, they are more likely to tolerate the implant and continue using it. The patient should report headaches or visual symptoms to a health care provider because rare instances of idiopathic intracranial hypertension have been associated with the implant. Papilledema must be ruled out if headaches occur.

Insertion, minor surgery that is relatively painless, is performed under aseptic conditions in an outpatient setting such as an office or clinic. A small incision is made in the inner upper arm after the patient receives a local anesthetic. The capsule or capsules are inserted within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle to avoid the possibility of a preexisting pregnancy. The contraceptive effect occurs within 24 hours and lasts for 5 years. Insertion usually takes about 15 minutes. Although the implants can be removed at any time, it can be a more difficult and lengthy procedure because over time tissue encapsulates the implants. Women who have regular bleeding with an implant method are at higher risk for pregnancy and should be counseled to have a pregnancy test if the regular bleeding stops.

\section*{New Hormonal Methods of Contraception}

Two new hormonal methods of contraception are Ortho Evra and NuvaRing. Ortho Evra is a thin, beige, matchbook-sized square that releases an estrogen and a progestin continuously. It is changed every week for 3 weeks. The fourth week is patch-free, producing withdrawal bleeding. The effectiveness of Ortho Evra is comparable to that of oral contraceptives. Its risks are similar to those of oral contraceptives and include an increased risk of blood clots. The patch may be applied to the torso, chest, arms, or thighs; it should not be applied to the breasts.

NuvaRing is a vaginal ring that is inserted in the vaginal for 3 weeks and then removed, resulting in withdrawal bleeding. It is as effective as oral contraceptives and has the same risks. It is flexible, does not require sizing or fitting, and is effective when placed anywhere in the vagina.

Although both of these contraceptive methods increase the options for women, neither protects against STDs. Women using these methods should be instructed not to smoke. Chart 46-15 lists hormonal methods of birth control approved by the FDA.

\section*{Intrauterine Device}

An IUD is a small plastic device, usually T -shaped, that is inserted into the uterine cavity to prevent pregnancy. A string attached to the IUD is visible and palpable at the cervical os. An IUD prevents conception by causing a local inflammatory reaction that is toxic to spermatozoa and blastocysts, thus preventing fertilization. The IUD does not work by causing abortion.

Paraguard, a copper-bearing IUD, is effective for 10 years. Copper has an antispermatic effect. The Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS; Mirena) is an IUD that releases levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestin used in oral contraceptives, and has been found to reduce heavy bleeding. Limited studies
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-403.jpg?height=623&width=863&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=112)
show that IUDs may prevent the need for hysterectomy in some women by reducing bleeding, may be an adjunct in HRT, may protect women from endometrial cancer, and may prevent cervical cancer.

The IUD method is effective over a long time, appears to have no systemic effects, and reduces the possibility of patient error. This reversible method of birth control is as effective as oral contraceptives and more effective than barrier methods.

Disadvantages include possible excessive bleeding, cramps, and backaches and a slight risk of tubal pregnancy, pelvic infection, displacement of the device, and, rarely, perforation of the cervix and uterus. If a pregnancy occurs with an IUD in place, the device is removed immediately to avoid infection. Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) may occur on removal. An IUD is not usually used in women who have not had children because the nulliparous uterus may be too small to tolerate it. Women with multiple partners, women with heavy or crampy periods, or those with a history of ectopic pregnancy or pelvic infection are encouraged to use other methods. Some clinicians test for chlamydia and gonorrhea prior to insertion to prevent PID.

\section*{Mechanical Barriers}

\section*{DIAPHRAGM}

The diaphragm is an effective contraceptive device that consists of a round, flexible spring ( 50 to 90 mm wide) covered with a dome-like latex rubber cup. A spermicidal (contraceptive) jelly or cream is used to coat the concave side of the diaphragm before it is inserted deep into the vagina, covering the cervix. The diaphragm is a spermicide holder; the spermicide inhibits spermatozoa from entering the cervical canal. The diaphragm is not felt by the user or her partner when properly fitted and inserted. Because women vary in size, the diaphragm must be sized and fitted by an experienced clinician. The woman is instructed in using and caring for the device. A return demonstration ensures that the woman can insert the diaphragm correctly and that it covers the cervix.

Each time that the woman uses the diaphragm, she should examine it carefully. By holding it up to a bright light, she can ensure that there are no pinpoint holes, cracks, or tears in the diaphragm. Spermicidal jelly or cream is applied, and the diaphragm is then positioned to cover the cervix completely. The diaphragm should remain in place at least 6 hours (but no more than 12 hours) after coitus. Additional spermicide is applied if
more than 6 hours have passed before intercourse occurs and before each act of intercourse. On removal, the diaphragm is cleansed thoroughly with mild soap and water, rinsed, and dried before it is stored in its original container.

Disadvantages include allergic reactions in those who are sensitive to latex and an increased incidence of urinary tract infections. Toxic shock syndrome has been reported in some diaphragm users.

NURSING ALERT The nurse must assess the woman for possible latex allergy because use of latex barrier methods may cause severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients with latex allergy.

\section*{CERVICAL CAP}

The cervical cap is much smaller ( 22 to 35 mm ) than the diaphragm and covers only the cervix; it is used with a spermicide. If a woman can feel her cervix, she can usually learn to use a cervical cap. The chief advantage is that the cap may be left in place for 2 days.

Although convenient to use, the cervical cap may cause cervical irritation; therefore, before fitting a cap, most clinicians obtain a Pap smear and repeat the smear after 3 months. The cap can stay in place for 48 hours and does not require additional spermicide for repeated acts of intercourse.

\section*{FEMALE CONDOM}

The female condom was developed to provide women with protection from STDs and HIV as well as pregnancy. The female condom (Reality) consists of a cylinder of polyurethane enclosed at one end by a closed ring that covers the cervix and at the other end by an open ring that covers the perineum (Fig. 46-8). Advantages include some degree of protection from STDs (HPV, herpes simplex

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
virus, and HIV). Disadvantages include the inability to use the female condom with some coital positions (ie, standing).

\section*{SPERMICIDES}

Spermicides are available over the counter as foams, gels, and inserts and on condoms. Spermicides are effective, relatively inexpensive chemical contraceptives when used with condoms. When used alone, spermicide is better than no contraception at all; it can be used without a partner's cooperation and may provide protection from gonorrhea and chlamydia. Burning, a rash, or irritation can develop in either partner and is usually temporary. Changing to another brand of spermicide often alleviates the problem. Spermicides are made from nonoxynol-9 or octoxynol. Nonoxynol-9 has been found to be associated with minute tears in vaginal tissue with frequent use, possibly increasing the possibility of contracting HIV from an infected partner (Stephenson, 2000). It also may increase the risk of latex allergy when used with a condom by leaching out a natural rubber protein from the latex (Greydanus, Patel \& Rimsza, 2001).

\section*{MALE CONDOM}

The male condom is an impermeable, snug-fitting cover applied to the erect penis before it enters the vaginal canal. The tip of the condom is pinched while being applied to leave space for ejaculate. If no space is left, ejaculation may cause a tear or hole in the condom and reduce its effectiveness. The penis, with the condom held in place, is removed from the vagina while still erect to prevent the ejaculate from leaking.

The condom is an effective method when used with contraceptive foam. The latex condom also creates a barrier against transmission of STDs, especially gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and HIV. Natural condoms (those made from animal tissue), however, do not protect against HIV infection. The nurse needs to reassure women that they have a right to insist on their male partner using a condom and a right to refuse sex without condoms, although women in abusive relationships may increase their risk for abuse by doing so. Some women are buying and carrying condoms with them to be certain that one is available. Nurses should be familiar and comfortable with instructions about using a condom because many women need to know about this way of protecting themselves from HIV and other STDs.

During patient teaching about barrier methods of contraception, nurses need to consider the possibility of latex allergy for themselves and their patients. Contact dermatitis is often the first symptom of latex allergy. Swelling and itching can also occur. Possible warning signs of latex allergy include oral itching after blowing up a balloon or eating kiwis, bananas, pineapples, passion fruits, avocados, or chestnuts. Because many contraceptives are made of latex, patients who experience burning or itching while using a latex contraceptive are instructed to see their primary health care provider. Alternatives to latex condoms may include the female (Reality) and male (Avanti) condoms made of polyurethane.

Condoms do not provide complete protection from STDs, as the HPV virus may be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact. Other STDs may be transmitted if any abraded skin is exposed to body fluids. This information should be included in patient teaching.

\section*{Coitus Interruptus}

Coitus interruptus (removing the penis from the vagina before ejaculation) requires careful control by the male. Although it is a frequently used method of preventing pregnancy, it is considered an unreliable method of contraception.

\section*{Rhythm and Natural Methods}

Natural family planning is any method of conception regulation that is based on awareness of signs and symptoms of fertility during a menstrual cycle. The advantages of natural contraceptive methods include the following: (1) they are not hazardous to health, (2) they are inexpensive, and (3) they are approved by some religions. The disadvantage is that they require discipline by the couple, who must monitor the menstrual cycle and abstain from sex during the fertile phase. In addition, the rhythm method of contraception can be difficult to use because it relies on the woman determining her time of ovulation and on avoiding intercourse during the fertile period. The fertile phase (which requires sexual abstinence) is estimated to occur about 14 days before menstruation, although it may occur between the 10th and 17 th days. Spermatozoa can fertilize an ovum up to 72 hours after intercourse, and the ovum can be fertilized for 24 hours after leaving the ovary. The pregnancy rate with the rhythm method is about $40 \%$ yearly.

Women who carefully determine their "safe period," based on a precise recording of menstrual dates for at least 1 year, and who follow a carefully worked-out formula may achieve very effective protection. A long abstinence period during each cycle is required. These prerequisites require more time and control than many couples have. Changes in cervical mucus and basal body temperature due to hormonal changes related to ovulation form the scientific basis for the symptothermal method of ovulatory timing. Courses in natural family planning are offered at many Catholic hospitals and some family planning clinics.

Ovulation detection methods (eg, Ovulindex) are available in most pharmacies. The presence of the enzyme guaiacol peroxidase in cervical mucus signals ovulation 6 days beforehand and also affects mucosal viscosity. Test kits are available over the counter and are easy to use and reliable, but they can be expensive. Ovulation prediction kits are more effective for planning conception than for avoiding it.

\section*{Emergency Contraception}

\section*{DOSE OF ESTROGEN/PROGESTIN}

A properly timed, adequate dose of estrogen or estrogen and a progestin after intercourse without birth control, or when a method has failed, can prevent pregnancy by inhibiting or delaying ovulation. This method does not interrupt an established pregnancy. Nurses should be aware of this option and the indications for its use. This method obviously is not suitable for longterm contraception because it is not as effective as daily oral contraceptives or other reliable methods used regularly. However, it is valuable in emergency situations such as rape, a defective or torn condom or diaphragm, or other situations that may present the possibility of unwanted conception. It can be prescribed as Preven (estrogen/progestin) or Plan B (progestin) packages of emergency contraception with patient literature or it can be prescribed as a specific number of contraceptive pills, depending on the medication and dose used.

Usually, a small dose of oral contraceptives (ie, levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol) is given and repeated in 12 hours (called the Yuzpe method after the gynecologist who developed the method). This method must be used not more than 72 hours after intercourse. Nausea, a common side effect, can be minimized by taking the medication with meals and with an antiemetic medication. Other side effects, such as breast soreness and irregular bleeding, may occur but are transient. Any patient using this method should
be advised of the $1.6 \%$ failure rate and counseled about other contraceptive methods. Emergency contraception is related to luteal phase dysfunction, producing an endometrium that is out of phase. There are no known contraindications to the use of this method (Morris \& Young, 2000).

The nurse reviews with the patient instructions for taking the pills based on the medication regimen prescribed. If the woman is breastfeeding, a progestin-only formulation is prescribed. To avoid exposing the infant to synthetic hormones through breast milk, she can manually express milk and bottle-feed for 24 hours after treatment.

The woman's next menstrual period may begin a few days earlier or a few days later than expected, and she needs to be informed of this. The patient must return for a pregnancy test if she has not had a menstrual period in 3 weeks and should be offered another visit to provide a regular method of contraception if she does not have one currently. This medication may also be dispensed by pharmacists without a prescription in some states. All women need to be aware of this option and how to obtain it. Nurses can educate and inform women about it to reduce unwanted pregnancies and abortions. See the list of resources at the end of this chapter for more information on this method.

\section*{POSTCOITAL IUD INSERTION}

Postcoital IUD insertion, another form of emergency contraception, involves insertion of a copper-bearing IUD within 5 days of exposure in women who want this method of contraception; however, it may be inappropriate for some women or if other contraindications exist. The mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought that the IUD interferes with fertilization (Morris \& Young, 2000). The patient may experience discomfort on insertion and heavier menstrual periods and increased cramping. Contraindications include a confirmed or suspected pregnancy or any contraindication to regular copper IUD use. The patient must be informed that there is a risk that insertion of an IUD may disrupt a pregnancy that is already present.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}

Patients who use emergency contraception may be anxious, embarrassed, and lacking information about birth control. Nurses must be supportive and nonjudgmental and provide facts and appropriate patient teaching. If a patient repeatedly uses this method of birth control, she should be informed that the failure rate with this method is higher than with a regularly used method. A toll-free telephone information service (1-888-Not-2Late) operates 24 hours a day in English and Spanish and provides information and referrals to health care providers.

\section*{ABORTION}

Interruption of pregnancy or expulsion of the product of conception before the fetus is viable is called abortion. The fetus is generally considered to be viable any time after the fifth to sixth month of gestation. The term "premature labor" is used when a woman experiences labor after this point in the pregnancy.

\section*{Spontaneous Abortion}

It is estimated that 1 of every 5 to 10 conceptions results in spontaneous abortion. Most of these occur because an abnormality in the fetus makes survival impossible. Other causes may include
systemic diseases, hormonal imbalance, or anatomic abnormalities. If a pregnant woman experiences bleeding and cramping, a threatened abortion is diagnosed because an actual abortion is usually imminent. Spontaneous abortion occurs most commonly in the second or third month of gestation.

There are various kinds of spontaneous abortion, depending on the nature of the process (threatened, inevitable, incomplete, or complete). In a threatened abortion, the cervix does not dilate. With bed rest and conservative treatment, the abortion may be prevented. If it cannot, an abortion is imminent. If only some of the tissue is passed, the abortion is referred to as incomplete. If the fetus and all related tissue are spontaneously evacuated, the abortion is complete.

\section*{HABITUAL ABORTION}

Habitual or recurrent abortion is defined as successive, repeated, spontaneous abortions of unknown cause. As many as $60 \%$ of abortions may result from chromosomal anomalies. After two consecutive abortions, patients are referred for genetic counseling and testing, and other possible causes are explored. If bleeding occurs in these patients, conservative measures, such as bed rest and administering progesterone to support the endometrium, are tried in an attempt to save the pregnancy. Supportive counseling is crucial in this stressful condition. Bed rest, sexual abstinence, a light diet, and no straining on defecation are recommended in an effort to prevent spontaneous abortion. If infection is suspected, antibiotics may be prescribed.

In the condition known as incompetent or dysfunctional cervix, the cervix dilates painlessly in the second trimester of pregnancy, often resulting in a spontaneous abortion. In such cases, a surgical procedure called cervical cerclage may be used to prevent the cervix from dilating prematurely. The procedure involves placing a purse-string suture around the cervix at the level of the internal os. Bed rest is usually advised to keep the weight of the uterus off the cervix.

The patient and her health care providers must be informed that such a suture is in place in this high-risk pregnancy. About 2 to 3 weeks before term or the onset of labor, the suture is cut. Delivery is usually by cesarean section.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

After a spontaneous abortion, all tissue passed vaginally is saved for examination. The patient and all personnel caring for her are alerted to save any discharged material. In the rare case of heavy bleeding, the patient may require blood component transfusions and fluid replacement. An estimate of the bleeding volume can be determined by recording the number of perineal pads and the degree of saturation over 24 hours. When an incomplete abortion occurs, oxytocin may be prescribed to cause uterine contractions before dilation and evacuation (D \& E) or uterine suctioning.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}

Because patients experience loss and anxiety, emotional support and understanding are important aspects of nursing care. The response of the woman who desperately wants a baby is very different from that of the woman who does not want to be pregnant but may be frightened by the possible consequences of an abortion.

The nurse must be aware that the woman having a spontaneous abortion often experiences a grieving period. The grieving
may be delayed and may cause other problems until resolved. The many reasons for a delayed grief reaction include the following: friends may not have known the woman was pregnant; the woman may not have seen the lost fetus and can only imagine the gender, size, and characteristics of the child who never developed; there is usually no burial service; and those who know about the loss (family, friends, caregivers) may encourage denial by rarely talking about the loss or by discouraging the woman from crying.

Providing opportunities for the patient to talk and express her emotions helps and also provides clues for the nurse in planning more specific care. Those closest to the woman are encouraged to give emotional support and to allow her to talk and freely express her grief. Unresolved grief may manifest itself in persistent vivid memories of the events surrounding the loss, persistent sadness or anger, and episodes of overwhelming emotion when recalling the loss. Dysfunctional grief may require the assistance of a skilled therapist.

\section*{Elective Abortion}

A voluntary induced termination of pregnancy is called an elective abortion and is usually performed by skilled health care providers. In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade ruled that decisions about abortion reside with a woman and her physician in the first trimester. During the second trimester, the state may regulate practice in the interest of a woman's health and during the final weeks of pregnancy may choose to protect the life of the fetus, except when necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.

Legislation has been passed to increase access to abortion clinics and to prevent violence toward those who work in such facilities.

The rate of abortion, steady from 1980 to 1990, decreased $15 \%$ from 1990 to 1995. Rates since then have been the lowest since 1975 (Zapka, Lemon, Peerson et al., 2001). However, the rate has increased among the following groups of females: unmarried Caucasian girls under age 15, unmarried non-Caucasian girls ages 15 to 19, and married non-Caucasian women ages 20 to 24 . The U.S. rates of abortion are among the highest in the industrialized Western world. These numbers point out the need for nurses to provide contraceptive education and counseling. Elective abortions may be carried out in many different ways (Chart 46-16).

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

Before the procedure is performed, a nurse or counselor trained in pregnancy counseling explores with the patient her fears, feelings, and options. After the patient's choice is identified (ie, continuing pregnancy and parenthood; continuing pregnancy followed by adoption; or terminating pregnancy by abortion), a pelvic examination is performed to determine uterine size. Laboratory studies before an abortion must include a pregnancy test to confirm the pregnancy, hematocrit to rule out anemia, Rh determination, and an STD screen. A patient with anemia may need an iron supplement, and an Rh-negative patient may require RhoGAM to prevent isoimmunization. Before the procedure, all patients should be screened for STDs to prevent introducing pathogens upward through the cervix during the procedure.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}

Patient teaching is an important aspect of care for women who elect to terminate a pregnancy. A woman undergoing elective abortion is informed about what the procedure entails and the expected course after the procedure. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after the procedure and is instructed in recognizing and reporting signs and symptoms of complications (ie, fever, heavy bleeding, or pain).

Available contraceptive methods are reviewed with the patient at this time. Effectiveness depends on the method used and the extent to which the woman and her partner follow the instructions for use. The woman who has used any method of birth control should be assessed for her understanding of the method and its potential side effects and her satisfaction with the method. If the patient was not using contraception, the nurse explains all methods and their benefits and risks and assists the patient in making a contraceptive choice for use after abortion. An increasingly important related teaching issue is the need to use barrier contraceptive devices (ie, condoms) for protection against transmission of STDs and HIV infection.

Psychological support is another important aspect of nursing care. Nurses need to be aware that women terminate pregnancies for many reasons. Some women terminate pregnancies because of severe genetic defects. Many women who have been raped or impregnated in incestuous relationships or by an abusive partner elect to terminate their pregnancies. Infertility patients may elect to undergo selective termination if they become pregnant with multiple fetuses. In pregnancies with multiple gestation, adverse outcomes are directly proportional to the number of fetuses in the uterus. Such multifetal reductions are specialized procedures that are stressful and difficult for the parents; therefore, psychological support and understanding are required. The care of women undergoing termination of pregnancy is stressful, and assistance needs to be provided in a safe and nonjudgmental way. Nurses have the right to refuse to participate in a procedure that is against their religious beliefs but are professionally obligated not to impose their beliefs or judgments on their patients.

> NURSING ALERT Some women resort to using unskilled attempts to end a pregnancy. The methods usually include administering large amounts of various toxic agents (effects are toxic, and the uterus is never fully evacuated) or performing a curettage, with the associated risks of uterine rupture, hemorrhage, or infection. If a woman who has had a septic abortion receives proper medical attention early enough and is treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the prognosis is excellent. Fluid and blood component replacement may be required before careful attempts are made to evacuate the uterus.

Patients may opt for a type of abortion that ends a pregnancy by using medication rather than surgery. Mifepristone (RU-486, Mifeprex) is used only in early pregnancy (up to 49 days from the last menstrual period). It works by blocking progesterone. Cramping and bleeding similar to a heavy menstrual period will occur. This method requires three visits to a health care provider. The first visit consists of counseling and consent. A sonogram may be used to confirm the pregnancy. Mifepristone will then be administered. The second visit consists of a pelvic examination and possible sonogram to check if the pregnancy has been terminated. A third visit 12 days later is to make sure that the pelvic examination is normal and that the pregnancy has been termi-
nated. If the pregnancy persists, options will be discussed, including surgical abortion (ACOG Practice Bulletin \#26, 2001).

\section*{Infertility}

Infertility is defined as a couple's inability to achieve pregnancy after 1 year of unprotected intercourse. Primary infertility refers to a couple who has never had a child. Secondary infertility means that at least one conception has occurred, but currently the couple cannot achieve a pregnancy. In the United States, infertility is a major medical and social problem, affecting $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the reproductive-age population. In $20 \%$, the infertility is unexplained. The remaining $80 \%$ involve medical causes equally distributed between men and women (ACOG Technical Bulletin \#125, 2001; Compendium, 2000). Women's infertility may be related to anovulation, uterine or cervical factors, blocked fallopian tubes, or endometriosis, while men's infertility is related to sperm quality or sperm production. For infertile women who wish to bear children, infertility may have a profound emotional toll (Gonzalez, 2000; Hart, 2002).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Possible causes of infertility include uterine displacement by tumors, congenital anomalies, and inflammation. For an ovum to become fertilized, the vagina, fallopian tubes, cervix, and uterus must be patent and the mucosal secretions of the cervix must be receptive to sperm. Semen and cervical secretions are alkaline, whereas normal vaginal secretions are acidic. Often more than one factor is responsible for the problem. Identifying the causes may require the services of a gynecologist, urologist, and endocrinologist.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Careful evaluation includes physical examination, endocrinologic investigation, and consideration of psychosocial factors. Three complete histories (one of each partner and one of the couple), physical examination, and laboratory studies are performed on both partners to rule out such causative factors as previous STDs, anomalies, injuries, tuberculosis, mumps orchitis, impaired sperm production, endometriosis, DES exposure, or antisperm antibodies. Five factors are considered basic to infertility: ovarian, tubal, cervical, uterine, and semen conditions.

\section*{OVARIAN FACTORS}

Studies performed to determine if there is regular ovulation and if progestational endometrium is adequate for implantation may include a basal body temperature chart for at least four cycles, an endometrial biopsy, serum progesterone level, and ovulation index. The ovulation index involves a urine-stick test that determines if the surge in LH that precedes follicular rupture has occurred.

\section*{TUBAL FACTORS}

Hysterosalpingography is used to rule out uterine or tubal abnormalities. Laparoscopy permits direct visualization of the tubes and other pelvic structures and can assist in identifying conditions that may interfere with fertility (eg, endometriosis).

\section*{CERVICAL FACTORS}

The cervical mucus can be examined at ovulation and after intercourse to determine whether proper changes occur that promote sperm penetration and survival. A postcoital cervical mucus
test (Sims-Huhner test) is performed 2 to 8 hours after intercourse. Cervical mucus is aspirated with a medicine dropper-like instrument. Aspirated material is placed on a slide and examined under the microscope for the presence and viability of sperm cells. The woman is instructed not to bathe or douche between coitus and the examination.

\section*{UTERINE FACTORS}

Fibroids, polyps, and congenital malformations are possible conditions in this category. Their presence may be determined by pelvic examination, hysteroscopy, saline sonogram (a variation of a sonogram), and hysterosalpingography.

\section*{SEMEN FACTORS}

After 2 to 3 days of sexual abstinence, a specimen of ejaculate is collected in a clean container, kept warm, and examined within 1 hour for the number of sperm (density), percentage of moving forms, quality of forward movement (forward progression), and morphology (shape and form). From 2 to 6 mL of watery alkaline semen is normal; a normal count is 60 million to 100 million sperm $/ \mathrm{mL}$, although the incidence of impregnation is lessened only when the count drops below 20 million sperm $/ \mathrm{mL}$. A normal semen analysis should show the following (Angard, 1999):
- Volume: more than 1 mL
- Concentration: more than 20 million $/ \mathrm{mL}$
- Motility: more than $50 \%$ of the forms should be moving
- Morphology: more than $60 \%$ of sperm should have normal forms
- No sperm clumping, significant red or white blood cells, or thickening of seminal fluid (hyperviscosity)

\section*{MISCELLANEOUS FACTORS}

Men may also be affected by varicoceles, varicose veins around the testicle, which decrease semen quality by increasing testicular temperature. Retrograde ejaculation or ejaculation into the bladder is assessed by urinalysis after ejaculation.

Blood tests for male partners may include measuring testosterone; FSH and LH (both of which are involved in maintaining testicular function); and prolactin levels and antisperm antibodies (treated with corticosteroids).

Immunologic factors also are being investigated. Some cases of recurrent early pregnancy loss or recurrent natural abortion are the result of an abnormal response by the woman to antigens on fetal or placental tissues. Some women have been treated with infusions of their partner's lymphocytes with some success, but this treatment remains experimental and the long-term effects are unknown.

\section*{Medical Management}

Infertility is often difficult to treat because it frequently results from a combination of factors. Couples undergoing an infertility evaluation may conceive without the cause of infertility ever identified. Likewise, although some couples undergo all tests, the cause of the problem may remain undiscovered and infertility persists. Between these extremes, many problems, both simple and complex, can be discovered and corrected. Patients may need assisted reproductive technology to conceive; the methods are described below. Therapy may require surgery to correct a malfunction or anomaly, hormonal supplements, attention to proper timing, and recognition and correction of psychological or emotional factors.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Pharmacologically induced ovulation is undertaken when women do not ovulate on their own or ovulate irregularly. Various medications are used, depending on the primary cause of infertility (Chart 46-17). Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) is the most common medication used. Although Clomid's precise action is unknown, it enhances the release of pituitary gonadotropins, resulting in follicular rupture or ovulation.

Another mode of pharmacotherapy for anovulatory women includes the use of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The woman wears an infusion pump attached to an intravenous or subcutaneous catheter for up to 21 days. Administration of GnRH can result in ovulation in some women with low hormone levels. This option can reduce cycle monitoring and the incidence of multiple gestation (ACOG Technical Bulletin \#197, ACOG Compendium, 2001).

Human menopausal gonadotropin may also be used as it stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs. Blood tests and ultrasounds are used to monitor ovulation. Multiple pregnancies may occur with these medications. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) may also occur. This condition is characterized by enlarged multicystic ovaries and is complicated by a shift of fluid from the intravascular space into the abdominal cavity. It is iatrogenic and preventable and develops after ovarian stimulation. The fluid shift can result in ascites, pleural effusion, and edema; hypovolemia may also result. Risk factors include younger age, history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, high serum estradiol levels, a larger number of follicles, and pregnancy. If the woman is pregnant, she is producing human chorionic gonadotropin, which can worsen OHSS. Symptoms include abdominal discomfort, distention, weight gain, and ovarian enlargement. This condition may be moderate, severe, or critical. Severe OHSS may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is prevented by careful monitoring and adjustment of medication dosage.

Management in mild and moderate cases of OHSS consists of decreased activity, monitoring of urine output, and frequent

\section*{Chart 46-17 - PHARMACOLOGY Medications That Induce Ovulation}

\section*{Clomiphene (Clomid)}

Clomiphene is used when the hypothalamus is not stimulating the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH. This medication stimulates follicles in the ovary. It is usually taken for 5 days beginning on the fifth day of the menstrual cycle. Ovulation should occur 4 to 8 days after the last dose. Patients receive instructions about timing intercourse to facilitate fertilization.
Menotropin (Pergonal)
Menotropin, a combination of FSH and LH, is used for women with deficiencies in these hormones. Pergonal stimulates the ovaries, so monitoring by ultrasound and hormone levels is essential because overstimulation may occur.
Urofollitropin (Metrodin)
Urofollitropin, containing FSH with a small amount of LH, is used in some disorders (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome) to stimulate follicle growth. Clomid is then used to stimulate ovulation.
Chorionic Gonadotropin
Chorionic gonadotropin is used to stimulate release of the egg from the ovary and may be used in combination with the above medications.
office visits as designated by the reproductive endocrinologist. The patient with severe OHSS is hospitalized for monitoring and treatment. Severe OHSS is characterized by clinical ascites, hypovolemia, oliguria, hemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalance, and ovarian size greater than 10 cm . Treatment of severe OHSS includes use of an indwelling catheter for strict monitoring of fluid intake and output and daily measurements of weight and abdominal circumference. Intravenous fluids and heparin are administered as prescribed. The patient is permitted to ambulate as tolerated. Critical OHSS is life-threatening and is characterized by tense ascites that may be accompanied by hydrothorax, renal failure, and ARDS. Volume expanders, diuretic agents, hemodialysis, and intubation may be required (Copeland, 2000).

\section*{ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION}

Depositing semen into the female genital tract by artificial means is called artificial insemination. If the sperm cannot penetrate the cervical canal normally, artificial insemination using the partner's semen (AIH, or artificial insemination with sperm from the husband or partner) may be considered. In azoospermia (lack of sperm in the semen), semen from carefully selected donors may be used (AID, or artificial insemination with sperm from donor).

Indications for using artificial insemination include: (1) the man's inability to deposit semen in the vagina, which may be due to premature ejaculation, pronounced hypospadias (a displaced male urethra), or dyspareunia (painful intercourse experienced by the woman), (2) inability of semen to be transported from the vagina to the uterine cavity (this is usually due to faulty chemical conditions and may occur with an abnormal cervical discharge), and (3) a single woman's desire to have a child.

The woman may have received clomiphene (Clomid) and menotropins (Pergonal) to stimulate ovulation before insemination. Ultrasounds and blood studies of varying hormone levels are used to pinpoint the best time for insemination and to monitor for OHSS. The recipient is placed in the lithotomy position on the examination table, a speculum is inserted, and the vagina and cervix are swabbed with a cotton-tipped applicator to remove any excess secretions. Semen is drawn into a sterile syringe, and a cannula is attached. The semen is then directed to the external os. Semen may also be placed into the uterine cavity (intrauterine insemination). In this procedure, the sperm are washed before insertion to remove biochemicals and to select the most active sperm. This is indicated when mucus is inadequate, when antibodies are present, or when the sperm count is low. After careful withdrawal of the cannula, the patient remains in a supine position for 30 minutes.

The success rate for artificial insemination varies. Three to six inseminations may be required over 2 to 4 months. Because artificial insemination is likely to be a stressful and difficult situation for couples, nursing support and strategies to promote coping are crucial.

Cannula With Partner's Semen. Certain conditions need to be established before semen is transferred to the vagina. The woman must have no abnormalities of the genital system, the fallopian tubes must be patent, and ova must be available. In the male, sperm need to be normal in shape, amount, motility, and endurance. The time of ovulation should be determined as accurately as possible so that the 2 or 3 days during which fertilization is possible each month can be targeted for treatment. Fertilization
seldom occurs from a single insemination. Usually, insemination is attempted between days 10 and 17 of the cycle; three different attempts may be made during one cycle. Semen is collected by masturbation; alternatively, a perforated sheath is worn over the penis during intercourse by couples who object to masturbation. Withdrawal and using condoms for sperm collection are considered unsatisfactory by many infertility specialists because some sperm may be lost or adversely affected.

Insemination With Donor Semen. When the sperm of the woman's partner is defective or absent or when there is a risk of transmitting a genetic disease, donor sperm may be used. Safeguards are put in place to address legal, ethical, emotional, and religious issues. Written consent is obtained to protect all parties involved, including the woman, the donor, and the resulting child. The donor's semen is frozen and the donor is evaluated to ensure that he is free of genetic disorders and STDs, including HIV infection.

\section*{IN VITRO FERTILIZATION}

In vitro fertilization (IVF) involves ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer. This procedure is accomplished by first stimulating the ovary to produce multiple eggs or ova, usually with medications, because success rates are greater with more than one early embryo. Many different protocols exist for inducing ovulation with one or more agents. Patients are carefully selected and evaluated, and cycles are carefully monitored using ultrasound and estradiol levels. At the appropriate time, the ova are recovered by transvaginal ultrasound retrieval. Sperm and eggs are coincubated for up to 36 hours, and the embryos are transferred about 48 hours after retrieval. Implantation should occur in 3 to 5 days.

Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), a variation of IVF, is the treatment of choice for patients with ovarian failure. Success rates vary from $20 \%$ to $30 \%$. The ovaries are stimulated with gonadotropin derivatives, and follicles are observed with vaginal ultrasound. Once the oocyte is mature, it is retrieved by laparoscopy or transvaginally with ultrasound guidance. The oocyte (unfertilized egg) is removed and drawn into a catheter, where it is mixed with sperm that was obtained shortly before the oocyte retrieval. The most motile fraction of sperm is selected by a washing process. The oocyte and sperm are then inserted into the fallopian tube, where fertilization occurs. The latter method avoids anesthesia. GIFT is the technique of choice for nontubal causes of infertility and for older infertile women.

Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) consists of oocyte retrieval and fertilization in vitro; the zygotes are placed into the fallopian tubes via laparoscopy.

The most common indications for IVF and GIFT are irreparable tubal damage, endometriosis, immunologic problems, unexplained infertility, inadequate sperm, and exposure to DES.

\section*{OTHER ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES}

In intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), an ovum is retrieved as described previously, and a single sperm is injected through the zona pellucida, through the egg membrane, and into the cytoplasm of the oocyte. The fertilized egg is then transferred back to the donor. ICSI is the treatment of choice in severe male factor infertility.

Women who cannot produce their own eggs (ie, premature ovarian failure) have the option of using the eggs of a donor after
stimulation of the donor's ovaries. The recipient also receives hormones in preparation for these procedures. Couples may also choose this modality if the female partner has a genetic disorder that may be passed on to children.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing interventions appropriate when working with couples during infertility evaluations include the following: assist in reducing stress in the relationship, encourage cooperation, protect privacy, foster understanding, and refer the couple to appropriate resources when necessary. Because infertility workups are expensive, time-consuming, invasive, stressful, and not always successful, couples need support in working together to deal with this endeavor.

Resolve, Inc., a nonprofit self-help group that provides information and support for infertile patients, was founded by a nurse who experienced difficulty conceiving. The literature on infertility that is produced by this group is an important resource for patients and professionals. Most areas across the country have local support groups. More information can be obtained by writing to Resolve, Inc. (see the address at the end of this chapter).

Smoking is strongly discouraged because it has an adverse effect on the success of assisted reproduction. Diet, exercise, stress reduction techniques, health maintenance, and disease prevention are being emphasized in many infertility programs.

\section*{ECTOPIC PREGNANCY}

The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is on the rise: it occurs in $2 \%$ of pregnancies (Lemus, 2000). It occurs when a fertilized ovum (a blastocyst) becomes implanted on any tissue other than the uterine lining (eg, the fallopian tube, ovary, abdomen, or cervix; Fig. 46-9). The most common site of ectopic implantation is the fallopian tube.

Possible causes include salpingitis, peritubal adhesions (after pelvic infection, endometriosis, appendicitis), structural abnormalities of the fallopian tube (rare and usually related to DES exposure), previous ectopic pregnancy (after one ectopic pregnancy, the risk of recurrence is $7 \%$ to $15 \%$; Lemus, 2000), previous tubal surgery, multiple previous induced abortions (particularly if followed by infection), tumors that distort the tube, and IUD and progestin-only contraceptives. PID appears to be the major risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Improved antibiotic therapy for PID usually prevents total tubal closure but may leave a stricture or narrowing, predisposing the woman to ectopic implantation. The odds of recurrent ectopic pregnancy are three times higher if an infectious pathology was the cause of the first one. If a woman has a second ectopic pregnancy, assisted reproduction is considered.

The rate of tubal pregnancies has increased in disproportion to population growth. Ectopic pregnancies are being diagnosed sooner and more often because of advanced diagnostic techniques. Moreover, they are being treated conservatively before emergency rupture and hemorrhage occur. It may be that the increased numbers result from better diagnostic techniques. Conservative treatment makes ectopic pregnancy less life-threatening than previously, but this condition persists as the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester and the second leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States. Ectopic pregnancy is also a complication of IVF.

Nursing Research Profile 46-1
The Experience of Premature Ovarian Eailure
Orshan, S. A., Furniss, K. K., Forst, C., \& Santoro, N. (2001). The lived experience of premature ovarian failure. JOGNN, 30(2), 202-207.

\section*{Purpose}

Premature ovarian failure (POF), the premature cessation of function of the ovaries, affects $1 \%$ to $5 \%$ of women below the age of 40 . Little is known about the impact of POF on women who experience it and their reactions to the diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of women diagnosed with idiopathic POF.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A qualitative research study using phenomenology was used. Six women who experienced idiopathic POF before the age of 35 were asked to describe the meaning of POF to them. The subjects ranged in age from 25 to 41 at the time of the interview; mean age was 36.7 years. Five of the women were Caucasian; one was African American. Four of the six women had ceased menstruating between 5 and 10 years before the interview. Interviews were conducted in private settings; the women were asked to share what it had been like to live with POF and to describe the reactions of their family and friends to the diagnosis of POF. Audiotapes of the interviews were transcribed and analyzed.

\section*{Findings}

Four major themes emerged from analysis of the interview data: 1) being treated as a diagnosis rather than as a person, 2 ) grieving for death of a dream for the future, 3) existing in a world with others, most of whom are fertile, and 4) being too young to be so old. The women in the study reported feeling robbed of their ability to have children and robbed of their youth with the premature onset of menopause. Women reported reacting to the diagnosis of POF with feelings of anger, depression, grief, and mourning.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses need to be sensitive to the impact that POF has on women and need to create a supportive environment for women who experience premature menopause. While POF is not a common diagnosis, women who experience it might benefit from health care providers who listen to their concerns, provide support, teach, and make appropriate referrals. Recognizing the impact the diagnosis has on women is important for nurses caring for women with POF.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Early intervention decreases rupture, minimizes tubal damage, and usually avoids the need for surgery. Signs and symptoms vary depending on whether tubal rupture has occurred. Delay in menstruation from 1 to 2 weeks followed by slight bleeding (spotting) or a report of a slightly abnormal period suggests the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy. Symptoms may begin late, with vague soreness on the affected side, probably due to uterine contractions and distention of the tube. Typically, the patient experiences sharp, colicky pain. Most patients experience pelvic or abdominal pain and some spotting or bleeding. Gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, or lightheadedness is common. The patient frequently thinks the abnormal bleeding is a menstrual period, especially if a recent period occurred and was normal.

If implantation occurs in the fallopian tube, the tube becomes more and more distended and can rupture if the ectopic pregnancy

remains undetected for 4 to 6 weeks or longer after conception. When the tube ruptures, the ovum is discharged into the abdominal cavity.

When tubal rupture occurs, the woman experiences agonizing pain, dizziness, faintness, and nausea and vomiting. These symptoms are related to the peritoneal reaction to blood escaping from the tube. Air hunger and symptoms of shock may occur, and the signs of hemorrhage-rapid and thready pulse, decreased blood pressure, subnormal temperature, restlessness, pallor, and sweating-are evident. Later, the pain becomes generalized in the abdomen and radiates to the shoulder and neck because of accumulating intraperitoneal blood that irritates the diaphragm.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

During vaginal examination, a large mass of clotted blood that has collected in the pelvis behind the uterus or a tender adnexal mass may be palpable. If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the patient is evaluated by sonography and the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. If the ultrasound results are inconclusive, the beta-hCG test is repeated to evaluate the rate of rise in the level. The levels of hCG (the diagnostic hormone of pregnancy) double in early normal pregnancies every 3 days but are reduced in abnormal or ectopic pregnancies. A less-than-normal increase is cause for suspicion. Serum progesterone levels are also measured. Levels under $5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ are considered abnormal; levels over $25 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ are associated with a normally developing pregnancy. Urine tests for pregnancy are not helpful in ectopic pregnancies.

Ultrasound can detect a pregnancy between 5 and 6 weeks from the last menstrual period. Detectable fetal heart movement outside the uterus on ultrasound is firm evidence of an ectopic pregnancy. On occasion, an ultrasound study is not definitive and the diagnosis must be made with combined diagnostic aids (hCG level, ultrasound, pelvic examination, and clinical judgment). Studies using ultrasound with Doppler flow, in which color indicates perfusion, are helpful.

Occasionally, the clinical picture makes the diagnosis relatively easy. However, when the clinical signs and symptoms are
questionable, which is often the case, other procedures have value. Laparoscopy is used because the physician can visually detect an unruptured tubal pregnancy and thereby circumvent the risk of its rupture.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

When surgery is performed early, almost all patients recover rapidly; if tubal rupture occurs, mortality increases. The type of surgery is determined by the size and extent of local tubal damage. Conservative surgery would include "milking" an ectopic pregnancy from the tube. Resection of the involved fallopian tube with end-to-end anastomosis may be effective. Some surgeons attempt to salvage the tube with a salpingostomy, which involves opening and evacuating the tube and controlling bleeding. More extensive surgery includes removing the tube alone (salpingectomy) or with the ovary (salpingo-oophorectomy). Depending on the amount of blood lost, blood component therapy and treatment of hemorrhagic shock may be necessary before and during surgery. Surgery may also be indicated in women unlikely to comply with close monitoring or those who live too far away from a health care facility to obtain the monitoring needed with nonsurgical management.

Methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic agent and folic acid antagonist, is used after surgery to treat any remaining embryonic or early pregnancy tissue, as indicated by a persistent or rising betahCG level. The beta-hCG test is repeated 2 weeks after surgery to ensure a falling level.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Another option is the use of methotrexate without surgery. Because this medication stops the pregnancy from progressing by interfering with DNA synthesis and the multiplication of cells, it interrupts early, small, unruptured tubal pregnancies. Patients must be hemodynamically stable, have no active renal or hepatic disease, have no evidence of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia, and have a very small, unruptured tubal pregnancy on ultrasound. The medication
is administered intramuscularly or intravenously. Some patients may be treated with intratubal injection of methotrexate. Complete blood count, blood typing, and tests of liver and renal function are conducted to monitor the patient. The patient is advised to refrain from alcohol, intercourse, and vitamins with folic acid until the pregnancy is resolved because these may exacerbate the adverse effects of methotrexate. Abdominal pain may occur within 5 to 10 days and may indicate termination of the pregnancy. This requires careful assessment by the health care provider. Serum levels of hCG are monitored carefully, and these levels should gradually decrease. Ultrasounds may also be used for monitoring. Side effects of methotrexate include stomatitis and diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, impaired liver function, dermatitis, and pleuritis.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH AN ECTOPIC PREGNANCY}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history includes the menstrual pattern and any (even slight) bleeding since the last menstrual period. The nurse elicits the patient's description of pains and their location. The nurse asks the patient whether any sharp, colicky pains have occurred. Then the nurse notes whether pain radiates to the shoulder and neck (possibly caused by rupture and pressure on the diaphragm).

The nurse monitors vital signs, level of consciousness, and nature and amount of vaginal bleeding. If possible, the nurse assesses how the woman is coping with the loss of a pregnancy.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to the progression of the tubal pregnancy
- Anticipatory grieving related to the loss of pregnancy and effect on future pregnancies
- Deficient knowledge related to the treatment and effect on future pregnancies

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, major complications may include the following:
- Hemorrhage
- Hemorrhagic shock

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of pain; acceptance and resolution of grief and pregnancy loss; increased knowledge about ectopic pregnancy, its treatment, and its outcome; and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The abdominal pain associated with ectopic pregnancy may be described as cramping or severe continuous pain. If the patient is to have surgery, preanesthetic medications may provide pain relief. Postoperatively, analgesic agents are administered liberally;
this promotes early ambulation and enables the patient to cough and take deep breaths.

\section*{SUPPORTING THE GRIEVING PROCESS}

Patients' distress levels vary. If the pregnancy is wanted, loss may or may not be expressed verbally by the patient and her partner. The impact may not be fully realized until much later. The nurse should be available to listen and provide support. The patient's partner, if appropriate, should participate in this process. Even if the pregnancy was unplanned, a loss has been experienced, and a grief reaction may follow. Severe and persistent psychological distress may require referral for psychological counseling.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Potential complications of ectopic pregnancy are hemorrhage and shock. Careful assessment is essential to detect the development of these complications. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, level of consciousness, amount of bleeding, and intake and output provides information about the possibility of hemorrhage and the need to prepare for intravenous therapy. Bed rest is indicated. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and blood gas levels are monitored to assess hematologic status and adequacy of tissue perfusion. Significant deviations in these laboratory values are reported immediately, and the patient is prepared for possible surgery. Blood component therapy may be required if blood loss has been rapid and extensive. If hypovolemic shock occurs, the treatment is directed toward re-establishing tissue perfusion and adequate blood volume. See Chapter 15 for a discussion of the intravenous fluids and medications used in treating shock.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

If the patient has experienced life-threatening hemorrhage and shock, these complications are addressed and treated before any indepth teaching can begin. At this time, the patient's and the nurse's attention is focused on the crisis, not on learning. Therefore, it may be later that the patient begins to ask questions about what has happened and why certain procedures were performed. Procedures are explained in terms that a distressed and apprehensive patient can understand. The patient's partner is included in teaching and explanations when possible. After the patient recovers from postoperative discomforts, it may be more appropriate to address any questions and concerns that the patient and her partner have, including the effect of this pregnancy or its treatment on future pregnancies. Patients should be advised that ectopic pregnancies may recur. It is important to review signs and symptoms with the patient and instruct her to report an abnormal menstrual period promptly. Patient teaching is based on the needs of the patient and her partner and must take into consideration their distress and grief. The patient is informed about possible complications and instructed to report early signs and symptoms.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Because of the risk of subsequent ectopic pregnancies, the patient is advised to seek preconception counseling before considering future pregnancies and to seek early prenatal care. Psychological support and counseling may be advisable for women and their partners to help them deal with the loss of the pregnancy. Follow-up contact enables the nurse to answer questions and clarify information for the woman and her partner. In addition, it provides an opportunity to assess their ability to cope with the loss of the pregnancy.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Experiences relief of pain
a. Reports a decrease in pain and discomfort
b. Ambulates as prescribed; performs coughing and deep breathing
2. Begins to accept loss of pregnancy and expresses grief by verbalizing feelings and reactions to loss
3. Verbalizes an understanding of the causes of ectopic pregnancy
4. Experiences no complications
a. Exhibits no signs of bleeding, hemorrhage, or shock
b. Has decreased amounts of discharge (on perineal pad)
c. Has normal skin color and turgor
d. Exhibits stable vital signs and adequate urine output
e. Levels of beta-hCG return to normal

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 25-year-old woman is having a complete physical examination for the first time and is extremely apprehensive. How would you approach the history and physical examination with her? How would you modify your approach if the woman had significant physical and developmental/ cognitive disabilities?
2. A 57-year-old woman with osteoporosis has been taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for 9 years to treat hot flashes and to prevent further bone loss. She has recently read about the results of the Women's Health Initiative study suggesting that the risks of HRT outweigh the benefits. She is concerned not only about her risk for breast cancer based on those results, but also about the return of hot flashes and further bone loss if she stops the HRT. How would you advise her? What resources would you recommend to her?
3. An 18-year-old woman comes to the clinic for a gynecologic examination because she anticipates having sex with her new boyfriend. She asks you for advice about oral contraceptives versus barrier methods of contraception. What advice would you give her? How would you teach her about using a barrier method of contraception if that is what she chooses? How would you modify your teaching if she informed you that her new boyfriend has AIDS? What general health promotion teaching would you provide to her?
4. You are working in an infertility practice and are responsible for orienting couples beginning an evaluation for infertility to the procedures and services of the practice. A 40-year-old woman and her 48-year-old husband are eager to learn about the process. During your initial conversation with them, you learn that they both have high levels of stress and high-pressure jobs. While the woman is eager to begin the process, her husband is uncertain about wanting to proceed with the workup because of concerns about privacy, confidentiality, costs, and possible disappointment. How would you proceed in your explanations of the process
and procedures? What information about your assessment of the couple's readiness to undergo the evaluation would you report to the physician or nurse practitioner?
5. During a checkup at the clinic where you work, a 43-year-old patient tells you that she has met a new partner and is not concerned about sexual risks of STDs because she is a lesbian and has never had a sexual relationship with a man. How would you address the educational needs of this patient?
6. At a health clinic, you meet a 48-year-old woman with spina bifida who uses a cane at home and a wheelchair outside the home. She is approaching menopause and is concerned about how her limitations secondary to spinal bifida might affect her health related to menopause. Describe what health promotion issues would be relevant and the actions, including patient teaching, that are warranted.

\section*{Management of Patients With Female Reproductive Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Compare the various types of vaginal infections and the signs, symptoms, and treatments of each.
2. Develop a teaching plan for the patient with a vaginal infection.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with a vulvovaginal infection.
4. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with genital herpes.
5. Describe medical and nursing management for the patient with toxic shock syndrome.
6. Discuss the signs and symptoms, management, and nursing care implications of malignant disorders of the female reproductive tract.
7. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient undergoing a hysterectomy.
8. Describe indications for a wide excision of the vulva, or vulvectomy, and the preoperative and postoperative nursing interventions.
9. Compare nursing interventions indicated for the patient undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy for cancer of the female reproductive tract.

Disorders of the female reproductive system are relatively common. Some disorders are self-limited and cause only minor inconvenience to the woman; others are life-threatening and require immediate attention and long-term therapy. Many disorders are managed by the patient at home, whereas others require hospitalization and surgical intervention. All disorders require understanding and skill in patient teaching on the part of the nurse. The nurse must also be sensitive to women's concerns and their possible, even probable, discomfort in discussing and dealing with these disorders.

\section*{Vulvovaginal Infections}

The vagina is protected against infection by its normally low pH ( 3.5 to 4.5), which is maintained in part by the actions of Lactobacillus acidophilus, the dominant bacteria in a healthy vaginal ecosystem. These bacteria suppress the growth of anaerobes and produce lactic acid, which maintains normal pH . They also produce hydrogen peroxide, which is toxic to anaerobes. The risk of infection rises if a woman's resistance is reduced by stress or illness, if the pH is altered, or if a pathogen is introduced.

Vulvovaginal infections are common problems, and nurses have an important role in providing information that may prevent their
occurrence. To prevent these infections, women need to understand their own anatomy and vulvovaginal hygiene measures. In addition, continued research into causes and treatments is needed, along with better ways to encourage growth of lactobacilli.

The epithelium of the vagina is highly responsive to estrogen, which induces glycogen formation. The subsequent breakdown of glycogen into lactic acid assists in producing a low vaginal pH . When estrogen decreases during lactation and menopause, glycogen also decreases. With reduced glycogen formation, infections may occur. In addition, as estrogen production ceases during the perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods, the vagina and labia may atrophy (thin), making the vaginal area more susceptible to infection. When patients are treated with antibiotics, the normal vaginal flora are reduced. This results in altered pH and growth of fungal organisms. Other factors that may initiate infections include sexual intercourse with an infected partner and wearing tight, nonabsorbent, and heat-retaining clothing (Chart 47-1).

Vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) occurs when Candida or Trichomonas species or other bacteria invade the vagina. The normal vaginal discharge, which may occur in slight amounts during ovulation or just before the onset of menstruation, becomes more profuse when vaginitis occurs. Urethritis may accompany

vaginal vault: term used to describe the vagina following a hysterectomy, which involves removal of the uterus including the cervix
vaginitis: inflammation of the vagina, usually secondary to infection
vestibulitis: inflammation of the vulvar vestibule, or tissue around the opening of the vagina, that causes pain often with intercourse (dyspareunia)
vulvar dystrophy: thickening or lesions of the vulva; usually causes itching and may require biopsy to exclude malignancy
vulvectomy: removal of the tissue of the vulva
vulvitis: inflammation of the vulva, usually secondary to infection or irritation
vulvodynia: painful condition that affects the vulva
vaginitis because of the proximity of the urethra to the vagina. Discharge that occurs with vaginitis may produce itching, odor, redness, burning, or edema, which may be aggravated by voiding and defection. After the causative organism has been identified, appropriate treatment (discussed later) is prescribed. This may include oral medication or local medication that may be inserted into the vagina using an applicator.

\section*{CANDIDIASIS}

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a fungal or yeast infection caused by strains of Candida (Table 47-1). Candida albicans accounts for most cases, but other strains, such as Candida glabrata, may also be implicated. Many women with a healthy vaginal ecosystem harbor Candida but are asymptomatic. Certain conditions favor the change from an asymptomatic state to colonization with symptoms. For example, use of antibiotics decreases bacteria, thereby altering the natural protective organisms usually present in the vagina. Clinical infection may occur during pregnancy, with a systemic condition such as diabetes mellitus or human

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations include a vaginal discharge that causes pruritus (itching) and subsequent irritation. The discharge may be watery or thick but has a white, cottage cheese-like appearance. Symptoms are usually more severe just before menstruation and are usually less responsive to treatment during pregnancy. Diagnosis is made by microscopic identification of spores and hyphae on a glass slide prepared from a discharge specimen mixed with potassium hydroxide. With candidiasis, the pH is 4.5 or less.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal of management is to eliminate symptoms. Treatments include antifungal agents such as miconazole (Monistat), nystatin (Mycostatin), clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin), and terconazole (Terazol) cream. These agents are inserted into the vagina with an applicator at bedtime and may be applied to the vulvar area for pruritus. There are 1 -night, 3 -night, or 7 -night treatment courses available. Oral medication is also available (fluconazole [Diflucan]). Fluconazole is given in a one-pill dose; relief should be noted within 3 days.

Vaginal creams are available without a prescription; however, patients are cautioned to use these creams only if they are certain that they have a yeast or monilial infection. Many patients use these remedies for problems other than yeast infections. If the patient is uncertain about the cause of her symptoms or has not obtained relief after using these creams, she is instructed to seek health care promptly. Yeast infections can sometimes become recurrent and may be related to cell-mediated immunity or to an allergic response. Women with recurrent yeast infections benefit from a comprehensive gynecologic workup.

\section*{SEMINAL PLASMA PROTEIN ALLERGY}

Women with this condition develop an immunologic response to human semen, resulting in vaginal inflammation. Symptoms vary from local inflammation and pruritus to rare systemic anaphylaxis after exposure. Diagnosis is usually based on the absence of symptoms with condom use. Treatment may include cromolyn vaginal cream and immunotherapy. The success rate of treatment varies, and referral to an immunologist may be warranted.

\section*{BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS}

Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis normally found in the vagina and an absence of lactobacilli (see Table 47-1). It is characterized by a fish-like odor that is particularly noticeable after sexual intercourse or during menstruation as a result of a rise in the vaginal pH . It is usually accompanied by a heavier-than-normal discharge. Risk factors include douching, smoking, and increased sexual activity.

Bacterial vaginosis can occur throughout the menstrual cycle and does not produce local discomfort or pain. More than half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not notice any symptoms. Discharge, if noticed, is gray to yellowish white. The fish-like odor can be detected readily by adding a drop of potassium hydroxide to a glass slide with a sample of vaginal discharge, which releases amines. Under the microscope, vaginal cells are coated
with bacteria and are described as "clue cells." The pH of the discharge is usually above 4.7 because of the amines that result from enzymes from anaerobes. Lactobacilli, a natural host defense, are usually absent. Bacterial vaginosis is usually not a serious condition, but it has been associated with premature labor, endometritis, and recurrent urinary tract infection.

\section*{Medical Management}

Metronidazole (Flagyl), administered orally twice a day for 1 week, is effective; a vaginal gel is also available. Clindamycin (Cleocin) vaginal cream or ovules (oval suppositories) are also effective. If the infection recurs, the patient's partner may require treatment. Patients with recurrent bacterial vaginosis should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia.

\section*{TRICHOMONIASIS}

Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan that causes a common, usually sexually transmitted vaginitis that is often called "trich." About 5 million cases occur each year in the United States (U.S. Surgeon General's Report, 2001). It may be transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier who harbors the organism in the urogenital tract (see Table 47-1). It may increase the risk of contracting HIV from an infected partner.

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 47-1}

\section*{Vaginal Infections in Abused Versus Nonabused Pregnant Hispanic Women}

King., E. A., Britt, R., McFarlane, J. M., \& Hawkins, C. (2000). Bacterial vaginosis and Chlamydia trachomatis among pregnant abused and nonabused Hispanic women. JOGNN, 29(6), 606-612.

\section*{Purpose}

The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in a cohort of abused and nonabused pregnant Hispanic women.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The sample consisted of 233 pregnant, abused Hispanic women and 468 pregnant, nonabused Hispanic women from three urban prenatal clinics of a public health department in the southwestern United States. The women's status regarding abuse (abused vs. nonabused) was determined for a previous study by self-report using the Abuse Assessment Screen. Chart review was undertaken to determine the prevalence of BV and CT in both groups. Evidence of BV and CT in the women's medical records was based on standard ACOG criteria.

\section*{Findings}

The combined prevalence of BV and CT in the group of abused women was significantly higher ( $p<.05$ ) than that for nonabused women. There was no difference in prevalence of CT alone, but the prevalence of BV was significantly higher ( $p<.05$ ) for abused women. There were no significant differences in the two groups in terms of marital status, age, gestational age, or number of prenatal visits.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Although the findings are limited to one ethnic group in an urban public clinic setting, they do suggest the need for targeted screening of all abused pregnant women for BV. Detection and treatment of women with BV may prevent premature rupture of membranes and premature delivery in this high-risk group of pregnant women.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations include a vaginal discharge that is thin (sometimes frothy), yellow to yellow-green, malodorous, and very irritating. An accompanying vulvitis may result, with vulvovaginal burning and itching. Diagnosis is made by microscopic detection of the pear-shaped, mobile, flagellate organisms. Inspection with a speculum often reveals vaginal and cervical erythema (redness) with multiple small petechiae ("strawberry spots"). pH testing of a trichomonal discharge will demonstrate a pH greater than 4.5.

\section*{Medical Management}

The most effective treatment for trichomoniasis is metronidazole (Flagyl). Both partners receive a one-time loading dose or a smaller dose three times a day for 1 week. The one-time dose is more convenient; consequently, compliance tends to be greater. The weeklong treatment has occasionally been noted to be more effective. Some patients complain of an unpleasant but transient metallic taste when taking metronidazole. Nausea and vomiting, as well as a hot, flushed feeling, occur when this medication is taken with an alcoholic beverage (disulfiram-like reaction). In view of these side effects, the patient is strongly advised to abstain from alcohol while taking the medication.

Metronidazole therapy is contraindicated in patients with some blood dyscrasias or central nervous system diseases, in the first trimester of pregnancy, and in women who are breastfeeding. It is not prescribed without examination.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

After menopause, the vaginal mucosa becomes thinner and may atrophy. This condition can be complicated by infection from pyogenic bacteria, resulting in atrophic vaginitis (see Table 47-1). Leukorrhea (vaginal discharge) may cause itching and burning. Management is similar to that for bacterial vaginosis if bacteria are present. Estrogenic hormones, either taken orally or inserted into the vagina in a cream form, can also be effective in restoring the epithelium.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: \\ THE PATIENT WITH A VULVOVAGINAL INFECTION}

\section*{Assessment}

The woman with vulvovaginal symptoms should be examined as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. She is instructed not to douche because doing so removes the vaginal discharge needed to make the diagnosis. The area is observed for erythema, edema, excoriation, and discharge. Each of the infection-producing organisms produces its own characteristic discharge and effect (see Table 47-1). The patient is asked to describe any discharge and other symptoms, such as odor, itching, or burning. Dysuria often occurs as a result of local irritation of the urinary meatus. A urinary tract infection may need to be ruled out by obtaining a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity testing.

The patient is asked about the occurrence of factors that may contribute to vulvovaginal infection:
- Physical and chemical factors, such as constant moisture from tight or synthetic clothing, perfumes and powders,
soaps, bubble bath, poor hygiene, and use of feminine hygiene products
- Psychogenic factors (eg, stress, fear of STDs, abuse)
- Medical conditions or endocrine factors, such as a predisposition to vulvar involvement in a patient who has diabetes or is elderly
- Use of medications such as antibiotics, which may alter the vaginal flora and allow an overgrowth of monilial organisms
- New sex partner, multiple sex partners, previous vaginal infection

The patient is also asked about other factors that could contribute to infection, including hygiene practices (tampons, douching), use or nonuse of condoms, and use of chemicals such as nonoxynol-9 with barrier methods of birth control.

The nurse may prepare a vaginal smear (wet mount) to assist in diagnosing the infection. A common method for preparing the smear is to collect vaginal secretions with an applicator and place the secretions on two separate glass slides. A drop of saline solution is added to one slide and a drop of $10 \%$ potassium hydroxide is added to another slide for examination under a microscope. If bacterial vaginosis is present, the slide with normal saline solution added shows epithelial cells dotted with bacteria (clue cells). If Trichomonas species is present, small motile cells are seen. In the presence of yeast, the potassium hydroxide slide reveals typical characteristics. Discharge associated with bacterial vaginosis produces a strong odor when mixed with potassium hydroxide. This is called a positive "whiff test." Testing the pH of the discharge with Nitrazine paper assists in proper diagnosis.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the nursing assessment and other data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Discomfort related to burning, odor, or itching from the infectious process
- Anxiety related to stressful symptoms
- Risk for infection or spread of infection
- Deficient knowledge about proper hygiene and preventive measures

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of discomfort, reduction of anxiety related to stress symptoms, prevention of reinfection or infection of sexual partner, and acquisition of knowledge about methods for preventing vulvovaginal infections and managing self-care.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING DISCOMFORT}

Treatment with the appropriate medication usually relieves discomfort. Sitz baths are occasionally recommended. Use of cornstarch powder may relieve discomfort and skin irritation.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Although vulvovaginal infections are upsetting and require treatment, they are not life-threatening. The patient who experiences such an infection, however, may be anxious and fearful about the significance of the symptoms and possible causes. Explaining the cause of symptoms may reduce anxiety related to fear of a more
serious illness. Discussing ways to help prevent vulvovaginal infections may help the patient adopt specific strategies to decrease infection and the related symptoms.

\section*{PREVENTING REINFECTION OR SPREAD OF INFECTION}

There is a risk of another episode of the same infection or spread of the infection to sexual partners. The patient needs to be informed about these risks and the importance of adequate treatment of herself and her partner, if indicated. Other strategies to prevent persistence or spread of infection include abstaining from sexual intercourse when infected, treatment of sexual partners, and minimizing irritation of the affected area. When medications such as antibiotic agents are prescribed for any infection, the nurse instructs the patient about the usual precautions related to using these agents. If vaginal itching occurs, the patient can be reassured that this is usually not an allergic reaction but may be a yeast or monilial infection resulting from altered vaginal bacteria. Treatment for monilial infection is prescribed.

Another goal of treatment is to reduce tissue irritation caused by scratching or wearing tight clothing. The area needs to be kept clean by daily bathing and adequate hygiene after voiding and defecation. The use of a cool-air hairdryer and application of topical corticosteroids may be useful to keep the area dry and minimize irritation.

When teaching the patient about medications such as suppositories and devices such as applicators to dispense cream or ointment, the nurse may demonstrate the procedure by using a plastic model of the pelvis and vagina. The nurse should also stress the importance of hand washing before and after each administration of medication. To prevent the medication from escaping from the vagina, the patient should recline for 30 minutes after it is inserted, if possible. The patient is informed that seepage of medication may occur, and the use of a perineal pad may be helpful.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Vulvovaginal conditions are treated on an outpatient basis, unless the patient has other medical problems. Patient teaching, tact, and reassurance are important aspects of nursing care. Women may express embarrassment, guilt, or anger and may be concerned that the infection may be serious (causing infertility) or that it may have been acquired from a sex partner. In some instances, treatment plans include the partner.

In addition to reviewing ways of relieving discomfort and preventing reinfection, the nurse assesses each patient's learning needs relative to the immediate problem. The patient needs to know the characteristics of normal as opposed to abnormal discharge. Questions often arise about douching. Normally, douching and use of feminine hygiene sprays are unnecessary because daily baths or showers and proper hygiene after voiding and defecating keep the perineal area clean. Douching tends to eliminate normal flora, reducing the body's ability to ward off infection. In addition, repeated douching may result in vaginal epithelial breakdown and chemical irritation and has been associated with other pelvic disorders.

Therapeutic douching, however, may be recommended and prescribed to reduce unpleasant, abnormal odors; to remove excessive discharge; to change the pH (eg, vinegar douches); and to serve as an antiseptic irrigating solution. The procedure is reviewed with the patient, as is the care and cleaning of equipment so that it is properly disinfected.

In the case of recurrent yeast infections, the perineum should be kept as dry as possible. Loose-fitting cotton instead of tightfitting synthetic, nonabsorbent, heat-retaining underwear is recommended. The patient is instructed to perform a monthly inspection of the vulvar region for changes.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Experiences reduced discomfort
a. Cleans the perineum as instructed
b. Reports that itching is relieved
c. Maintains urine output within normal limits and without dysuria
2. Experiences relief of anxiety
3. Remains free from infection
a. Has no signs of inflammation, pruritus, odor, or dysuria
b. Notes that vaginal discharge appears normal (thin, clear, not frothy)
4. Participates in self-care
a. Takes medication as prescribed
b. Wears absorbent underwear
c. Avoids unprotected sexual intercourse
d. Douches only as prescribed

\section*{HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS}

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is sexually transmitted and is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) among young, sexually active persons. An estimated 5.5 million people become infected with HPV each year in the United States (U.S. Surgeon General's Report, 2001). More than 80 strains exist, some of which are associated with cervical abnormalities, including dysplasia and cancer. Infections can be latent (asymptomatic and detected only by DNA hybridization tests for HPV), subclinical (visualized only after application of acetic acid followed by inspection under magnification), or clinical (visible condylomata acuminata). The most common strains, 6 and 11, usually cause condylomata (warty growths) on the vulva. These are often visible or may be palpable by the patient. Condylomata are rarely premalignant but are an outward manifestation of the virus. Strains 6 and 11 are associated with a low risk for cervical cancer. Some strains may not cause condylomata but affect the cervix, resulting in abnormal Pap smear results. For example, strains $16,18,31,33$, 35, and 45 affect the cervix. Their effects are usually invisible on examination but may be seen on colposcopy. They may cause cervical changes that may appear as koilocytosis on Pap smear or abnormal smear results. These strains are associated with a higher risk for cervical cancer (U.S. Surgeon General's Report, 2001).

The incidence of HPV in young, sexually active women is high. Risk factors include being sexually active, having multiple sex partners, and having sex with a partner who has or has had multiple partners. Alcohol consumption and drug use are risk factors, as both impair careful decision making, judgment, and selfcare (Association of Reproductive Health Practitioners, 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of external genital warts includes topical application of trichloroacetic acid, podophyllin (Podofin, Podocon), and chemotherapeutic agents. Interferon injections are also used in
treatment. These agents are applied by the health care provider. Topical agents that can be applied by the patient to external lesions include podofilox (Condylox) and imiquimod (Aldara). Because the safety of podophyllin, imiquimod, and podofilox during pregnancy has not been determined, these agents should not be used to treat pregnant women. Electrocautery and laser therapy are alternative therapies that may be indicated for patients with a large number or area of genital warts (Centers for Disease Control \& Prevention, 2002).

Treatment usually eradicates perineal warts or condylomata. However, they may resolve spontaneously without treatment and may also recur even with treatment.

If the treatment includes application of the topical agent by the patient, she needs to be carefully instructed in the use of the agent prescribed and must be able to identify the warts and be able to apply the medication to them. The patient is instructed to anticipate mild pain or local irritation with the use of these agents (Centers for Disease Control \& Prevention, 2002).

Patients with HPV should have regular Pap smears, possibly every 6 months for several years, because of the propensity of HPV to cause dysplasia (changes in cervical cells).

Much remains unknown about the subclinical disease and latent phase of the disease. Women are often exposed to this virus by a partner who is unknowingly a carrier. Condoms can prevent transmission, but transmission can also occur during skin-to-skin contact in areas not covered by condoms. In many cases, patients are angry about having warts or HPV and do not know who infected them because the incubation period can be long and partners may have no symptoms. Acknowledging the emotional distress that occurs when an STD is diagnosed and providing support and facts are important nursing actions.

\section*{HERPESVIRUS TYPE 2 INFECTION (HERPES GENITALIS, HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS)}

Herpes genitalis is a recurrent, life-long viral infection that causes herpetic lesions (blisters) on the cervix, vagina, and external genitalia. It is an STD but may also be transmitted asexually from wet surfaces or by self-transmission (ie, touching a cold sore and then touching the genital area). The initial infection is usually very painful and lasts about 1 week, but it can also be asymptomatic. Recurrences are less painful and usually produce minor itching and burning. Some patients have few or no recurrences, whereas others have frequent bouts. Recurrences are often associated with stress, sunburn, dental work, or inadequate rest or nutrition. The incidence of herpes infection has increased fivefold since the late 1970s among Caucasian teenagers and adults in their 20s. At least 50 million persons in the United States have genital herpes infection; most of them have not been diagnosed (Centers for Disease Control \& Prevention, 2002). The prevalence of other STDs has decreased slightly, possibly due to increased condom use, but herpes can be transmitted by contact with skin not covered by a condom. Transmission is possible even when the carrier does not have symptoms (subclinical shedding). Lesions increase vulnerability to HIV infection and other STDs. Vaccines for this virus are in clinical trials.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Of the known herpesviruses, six affect humans: (1) herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), which usually causes cold sores of the lips; (2) herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2), or genital herpes; (3) varicella
zoster, or shingles; (4) Epstein-Barr virus; (5) cytomegalovirus; and (6) human B-lymphotrophic virus. HSV-2 appears to be the cause of about $80 \%$ of genital and perineal lesions; HSV-1 may cause about $20 \%$.

There is considerable overlap between HSV-1 and HSV-2, which are clinically indistinguishable. Close human contact by the mouth, oropharynx, mucosal surface, vagina, or cervix appears necessary to acquire the infection. Other susceptible sites are skin lacerations and conjunctivae. Usually, the virus is killed at room temperature by drying. When viral replication diminishes, the virus ascends the peripheral sensory nerves and remains inactive in the nerve ganglia. Another outbreak may occur when the host is subjected to stress. In pregnant women with active herpes, babies delivered vaginally may become infected with the virus. There is a risk for fetal morbidity and mortality if this occurs; therefore, a cesarean delivery may be performed if the virus recurs near the time of delivery.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Itching and pain accompany the process as the infected area becomes red and swollen (edematous). The vesicular state often appears as a blister, which later coalesces, ulcerates, and encrusts. In women, the labia are the usual primary site, although the cervix, vagina, and perianal skin may be affected. In men, the glans penis, foreskin, or penile shaft is typically affected. Influenza-like symptoms may occur 3 or 4 days after the lesions appear. Inguinal lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes in the groin), minor temperature elevation, malaise, headache, myalgia (aching muscles), and dysuria (pain on urination) are often noted. Pain is evident during the first week and then decreases. The lesions subside in about 2 weeks unless secondary infection occurs.

Rarely, complications may arise from extragenital spread, such as to the buttocks, upper thighs, or even the eyes as a result of touching lesions and then touching other areas. Patients should be advised to wash their hands after contact with lesions. Other potential problems are aseptic meningitis and severe emotional stress related to the diagnosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

There is currently no cure for HSV-2 infection, but treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. Management goals are preventing the spread of infection, making the patient comfortable, decreasing potential health risks, and initiating a counseling and education program. Acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), and famciclovir (Famvir) are antiviral agents that can suppress symptoms and shorten the course of the infection. Other antiviral agents are also available. All of them are effective at reducing the duration of lesions and preventing recurrences. Resistance and long-term side effects do not appear to be major problems. Recurrent episodes are much milder than the initial episode.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH A GENITAL HERPESVIRUS INFECTION}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history and a physical and pelvic examination are important in establishing the nature of the infectious condition. Additionally, the patient is assessed for risk for STDs. The perineum is inspected for painful lesions. Inguinal nodes are
assessed because they often are enlarged and tender during an occurrence of HSV.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to the genital lesions
- Risk for infection or spread of infection
- Anxiety related to the diagnosis
- Deficient knowledge about the disease and its management

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of pain and discomfort, control of infection and its spread, relief of anxiety, knowledge of and adherence to the treatment regimen and selfcare, and knowledge about implications for the future.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The lesions should be kept clean, and proper hygiene practices are advocated. Sitz baths ease discomfort. Clothing should be clean, loose, soft, and absorbent. Aspirin and other analgesics are usually effective in controlling pain. Occlusive ointments and powders are avoided because they prevent the lesions from drying.

If there is considerable pain and malaise, bed rest may be required. The patient is encouraged to increase fluid intake, to be alert for possible bladder distention, and to contact her primary health care provider immediately if she cannot void because of discomfort. Painful voiding may occur if urine comes in contact with the herpes lesions. Discomfort with urination can be reduced by pouring warm water over the vulva during voiding or by sitz baths. When oral acyclovir or other antiviral agents are prescribed, the patient is instructed about when to take the medication and what side effects to note, such as rash and headache. Rest, fluids, and a nutritious diet are recommended to promote recovery.

\section*{PREVENTING INFECTION AND ITS SPREAD}

The risk of reinfection and spread of infection to others or to other structures of the body can be reduced by hand washing, use of barrier methods with sexual contact, and adherence to prescribed medication regimens. Avoidance of contact when obvious lesions are present does not eliminate the risk because the virus can be shed in the absence of symptoms, and lesions may not be visible to the woman. Avoiding stress, sunburn, and other stress-producing situations may decrease the episodes of recurrence.

\section*{RELIEVING ANXIETY}

Concern about the presence of herpes infection, future occurrences of lesions, and the impact of the infection on future relationships and childbearing may cause considerable anxiety in the patient. The nurse can be an important support, listening to the patient's concerns and providing information and instruction. The patient may be angry with her partner if her partner is the probable source of the infection. She may need assistance and support in discussing the infection and its implications with her current sexual partner and in future sexual relationships. The
nurse can refer the patient to a support group to assist in coping with the diagnosis (see Resources at the end of the chapter).

\section*{INCREASING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DISEASE AND ITS TREATMENT}

Patient teaching is an essential part of nursing care of the patient with a genital herpes infection. This includes an adequate explanation about the infection and how it is transmitted, management and treatment strategies, strategies to minimize spread of infection, the importance of adherence to the treatment regimen, and self-care strategies. Because of the increased risk of HIV and other STDs in the presence of skin lesions, an important part of patient education involves instructing the patient to protect herself from exposure to HIV and other STDs. Further details are included in Chart 47-2.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Genital herpes causes physical pain and emotional distress. Usually, the patient is upset on learning the diagnosis. Therefore, when counseling the patient, the nurse should explain the causes of the condition and the manner in which it can be managed. Questions are encouraged because they may indicate that the patient is receptive to learning.

The nurse can provide reassurance that the lesions will heal and that recurrences can be minimized by adopting a healthful lifestyle and by taking prescribed medications. Self-care measures for the person with genital herpes appear in Chart 47-2.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Experiences a reduction in pain and discomfort
2. Keeps infection under control
a. Demonstrates proper hygiene techniques
b. Takes medication as prescribed
c. Consumes adequate fluids
d. Adopts healthy lifestyle (diet, adequate fluid intake, safer sex practices, stress management)
3. Uses strategies to reduce anxiety

d. Reports no recurrence of lesions

\section*{TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME}

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a life-threatening, multisystem disease caused by response to the toxins produced by strains of the bacterium $S$. aureus in susceptible patients. This rare condition is associated with menstruation (although the incidence of menstrual TSS has dramatically decreased due to public awareness, the number of nonmenstrual cases of TSS has not declined).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-425.jpg?height=1083&width=1783&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=109)

Approximately $1 \%$ of women carry strains of staphylococcus capable of producing the responsible toxin. Nonmenstrual TSS occurs after childbirth, after abortion, and in persons with bone and skin infections, postoperative infections, burns, mastitis, and varicella-related cellulitis. Sinusitis, tracheitis, pneumonia, and the presence of foreign bodies (eg, nasal packing, IUDs, contraceptive sponges) have been associated with nonmenstrual TSS.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

In an otherwise healthy person, the onset of TSS occurs with a sudden fever (temperature is always at least $38.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left[102^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right]$ ), chills, malaise, and muscle pain. Vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, headache, and signs suggesting early septic shock may develop. A red, macular rash similar to sunburn (diffuse, macular erythroderma) is a classic sign of TSS. In some patients, this rash appears first on the torso; in others, it is first seen on the hands (palms and fingers) and feet (soles and toes). Inflammation of mucous membranes also may occur. In 7 to 10 days, it desquamates (becomes scaly or peels). Myalgia and dizziness are common. Severe cases can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and cardiac dysfunction may occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Urine output decreases, and the blood urea nitrogen level increases, often resulting in disorientation. Laboratory tests also reveal leukocytosis and elevated bilirubin. Uncontrollable hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) may also occur. The clinical picture of septic shock (described in Chap. 15) results. Respiratory distress may develop as a result of pulmonary edema. If ARDS occurs, the outlook is grave. About $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ of patients with TSS die of complications.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment includes elimination of the source of the infection; administration of fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotic agents; and irrigation of the presumed site of infection. The patient is placed on bed rest, and the treatment plan is directed primarily at controlling the infection and restoring circulating blood volume.

Antibiotic therapy is based on the results of blood, urine, and other cultures. Antistaphylococcal agents are prescribed. Antibiotic therapy has not been found to affect the course of TSS but to prevent recurrence.

In cases of respiratory distress, oxygen therapy is instituted; if signs of acidosis appear, sodium bicarbonate is administered. Calcium is prescribed for hypocalcemia. A Swan-Ganz catheter (for hemodynamic monitoring) and intravenous dopamine may be used to manage shock. The entire treatment plan, including strategies directed toward emotional and psychological concerns, is adjusted according to each patient's condition, which may vary from mild to acute.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The patient with suspected TSS is assessed for factors known to be associated with it: use of tampons (absorbency, length of time a tampon was retained before changing it, trauma that may have occurred with its insertion) or diaphragms and the presence of other risk factors. Additionally, the patient is assessed and treated for complications associated with TSS (DIC and septic shock). The patient is observed for hematomas, petechiae, oozing from needle and infusion sites, cyanosis, and coolness of the nose, fingertips, and toes. The patient is further observed for skin changes and fluid intake and loss; these data assist in evaluating hydration and kidney function. The patient with TSS is usually critically ill
and is cared for in the intensive care unit to facilitate constant monitoring and assessment for the onset of complications and response to treatment. Because of the likelihood of severe septic shock, the patient is monitored closely for changes in vital signs, level of consciousness and responsiveness to stimuli, and laboratory values, including arterial blood gases. The patient's response to prescribed medications and fluids is also evaluated. See Chapter 15 for more information about management of shock.

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Because of the lengthy period that is required for recovery from TSS, the patient must be prepared to increase participation in self-care activities gradually. The patient and caregiver need instructions about detection and prevention of the complications associated with immobility. The nurse also explains the possible causes of TSS and steps to take to prevent its recurrence. Because use of tampons during menstruation has been linked with TSS, women who have had TSS should not use tampons. If a diaphragm is used, it should not be left in place longer than 8 to 10 hours. Using the diaphragm or cervical cap during menses or in the first 3 months postpartum is also discouraged. The risk of developing TSS increases any time a woman bleeds vaginally (ie, during menses and postpartum). Because of the risk of TSS, all women who use tampons should be informed that they must be changed frequently (every 4 hours) and inserted carefully to avoid abrasions (applicators with rough edges should be avoided). Use of superabsorbent tampons is not recommended.

\section*{ENDOCERVICITIS AND CERVICITIS}

Endocervicitis is an inflammation of the mucosa and the glands of the cervix that may occur when organisms gain access to the cervical glands after intercourse and, less often, after procedures such as abortion, intrauterine manipulation, or vaginal delivery. If untreated, the infection may extend into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and pelvic cavity. Inflammation can irritate the cervical tissue, resulting in spotting or bleeding and mucopurulent cervicitis.

\section*{CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA}

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most common causes of endocervicitis, although Mycoplasma may also be involved. Chlamydia causes about 3 million infections every year in the United States; it is most commonly found in young, sexually active people with more than one partner and is transmitted through sexual intercourse (U.S. Surgeon General's Report, 2001). It can result in serious complications, including pelvic infection, an increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Up to $40 \%$ of untreated women develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). One in 20 women of reproductive age in the United States is infected. Chlamydial infections of the cervix often produce no symptoms, but cervical discharge, dyspareunia, dysuria, and bleeding may occur. Other complications include conjunctivitis and perihepatitis. If a pregnant woman is infected, stillbirth, neonatal death, and premature labor may occur. Infants born to infected mothers may experience prematurity, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia.

Chlamydial infection and gonorrhea often coexist. As many as $25 \%$ of females who have chlamydial infections also have gonorrhea. The inflamed cervix that results from this infection may leave a woman more vulnerable to HIV transmission from an infected partner. Gonorrhea is also a major cause of PID, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Fifty percent of women with gonorrhea have no symptoms, but without treat-
ment $40 \%$ may develop PID. In males, urethritis and epididymitis may occur. Diagnosis can be confirmed by culture, smear, or other methods, using a swab to obtain a sample of cervical discharge or penile discharge from the patient's partner.

\section*{Medical Management}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends treating chlamydia with doxycycline for 1 week or with a single dose of azithromycin. Because of the high incidence of coinfection with chlamydia and gonorrhea, treatment for gonorrhea should include treatment for chlamydia as well (CDC, 2002). Partners must also be treated. Pregnant women are cautioned not to take tetracycline because of potential adverse effects on the fetus. In these cases, erythromycin may be prescribed. Results are usually good if treatment begins early. Possible complications from delayed treatment are tubal disease, ectopic pregnancy, PID, and infertility.

Cultures for chlamydia and other STDs should be obtained from all patients who have been sexually assaulted when they first seek medical attention; patients are treated prophylactically. Cultures should then be repeated in 2 weeks. Annual screening for chlamydia is recommended for all sexually active women 20 to 25 years of age and older women with new sex partners or multiple partners (CDC, 2002).

\section*{Nursing Management}

All sexually active women may be at risk for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other STDs, including HIV. Nurses can assist patients in assessing their own risk. Recognition of risk is a first step before changes in behavior occur. Patients should be discouraged from assuming that a partner is "safe" without open, honest discussion. Nonjudgmental attitudes, educational counseling, and role playing may all be helpful.

Because chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other STDs may have a serious effect on future health and fertility and because many STDs can be prevented by the use of condoms and spermicides and careful choice of partners, the nurse can play a major role in talking with patients about how to make sex as safe as possible. Exploring options with patients, determining their use of safer sex practices and their knowledge deficits, and correcting misinformation may prevent morbidity and mortality.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Nurses can educate women and help them to develop communication skills and to initiate discussions about sex with their partners. Communicating with partners about sex, risk, postponing intercourse, and using safer sex behaviors, including use of condoms, may be lifesaving. Some young women report having sex with someone but not being comfortable enough to discuss sexual risk issues. The nurse can pose the question, "If you are uncomfortable talking about sex with this person, how do you feel about having a sexual relationship with this person?"

Reinforcing the need for annual screening for chlamydia and other STDs is an important part of patient teaching. Instructions also include the need for the patient to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of her sex partners are treated (CDC, 2002). The CDC has revised its guidelines and recommends rescreening of all women with chlamydial infections 3 to 4 months after treatment is completed; this is in an effort to protect young women from infertility.

\section*{PELVIC INFECTION (PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE)}

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an inflammatory condition of the pelvic cavity that may begin with cervicitis and may involve the uterus (endometritis), fallopian tubes (salpingitis), ovaries (oophoritis), pelvic peritoneum, or pelvic vascular system. Infection, which may be acute, subacute, recurrent, or chronic and localized or widespread, is usually caused by bacteria but may be attributed to a virus, fungus, or parasite. Gonorrheal and chlamydial organisms are the most likely causes. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has also been implicated. This condition can result in the fallopian tubes becoming narrowed and scarred, which increases the risk for ectopic pregnancy (fertilized eggs become trapped in the tube), infertility, recurrent pelvic pain, tubo-ovarian abscess, and recurrent disease. Rupture of a tubo-ovarian abscess has a 5\% to $10 \%$ mortality rate and usually necessitates a complete hysterectomy. About 1 million women are diagnosed with PID each year in the United States; most are younger than 25 years of age, and one fourth of them have serious sequelae (ie, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain) (Rein, Kasler, Irwin \& Rabiee, 2000). PID is the most common gynecologic cause of hospital admissions in the United States. The true incidence of PID is unknown because most cases are asymptomatic (Ross, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The exact pathogenesis of PID has not been determined, but it is presumed that organisms usually enter the body through the vagina, pass through the cervical canal, colonize the endocervix, and move upward into the uterus. Under various conditions, the organisms may proceed to one or both fallopian tubes and ovaries and into the pelvis. In bacterial infections that occur after childbirth or abortion, pathogens are disseminated directly through the tissues that support the uterus by way of the lymphatics and blood vessels (Fig. 47-1). In pregnancy, the increased blood supply required by the placenta provides more pathways for infection. These postpartum and postabortion infections tend to be unilateral. Infections can cause perihepatic inflammation when the organism invades the peritoneum.

In gonorrheal infections, the gonococci pass through the cervical canal and into the uterus, where the environment, especially during menstruation, allows them to multiply rapidly and spread
to the fallopian tubes and into the pelvis (see Fig. 47-1). The infection is usually bilateral. In rare instances, organisms (eg, tuberculosis) gain access to the reproductive organs by way of the bloodstream from the lungs (see Fig. 47-1). One of the most common causes of salpingitis (inflammation of the fallopian tube) is chlamydia, possibly accompanied by gonorrhea.

Pelvic infection is most commonly caused by sexual transmission but can also occur with invasive procedures such as endometrial biopsy, surgical abortion, hysteroscopy, or IUD insertion. Bacterial vaginosis, a vaginal infection, may predispose women to pelvic infection. Risk factors include early age at first intercourse, multiple sexual partners, frequent intercourse, intercourse without condoms, sex with a partner with an STD, and a history of STDs or previous pelvic infection.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms of pelvic infection usually begin with vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, lower abdominal pelvic pain, and tenderness that occurs after menses. Pain may increase while voiding or with defecation. Other symptoms include fever, general malaise, anorexia, nausea, headache, and possibly vomiting. On pelvic examination, intense tenderness may be noted on palpation of the uterus or movement of the cervix (cervical motion tenderness). Symptoms may be acute and severe or low-grade and subtle.

\section*{Complications}

Pelvic or generalized peritonitis, abscesses, strictures, and fallopian tube obstruction may develop. Obstruction may cause an ectopic pregnancy in the future if a fertilized egg cannot pass a tubal stricture, or scar tissue may occlude the tubes, resulting in sterility. Adhesions are common and often result in chronic pelvic pain; they eventually may require removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Other complications include bacteremia with septic shock and thrombophlebitis with possible embolization.

\section*{Medical Management}

Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is prescribed. Women with mild infections may be treated as outpatients (Ness, Soper, Holley et al., 2002c), but hospitalization may be necessary. Intensive therapy includes bed rest, intravenous fluids, and intravenous antibiotic

therapy. If the patient has abdominal distention or ileus, nasogastric intubation and suction are initiated. Carefully monitoring vital signs and symptoms assists in evaluating the status of the infection. Treating sexual partners is necessary to prevent reinfection.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Infection takes a toll, both physically and emotionally. The patient may feel well one day and experience vague symptoms and discomfort the next. She may also suffer from constipation and menstrual difficulties.

The hospitalized patient is maintained on bed rest and is usually placed in the semi-Fowler's position to facilitate dependent drainage. Accurate recording of vital signs and the characteristics and amount of vaginal discharge is necessary as a guide to therapy.

The nurse administers analgesic agents as prescribed for pain relief. Heat applied safely to the abdomen may also provide some pain relief and comfort.

The nurse minimizes the transmission of infection to others by carefully handling perineal pads with gloves, discarding the soiled pad according to hospital guidelines for disposal of biohazardous material, and performing meticulous hand hygiene.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient must be informed of the need for precautions and must be encouraged to take part in procedures to prevent infecting others and protecting herself from reinfection. If a partner is not well known or has had other sexual partners recently, use of condoms may prevent life-threatening infection and its sequelae. If reinfection occurs or if the infection spreads, symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, malaise, malodorous purulent vaginal discharge, and leukocytosis. Patient teaching consists of explaining how pelvic infections occur, how they can be controlled and avoided, and their signs and symptoms. Guidelines and instructions provided to the patient are summarized in the accompanying Home Care Checklist (Chart 47-3).

All patients who have had PID need to be informed of the signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy (pain, abnormal bleeding, delayed menses, faintness, dizziness, and shoulder pain) because they are prone to this complication. (See Chap. 46 for a discussion of ectopic pregnancy.)

\section*{HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION AND ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME}

Any discussion of vulvovaginal infections must include the topic of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), described in Chapter 52.

The incidence of HIV infection and AIDS is increasing in women. Females represent the fastest-growing segment of the AIDS epidemic. Most are in the reproductive age group, and more than 70\% are African American or Hispanic. More than half are intravenous (or injecting) drug users, whereas the other half have been exposed through sexual contact with HIV-infected partners. Women who exchange sex for drugs are at high risk, as are women who engage in anal intercourse. Heterosexual transmission is the leading cause of new HIV infection in women. Women are nine times more likely to get HIV from men than men are from women. Factors that may account for this difference include a higher quantity of HIV in semen as compared with vaginal secretions, a larger inoculum on ejaculation, retention of HIV-infected semen in the vagina, and traumatic microscopic mucosal injury during intercourse. The presence of genital ulcers or a friable cervix increases risk. Intercourse during menses may also increase risk. Additionally, any break in skin integrity increases the possibility of infection (eg, a herpetic lesion or syphilitic chancre could provide a portal of entry). Nurses need to inform women about the dangers of unprotected sex (Hader, Smith, Moore \& Holmberg, 2001; Healthy People 2010, 2000).

Syphilis appears to accelerate in HIV-positive patients and proceeds directly from primary to tertiary disease in some patients. Chlamydia is associated with a high risk for HIV (which may be related to inflammatory changes of the cervix, providing entry sites). HIV-positive women have a higher rate of HPV, and this risk increases as their CD4 cell count decreases. Infections with HPV and HIV together increase the risk of malignant transformation and cervical cancer. This risk also increases as the CD4 cell count decreases. Thus, women with HIV infection should have frequent Pap smears. HIV-positive women also have larger and more painful herpes lesions with more recurrences, probably related to immunosuppression from their disease. Treatment with acyclovir or other antiviral agents is appropriate for such patients. Pneumonitis, esophagitis, and disseminated skin involvement are common in this population. Candidiasis also occurs frequently in this population; oral candidiasis may signal rapidly advancing disease. Many HIV-infected women have gynecologic disorders,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-428.jpg?height=634&width=1777&top_left_y=1971&top_left_x=208)
including candidiasis, PID, anogenital warts, and cervical dysplasia (Healthy People 2010, 2000).

Women with HIV and women with partners who have HIV must be counseled about safer sex. Consistent use of condoms with an HIV-infected partner can keep seroconversion rates to about $1 \%$, but inconsistent use results in an annual $7.2 \%$ seroconversion rate. Because there is a $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ chance of perinatal transmission, decisions to conceive or to use contraception must be based on teaching and care. (The use of antiretroviral agents by pregnant women has been shown to decrease perinatal transmission of HIV infection significantly. Therefore, the use of these agents during pregnancy must also be discussed.) For those who choose to avoid conception, condoms or condoms with oral contraceptives are possible choices.

Women who are at risk for HIV should be offered testing after informed consent by a trained nurse or counselor. Because patients may be reluctant to discuss risk-taking behavior, routine screening should be offered to all women. Early detection permits early treatment to delay progression of the disease. The nurse plays a crucial role in educating patients about HIV and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS.

\section*{Structural Disorders}

\section*{FISTULAS OF THE VAGINA}

A fistula is an abnormal, tortuous opening between two internal hollow organs or between an internal hollow organ and the exterior of the body. The name of the fistula indicates the two areas that are connected abnormally: a vesicovaginal fistula is an opening between the bladder and the vagina, and a rectovaginal fistula is an opening between the rectum and the vagina (Fig. 47-2). Fistulas may be congenital in origin. In adults, however, breakdown usually occurs because of tissue damage resulting from injury sustained during surgery, vaginal delivery, radiation therapy, or disease processes such as carcinoma.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms depend on the specific defect. For example, in the patient with a vesicovaginal fistula, urine escapes continuously into the vagina. With a rectovaginal fistula, there is fecal incontinence,

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-429.jpg?height=610&width=791&top_left_y=1842&top_left_x=144}

\end{figure}
and flatus is discharged through the vagina. The combination of fecal discharge with leukorrhea results in malodor that is difficult to control.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A history of the symptoms experienced by the patient is important to identify the structural alterations and to assess the impact of the symptoms on the patient's quality of life. In addition, the use of methylene blue dye helps delineate the course of the fistula. In vesicovaginal fistula, the dye is instilled into the bladder and appears in the vagina. After a negative methylene blue test result, indigo carmine is injected intravenously; the appearance of the dye in the vagina indicates a ureterovaginal fistula. Cystoscopy or intravenous pyelography may then be used to determine the exact location.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goal is to eliminate the fistula and to treat infection and excoriation. A fistula may heal without surgical intervention, but surgery is often required. If the primary care provider determines that a fistula will heal without surgical intervention, care is planned to relieve discomfort, prevent infection, and improve the patient's self-concept and self-care abilities. Measures to effect healing include proper nutrition, cleansing douches and enemas, rest, and administration of prescribed intestinal antibiotic agents. A rectovaginal fistula heals faster when the patient eats a low-residue diet and when the affected tissue drains properly. Warm perineal irrigations and controlled heat-lamp treatments promote healing.

Sometimes a fistula does not heal on its own and cannot be surgically repaired. In this situation care must be planned and implemented on an individual basis. Cleanliness, frequent sitz baths, and deodorizing douches are required, as are perineal pads and protective undergarments. Meticulous skin care is necessary to prevent excoriation. Applying bland creams or lightly dusting with cornstarch may be soothing. Additionally, attending to the patient's social and psychological needs is an essential aspect of care.

If the patient will have a fistula repaired surgically, preoperative treatment of any existing vaginitis is important to ensure success. Usually, the vaginal approach is used to repair vesicovaginal and urethrovaginal fistulas; the abdominal approach is used to repair fistulas that are large or complex. Fistulas that are difficult to repair or that are very large may require surgical repair with a urinary or fecal diversion.

Because fistulas usually are related to obstetric, surgical, or radiation trauma, occurrence in a patient without previous vaginal delivery or a history of surgery must be evaluated carefully. Crohn's disease or lymphogranuloma venereum may be the cause.

Despite the best surgical intervention, fistulas may recur. After surgery, medical follow-up continues for at least 2 years to monitor for a possible recurrence.

\section*{PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE: CYSTOCELE, RECTOCELE, ENTEROCELE}

Time and gravity can put strain on the ligaments and structures that make up the female pelvis. Childbirth can result in tears of the levator sling musculature, resulting in structural weakness. Hormone deficiency also may play a role.

Cystocele is a downward displacement of the bladder toward the vaginal orifice (Fig. 47-3) resulting from damage to the an-

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-430.jpg?height=567&width=1796&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=197}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 47-3 Diagrammatic representation of the three most common types of pelvic floor relaxation: (A) cystocele, (B) rectocele, and (C) enterocele. Arrows depict sites of maximum protrusion.}
\end{figure}
terior vaginal support structures. It usually results from injury and strain during childbirth. The condition usually appears some years later when genital atrophy associated with aging occurs, but younger, multiparous, premenopausal women may also be affected.

Rectocele and perineal lacerations may affect the muscles and tissues of the pelvic floor and may occur during childbirth. Because of muscle tears below the vagina, the rectum may pouch upward, thereby pushing the posterior wall of the vagina forward. This structural abnormality is called a rectocele. Sometimes the lacerations may completely sever the fibers of the anal sphincter (complete tear). An enterocele is a protrusion of the intestinal wall into the vagina. Prolapse (if complete prolapse occurs, it may also be referred to as procidentia) results from a weakening of the support structures of the uterus itself; the cervix drops and may protrude from the vagina.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Because a cystocele causes the anterior vaginal wall to bulge downward, the patient may report a sense of pelvic pressure, fatigue, and urinary problems such as incontinence, frequency, and urgency. Back pain and pelvic pain may occur as well. The symptoms of rectocele resemble those of cystocele, with one exception: instead of urinary symptoms, the patient may experience rectal pressure. Constipation, uncontrollable gas, and fecal incontinence may occur in patients with complete tears. Prolapse can result in feelings of pressure and ulcerations and bleeding. Dyspareunia may occur with these disorders.

\section*{Medical Management}

Kegel exercises, which involve contracting or tightening the vaginal muscles, are prescribed to help strengthen these weakened muscles. The exercises are more effective in the early stages of a cystocele. Kegel exercises are easy to do and are recommended for all women, including those with strong pelvic floor muscles (Chart 47-4).

Pessaries can be used to avoid surgery. This device is inserted into the vagina and positioned to keep an organ, such as the bladder, uterus, or intestine, properly aligned when a cystocele, rectocele, or prolapse has occurred. Pessaries are usually ringshaped or doughnut-shaped and are made of various materials, such as rubber or plastic (Fig. 47-4). Rubber pessaries must be avoided in women with latex allergy. The size and type of pessary
are selected and fitted by a gynecologic health care provider. The patient should have the pessary removed, examined, and cleaned by her health care provider at prescribed intervals. At this checkup, vaginal walls are examined for pressure points or signs of irritation. Normally, the patient experiences no pain, discomfort, or discharge with a pessary, but if chronic irritation occurs, alternative measures may be needed.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

In many cases, surgery helps to correct structural abnormalities. The procedure to repair the anterior vaginal wall is called anterior colporrhaphy, repair of a rectocele is called a posterior colporrhaphy, and repair of perineal lacerations is called a perineorrhaphy. These repairs are frequently performed laparoscopically, resulting in short hospital stays and good outcomes. A laparoscope is inserted through a small abdominal incision, the pelvis is visualized, and surgical repairs are performed.

\section*{UTERINE PROLAPSE}

Usually, the uterus and the cervix lie at right angles to the long axis of the vagina and with the body of the uterus inclined slightly forward. The uterus is normally freely movable upon examination. Individual variations may result in an anterior, middle, or posterior uterine position. A backward positioning of the uterus, known as retroversion and retroflexion, is not uncommon (Fig. 47-5).

\section*{Chart 47-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION \\ Performing Kegel (Pelvic Muscle) Exercises}

\footnotetext{
Purposes: To strengthen and maintain the tone of the pubococcygeal muscle, which supports the pelvic organs; reduce or prevent stress incontinence and uterine prolapse; enhance sensation during sexual intercourse; and hasten postpartum healing
1. Become aware of pelvic muscle function by "drawing in" the perivaginal muscles and anal sphincter as if to control urine or defection, but not contracting the abdominal, buttock, or inner thigh muscles.
2. Sustain contraction of the muscles for up to 10 seconds, followed by at least 10 seconds of relaxation.
3. Perform these exercises $30-80$ times a day.

Training and exercise should be individualized for each patient.

\end{figure}

If the structures that support the uterus weaken (typically from childbirth), the uterus may work its way down the vaginal canal (prolapse) and even appear outside the vaginal orifice (procidentia) (Fig. 47-6). As the uterus descends, it may pull the vaginal walls and even the bladder and rectum with it. Symptoms include pressure and urinary problems (incontinence or retention) from displacement of the bladder. The problems are aggravated when the woman coughs, lifts a heavy object, or stands for a long time. Normal activities, even walking up stairs, may aggravate the problem.

\section*{Medical Management}

Pessaries and surgery are two options for treatment. If surgery is the method of treatment used, the uterus is sutured back into place and repaired to strengthen and tighten the muscle bands. In postmenopausal women, the uterus may be removed (hysterectomy). For elderly women or those who are too ill to withstand the strain of surgery, pessaries may be the treatment of choice.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{IMPLEMENTING PREVENTIVE MEASURES}

Some problems related to "relaxed" pelvic muscles (cystocele, rectocele, and uterine prolapse) may be prevented. During pregnancy, early visits to the health care provider permit early detection of problems. During the postpartum period, the woman can be taught to perform Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the uterus.

Delays in obtaining evaluation and treatment may result in complications such as infection, cervical ulceration, cystitis, and hemorrhoids. The nurse encourages the patient to obtain prompt treatment for these structural disorders.

\section*{IMPLEMENTING PREOPERATIVE NURSING CARE}

Before surgery, the patient needs to know the extent of the proposed surgery, the expectations for the postoperative period, and the effect of surgery on future sexual function. In addition, the patient having a rectocele repair needs to know that before surgery, a laxative and a cleansing enema may be prescribed. She may be asked to administer these at home the day before surgery. A perineal shave may be prescribed as well. The patient is usually placed

\begin{figure}

\caption{FIGURE 47-6 Complete prolapse of the uterus through the introitus.}
\end{figure}
in a lithotomy position for surgery, with special attention given to moving both legs in and out of the stirrups simultaneously to prevent muscle strain and excess pressure on the legs and thighs. Other preoperative interventions are similar to those described in Chapter 18.

\section*{INITIATING POSTOPERATIVE NURSING CARE}

Immediate postoperative goals include preventing infection and pressure on any existing suture line. This may require perineal care and may preclude using dressings. The patient is encouraged to void within a few hours after surgery for cystocele and complete tear. If the patient does not void within this period and reports discomfort or pain in the bladder region after 6 hours, she will need to be catheterized. Some physicians prefer to leave an indwelling catheter in place for 2 to 4 days, so some women may return home with a catheter in place. Various other bladder care methods are described in Chapter 44. After each voiding or bowel movement, the perineum is cleansed with warm, sterile saline solution and dried with sterile absorbent material if a perineal incision has been made.

After an external perineal repair, several methods are used in caring for the sutures. In one method, the sutures are left alone until healing occurs (in 5 to 10 days). Thereafter, daily vaginal douches with sterile saline solution may be administered during recovery. In another method-the wet method-small, sterile saline douches are administered twice daily, beginning on the day after surgery and continuing throughout recovery. A heat lamp or hair dryer may be used to help dry the area and promote healing. Commercially available sprays containing combined antiseptic and anesthetic solutions are soothing and effective, and an ice pack applied locally may relieve discomfort. However, the weight of the ice bag must rest on the bed and not on the patient.

Routine postoperative care is similar to that given after abdominal surgery. The patient is positioned in bed with the head and knees elevated slightly. The patient may go home the day of or the day after surgery; the duration of the hospital stay depends on the surgical approach used.

After surgery for a complete perineal laceration (through the rectal sphincter), special care and attention are required. The bladder is drained through the catheter to prevent strain on the sutures. Throughout recovery, stool-softening agents are administered nightly after the patient begins a soft diet.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Predischarge instructions include information pertaining to the gynecologist's postoperative instructions related to douching, using mild laxatives, performing exercise as recommended, and avoiding lifting heavy objects or standing for prolonged periods. The patient is reminded to return to the gynecologist for a follow-up visit and to consult with the physician about when it is safe to resume sexual intercourse.

The patient is instructed to report any pelvic pain, unusual discharge, inability to carry out personal hygiene, and vaginal bleeding. She is advised to continue with perineal exercises, which are recommended to improve muscle strength and tone.

\section*{Benign Disorders}

Vulvitis, an inflammation of the vulva, may occur with other disorders, such as diabetes, dermatologic problems, or poor hygiene, or it may be secondary to irritation from a vaginal discharge related to a specific vaginitis.

Vulvodynia is a chronic syndrome of vulvar discomfort. Symptoms may include burning, stinging, irritation or excoriation. It has been described as primary, with onset at first tampon insertion or sexual experience, or secondary, beginning months or years after first tampon insertion or sexual experience. It may be classified as organic if it has a known cause (infection, trauma, or irritants) or idiopathic if no cause is known. It seems to be similar to a peripheral neuralgia and may respond to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants.

Cyclic vulvitis is a subset of vulvodynia and is characterized by episodes of vulvar discomfort. Typical complaints are recurrent itching and burning, often worsening with menses and after sexual intercourse. Erythema and swelling may occur. It is often related to candidal infection, and fungal cultures are often positive.

Vulvar vestibulitis is a chronic persistent syndrome of severe pain on touch to the vestibular area or attempted vaginal entry, and physical findings of vestibular erythema. Treatment methods vary. Research is ongoing to identify treatment for vulvar vestibulitis, but topical treatments (ie, estrogens, corticosteroids, trichloroacetic acid), surgery, and interferon have been used. Biofeedback has also been used.

\section*{VULVAR CYSTS}

Bartholin's cyst results from the obstruction of a duct in one of the paired vestibular glands located in the posterior third of the vulva, near the vestibule. This cyst is the most common of vulvar tumors. A simple cyst may be asymptomatic, but an infected cyst or abscess may cause discomfort. Infection may be due to a gonococcal organism, Escherichia coli, or S. aureus and can cause an abscess with or without involving the inguinal lymph nodes. Skene's duct cysts may result in pressure, dyspareunia, altered urinary stream, and pain, especially if infection is present. Vestibular cysts, located inferior to the hymen, may also occur.

\section*{Medical Management}

The usual treatment for a Bartholin's cyst is incision and drainage followed by antibiotic therapy. If a cyst is asymptomatic, treatment is unnecessary. Moist heat or sitz baths may promote drainage and resolution. If surgery is necessary, a Word Bartholin gland catheter is usually used. This catheter, a short latex stem with an inflatable bulb at the distal end, creates a tract that preserves the gland and allows for drainage. A nonopioid analgesic agent may be administered before this outpatient procedure. A local anesthetic agent is injected, and the cyst is incised or lanced and irrigated with normal saline; the catheter is inserted and inflated with 2 to 3 mL of water. The catheter stem is then tucked into the vagina to allow freedom of movement. The catheter is left in place for 4 to 6 weeks until the tract re-epithelializes. The patient is informed that discharge should be expected, as the catheter allows drainage of the cyst. She is instructed to contact her primary health care provider if pain occurs because the bulb may be too large for the cavity and fluid may need to be removed. Routine hygiene is encouraged.

Skene's duct cysts can be excised or drained with a Word catheter. Vestibular cysts are excised if symptomatic.

\section*{VULVAR DYSTROPHY}

Vulvar dystrophy is a condition found in older women that causes dry, thickened skin on the vulva or slightly raised, whitish papules, fissures, or macules. Symptoms usually consist of varying degrees of itching, but some patients have no symptoms. A few pa-
tients with vulvar cancer have associated dystrophy (vulvar cancer is discussed later in this chapter). Biopsy with careful follow-up is the standard intervention. Benign dystrophies include lichen planus, simplex chronicus, lichen sclerosus, squamous cell hyperplasia, vulvar vestibulitis, and other dermatoses (Chart 47-5).

\section*{Medical Management}

Topical corticosteroids (ie, hydrocortisone suppositories) are the usual treatment for lichen planus. Petrolatum jelly may relieve pruritus. Use is decreased as symptoms abate. Topical corticosteroids are effective in treating squamous cell hyperplasia. Treatment is often complete in 2 to 3 weeks; this condition is not likely to recur after treatment is complete.

If malignant cells are detected on biopsy, local excision, laser therapy, local chemotherapy, and immunologic treatment are used. Vulvectomy is avoided, if possible, to spare the patient from the stress of disfigurement and possible sexual dysfunction.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Key nursing responsibilities for patients with vulvar dystrophies focus on teaching. Important topics include hygiene and selfmonitoring for signs and symptoms of complications.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Instructions for patients with benign vulvar dystrophies include the importance of maintaining good personal hygiene and keeping the vulva dry. Lanolin or hydrogenated vegetable oil is recommended for relief of dryness. Sitz baths may help but should not be overused because dryness

\section*{Types of Benign Vulvar Disorders}

Lichen Planus and Simplex Chronicus
- Chronic vulvar and vaginal disorders that are diagnosed by biopsy
- May appear as mild inflammation or as severe erosion
- Result in redness, lesions, pain, and dyspareunia

Lichen Sclerosus
- A benign epithelial disorder that is most common in prepubertal and postmenopausal females
- A familial tendency toward this condition may exist.
- Epithelial thinning, edema, and fibrosis occur, and the vulva appears white and paper thin.
- Bleeding and pruritus may occur, and intercourse may be difficult.
- Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy.

Squamous Cell Hyperplasia
- A benign epithelial disorder that may look like lichen sclerosus but is not inflamed
- Causes itching and plaquelike excoriated skin
- Must be differentiated from vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma in situ by biopsy
Vulvar Vestibulitis
- An inflammatory process associated with vulvodynia and possibly interstitial cystitis
- Causes pain during and after intercourse; discomfort may also preclude intercourse
- Onset of symptoms may be related to vaginal infection, laser treatment, history of sexual abuse, or excessive washing with irritant soaps.
- Examination reveals redness, inflammation, and tenderness.
may result or increase. The patient is instructed to notify her primary health care provider about any change or ulceration because biopsy may be necessary to rule out squamous cell carcinoma.

By encouraging all patients to perform genital self-examinations regularly and have any itching, lesions, or unusual symptoms assessed by a health care provider, nurses can help prevent complications and progression of vulvar lesions.

\section*{OVARIAN CYSTS}

The ovary is a common site for cysts, which may be simple enlargements of normal ovarian constituents, the graafian follicle, or the corpus luteum, or they may arise from abnormal growth of the ovarian epithelium.

Dermoid cysts are tumors that are thought to arise from parts of the ovum that normally disappear with ripening (maturation). Their origin is undefined, and they consist of undifferentiated embryonal cells. They grow slowly and are found during surgery to contain a thick, yellow, sebaceous material arising from the skin lining. Hair, teeth, bone, and many other tissues are found in a rudimentary state within these cysts. Dermoid cysts are only one type of lesion that may develop. Many other types can occur, and treatment usually depends on the type.

The patient may or may not report acute or chronic abdominal pain. Symptoms of a ruptured cyst mimic various acute abdominal emergencies, such as appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy. Larger cysts may produce abdominal swelling and exert pressure on adjacent abdominal organs.

Polycystic ovary syndrome, a complex endocrine condition involving a disorder in the hypothalamic-pituitary and ovarian network or axis resulting in anovulation, occurs in women of childbearing age. Symptoms are related to androgen excess. Irregular periods resulting from lack of regular ovulation, obesity, and hirsutism may be presenting complaints. Cysts form in the ovaries because the hormonal milieu cannot cause ovulation on a regular basis. Onset may occur at menarche or later. When pregnancy is desired, medications to stimulate ovulation are often effective. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome may develop insulin resistance and may be at higher risk for cardiac disorders in later life.

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment of large ovarian cysts is usually surgical removal. For cysts that are small and appear to be fluid-filled or physiologic in a young, healthy patient, however, oral contraceptives may be used to suppress ovarian activity and resolve the cyst. Oral contraceptives are also usually prescribed to treat polycystic ovary syndrome. About $98 \%$ of cysts that occur in women aged 29 years and younger are benign. In women older than 50 years of age, only half of these cysts are benign. The postoperative nursing care after surgery to remove an ovarian cyst is similar to that after abdominal surgery, with one exception. The marked decrease in intra-abdominal pressure resulting from removal of a large cyst usually leads to considerable abdominal distention. This complication may be prevented to some extent by applying a snug-fitting abdominal binder.

Some surgeons discuss the option of a hysterectomy when a woman is undergoing a bilateral ovary removal because of a suspicious mass because it may increase life expectancy, avoid a later second surgery, and save on health care costs. It is preventive in that future cancer is avoided, as is benign disease that might require hysterectomy. Patient preference is a priority in determining its appropriateness.

\section*{BENIGN TUMORS OF THE UTERUS: FIBROIDS (LEIOMYOMAS, MYOMAS)}

Myomatous or fibroid tumors of the uterus are estimated to occur in $25 \%$ of women over age 30 . Some women are genetically predisposed. They are a common reason for hysterectomy as they often result in menorrhagia that can be difficult to control. They arise from the muscle tissue of the uterus and can be found in the lining (intracavitary), muscle wall (intramural), and outside surface (serosal) of the uterus. They develop slowly in women between the ages of 25 and 40 and may become large. Fibroids may cause no symptoms, or they may produce abnormal vaginal bleeding. Other symptoms are due to pressure on the surrounding organs and include pain, backache, constipation, and urinary problems. Menorrhagia (excessive bleeding) and metrorrhagia (irregular bleeding) may occur because fibroids may distort the uterine lining (Fig. 47-7).

\section*{Medical Management}

The treatment of uterine fibroids depends to a large extent on their size, symptoms, and location. The patient with minor symptoms is closely monitored. If she plans to have children, treatment is as conservative as possible. As a rule, large tumors that produce pressure symptoms should be removed (myomectomy). The uterus may be removed (hysterectomy) if symptoms are bothersome and childbearing is completed (see later discussion of nursing care for a patient having a hysterectomy).

Several other alternatives to hysterectomy have been developed for the treatment of excessive bleeding due to fibroids. These include:
- Hysteroscopic resection of myomas: a laser is used through a hysteroscope passed through the cervix; no incision or overnight stay is needed

\begin{figure}

- Uterine artery embolization: polyvinyl alcohol particles are injected into the blood vessels that supply the fibroid, shrinking it; this procedure may result in serious complications such as pain, infection, and bleeding
Fibroids usually shrink and disappear during menopause, when estrogen is no longer produced. Medications (eg, leuprolide [Lupron]) or other GnRH analogs that induce medical menopause may be prescribed to shrink the tumors. This treatment consists of monthly injections, which may cause hot flashes and vaginal dryness. This treatment is usually short term (ie, before surgery) to shrink the fibroids, allowing easier surgery, and to alleviate anemia, which may coexist due to heavy menstrual flow. Antifibrotic agents are under investigation for long-term treatment of fibroids. Mifepristone (RU 486), a progesterone antagonist, has also been prescribed.

\section*{ENDOMETRIOSIS}

In endometriosis, a benign lesion or lesions with cells similar to those lining the uterus grow aberrantly in the pelvic cavity outside the uterus. Often, extensive endometriosis causes few symptoms, whereas an isolated lesion may produce severe symptoms. Between 7\% and 10\% of women in the United States are affected by this disorder (Olive \& Pritts, 2001). It is a major cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility. In order of frequency, pelvic endometriosis involves the ovary, uterosacral ligaments, cul-de-sac, rectovaginal septum, uterovesical peritoneum, cervix, outer surface of the uterus, umbilicus, laparotomy scar tissue, hernial sacs, and appendix.

Endometriosis has been diagnosed more frequently as a result of the increased use of laparoscopy. Before laparoscopy, major surgery was necessary before a diagnosis could be made. There is a high incidence among patients who bear children late and among those who have fewer children. In countries where tradition favors early marriage and early childbearing, endometriosis is rare. There also appears to be a familial predisposition to endometriosis; it is more common in women whose close female relatives are affected. Other factors that may suggest increased risk include a shorter menstrual cycle (less than every 27 days), flow longer than 7 days, outflow obstruction, and younger age at menarche. Characteristically, endometriosis is found in young, nulliparous women between the ages of 25 and 35 years. It is also found in teens, particularly those with dysmenorrhea that does not respond to NSAIDs or oral contraceptives.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Misplaced endometrial tissue responds to and depends on ovarian hormonal stimulation. During menstruation, this ectopic tissue bleeds, mostly into areas having no outlet, which causes pain and adhesions. The lesions are typically small and puckered, with a blue/brown/gray powder-burn appearance and brown or blueblack appearance, indicating concealed bleeding. They may also have an atypical appearance as red, white, petechial, and reddishbrown implants.

Endometrial tissue contained within an ovarian cyst has no outlet for the bleeding; this formation is referred to as a pseudo-
cyst or chocolate cyst. Adhesions, cysts, and scar tissue may result, causing pain and infertility.

Currently the best-accepted theory regarding the origin of endometrial lesions is the transplantation theory, which suggests that a backflow of menses (retrograde menstruation) transports endometrial tissue to ectopic sites through the fallopian tubes. Transplantation of tissue can also occur during surgery if endometrial tissue is transferred inadvertently by way of surgical instruments. Retrograde menstruation has been found to occur in many women, not just those with endometriosis. Why some women develop this condition and others do not is unknown. Endometrial tissue can also be spread by lymphatic or venous channels.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms vary but include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic discomfort or pain. Dyschezia (pain with bowel movements) and radiation of pain to the back or leg may occur. Depression, loss of work due to pain, and relationship difficulties may result. Infertility may occur because of fibrosis and adhesions or because of a variety of substances (prostaglandins, cytokines, other factors) produced by the implants (Olive \& Pritts, 2001).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

A health history, including an account of the menstrual pattern, is necessary to elicit specific symptoms. On bimanual pelvic examination, fixed tender nodules are sometimes palpated and uterine mobility may be limited, indicating adhesions. Laparoscopic examination confirms the diagnosis and helps to stage the disease. In stage 1, the patient has superficial or minimal lesions; stage 2, mild involvement; stage 3 , moderate involvement; and stage 4 , deep involvement and dense adhesions, with obliteration of the cul-de-sac.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment depends on the symptoms, the patient's desire for pregnancy, and the extent of the disease. If the woman does not have symptoms, routine examination may be all that is required. Other therapy for varying degrees of symptoms may be NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists, or surgery. Pregnancy often alleviates symptoms because neither ovulation nor menstruation occurs.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Palliative measures include use of medications, such as analgesic agents and prostaglandin inhibitors, for pain. Hormonal therapy is effective in suppressing endometriosis and relieving dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain). Oral contraceptives are used frequently. Side effects that may occur with oral contraceptives include fluid retention, weight gain, or nausea. These can usually be managed by changing brands or formulations. Depo-Provera or Lunelle, injectable contraceptive agents, may also be used.

Several types of hormonal therapy are also available in addition to the oral contraceptives. A synthetic androgen, danazol (Danocrine), causes atrophy of the endometrium and subsequent amenorrhea. The medication inhibits the release of gonadotropin with minimal overt sex hormone stimulation. The drawbacks of this medication are that it is expensive and may cause troublesome side effects such as fatigue, depression, weight gain, oily skin, decreased breast size, mild acne, hot flashes, and vaginal at-
rophy. GnRH agonists decrease estrogen production and cause subsequent amenorrhea. Side effects are related to low estrogen levels (eg, hot flashes and vaginal dryness). Loss of bone density is often offset by concurrent use of estrogen. Leuprolide, another medication, is injected monthly to suppress hormones, induce an artificial menopause, and thereby avoid menstrual effects and relieve endometriosis. Some clinicians prescribe a combination of therapies. Most women continue treatment despite side effects, and symptoms diminish for $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of women with mild to moderate endometriosis.

Assisted reproductive techniques may be warranted and effective in women with infertility secondary to endometriosis (Olive \& Pritts, 2002). Hormonal medications are not used, however, in patients with a history of abnormal vaginal bleeding or liver, heart, or kidney disease. Bone density is followed carefully because of the risk of bone loss; hormone therapy is usually short-term.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

If conservative measures are not helpful, surgery may be necessary to relieve pain and enhance the possibility of pregnancy. Surgery may be combined with use of medical therapy. The procedure selected depends on the patient. Laparoscopy may be used to fulgurate (cut with high-frequency current) endometrial implants and to release adhesions. Laser surgery is another option made possible by laparoscopy. Laser therapy vaporizes or coagulates the endometrial implants, thereby destroying this tissue. Other surgical options include endocoagulation and electrocoagulation, laparotomy, abdominal hysterectomy, oophorectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and appendectomy. For women older than 35 or those willing to sacrifice reproductive capability, total hysterectomy is an option. Endometriosis recurs in many women.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The health history and physical examination focus on specific symptoms (eg, pain) and when and how long they have been bothersome, the effect of prescribed medications, and the woman's reproductive plans. This information helps in determining the treatment plan. Explaining the various diagnostic procedures may help to alleviate the patient's anxiety. Patient goals include relief of pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and avoidance of infertility.

As the treatment progresses, the woman with endometriosis and her partner may find that pregnancy is not easily possible, and the psychosocial impact of this realization must be recognized and addressed. Alternatives, such as in vitro fertilization or adoption, may be discussed at an appropriate time and referrals offered.

The nurse's role in patient education is to dispel myths and encourage the patient to seek care if dysmenorrhea or dyspareunia occurs. The Endometriosis Association (listed at the end of this chapter) is a helpful resource for patients seeking further information and support for this condition, which can cause disabling pain and severe emotional distress.

\section*{ADENOMYOSIS}

In adenomyosis, the tissue that lines the endometrium invades the uterine wall. The incidence is highest in women ages 40 to 50. Symptoms include hypermenorrhea (excessive and prolonged bleeding), acquired dysmenorrhea, polymenorrhea (abnormally frequent bleeding), and premenstrual staining. Physical examination findings on palpation include an enlarged, firm, and tender uterus. Treatment depends on the severity of bleeding and pain. Hysterectomy may offer greater relief than more conservative therapies.

\section*{Malignant Conditions}

Malignant tumors of the female reproductive system (excluding breast cancer) occur in 274,000 women and are estimated to kill more than 27,000 women in the United States each year. Estimated incidence and estimated mortality for the United States in 2000 are (American Cancer Society, 2002):
- Cervical cancer (estimates do not include in situ cancers): 13,000 new cases, 4,100 deaths
- Uterine cancer: 39,300 new cases, 6,600 deaths
- Ovarian cancer: 23,300 new cases, 13,900 deaths
- Vaginal cancer: 2,000 new cases, 800 deaths
- Vulvar cancer: 3,800 new cases, 800 deaths

Although some cancers are difficult to detect or prevent, yearly pelvic examination with a Pap smear is a painless and relatively inexpensive method of early detection. Health care providers can encourage women to follow this health practice by providing nonstressful examinations that are educational and supportive and offering an opportunity for the patient to ask questions and clarify misinformation. If more women understood that the pelvic examination and Pap smear do not have to be uncomfortable or embarrassing, early detection rates would undoubtedly improve, and lives would be saved.

\section*{CANCER OF THE CERVIX}

Carcinoma of the cervix is predominantly squamous cell cancer ( $10 \%$ are adenocarcinomas). During the past 20 years, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer has decreased from 14.2 cases per 100,000 women to 7.8 cases per 100,000 women. It is less common than it once was because of early detection of cell changes by Pap smear. However, it is still the third most common female reproductive cancer and affects about 13,000 women in the United States every year (American Cancer Society, 2002). Cervical cancer occurs most commonly in women ages 30 to 45, but it can occur as early as age 18. Risk factors include multiple sex partners, early age at first coitus, short interval between menarche and first coitus, sexual contact with men whose partners have had cervical cancer, exposure to the HPV virus, and smoking (Chart 47-6).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

There are several different types of cervical cancer. Most cancers originate in squamous cells, while the remainder are adenocarcinomas or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas begin in mucus-producing glands and are often due to HPV infection. Most cervical cancers, if not detected and treated, spread to regional pelvic lymph nodes, and local recurrence is not uncommon. Early cervical cancer rarely produces symptoms. If symptoms are present, they may go unnoticed as a thin watery vaginal discharge often noticed after intercourse or douching. When symptoms such as discharge, irregular bleeding, or bleeding after sexual intercourse occur, the disease may be advanced. Advanced disease should not occur if all women have access to gynecologic care and avail themselves of it. The nurse's role in access and utilization is crucial and may prevent the delay of detection of cervical cancer until the advanced stage.

In advanced cervical cancer, the vaginal discharge gradually increases and becomes watery and, finally, dark and foul-smelling from necrosis and infection of the tumor. The bleeding, which occurs at irregular intervals between periods (metrorrhagia) or after menopause, may be slight (just enough to spot the undergarments)
sonably predicted. The International Classification adopted by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics and included in the NIH Consensus Conference on Cervical Cancer (1996) (Table 47-2) is the most widely used staging system; the TNM (tumor, nodes, and metastases) classification is also used in describing cancer stages. In this system, T refers to the extent of the primary tumor, N to lymph node involvement, and M to metastasis, or spread of the disease.

Signs and symptoms are evaluated, and x-rays, laboratory tests, and special examinations, such as punch biopsy and colposcopy, are performed. Depending on the stage of the cancer, other tests and procedures may be performed to determine the extent of disease and appropriate treatment. These tests include dilation and curettage (D \& C), computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intravenous urography, cystography, and barium x-ray studies.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{PRECURSOR OR PREINVASIVE LESIONS}

When precursor lesions, such as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL), which is also referred to as LSIL (CIN I and II or mild to moderate dysplasia), are found by colposcopy
and occurs usually after mild trauma or pressure (eg, intercourse, douching, or bearing down during defecation). As the disease continues, the bleeding may persist and increase. Leg pain, dysuria, rectal bleeding, and edema of extremities signal advanced disease.

As the cancer advances, it may invade the tissues outside the cervix, including the lymph glands anterior to the sacrum. In one third of patients with invasive cervical cancer, the disease involves the fundus. The nerves in this region may be affected, producing excruciating pain in the back and the legs that is relieved only by large doses of opioid analgesic agents. If the disease progresses, it often produces extreme emaciation and anemia, usually accompanied by fever due to secondary infection and abscesses in the ulcerating mass, and by fistula formation. Because the survival rate for in situ cancer is $100 \%$ and the rate for women with more advanced stages of cervical cancer decreases dramatically, early detection is essential.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Diagnosis may be made on the basis of abnormal Pap smear results, followed by biopsy results identifying severe dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type III [CIN III], high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HGSIL] [also referred to as HSIL], or carcinoma in situ; see below). HPV infections are usually implicated in these conditions. Biopsy results may indicate carcinoma in situ. Carcinoma in situ is technically classified as severe dysplasia and is defined as cancer that has extended through the full thickness of the epithelium of the cervix, but not beyond. This is often referred to as preinvasive cancer.

In its very early stages, invasive cervical cancer is found microscopically by Pap smear. In later stages, pelvic examination may reveal a large, reddish growth or a deep, ulcerating lesion. The patient may report spotting or bloody discharge.

When the patient has been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer, clinical staging estimates the extent of the disease so that treatment can be planned more specifically and prognosis rea-

and biopsy, careful monitoring by frequent Pap smears or conservative treatment is possible. Conservative treatment may consist of monitoring, cryotherapy (freezing with nitrous oxide), or laser therapy. A loop electrocautery excision procedure (LEEP) may also be used to remove abnormal cells. In this procedure, a thin wire loop with laser is used to cut away a thin layer of cervical tissue. LEEP is an outpatient procedure usually performed in a gynecologist's office; it takes only a few minutes. Analgesia is given before the procedure, and a local anesthetic agent is injected into the area. This procedure allows the pathologist to examine the removed tissue sample to determine if the borders of the tissue are disease-free. Another procedure called a cone biopsy or conization (removing a cone-shaped portion of the cervix) is performed when biopsy findings demonstrate CIN III or HGSIL, equivalent to severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ.

If preinvasive cervical cancer (carcinoma in situ) occurs when a woman has completed childbearing, a hysterectomy is usually recommended. If a woman has not completed childbearing and invasion is less than 1 mm , a cone biopsy may be sufficient. Frequent re-examinations are necessary to monitor for recurrence.

A newly developed procedure called a radical trachelectomy is an alternative to hysterectomy in women with cervical cancer who are young and want to have children (Dargent, Martin, Sacchetoni \& Mathevet, 2000). In this procedure the cervix is gripped with retractors and pulled into the vagina until it is visible. The affected tissue is excised while the rest of the cervix and uterus remain intact. A drawstring suture is placed to close the cervix.

Patients who have precursor or premalignant lesions need reassurance that they do not have invasive cancer. However, the importance of close follow-up is emphasized because the condition, if untreated for a long time, may progress to cancer. Patients with cervical cancer in situ also need to know that this is usually a slowgrowing and nonaggressive type of cancer that is not expected to recur after appropriate treatment.

\section*{INVASIVE CANCER}

Treatment of invasive cervical cancer depends on the stage of the lesion, the patient's age and general health, and the judgment and experience of the physician. Surgery and radiation treatment (intracavitary and external) are most often used. When tumor invasion is less than 3 mm , a hysterectomy is often sufficient. Invasion exceeding 3 mm usually requires a radical hysterectomy with pelvic node dissection and aortic node assessment. Stage 1B1 tumors are treated with radical hysterectomy and radiation. Stage 1B2 tumors are treated individually because no single correct course has been determined, and many variable options may be seen clinically (Chart 47-7). Frequent follow-up after surgery by a gynecologic oncologist is imperative because the risk of recurrence is $35 \%$ after treatment for invasive cervical cancer. Recurrence usually occurs within the first 2 years. Recurrences are often in the upper quarter of the vagina, and ureteral obstruction may be a sign. Weight loss, leg edema, and pelvic pain may be signs of lymphatic obstruction and metastasis.

Radiation, which is often part of treatment to reduce recurrent disease, may be delivered by an external beam or by brachytherapy (method by which the radiation source is placed near the tumor) or both. The field to be irradiated and dose of radiation are determined by stage, volume of tumor, and lymph node involvement. Treatment can be administered daily for 4 to 6 weeks followed by one or two treatments of intracavitary radiation. Interstitial therapy may be used when vaginal placement has become impossible due to tumor or stricture.

Chelpt
$41-7$ Surgical Procedures for Cervical Cancer

Surgical procedures that may be carried out to treat cervical cancer include the following:
- Total hysterectomy-removal of the uterus, cervix, and ovaries
- Radical hysterectomy-removal of the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, proximal vagina, and bilateral lymph nodes through an abdominal incision (Note: "radical" indicates that an extensive area of the paravaginal, paracervical, parametrial, and uterosacral tissues is removed with the uterus.)
- Radical vaginal hysterectomy-vaginal removal of the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and proximal vagina
- Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy-removal of the common iliac, external iliac, hypogastric, and obturator lymphatic vessels and nodes
- Pelvic exenteration-removal of the pelvic organs, including the bladder or rectum and pelvic lymph nodes, and construction of diversional conduit, colostomy, and vagina
- Radical trachelectomy-removal of the cervix and selected nodes to preserve childbearing capacity in a woman of reproductive age with cervical cancer

Platinum-based agents are being used to treat advanced cervical cancer. They are often used in combination with radiation therapy, surgery, or both. Studies are ongoing to find the best approach to treat advanced cervical cancer. Vaginal stenosis is a frequent side effect of radiation. Sexual activity with lubrication is preventive, as is use of a vaginal dilator to avoid severe permanent vaginal stenosis.

Some patients with recurrences of cervical cancer are considered for pelvic exenteration, in which a large portion of the pelvic contents is removed. Unilateral leg edema, sciatica, and ureteral obstruction indicate likely disease progression. Patients with these symptoms have advanced disease and are not considered candidates for this major surgical procedure. Surgery is often complex because it is performed close to the bowel, bladder, ureters, and great vessels. Complications can be considerable and include pulmonary emboli, pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hemorrhage, sepsis, small bowel obstruction, fistula formation, urinary obstruction of ileal conduit, bladder dysfunction, and pyelonephritis, most often in the first 18 months. Vein constriction must be avoided postoperatively. Patients with varicose veins or a history of thromboembolic disease may be treated prophylactically with heparin. Pneumatic compression stockings are prescribed to reduce the risk for deep vein thrombosis. Nursing care of these patients is complex and requires coordination and care by experienced health care professionals. This is a complex, extensive surgical procedure that is reserved for those with a high likelihood of cure.

\section*{PREGNANCY-RELATED NEOPLASM}

Hydatidiform mole is a type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasm that occurs in 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. Delayed menses with spotting is the most common sign. Hyperemesis and uterine enlargement beyond that expected for gestational dates are also indicative. Moles can be partial or complete. Complete moles are more likely to be associated with medical complications. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (formerly called preeclampsia), a pregnancy-related complex of symptoms that may include edema, hypertension, and proteinuria, may occur. Treatment consists of suction curettage followed by monitoring serial beta-human
chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels, which usually take about 2.5 months to return to normal. This condition may recur. Moles can be invasive also.

Choriocarcinoma, another gestational neoplasm that usually occurs in the postpartum period, is a placental site trophoblastic tumor. These malignancies are being diagnosed more readily and treated more effectively today due to the availability of testing for HCG, a sensitive marker that can be used for monitoring. Ultrasound is also used for making the diagnosis. These malignancies are usually found in obstetric patients and are described in detail in obstetric and oncologic textbooks. Nurses need to be aware that these conditions are traumatic, anxiety-producing, and often very stressful for the patient since they are often associated with pregnancy loss.

\section*{CANCER OF THE UTERUS (ENDOMETRIUM)}

Cancer of the uterine endometrium (fundus or corpus) has increased in incidence, partly because people are living longer and because reporting is more accurate. Most uterine cancers are endometrioid (that is, originating in the lining of the uterus). After breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and the most common pelvic neoplasm. Cumulative exposure to estrogen is considered the major risk factor (Chart 47-8). This exposure occurs with the use of estrogen replacement therapy without the use of progestin, early menarche, late menopause, never having children, and anovulation. Other risk factors include infertility, diabetes, hypertension, gallbladder disease, and obesity (American Cancer Society, 2002). Tamoxifen may also cause proliferation of the uterine lining, and women receiving this medication for treatment or prevention of breast cancer are monitored by their oncologists. Another less common type of cancer of the uterus is not estrogen-dependent and is found in multiparous, thin women.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

All women should be encouraged to have annual checkups, including a gynecologic examination. Any woman who is experiencing irregular bleeding should be evaluated promptly. If a menopausal or perimenopausal woman experiences bleeding, an endometrial aspiration or biopsy is performed to rule out hyperplasia, a possible precursor of endometrial cancer. The procedure is quick and painless. Ultrasonography can also be used to measure the thickness of the endometrium. (Postmenopausal women should have a very thin endometrium due to low levels of estro-

\section*{Risk Factors for Uterine Cancer}
- Age: at least 55 years; median age, 61 years
- Postmenopausal bleeding
- Obesity that results in increased estrone levels (related to excess weight) resulting from conversion of androstenedione to estrone in body fat, which exposes the uterus to unopposed estrogen
- Unopposed estrogen therapy (estrogen used without progesterone, which offsets the risk of unopposed estrogen)
- Other: nulliparity, truncal obesity, late menopause (after 52 years of age) and, possibly, use of tamoxifen
gen; a thicker lining warrants further investigation.) A biopsy or aspiration is diagnostic.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of endometrial cancer consists of total hysterectomy (discussed later in this chapter) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and node sampling. Depending on the stage, the therapeutic approach is individualized and is based on stage, type, differentiation, degree of invasion, and node involvement. Whole pelvis radiotherapy is used if there is any spread beyond the uterus. Preoperative and postoperative treatments for stage II and beyond may include pelvic, abdominal, and vaginal intracavitary radiation. Recurrent cancer usually occurs inside the vaginal vault or in the upper vagina, and metastasis usually occurs in lymph nodes or the ovary. Recurrent lesions in the vagina are treated with surgery and radiation. Recurrent lesions beyond the vagina are treated with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Progestin therapy is used frequently. Patients should be prepared for such side effects as nausea, depression, rash, or mild fluid retention with this therapy.

\section*{CANCER OF THE VULVA}

Primary cancer of the vulva represents $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ of all gynecologic malignancies and is seen mostly in postmenopausal women, although its incidence in younger women is increasing. The median age for cancer limited to the vulva is 44 years, whereas the median age for invasive vulvar cancer is 61 years. Possible risk factors include hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and immunosuppression. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for most primary vulvar tumors. Less common are Bartholin's gland cancer and malignant melanoma. Little is known about what causes this disease; however, increased risk may be related to chronic vulvar irritation, vulvar disorders, HPV, and smoking.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Long-standing pruritus and soreness are the most common symptoms of vulvar cancer. Itching occurs in half of all patients with vulvar malignancy. Bleeding, foul-smelling discharge, and pain may also be present and are usually signs of advanced disease. Cancerous lesions of the vulva are visible and accessible and grow relatively slowly. Early lesions appear as a chronic dermatitis; later, the patient may note a lump that continues to grow and becomes a hard, ulcerated, cauliflower-like growth. Biopsy should be performed on any vulvar lesion that persists, ulcerates, or fails to heal quickly with proper therapy. Vulvar malignancies may appear as a lump or mass, redness, or a lesion that fails to heal.

The nurse is in an ideal position to encourage a woman to perform vulvar self-examination regularly. Using a mirror, the patient can see what constitutes normal female anatomy and learn about changes that should be reported (eg, lesions, ulcers, masses, and persistent itching). The nurse must urge women to seek health care if they notice anything abnormal because this is one of the most curable of all malignant conditions.

\section*{Medical Management}

Vulvar intraepithelial lesions are preinvasive and are also called vulvar carcinoma in situ. They may be treated by local excision, laser ablation, chemotherapeutic creams (ie, 5-fluorouracil), or cryosurgery.

When invasive vulvar carcinoma exists, primary treatment may include wide excision or removal of the vulva (vulvectomy). An effort is made to individualize treatment, depending on the extent of the disease. A wide excision is performed only if lymph nodes are normal. More pervasive lesions require vulvectomy with deep pelvic node dissection. Vulvectomy is very effective at prolonging life but is frequently followed by complications (ie, scarring, wound breakdown, leg swelling, vaginal stenosis, or rectocele). To reduce complications, only necessary tissue is removed.

Radiation is used to treat unresectable tumors or cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. If a widespread area is involved or the disease is advanced, a radical vulvectomy with bilateral groin dissection may be performed. Excision and evaluation of the sentinel node, which drains the primary tumor, may be performed. If negative, full groin dissection may be omitted (Duffy, 2001). Antibiotic and heparin prophylaxis may be prescribed preoperatively and continued postoperatively to prevent infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary emboli. Elastic compression stockings are applied to reduce the risk for deep vein thrombosis.

Clinical trials to determine the most effective treatment are difficult to conduct, as there are few patients with this condition. Morbidity with recurrence of the disease is high. Patterns can vary in patients.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING VULVAR SURGERY}

\begin{abstract}
Assessment
The health history is a valuable tool for establishing rapport with the patient. The reason the patient is seeking health care is apparent. What the nurse can tactfully elicit is the reason why a delay, if any, occurred, in seeking health care-for example, because of modesty, economics, denial, neglect, or fear (abusive partners sometimes prevent women from seeking health care). Factors involved in any delay in seeking health care and treatment may also affect the patient's recovery. The patient's health habits and lifestyle are assessed, and her receptivity to teaching is evaluated. Psychosocial factors are also assessed. Preoperative preparation and psychological support begin at this time.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Anxiety related to the diagnosis and surgery
- Acute pain related to the surgical incision and subsequent wound care
- Impaired skin integrity related to the wound and drainage
- Sexual dysfunction related to change in body image
- Self-care deficit related to lack of understanding of perineal care and general health status

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Wound infection and sepsis
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Hemorrhage

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include acceptance of and preparation for surgical intervention, relief of pain, maintenance of skin integrity, recovery of optimal sexual function, ability to perform adequate and appropriate self-care, and absence of complications.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING ANXIETY}

The patient must be allowed time to talk and ask questions. Fear often decreases when a woman of childbearing age who is to undergo wide excision of the vulva or vulvectomy learns that the possibility for subsequent sexual relations is good and that pregnancy is possible after a wide excision. The nurse must know what information the physician has given the patient about the surgery to reinforce that information and address the patient's questions and concerns.

\section*{PREPARING SKIN FOR SURGERY}

Skin preparation may include cleansing the lower abdomen, inguinal areas, upper thighs, and vulva with a detergent germicide for several days before the surgical procedure. The patient may be instructed to do this at home.

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Because of the wide excision, the patient may experience severe pain and discomfort even with minimal movement. Inadequate pain relief will inhibit the patient's mobility and increase the likelihood of complications. Therefore, analgesic agents are administered preventively (ie, around the clock at designated times) to relieve pain and increase the patient's comfort level. Patient-controlled analgesia may be used to provide pain relief and promote patient comfort. Careful positioning using pillows usually increases comfort, as do soothing back rubs. A low Fowler's position or, occasionally, a pillow placed under the knees will reduce pain by relieving tension on the incision; however, efforts must be made to avoid pressure behind the knees, which increases the risk for deep vein thrombosis. Positioning the patient on her side, with pillows between her legs and against the lumbar region, provides comfort and reduces tension on the surgical wound.

\section*{IMPROVING SKIN INTEGRITY}

The patient may be confined to bed for several days to promote healing of the surgical and donor sites (if skin grafts were used). A pressure-reducing mattress may be used to prevent pressure ulcers. Moving from one position to another requires time and effort; use of an overbed trapeze bar may help the patient to move herself more easily. Ambulation may be attempted on the second day.

The extent of the surgical incision and the type of dressing are considered when choosing strategies to promote skin integrity. Intact skin needs to be protected from drainage and moisture, and dressings must be changed as needed to ensure patient comfort, to perform wound care and irrigation (if prescribed), and to permit observation of the surgical site. When the patient returns from the operating room, perineal dressings are more likely to remain in place and be comfortable if a T -binder is used.

A skin graft from the buttocks may have been performed if the edges of the excision could not be approximated, and drains may have been put in place as well. A pressure stent may be applied to
the grafted site to promote adhesion. Nursing care includes monitoring for suppuration (accumulation of purulent material) under the graft and assisting the patient to keep the perineal area clean and dry.

The wound is cleansed daily with warm, normal saline irrigations or other antiseptic solutions as prescribed. A transparent dressing or Xeroform gauze may be in place over the wound to minimize exposure to the air and subsequent pain. The appearance of the surgical site and the characteristics of drainage are assessed and documented. After the dressings are removed, a bed cradle may be used to keep the bed linens away from the surgical site. The nurse must protect the patient from exposure when visitors arrive or someone else enters the room.

\section*{SUPPORTING POSITIVE SEXUALITY AND SEXUAL FUNCTION}

The patient who undergoes vulvar surgery usually experiences concerns about the effects of the surgery on her body image, sexual attractiveness, and functioning. Establishing a trusting nurse-patient relationship is important for the patient to feel comfortable expressing her concerns and fears. The patient is encouraged to share and discuss her concerns with her sexual partner.

Because alterations in sexual sensation and functioning depend on the extent of surgery, the nurse needs to know about any structural and functional changes resulting from the surgery. Consulting with the surgeon will clarify which changes to expect, and referring the patient and her partner to a sex counselor may help them address these changes and resume satisfying sexual activity.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Infection}

The location and extent of the surgical site and incision put the patient at risk for contamination of the site and infection and sepsis. The patient is monitored closely for local and systemic signs and symptoms of infection: purulent drainage, redness, increased pain, fever, and an increased white blood cell count. The nurse assists in obtaining tissue specimens for culture if infection is suspected and administers antibiotic agents as prescribed. Hand hygiene, always a crucial infection-preventing measure, is of particular importance whenever there is an extensive area of exposed tissue. Catheters, drains, and dressings are handled carefully and with gloves to avoid cross-contamination. A low-residue diet prevents straining on defecation and wound contamination. Sitz baths are discouraged after a wide excision because of the risk for infection.

\section*{Deep Vein Thrombosis}

The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis because of the positioning required during surgery, postoperative edema, and the usually prolonged immobility needed to promote healing. Elastic compression stockings are applied, and the patient is encouraged and reminded to perform ankle exercises to minimize venous pooling, which leads to deep vein thrombosis. The patient is encouraged and assisted in changing position by using the overhead trapeze. Pressure behind the knees is avoided when positioning the patient because this may increase venous pooling. The patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (leg pain, redness, warmth, positive Homans' sign) and pulmonary embolism (chest pain, tachycardia, dyspnea). Fluid intake is encouraged to prevent dehydration, which also increases the risk for deep vein thrombosis.

\section*{Hemorrhage}

The extent of the surgical incision and possibly wide excision of tissue increase the risk of postoperative bleeding and hemorrhage. Although the pressure dressings that are applied after surgery minimize the risk, the patient must be monitored closely for signs of hemorrhage and resulting hypovolemic shock. These signs may include decreased blood pressure, increased pulse rate, decreased urine output, decreased mental status, and cold, clammy skin.

If hemorrhage and shock occur, interventions include fluid replacement, blood component therapy, and vasopressor medications. Laboratory results (eg, hematocrit and hemoglobin levels) and hemodynamic monitoring are used to assess the patient's response to treatment. Depending on the specific cause of hemorrhage, the patient may be returned to the operating room. The patient who experiences hemorrhage is anxious and apprehensive. Providing brief explanations of the procedures being performed and offering reassurance that the problem has been identified and is being taken care of may reduce the anxiety and fears of the patient and her family.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Preparing the patient for hospital discharge begins before hospital admission. The patient and family are informed about what to expect during the immediate postoperative and recovery periods. Posthospital care requires giving complete instructions to a family member or significant other who will help care for the patient at home and to the home care nurse who will provide follow-up care. Depending on the changes resulting from the surgery, the patient and her family may need instruction about wound care, urinary catheterization, and possible complications. The patient is encouraged to share her concerns and to assume increasing responsibility for her own care. She is encouraged and assisted in learning to care for the surgical wound.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Shortened hospital stays may result in the patient's discharge during the early postoperative recovery stage. Thus, home care referral or discharge to a subacute facility may be indicated. During this phase, the patient's physical status and psychological responses to the surgery are assessed. Additionally, the patient is assessed for complications and healing of the surgical site. During home visits, the patient's environment is assessed to determine if modifications are needed to facilitate patient care. The home care nurse uses the home visit to reinforce previous teaching and to assess the patient's and the family's understanding of and adherence to the prescribed treatment strategies. Follow-up phone calls by the nurse to the patient between home visits are usually reassuring to the patient and family, who may be responsible for performing complex care procedures. Attention to the patient's psychological responses is important because the patient may become discouraged and depressed because of alterations in body image and a slow recovery. Communication between the nurse involved in the patient's immediate postoperative care and the home care nurse is essential to ensure continuity of care.

\section*{CANCER OF THE VAGINA}

Cancer of the vagina usually results from metastasized choriocarcinoma or from cancer of the cervix or adjacent organs (eg, uterus, vulva, bladder, or rectum). Primary cancer of the vagina is squamous in origin.

Risk factors include previous cervical cancer, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), previous vaginal or vulvar cancer, previous radiation therapy, history of HPV, or pessary use. Any patient with previous cervical cancer should be examined regularly for vaginal lesions.

Before 1970, vaginal cancer occurred primarily in postmenopausal women. In the 1970s, it was shown that maternal ingestion of DES affected female offspring who were exposed in utero. Benign genital tract abnormalities have occurred in some of these young women. Vaginal adenosis (abnormal tissue growth) may also occur. The risk for clear cell tumor related to DES exposure is 0.14 to 1.4 in 1,000 women. Colposcopy is indicated for all women exposed to this medication in utero. If colposcopic examination discloses adenosis or a significant cervical lesion, follow-up is essential.

Vaginal pessaries, used to support prolapsed tissues, have been associated with vaginal cancer only if the devices were not cared for properly (ie, regularly cleaned and the vagina examined by a health care professional) because pessaries can be a source of chronic irritation.

Patients often do not have symptoms but may report slight bleeding after intercourse, spontaneous bleeding, vaginal dis-
charge, pain, and urinary or rectal symptoms (or both). Diagnosis is often by Pap smear of the vagina.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of early lesions may be local excision or administration of a chemotherapeutic cream (ie, 5-fluorouracil applied with a tampon or a diaphragm). Cotton balls placed at the introitus lessen spillage, which otherwise can result in perineal irritation. Laser therapy is a common treatment option in early vaginal and vulvar cancer. Radiation, another treatment option, is delivered by external beam to the pelvis, by vaginal intracavitary radiation using a tandem and colpostats, or by interstitial vaginal implants using an obturator and vaginal template. For a tumor located in the lower third of the vagina, radical node dissection is followed by radiation.

Encouraging close follow-up by health care providers is the prime focus of nursing interventions with women who were exposed to DES in utero. Because DES was used only from the 1940s to the 1970s, the incidence will decrease with each subsequent year. Emotional support for mothers and daughters is essential. For young women who have had vaginal reconstructive surgery, specific vagina-dilating procedures may be initiated and taught. Water-soluble lubricants are helpful in reducing painful intercourse (dyspareunia). If a lesion requiring treatment develops, all aspects and effects of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery need to be explored on an individual basis.

\section*{CANCER OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES}

Malignancies of the fallopian tube are rare and are the least common type of genital cancer. Symptoms include a profuse, watery discharge and a colicky lower abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding. An enlarged fallopian tube may be found on examination. Surgery followed by radiation therapy is the usual treatment.

\section*{CANCER OF THE OVARY}

Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. About $75 \%$ of cases are detected at a late stage (Duffy, 2001). The ovary is a common site of primary as well as metastatic lesions from other cancers. Most cases affect women ages 50 to 59 . The incidence of ovarian cancer is highest in industrialized countries, except for Japan, where its incidence is low.

A woman with ovarian cancer has a threefold to fourfold increased risk for breast cancer, and women with breast cancer have an increased risk for ovarian cancer. No definitive causative factors have been determined, but oral contraceptives appear to provide a protective effect. Heredity plays a part, and many physicians advocate pelvic examinations every 6 months for women who have one or two relatives with ovarian cancer. Despite careful examination, ovarian tumors are often difficult to detect because they are usually deep in the pelvis. No early screening mechanism exists at present, although tumor markers are being explored. Transvaginal ultrasound and $\mathrm{Ca}-125$ antigen testing are helpful in those at high risk for this condition. Tumor-associated antigens are helpful in follow-up care after diagnosis and treatment but not in early general screening.

Advances in our knowledge of genetics are changing the approaches to detecting and treating breast and ovarian cancer. Some families have specific genes that predispose them to various cancers. BRCA-1 is a genetic mutation that results in an increased
risk for breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA-2 is another genetic mutation that may result in increased risk for both female and male breast cancers and for ovarian cancer (Duffy, 2001). Other mutations are also under study. Testing for susceptibility is in the early stages at centers that have expertise in genetics, testing, and counseling. Testing is indicated when a family history of three or more cases of closely related members includes premenopausal breast cancer or ovarian cancer. One member with cancer is tested, and if the results are positive, other members without cancer may undergo testing.

Much more needs to be learned about the risks associated with some mutations, the reliability of testing, and the efficacy of follow-up. Confidentiality and insurance risks are ethical issues that need clarification. Because there are no primary methods of preventing breast or ovarian cancer, emotional distress is also a problem. Patients with concerns about their family history should be referred to a cancer genetics center to obtain information and testing, if indicated. Women with inherited types of ovarian cancer tend to be younger when the diagnosis is made than the average age of 59 years at the time of diagnosis.

Risk factors also include nulliparity and infertility. Older age is a major risk factor because the incidence of this disease peaks in the eighth decade of life. High dietary fat intake, mumps before menarche, use of talc in the perineal area, and family history are suspected to increase risk, while multiparity, oral contraceptive use, breastfeeding, and anovulatory disorders may be protective. Survival rates depend on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis.

Fifteen percent of all new cases of ovarian tumors have low malignancy potential (LMP tumors). These borderline tumors resemble ovarian cancer but have much more favorable outcomes. Women diagnosed with this type of cancer tend to be younger, in their early 40 s. A conservative surgical approach is now used. The affected ovary is removed, but the uterus and the contralateral ovary may remain. Adjuvant therapy may not be warranted for these tumors.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Symptoms are nonspecific and include increased abdominal girth, pelvic pressure, bloating, indigestion, flatulence, increased waist size, leg pain, and pelvic pain. Symptoms are often vague, and many women ignore the symptoms. Ovarian cancer is often silent, but enlargement of the abdomen from an accumulation of fluid is the most common sign. Any woman with gastrointestinal symptoms and without a known diagnosis must be evaluated with ovarian cancer in mind. Flatulence, fullness after a light meal, and increasing abdominal girth are significant symptoms.

Vague, undiagnosed, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms should alert the nurse to the possibility of an early ovarian malignancy. A palpable ovary in a woman who has gone through menopause is investigated because ovaries normally become smaller and less palpable after menopause.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Any enlarged ovary must be investigated. Pelvic examination often does not detect early ovarian cancer, and pelvic imaging techniques are not always definitive. About $75 \%$ of ovarian cancers have metastasized by the time of diagnosis; about $60 \%$ have spread beyond the pelvis. Of the many different ovarian cancer cell types, epithelial tumors constitute $90 \%$. Germ cell tumors and stromal tumors make up the other $10 \%$.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

Surgical staging, exploration, and reduction of tumor mass are the basics of treatment. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice; the preoperative workup includes a barium enema or colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, chest x-rays, and intravenous urography. CT scans and immunoscintigraphy, the use of radioactive antibodies, may be used preoperatively to rule out intra-abdominal metastasis. Staging the tumor is important to guide treatment (Chart 47-9). A total abdominal hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries and the omentum (bilateral salpingooophorectomy and omentectomy) is the standard procedure for early disease.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Chemotherapy often follows surgery, usually with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), cisplatin (Platinol-AQ), carboplatin (Paraplatin), or paclitaxel (Taxol). Hexamethylmelamine (Hexalen), ifosfamide (Ifex), bone marrow transplantation, and peripheral blood stem cell support may also be used. Paclitaxel, cisplatin, and carboplatin are most often used because of their excellent clinical benefits and manageable toxicity. Leukopenia, neurotoxicity, and fever may occur.

Paclitaxel, an agent derived from the Pacific yew tree, works by causing microtubules within the cells to gather and prevents the breakdown of these threadlike structures. In general, cells cannot function when they are clogged with microtubules and cannot divide. Because this medication often causes leukopenia, the patient may need to take granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as well.

Paclitaxel is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to medications formulated in polyoxyethylated castor oil and in patients with baseline neutropenia. Because of possible adverse cardiac effects, paclitaxel is not used in patients with cardiac disorders. Hypotension, dyspnea, angioedema, and urticaria indicate severe reactions that usually occur soon after the first and second doses are administered. The nurse must be prepared to assist in treating anaphylaxis. The patient should be prepared for inevitable hair loss.

Cisplatin is used frequently in chemotherapeutic treatment of ovarian cancer, both alone and in combination with other agents, and in intraperitoneal applications. Patients may require bone marrow transplantation or stem cell transplantation to treat ovarian cancer. Care for these patients is described in Chapter 16. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin may provide a promising mode of treatment.

Carboplatin may be used in the initial treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. It may also be used in patients with recurrence of ovarian cancer after other chemotherapy, including cisplatin. It must be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.

\section*{Stages of Ovarian Cancer}

I—Growth limited to the ovaries
II-Growth involves one or both ovaries with pelvic extension
III—Growth involves one or both ovaries with metastases outside the pelvis or positive retroperitoneal or inguinal nodes
IV-Growth involves one or both ovaries with distant metastases

Other medications include topotecan (Hycamtin), irinotecan (Camptosar), gemcitabine (Gemzar), vinorelbine (Navelbine), liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), and docetaxel (Taxotere). Different combinations, different regimens, different routes, and use of growth factors are being investigated.

Liposomal therapy, delivery of chemotherapy in a liposome, allows the highest possible dose of chemotherapy to the tumor target with a reduction in adverse effects. Liposomes are used as drug carriers because they are nontoxic, biodegradable, easily available, and relatively inexpensive. This encapsulated chemotherapy allows increased duration of action and better targeting. The encapsulation of doxorubicin lessens the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and alopecia. The patient must be monitored for bone marrow suppression. Gastrointestinal and cardiac effects may also occur. These medications are administered by oncology nurses as a slow intravenous infusion over 60 to 90 minutes.

Genetic engineering and identification of cancer genes may make gene therapy a future possibility. Gene therapy is under investigation. Radiation may be helpful and is more useful in some types of ovarian cancer than others.

After adjunct therapies are completed, a second-look laparoscopy or a laparotomy may be performed in some clinical centers to evaluate the treatment results and to obtain multiple tissue samples for biopsy. Occasionally, catheters are left in place if radioactive agents are to be used postoperatively. Chemotherapy is the most common form of treatment in advanced disease.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing measures include those related to the patient's treatment plan, be it surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or palliation. Emotional support, comfort measures, and information, plus attentiveness and caring, are meaningful aids to the patient and her family.

Nursing interventions after pelvic surgery to remove the tumor are similar to those after other abdominal surgeries. If ovarian cancer occurs in a young woman and the tumor is unilateral, it is removed. Childbearing, if desired, is encouraged in the near future. After childbirth, surgical re-exploration may be performed and the remaining ovary may be removed. If both ovaries are involved, surgery is performed and chemotherapy follows.

Patients with advanced ovarian cancer may develop ascites and pleural effusion. Nursing care may include administering intravenous therapy to alleviate fluid and electrolyte imbalances, initiating parenteral nutrition to provide adequate nutrition, providing postoperative care after intestinal bypass to alleviate an obstruction, and providing pain relief and managing drainage tubes. These conditions are complex and often require assistance and support from an oncology nurse specialist. Comfort measures for women with ascites may include providing small frequent meals, decreasing fluid intake, administering diuretic agents, and providing rest. Patients with pleural effusion may experience shortness of breath, hypoxia, pleuritic chest pain, and cough. Thoracentesis is usually performed.

\section*{Hysterectomy}

A total hysterectomy involves removing the uterus and the cervix. This procedure is performed for many conditions other than cancer, including dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometriosis, nonmalignant growths, pelvic relaxation and prolapse, and previous
injury to the uterus. Malignant conditions often require a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of fallopian tubes and ovaries).

Laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy is performed by some physicians with excellent results and rapid recovery. This method is most often used for vaginal hysterectomy and is performed as a short-stay procedure or ambulatory surgery in carefully selected patients. Patients have a short hospital stay and a low incidence of postoperative infection.

The number of hysterectomies in the United States per year has stabilized at 600,000 , despite an increase in the number of babyboomers who have reached the age when this procedure is likely to be performed. The rate may be stabilizing because women often seek second opinions, and the number of therapeutic options (ie, laser therapy, endometrial ablation, and medications to shrink fibroid tumors) has increased.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

The physical preparation of a patient undergoing a hysterectomy differs little from that of a patient undergoing a laparotomy. The lower half of the abdomen and the pubic and perineal regions may be shaved, and these areas are cleaned with soap and water (some surgeons do not require that the patient be shaved). The intestinal tract and the bladder need to be empty before the patient is taken to the operating room to prevent contamination and injury to the bladder or intestinal tract. An enema and antiseptic douche may be prescribed the evening before surgery, and the patient may be instructed to administer these treatments at home. Preoperative medications administered before surgery may help the patient relax.

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

The principles of general postoperative care for abdominal surgery apply, with particular attention given to peripheral circulation to prevent thrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis (noting varicosities, promoting circulation with leg exercises, and using elastic compression stockings). Major risks are infection and hemorrhage. In addition, because the surgical site is close to the bladder, voiding problems may occur, particularly after a vaginal hysterectomy.

Edema or nerve trauma may cause temporary loss of bladder tone (bladder atony), and an indwelling catheter may be inserted. During surgery, the handling of the bowel may cause paralytic ileus and interfere with bowel functioning.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT UNDERGOING A HYSTERECTOMY}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history and the physical and pelvic examination are completed, and laboratory studies are performed. Additional assessment data include the patient's psychosocial responses, because the need for a hysterectomy may elicit strong emotional reactions. If the hysterectomy is performed to remove a malignant tumor, anxiety related to fear of cancer and its consequences adds to the stress of the patient and her family. These women may be at greater risk for psychological symptoms, physical symptoms, postmenopausal syndrome, and increased use of health care
postoperatively. Other women note improved physical and mental health after hysterectomy.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on all the assessment data, the patient's major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Anxiety related to the diagnosis of cancer, fear of pain, possible perception of loss of femininity, and disfigurement
- Disturbed body image related to altered fertility and fears about sexuality and relationships with partner and family
- Acute pain related to surgery and other adjuvant therapy
- Deficient knowledge of the perioperative aspects of hysterectomy and postoperative self-care

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Hemorrhage
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Bladder dysfunction

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of anxiety, acceptance of loss of the uterus, absence of pain or discomfort, increased knowledge of self-care requirements, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING ANXIETY}

Anxiety stems from several factors: unfamiliar environment, the effects of surgery on body image and reproductive ability, fear of pain and other discomfort, and, possibly, feelings of embarrassment about exposure of the genital area in the perioperative period. Conflicts between medical treatment and religious beliefs may arise as well. In such cases, the nurse needs to determine what the experience means to the patient and how to assist her in expressing her feelings. Throughout the pre- and postoperative and recovery periods, explanations are given about physical preparations and procedures that are performed.

Patient education addresses the outcomes of surgery, possible feelings of loss, and options for management of symptoms of menopause. Women vary in their preferences; many want a choice of treatment options, a part in decision making, accurate and useful information at the appropriate time, support from their health care providers, and access to professional and lay support systems.

Recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative study of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have indicated that HRT does not have long-term cardiac benefits and may increase the risk for breast cancer. Although HRT has positive effects on bone density in women, many clinicians and women have concluded that the risks of HRT outweigh the benefits. However, some believe that short-term use of HRT (5 years or less) may be used to treat menopausal symptoms (Women's Health Initiative, 2002). If the patient is considering beginning HRT, risks and benefits are discussed preoperatively and medication is started following surgery. Teaching is provided and the need for monitoring is emphasized.

\section*{IMPROVING BODY IMAGE}

The patient may have strong emotional reactions to having a hysterectomy and strong personal feelings related to the diagnosis, views of significant others who may be involved (family, partner), religious beliefs, and fears about prognosis. Concerns such as the inability to have children and the effect on femininity may surface, as may questions about the effects of surgery on sexual relationships, function, and satisfaction. The patient needs reassurance that she will still have a vagina and that she can experience sexual intercourse after a temporary postoperative abstinence while tissues heal. Information that sexual satisfaction and orgasm arise from clitoral stimulation rather than from the uterus reassures many women. Most women note some change in sexual feelings after hysterectomy, but they vary in intensity. In some cases, the vagina is shortened by surgery, and this may affect sensitivity or comfort.

When a woman's hormonal balance is upset, as usually occurs in reproductive system disturbances, the patient may experience depression and heightened emotional sensitivity to people and situations. The nurse needs to approach and evaluate each patient individually in light of these factors. The nurse who exhibits interest, concern, and willingness to listen to the patient's fears will assist in the patient's progress throughout the surgical experience.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

A hysterectomy may be performed abdominally or vaginally. The surgeon bases this decision on the diagnosis and the size of the uterus. An abdominal approach is used when the patient has cancer or when the uterus is enlarged. Resultant pain and abdominal discomfort are common. Analgesic agents are administered as prescribed to relieve pain and promote movement and ambulation.

In some circumstances, a nasogastric tube may be inserted before the patient leaves the operating room to relieve discomfort from abdominal distention, especially if excessive handling of the viscera was required or if a large tumor was removed. Excision of a large tumor could cause edema because of the sudden release of pressure. In the postoperative period, fluids and food may be restricted for 1 or 2 days. If the patient has abdominal distention or flatus, a rectal tube and application of heat to the abdomen may be prescribed. When abdominal auscultation reveals return of bowel sounds and peristalsis, additional fluids and a soft diet are permitted. Early ambulation facilitates the return of normal peristalsis.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Hemorrhage}

Vaginal bleeding and hemorrhage may occur after hysterectomy. To detect these complications early, the nurse counts the perineal pads used, assesses the extent of saturation with blood, and monitors vital signs. Abdominal dressings are monitored for drainage if an abdominal surgical approach was used. In preparation for hospital discharge, the nurse gives prescribed guidelines for activity restrictions to promote healing and to prevent postoperative bleeding.

\section*{Deep Vein Thrombosis}

Because of positioning during surgery, postoperative edema, and immobility, the patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus. To minimize the risk, elastic compression stockings are applied. Additionally, the patient is encouraged and assisted to change positions frequently, although pressure under
the knees is avoided. The nurse assists the patient to ambulate early in the postoperative period, and the patient is encouraged to exercise her legs and feet while in bed. Additionally, the nurse assesses for deep vein thrombosis or phlebitis (leg pain, redness, warmth, positive Homans' sign) and pulmonary embolism (chest pain, tachycardia, dyspnea). Because the patient may be discharged within 1 or 2 days of surgery, she is instructed to avoid prolonged sitting in a chair with pressure at the knees, sitting with crossed legs, and inactivity.

\section*{Bladder Dysfunction}

Because of possible difficulty in voiding postoperatively, an indwelling catheter may be inserted before or during surgery and is left in place in the immediate postoperative period. If a catheter is in place, it is usually removed shortly after the patient begins to ambulate. After the catheter is removed, urinary output is monitored; additionally, the abdomen is assessed for distention. If the patient does not void within a prescribed time, measures are initiated to encourage voiding (eg, assisting the patient up to the bathroom, pouring warm water over the perineum). If the patient cannot void, catheterization may be necessary.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

The information provided to the patient is tailored to her needs. She must know what limitations or restrictions, if any, to expect. She is instructed to check the surgical incision daily and to contact her primary health care provider if redness or purulent drainage or discharge appears. She is informed that her periods are now over but that she may have a slightly bloody discharge for a few days; if bleeding recurs after this time, it should be reported immediately. The patient is instructed about the importance of an adequate oral intake and of maintaining bowel and urinary tract function. The patient is informed that postoperative fatigue may occur but that it should gradually decrease.

The patient should resume activities gradually. This does not mean sitting for long periods, because doing so may cause blood to pool in the pelvis, increasing the risk for thromboembolism. The nurse explains that showers are preferable to tub baths to reduce the possibility of infection and to avoid the dangers of injury that may occur when getting in and out of the bathtub. The patient is instructed to avoid straining, lifting, having sexual intercourse, or driving until her surgeon permits her to resume these activities. Vaginal discharge, foul odor, excessive bleeding, any leg redness or pain, or an elevated temperature should be reported to her primary health care provider promptly. The nurse should be familiar with information given to the patient by the surgeon regarding all activities and restrictions to reinforce them and prevent confusion.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Follow-up telephone contact provides the nurse with the opportunity to determine whether the patient is recovering without problems and to answer any questions that may have arisen. The patient is reminded about postoperative follow-up appointments. If the patient's ovaries were removed, HRT may be considered. Providing information about the findings of the Women's Health Initiative (2002) study about the benefits and risks of HRT promotes informed decision making about its use. The patient is reminded to discuss HRT and alternative therapies with her primary care provider.

\section*{RadiationTherapy}

Radiation is usually the treatment of choice for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, depending on the stage of the cancer. In uterine and ovarian cancers, however, radiation is usually an adjunct to surgery. When radiation is the definitive treatment of cervical cancer, a combination of external pelvic irradiation and internal (intracavitary) irradiation may be used. Only in the earliest microinvasive carcinomas of the cervix is intracavitary irradiation used alone. High cure rates can be expected with cervical cancer limited to the cervix. As the disease extends into the parametrium, the cure rate decreases. Once the disease extends to the pelvic side walls, however, perhaps only one third of patients are cured, although many more benefit from the palliative effects of radiation (ie, reduction in tumor bulk and control of infection, pain, and bleeding).

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY}

Radiation side effects are cumulative and tend to appear when the total dose exceeds the body's natural capacity to repair the damage caused by radiation. Radiation enteritis, resulting in diarrhea and abdominal cramping, and radiation cystitis, manifested by urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria, may occur. These effects are manifestations of the normal tissues' response to radiation therapy. Occasionally, severe reactions require interrupting treatment until normal tissue repair occurs. Fatigue is one of the most bothersome side effects and is often not relieved by rest.

The radiation oncologist and nurse must carefully inform the patient in advance about possible side effects and implement management strategies if they occur. Such measures include dietary control (restricting the amount of fiber, roughage, and lactose) and the use of antispasmodic medications. The purpose of
a low-residue diet is to prevent frequent bowel movements and to avoid blockage resulting from possible constriction of the gastrointestinal tract. An oncology dietitian may be consulted.

Evaluating the patient's and family's physical, emotional, and learning needs is part of the nursing assessment before and during treatment. Information overload, along with anxiety that impairs learning, must be anticipated.

Any method of therapy requires adequate preparation, education, and emotional support. The patient who has been adequately prepared, supported, and educated before treatment through expert nursing care will find it easier to cope with the rigors and stress of cancer and its treatment.

\section*{METHODS OF RADIATION THERAPY}

Several approaches are used to deliver radiation to the female reproductive system: external radiation, intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), and internal (intracavitary) irradiation or brachytherapy. The cervix and uterus lend themselves naturally to internal irradiation because they can serve as a receptacle for radioactive sources.

\section*{External Radiation Therapy}

This method of delivering radiation destroys cancerous cells at the skin surface or deeper in the body. Other methods of delivering radiation therapy are more commonly used to treat cancer of the female reproductive system than this method.

\section*{Intraoperative Radiation Therapy}

IORT allows radiation to be applied directly to the affected area during surgery. An electron beam is directed at the disease site. This direct-view irradiation may be used when para-aortic nodes are involved or for unresectable (inoperable) or partially resectable neoplasms. Benefits include accurate beam direction (which precisely limits the radiation to the tumor) and the ability during treatment to block sensitive organs from radiation. IORT is usually combined with external-beam irradiation preoperatively or postoperatively.

\section*{Internal (Intracavitary) Irradiation}

The patient receives an anesthetic agent and is examined, after which specially prepared applicators are inserted into the endometrial cavity and vagina. These devices are not loaded with radioactive material until the patient returns to her room. X-rays are obtained to verify the precise relationship of the applicator to the normal pelvic anatomy and to the tumor. Only when this step is completed does the radiation oncologist load the applicators with predetermined amounts of radioactive material. This procedure, called afterloading, allows for precise control of the radiation exposure received by the patient, with minimal exposure of the physician, nurse, and other health care personnel. A patient undergoing internal radiation treatment remains isolated in a private room until the application is completed. Adjacent rooms may need to be evacuated and a lead shield placed at the doorway to the patient's room.

Of the various applicators developed for intracavitary treatment, some are inserted into the endometrial cavity and endocervical canal as multiple small irradiators (eg, Heyman's capsules). Others consist of a central tube (a tandem or intrauterine "stem")
placed through the dilated endocervical canal into the uterine cavity, which remains in a fixed relationship with the irradiators placed in the upper vagina on each side of the cervix (vaginal ovoids) (Fig. 47-8).

When the applicator is inserted, an indwelling urinary catheter is also inserted. Vaginal packing is inserted to keep the applicator in place and to keep other organs, such as the bladder and rectum, as far from the radioactive source as possible. The objective of the internal treatment is to maintain the distribution of internal radiation at a fixed dosage throughout the application. Such applications usually last 24 to 72 hours, depending on dose calculations made by the radiation physicist.

Automated high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy systems have been developed that allow outpatient radiation therapy. Treatment time is shorter, thereby decreasing patient discomfort. Staff exposure to radiation is also avoided. Isotopes of radium and cesium are used for intracavitary irradiation.

\section*{NURSING CONSIDERATIONS FOR RADIATION SAFETY}

Various radioactive elements are used in intracavitary therapy. Regardless of the specific agent used, diligent nursing care must be provided. The patient is carefully observed and care is provided; however, the nursing staff must minimize radiation exposure to themselves as much as possible by applying the principles of time, distance, and shielding, as follows:
- Minimize amount of time near a radioactive source.
- Maximize distance from radioactive source.
- Use required shielding to minimize exposure.

Nurses who are or may be pregnant should not be involved in the immediate care of such patients. Nursing visits to the patient should be planned in advance to minimize the amount of time the nurse is in contact with the patient. Additionally, to minimize radiation exposure, the nurse remains as far away (ie, at the entrance to the room) from the radiation source as possible but makes special efforts to provide some time to discuss the patient's anxieties and fears.

The Radiation Safety Department will give specific safety precautions to those who will be in contact with the patient, including health care providers and family. Nurses caring for the patient

\end{figure}
will receive directions about safe times and distances related to care provision to ensure that their occupational exposure is as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Other instructions vary but may include the following:
- Wear film badges or pocket ion chambers to monitor exposure.
- Wear rubber gloves to dispose of any soiled matter that may be contaminated. (These gloves, however, do not provide protection from sealed radiation sources.)
- Provide specific laundry and housekeeping directions.
- Keep the patient restricted to her room and allow no visitors who are or may be pregnant or who are younger than 18 years of age.
- Explain that a discharge survey is usually performed by Radiation Safety Department personnel before the patient leaves the room. The survey ensures that all sources of radiation have been removed.

\section*{NURSING PRIORITIES FOR PATIENT CARE}

Of the many nursing concerns, primary concerns involve providing the patient with emotional support and physical comfort and not dislodging the applicator. Although the radiation oncologist takes steps to secure the internal applicator in place and nursing personnel need not be preoccupied with the fear that the applicator will be prematurely extruded, they should monitor to see that the applicator or the radioactive sources have not been dislodged. Should this happen, the nurse should avoid touching the radioactive object and notify the Radiation Safety Department at once.

The nurse needs to explain that during the treatment, the patient must stay on absolute bed rest. She may move from side to side with her back supported by a pillow, and the head of the bed may be raised to 15 degrees. She should be encouraged to practice deep-breathing and coughing exercises and to flex and extend the feet to stretch the calf muscles, promoting circulation and venous return. Elastic compression stockings are important. Back care, though appreciated by the patient, needs to be performed within the minimal time allowed at the bedside.

Usually the patient receives a low-residue diet to prevent frequent bowel movements. In addition, a urinary catheter will be in place and must be inspected frequently to ensure that it drains properly. The chief hazard of improper drainage is that the bladder may become distended and its walls exposed to radiation. Although perineal care is not performed at this time, any profuse discharge should be reported immediately to the radiation oncologist or gynecologic surgeon.

Additional nursing interventions include observing the patient for temperature elevation, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms should be reported because they may indicate such complications as infection or perforation.

Patient teaching includes informing the patient that abdominal fullness, cramping, backache, and the urge to void are normal feelings during therapy. Severe pain should not occur. Administering mild opioid agents, muscle relaxants, or sedative medications may be helpful.

\section*{APPLICATOR REMOVAL}

The radiation oncologist calculates precisely the radiation dose. At the end of the prescribed period, the nurse may be requested to assist the physician in removing the applicator. Because the sources are afterloaded, they can be removed by the physician in the same manner as they were inserted. This does not require
local or general anesthesia and is performed in the patient's room. Medicating the patient with a mild sedative agent may be required, however, before the applicator is removed.

\section*{POST-TREATMENT CARE}

Progressive ambulation is recommended after any period of enforced bed rest. Diet may be offered as tolerated. The patient may shower as soon as she wishes but should be instructed not to douche after removal of the applicator. Because the cervix may have been dilated, any chance of bacterial contamination should be minimized.

Both before and after treatment, nurses caring for patients undergoing radiation therapy need to assess any misconceptions about this mode of treatment that the patient and family may have. The oncology clinical nurse specialist may be a valuable resource for information and problem solving, if necessary. Resources for further clinical and patient information are listed at the end of Chapter 16.

\section*{critical thinking Exercises}
1. Your 42-year-old patient has not received gynecologic care for the last 15 years but is currently seeking care for intermittent vaginal bleeding. When obtaining a history from her, you learn that her mother received diethylstilbestrol (DES) during her pregnancies. What implications does this have for care and follow-up of this patient?
2. A 22-year-old graduate student seeks care because of severe pelvic pain, fever, and vaginal discharge. She reports having multiple sex partners and says she never uses a condom during sex because she uses oral contraceptives. Her physician has informed her that her symptoms are those of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and she is admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotic agents. What nursing care is important for her to minimize the risk for complications and to prevent transmission to others? Design a teaching plan to address the short- and long-term implications of the diagnosis of PID.
3. Your 48-year-old patient is scheduled for a total hysterectomy. She tells you that she has a family history of breast cancer and both her mother and sister have osteoporosis. She asks you for advice about beginning hormone replacement therapy (HRT) because of her osteoporosis risk and to prevent hot flashes. How would you proceed, and what information would you give her?
4. A 68 -year-old woman is undergoing surgery to treat cervical cancer. While she is in the operating room, her husband reveals his concerns that he and his wife will never be able to have sexual relations again because of her diagnosis and treatment. What approach would you take in discussing this with the patient and with her husband?
5. A 45-year-old woman is scheduled for surgery to repair a rectovaginal fistula. Twenty years ago she experienced a spinal cord injury that resulted in paralysis below the waist. Explain how you will modify pre- and postoperative nursing care in view of her disability. What discharge planning will be important for her?

\section*{Assessment and Management of Patients With Breast Disorders}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Develop a teaching plan for breast self-examination for patients and consumer groups.
2. Describe the diagnostic tests used to detect breast disorders.
3. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient with breast cancer.
4. Compare the therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy in treating breast cancer.
5. Describe the physical, psychosocial, and rehabilitative needs of the patient who has had breast surgery for the treatment of breast cancer.

$I_{n}$-n many cultures, the breast plays a significant role in a woman's sexuality and identification of herself as female. Although advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast disorders are changing the prognosis for breast disease and cancer, women's responses to possible breast disease include fear of disfigurement and loss of sexual attractiveness and fear of death. The woman with breast disease may undergo diagnostic testing, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Thus, nurses caring for patients with breast disease must have an in-depth understanding of these treatment modalities and expert assessment and clinical skills to address the physical and psychological needs of patients facing breast disorders, and their families.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

In males and females, the breasts are the same until puberty, when estrogen and other hormones initiate breast development in females. This development usually occurs at about age 10 years and continues until about age 16 years, although the range can vary
from 9 to 18 years. Stages of breast development are described as Tanner stages 1 through 5. Stage 1 describes a prepubertal breast. Stage 2 is breast budding, the first sign of puberty in a female. Stage 3 involves further enlargement of breast tissue and the areola (a darker tissue ring around the nipple), and stage 4 occurs when the nipple and areola form a secondary mound on top of the breast tissue. Stage 5 is the continued development of a larger breast with a single contour.

The breast contains glandular (parenchyma) and ductal tissue, along with fibrous tissue that binds the lobes together and fatty tissue in and between the lobes. These paired mammary glands are located between the second and sixth ribs over the pectoralis major muscle from the sternum to the midaxillary line. An area of breast tissue, called the tail of Spence, extends into the axilla. Cooper's ligaments, which are fascial bands, support the breast on the chest wall. Figure 48-1 shows the anatomy of the fully developed breast.

Each breast consists of 12 to 20 cone-shaped lobes that are made up of lobules containing clusters of acini, small structures ending in a duct. All of the ducts in each lobule empty into an
atypical hyperplasia: abnormal increase in the number of cells in a specific area within the ductal or lobular areas of the breast; this abnormal proliferation increases the risk for cancer
benign proliferative breast disease: various types of atypical, yet noncancerous, breast tissue that increase the risk for breast cancer
BRCA-1: gene on chromosome 17 that, when damaged or mutated, places a woman at greater risk for breast or ovarian cancer, or both, compared with women who do not have the mutation
BRCA-2: gene on chromosome 17 that, when damaged or mutated, places a woman at greater risk for breast cancer (though less so than BRCA-1) compared with women who do not have the mutation
breast-conservation therapy: surgery to remove a breast tumor and a margin of tissue around the tumor without removing any other part of the breast; may include an axillary lymph node dissection, radiation therapy, or both
breast self-examination (BSE): technique for checking one's own breasts for lumps or suspicious changes
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): cancer cells that start in the ductal system of the breast but have not penetrated the surrounding tissue
estrogen and progesterone receptor assay: test to determine whether the breast tumor is nourished by hormones; this information is useful in making a prognosis and determining treatment
fibrocystic breast changes: term used to describe certain benign changes in the breast, typically associated with palpable nodularity, lumpiness, swelling, or pain
fine-needle aspiration (FNA): the removal of fluid for diagnostic analysis from a cyst or cells from a mass using a needle and syringe
galactography: use of mammography after an injection of radiopaque dye to diagnose problems in the ductal system of the breast
gynecomastia: overdeveloped breast tissue typically seen in adolescent boys
lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): an atypical change and proliferation of the lobular cells of the breast; previously considered a premalignant condition but now considered a marker of increased risk for invasive breast cancer
lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy: procedure using radiopaque dye and nuclear medicine techniques to identify and analyze the first draining lymph node from the breast within the axillary region
lymphedema: chronic swelling of an extremity due to interrupted lymphatic circulation, typically from an axillary dissection mammography: an x-ray of the breast; the principal method of screening for and detection of breast cancer in women mammoplasty: surgical procedure to reconstruct or change the size or shape of the breast; can be done for reduction or augmentation
mastalgia: breast pain, usually related to hormonal fluctuations or irritation of a nerve mastitis: inflammation or infection of the breast
medullary carcinoma: special type of infiltrating breast cancer in which the tumor is well defined, with obvious boundaries modified radical mastectomy: removal of the breast tissue, nipple-areola complex,
and a portion of the axillary lymph nodes
Paget's disease: form of breast cancer that begins in the ductal system and involves the nipple, areola, and surrounding skin
prophylactic mastectomy: removal of the breast to reduce the risk for or to prevent the development of breast cancer in women considered at high risk
stereotactic biopsy: computer-guided method of core needle biopsy that is useful when masses in the breast cannot be felt but can be visualized using mammography
surgical biopsy: procedure in which tissue samples or the entire specimen is removed for examination under a microscope by a pathologist
tissue expander with permanent implant: series of surgical procedures used to reconstruct the breast after a mastectomy; involves stretching the skin and muscle before inserting the permanent implant total mastectomy: removal of the breast tissue and nipple-areola complex, typically used as one type of treatment for DCIS transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM flap): method of breast reconstruction in which adipose tissue and muscle from the lower abdomen, along with their circulatory structures, are transferred to the mastectomy site
ultrasonography: imaging method using high-frequency sound waves to diagnose whether masses are solid or fluid-filled
wire needle localization: procedure used to perform a breast biopsy when the lump is difficult to palpate but can be visualized using mammography; a wire is inserted into the breast tissue under mammographic visualization, and the surgeon then removes the tissue surrounding the wire

ampulla, which then opens onto the nipple after narrowing. About $85 \%$ of the breast is fat.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

When assessing a patient who describes a breast problem, the nurse should ask the woman when she noted the problem and how long it has been present. Other questions include: Is pain associated with the symptom, and can you feel any areas in your breast that are of concern? What are your breast self-examination (BSE) practices? Have you had a mammogram or any other screening or diagnostic tests? If so, when? What follow-up recommendations were made?

The woman is asked about her reproductive history because of its relationship to risk for breast disorders. Questions should include the woman's age at menarche, last menstrual period, cycle regularity, and use of oral contraceptives or other hormone products. Other necessary information includes her history of pregnancies, live births, abortions, or miscarriages, and breastfeeding. If the patient is postmenopausal, her age at menopause and any symptoms she experienced and current or previous use of hormone replacement therapy are also addressed.

General health assessment includes the patient's use of tobacco and alcohol. Her medical and surgical history is important to obtain, along with any family history of diseases, particularly cancer. Social information, such as marital status, occupation, and the availability of resources and support persons, should also be elicited.

\section*{Psychosocial Implications of Breast Disease}

Because of the significant role of the breast in a woman's sexuality, responses to any actual or suspected disease may include fear, anxiety, and depression. Specific responses may include fears of disfigurement, loss of sexual attractiveness, abandonment by her partner, and death. These fears may cause some women to delay seeking health care for evaluation of a possible breast problem. Alternatively, in some women anxiety or fear regarding breast cancer may cause them to seek the services of a health care provider for the slightest change or problem.

In response to these reactions, the nurse's role is to identify the patient's concerns, anxieties, and fears. Patient education and psychosocial support become key nursing interventions. Assessment of the woman's concerns related to breast care and her responses to a potential problem is important whether the problem is benign or potentially malignant. Nurses can help women through the potentially frightening visit to the primary health care provider or surgeon. Because of underlying fears about a breast problem, anxiety management is a valuable intervention, and the nurse's calm, caring demeanor, along with astute listening skills and concrete direction and guidance, can decrease a woman's anxiety during the process.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT: FEMALE BREAST}

Examination of the female breast can be conducted during any general physical or gynecologic examination or whenever the patient suspects, reports, or fears breast disease. A clinical breast examination is recommended at least every 3 years for women ages

Poole, K., \& Lyne, P. A. (2000). The 'cues' to diagnosis: Describing the monitoring activities of women undergoing diagnostic investigations for breast disease. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 31(4), 752-758.

\section*{Purpose}

Women undergoing diagnostic workup for symptoms of breast disease have identified the process as very stressful for them and their partners. This qualitative portion of a larger study investigated the experience of undergoing fine-needle biopsy and waiting for the results of the biopsy. The transactional theory of stress, appraisal, and coping of Lazarus and Folkman served as the framework for the study.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Focus interviews were conducted with a subset of the 235 women who participated in the larger study and had fine-needle aspirations at two outpatient breast clinics. The subset consisted of 40 women; 20 of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 20 with benign breast disease. The women were interviewed in their homes 2 to 3 weeks post-diagnosis about their experiences from discovery of their breast abnormality to the time of diagnosis. The interviews, which ranged from 30 to 90 minutes, were audiotaped. Categories of themes emerging from the interviews were generated: the discovery of the breast abnormality and women's reflections after receiving biopsy results.

\section*{Findings}

Analysis of the transcripts revealed four different types of threatrelated cues during the diagnostic period: temporal, interpersonal, procedural, and spatial. Temporal cues identified by women in the study were those related to time. For example, the amount of time from referral by the primary care practitioner to the specialist breast unit was perceived by women as an indicator of the urgency of their
problem; the quicker the referral, the greater urgency they perceived their problem to have. Interpersonal cues identified by the women were words, actions, gestures, or pauses in conversation by health care personnel. Active identification and interpretation of interpersonal cues by women were linked to uncertainty and lack of control during the diagnostic process. Procedural cues were those associated with the aspects of how the biopsy and other diagnostic procedures were performed. For example, the need to repeat an x-ray or the refusal of the radiologist to let the patient see the mammogram were taken as cues of a likely diagnosis of cancer. Spatial cues were those in which women interpreted usually uneventful aspects in the environment as indicative of their diagnosis. For example, one women interpreted the actions of health care personnel in arranging the chairs in the room in a certain way as she entered as indicative of the fact that they were about to inform her of a diagnosis of cancer.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

These findings, described by the researchers as monitoring activities on the part of women undergoing diagnostic assessment for breast cancer, suggest the need women have to know their diagnosis and to reduce their uncertainty about the diagnosis. The stress associated with misinterpretation of these cues suggests the need for nurses and other health care providers to provide women with accurate and timely information to minimize their possible misinterpretation of behaviors. Nurses can help patients understand what time frames exist within the institution and explain the routines involved with the process of undergoing evaluation for a breast lump.

20 to 40 years, and then annually. A thorough breast examination, including instruction in BSE, takes at least 10 minutes.

\section*{Inspection}

Examination begins with inspection. The patient disrobes to the waist and sits in a comfortable position facing the examiner. The breasts are inspected for size and symmetry. A slight variation in the size of each breast is common and generally normal. The skin is inspected for color, venous pattern, and thickening or edema. Erythema (redness) may indicate benign local inflammation or superficial lymphatic invasion by a neoplasm. A prominent venous pattern can signal increased blood supply required by a tumor. Edema and pitting of the skin may result from a neoplasm blocking lymphatic drainage and giving the skin an orangepeel appearance (peau d'orange), a classic sign of advanced breast cancer. Examples of abnormal breast findings can be found in Chart 48-1.

Although the appearance of the nipple-areola complex varies greatly between patients, for individual women the two are generally similar in size and shape. Inversion of one or both is not uncommon and is a significant finding only when of recent origin. Ulceration, rashes, or spontaneous nipple discharge requires evaluation. To elicit a dimpling or retraction that may otherwise go undetected, the examiner instructs the patient to raise both arms overhead. This maneuver normally elevates both breasts equally. Next, the patient is instructed to place her hands at her waist and push in. These movements, causing contraction of the pectoral muscles, do not normally alter the breast contour or nipple direction. Any dimpling or retraction during these position changes
may suggest a potential malignancy. The clavicular and axillary regions are inspected for swelling, discoloration, lesions, or enlarged lymph nodes.

\section*{Palpation}

Palpation of the axillary and clavicular areas is easily performed with the patient seated. To examine the axillary lymph nodes, the examiner gently abducts the patient's arm from the thorax. The patient's left forearm is grasped gently and supported with the examiner's left hand. The right hand is then free to palpate the axillae and note any lymph nodes that may be lying against the thoracic wall. The flat parts of the fingertips are used to gently palpate the areas of the central, lateral, subscapular, and pectoral nodes (Fig. 48-2). Normally, these lymph nodes are not palpable, but if they are enlarged, their size, location, mobility, consistency, and tenderness are noted. The breasts are also palpated with the patient sitting in an upright position.

The patient is then assisted to a supine position. Before the breast is palpated, the patient's shoulder is elevated by a small pillow to balance the breast on the chest wall. Failure to do this allows the breast tissue to slip laterally, and a breast mass may be missed in this thickened tissue. Light, systematic palpation includes the entire surface of the breast and the axillary tail. The examiner may choose to proceed in a clockwise direction, following imaginary concentric circles from the outer limits of the breast toward the nipple. Other acceptable methods are to palpate from each number on the face of the clock toward the nipple in a clockwise fashion or along imaginary vertical lines on the breast (Fig. 48-3).

During palpation, the examiner notes tissue consistency, patient-reported tenderness, or masses. If a mass is detected, it is described by its location (eg, left breast, 2 cm from the nipple at 2 o'clock position). Size, shape, consistency, border delineation, and mobility are included in the description. Finally, the areola is gently compressed to detect any discharge or secretion.

The breast tissue of the adolescent is usually firm and lobular, whereas that of the postmenopausal woman is more likely to feel thinner and more granular. During pregnancy and lactation, the breasts are firmer and larger, with lobules that are more distinct. Hormonal changes cause the areola to darken. Cysts are com-

monly found in menstruating women and are usually well defined and freely movable. Premenstrually, cysts may be larger and more tender. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, tend to be hard, the consistency of a pencil eraser, poorly defined, fixed to the skin or underlying tissue, and usually nontender. A physician should evaluate any abnormalities detected during inspection and palpation.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT: MALE BREAST}

Because breast cancer can occur in men, examination of the male breast and axillae is an important part of physical assessment. The nipple and areola are inspected for masses. Most cancers in men are found at a later stage, possibly because men are not aware of their risk for developing breast cancer. Treatment of breast cancer in males is similar as well.

Gynecomastia (overdeveloped mammary glands in the male) is differentiated from the soft, fatty enlargement of obesity by the firm enlargement of glandular tissue beneath and immediately surrounding the areola. The same procedure for palpating the female axillae is used when assessing the male axillae.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

\section*{BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION}

BSE instruction can be performed during assessment as part of the physical examination; it can be taught in any setting, either to individuals or groups. Instructions about BSE are provided to men if they have a family history of breast cancer because these men may be at higher risk for male breast cancer.

Variations in breast tissue occur during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Therefore, normal changes must be distinguished from those that may signal disease. Most women notice increased tenderness and lumpiness before their menstrual period; therefore, BSE is best performed after menses (day 5 to day 7 , counting the first day of menses as day 1 ), when less fluid is retained. Also, many women have grainy-textured breast tissue, but these areas are usually less nodular after menses.

Because women themselves detect many breast cancers, priority is given to teaching all women how and when to examine their breasts (Chart 48-2). It is estimated that only $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ of women perform BSE proficiently and regularly each month. Younger women, who have normal lumps in their breasts, find it particularly difficult to perform BSE because they have a harder time distinguishing normal from abnormal lumps and are not sure of what they are feeling due to the density of their breast tissue. Even women who perform BSE may delay seeking medical attention because of fear, economic factors, lack of education, reluctance to act if no pain is involved, psychological factors, and modesty.

Women should begin practicing BSE at the time of their first gynecologic examination, which usually occurs in their late teens or early 20s. All health care providers, aware of these implications, should encourage women to examine their own breasts and teach them to recognize early changes that may indicate problems. The nurse plays a pivotal role in preventive education. Almost all settings lend themselves to teaching, providing information, and encouraging appropriate care for prevention, detection, and treatment of breast problems. An individual teaching session with the patient can increase the frequency with which she practices BSE.

A lesson in BSE should include the following: optimal timing for BSE (5 to 7 days after menses begin for premenopausal women
and once monthly for postmenopausal women), a demonstration of examination techniques, a review of what normal breast tissue feels like, a discussion on identification of breast changes, and a return demonstration on the patient and a breast model. Patients who have had breast surgery for the treatment of breast cancer are carefully instructed to examine themselves for any nodules or changes in their breasts or along the chest wall that may indicate a recurrence of the disease.

Films or videos about BSE, shower cards, and pamphlets can be obtained from local chapters of the American Cancer Society. The National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, offers a program that teaches nurses to instruct patients in BSE and also provides teaching aids. The National Alliance for Breast Cancer Organizations, a clearinghouse for lay materials on breast cancer education, is another resource.

\section*{MAMMOGRAPHY}

Mammography is a breast-imaging technique that can detect nonpalpable lesions and assist in diagnosing palpable masses. The procedure takes about 20 minutes and can be performed in an xray department or independent imaging center. Two views are taken of each breast: a craniocaudal view and a mediolateral oblique view. For these views, the breast is mechanically compressed from top to bottom and side to side (Fig. 48-4). Women may experience some fleeting discomfort because maximum compression is necessary for proper visualization. The current mammograms are compared with previous mammograms, and any changes indicate a need for further investigation. Mammography may detect a breast tumor before it is clinically palpable (ie, smaller than 1 cm ); however, it has limitations and is not foolproof. The false-negative rate ranges between $5 \%$ and $10 \%$; it is generally greater in younger women with greater density of breast tissue. Some patients have very dense breast tissue, making it difficult to detect lesions with mammography.

Patients scheduled for a mammogram may voice concern about exposure to radiation. The radiation exposure is equivalent to about 1 hour of exposure to sunlight, so patients would have

\begin{figure}

\caption{EIGURE 48-4 The mammography procedure (A) relies on x-ray imaging to produce the mammogram ( $\mathbf{B}$ ), which in this case reveals a breast lump.}
\end{figure}
to have many mammograms in a year to increase their cancer risk. The benefits of this test outweigh the risks. Because the quality of mammography varies widely from one setting to the next, it is important for women to find accredited breast care centers that produce reliable mammograms.

Current mammographic screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society recommend a mammogram every year starting at the age of 40 years. A baseline mammogram should be obtained after the age of 35 years and by the age of 40 . Younger women who are identified as at a higher risk for breast cancer by family history should seek the opinion of a breast specialist about when to begin screening mammograms. Several studies suggest that screening for high-risk women should begin about 10 years before the age of diagnosis of the family member with breast cancer (Hartmann, Sellers, Schaid et al., 1999). In families with a history of breast cancer, a downward shift in age of diagnosis of about 10 years is seen (eg, grandmother diagnosed with breast cancer at age 48 , mother diagnosed with breast cancer at age 38 , then daughter should begin screening at age 28). Nurses need to provide teaching about screening guidelines for women in the general population and those at high risk so that these women can make informed choices about screening.

The combination of screening mammography, physical examination, and BSE has reduced overall mortality from breast cancer by 63\% among women ages 40 to 69 years (Tabar, Vitak, Tony et al., 2001). Despite the decreased mortality associated with mammographic screening, it has not been used equitably across the U.S. population. Current statistics indicate that $67 \%$ of women 40 years of age and over have had a mammogram within the past 2 years (CDC Database, 2000). Women with fewer resources (eg, elderly, poor, minority women, women without health insurance) often do not have the means to undergo mammography or the resources for follow-up treatment when lesions are detected. Recent studies have shown that social support contributes to adherence to mammographic screening guidelines (Anderson, Urban \& Etzioni, 1999; Faccione, 1999; Lauver, Kane, Bodden et al., 1999). Many nurses direct their efforts at educating women about the benefits of mammography. Working to overcome barriers to screening mammography, especially among the elderly and women with disabilities, is an important nursing intervention in the community, and nurses have an important role in the development of educational materials targeted to specific literacy levels and ethnic groups.

\section*{Galactography}

Galactography is a mammographic diagnostic procedure that involves injection of less than 1 mL of radiopaque material through a cannula inserted into a ductal opening on the areola, followed by a mammogram. It is performed when the patient has a bloody nipple discharge on expression, spontaneous nipple discharge, or a solitary dilated duct noted on mammography. These symptoms may indicate a benign lesion or a cancerous one.

\section*{ULTRASONOGRAPHY}

Ultrasonography (ultrasound) is used in conjunction with mammography to distinguish fluid-filled cysts from other lesions. A transducer is used to transmit high-frequency sound waves through the skin and into the breast, and an echo signal is measured. The echo waves are interpreted electronically and then displayed on a screen. This technique is $95 \%$ to $99 \%$ accurate in diagnosing cysts but does not definitively rule out a malignant lesion.

For women with dense breasts, the introduction of screening ultrasound examinations has been researched during this past decade. The addition of ultrasonography to breast cancer screening can increase the sensitivity of screening for this population of women, who tend to be either young or on hormone replacement therapy. The largest study showed an increase in cancer detection by $17 \%$ with the addition of screening ultrasonography (Kolb, Lichy \& Newhouse, 1998). Further research will help provide information on the usefulness of ultrasound as a screening modality.

\section*{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is a promising tool for use in diagnosing breast conditions. It is a highly sensitive, although not specific, test and serves as an adjunct to mammography. A coil is placed around the breast, and the patient is placed inside the MRI machine for about 2 minutes. An injection of gadolinium, a contrast dye, is given intravenously. MRI of the breast can be helpful in determining the exact size of a lesion or the presence of multiple foci more precisely than mammography. It also can determine more precisely than a CT scan if a lesion is fixed to the chest wall. Other uses include identifying occult (undetectable) breast cancer, determining the tumor's response to chemotherapy, and determining the integrity of saline or silicone breast implants. The cost of breast MRI, however, is high; therefore, it is not currently used for routine screening. However, the sensitivity of the MRI may be beneficial for cancer detection in higher-risk women, and the results from preliminary studies are encouraging (Schnall, 2001).

\section*{PROCEDURES FOR TISSUE ANALYSIS}

\section*{Fine-Needle Aspiration}

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is an outpatient procedure usually initiated when mammography, ultrasonography, or palpation detects a lesion. A surgeon performs the procedure when there is a palpable lesion, or a radiologist performs it under x-ray guidance for nonpalpable lesions. Injection of a local anesthetic may or may not be used, but most times the surgeon or radiologist inserts a 21 - or 22 -gauge needle attached to a syringe into the site to be sampled. The syringe is then used to withdraw tissue or fluid into the needle. This cytologic material is spread on a slide and sent to the laboratory for analysis. FNA is less expensive than other diagnostic methods, and results are usually available quickly; however, this diagnostic test is often not $100 \%$ accurate, and the false-negative rate is substantial. False-negative or false-positive results are possible, and clinical follow-up depends on the level of suspicion about the breast lesion.

\section*{Stereotactic Biopsy}

Stereotactic biopsy, also an outpatient procedure, is performed for nonpalpable lesions found on mammography. The patient lies prone on a special table, and the breast is positioned through an opening in the table and compressed for a mammogram. The lesion to be sampled is then located with the aid of a computer. Next, a local anesthetic is injected into the entry site on the breast, a core needle is inserted, and samples of the tissue are taken for pathologic examination. If the lesion is small, a clip is placed at the site of the biopsy, so that a specific area can be visualized again as another mammogram is performed. This technique allows ac-
curate diagnosis and often allows the patient to avoid a surgical biopsy, although some patients may end up needing a surgical biopsy, depending on the pathologic diagnosis.

\section*{Surgical Biopsy}

Surgical biopsy is the most common outpatient surgical procedure. Eight of 10 lesions are benign on biopsy. The procedure is usually done using local anesthesia, moderate sedation, or both. The biopsy involves excising the lesion and sending it to the laboratory for pathologic examination.

\section*{EXCISIONAL BIOPSY}

Excisional biopsy is the usual procedure for any palpable breast mass. The entire lesion, plus a margin of surrounding tissue, is removed. This type of biopsy may also be referred to as a lumpectomy. Depending on the clinical situation, a frozen section may be done at the time of the biopsy (a small piece of the mass or lesion is given a provisional diagnosis by the pathologist), so that the surgeon can provide the patient with a diagnosis in the recovery room.

\section*{INCISIONAL BIOPSY}

Incisional biopsy is performed when tissue sampling alone is required; this is done both to confirm a diagnosis and to determine the hormonal receptor status. Complete excision of the area may not be possible or immediately beneficial to the patient, depending on the clinical situation. This procedure is often performed in women with locally advanced breast cancer or in cancer patients with a suspicion of recurrent disease, whose treatment may depend on the tumor's estrogen and progesterone receptor status. These receptors are identified during pathologic examination of the tissue.

\section*{TRU-CUT CORE BIOPSY}

In a Tru-Cut core biopsy, the surgeon uses a special large-lumen needle to remove a core of tissue. This procedure is used when a tumor is relatively large and close to the skin surface and the surgeon strongly suspects that the lesion is a carcinoma. If cancer is diagnosed, the tissue is also tested for hormone receptor status.

\section*{WIRE NEEDLE LOCALIZATION}

Wire needle localization is a technique used when mammography detects minute, pinpoint calcifications (indicating a potential malignancy) or nonpalpable lesions and a biopsy is necessary. A long, thin wire is inserted, usually painlessly, through a needle before the excisional biopsy under mammographic guidance to ensure that the wire tip designates the area to undergo biopsy. The wire remains in place after the needle is withdrawn to ensure a precise biopsy. The patient is then taken to the operating room, where the surgeon follows the wire down and excises the area around the wire tip. The tissue removed is x-rayed at the time of the procedure; these specimen x-rays, along with follow-up mammograms taken several weeks later (after the site has healed), verify that the area of concern was located and removed.

\section*{Nursing Care of the Patient Undergoing a Breast Biopsy}

Breast biopsies are one of the most common ambulatory surgical procedures performed, with $80 \%$ of the results negative for malignancy (Norris, 2001). Prior to the procedure, the nurse's
role is to provide instruction; however, it is important for the nurse to first assess how the woman is coping with her need for the procedure and her ability to process information about the procedure and the possible implications of the biopsy results. Anxiety and fear are normal responses to the need for a breast biopsy, but these responses may interfere with the woman's ability to recall and understand the information that is provided prior to the procedure. Therefore, written information and booklets are used to reinforce teaching. The nurse also must give the patient an opportunity to address issues and concerns related to the biopsy.

The nurse instructs the patient to avoid use of agents that can interfere with blood clotting and increase the risk for bleeding. Among these agents are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E supplements, herbal substances (such as gingko biloba and garlic supplements), warfarin, and products containing aspirin. The patient may be instructed not to eat or drink after midnight, depending on the type of biopsy planned. Most breast biopsy procedures today are performed with the use of moderate sedation and local anesthesia; thus, the recovery period is relatively brief.

Postoperative assessment includes monitoring the effects of the anesthesia and inspection of the dressing covering the incision. Prior to discharge from the ambulatory surgery center or office, the patient must be able to tolerate fluids or food, ambulate, and void. The patient should be accompanied home by a family member or friend. At discharge, the nurse reviews with the patient the care of the biopsy site, pain management, and activity restrictions. The dressing covering the incision is usually removed on the second day, but use of a supportive bra is encouraged immediately after the procedure for 3 to 7 days to limit movement of the breast and reduce discomfort. Steri-strips applied over the incision are left in place until they start to come off, usually a couple of weeks after the procedure. A follow-up telephone call to the patient by the nurse 24 to 48 hours after the procedure is standard care and provides an opportunity for the nurse to answer any questions the patient might have.

Most women return to their usual activities the day after the procedure but are encouraged to avoid jarring or high-impact activities for 1 week to promote healing of the biopsy site. Discomfort is usually minimal from the procedure and most women find acetaminophen sufficient for pain relief; however, a mild opioid may be prescribed, if needed.

Follow-up after the biopsy includes a return visit to the surgeon for discussion of the final pathology report and assessment of the healing of the biopsy site. Depending on the results of the biopsy, the nurse's role varies. If the pathology report is negative for cancer, the nurse reviews incision care and explains what to expect as the biopsy site heals (ie, changes in sensation may occur weeks or months after the biopsy due to injury to the nerves within the breast tissue). If a diagnosis of cancer is made, the nurse's role changes dramatically; this is discussed in depth later in this chapter.

\section*{Overview of Breast Conditions and Diseases}

Not all disorders of the breast are cancerous. Some disorders are structural, such as fissure, or infection-related, such as mastitis. Some conditions may progress from a benign to a malignant condition, such as benign proliferative breast disease, and some conditions are clearly cancer of various kinds in various stages.

\section*{Conditions Affecting the Nipple}

\section*{FISSURE}

A fissure is a longitudinal ulcer that tends to develop in breastfeeding women. If the nipple becomes irritated, a painful, raw area may form and become a site of infection. Daily washing with water, massage with breast milk or lanolin, and exposure to air are helpful. Breastfeeding can continue with a nipple shield, if necessary. If the fissure is severe or extremely painful, the woman is advised to stop breastfeeding; a breast pump can be used until the breastfeeding can be resumed. Persistent ulceration requires further diagnosis and therapy. Guidance with breastfeeding from a nurse or lactation consultant may be helpful because nipple irritation can result from improper positioning (ie, the infant has not grasped the areola fully).

\section*{BREAST DISCHARGE}

Breast discharge in a woman who is not lactating may be related to many causes. Carcinoma, papilloma, pituitary adenoma, cystic breasts, and various medications can result in a discharge of fluid from the nipple. Oral contraceptives, pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy, chlorpromazine-type medications, and frequent breast stimulation may be contributing factors. In some athletic women, breast discharge may occur during running or aerobic exercises. Breast discharge should be evaluated by the health care provider, but it is not often a cause for alarm. One in three women have clear discharge on expression, which is usually normal. Causes for concern are green discharge, which usually indicates infection, and brown or red discharge, which is indicative of a disorder. Spontaneous discharge should always be evaluated because it is not normal unless a woman is lactating. The discharge is examined for fat globules to determine if it is breast milk. It is also tested for occult blood because malignancy must be considered.

\section*{BLEEDING OR BLOODY NIPPLE DISCHARGE}

At times, a bloody discharge may be produced when pressure is placed on one area at the edge of the areola. Although a bloody discharge can signal a malignancy, it usually results from a wartlike, benign epithelial tumor or papilloma growing in one of the large collecting ducts just at the edge of the areola or in an area of cystic disease. Bleeding occurs with any trauma, and the blood collects in the duct until it is pressed out at the nipple. Treatment includes excision of the duct with the papilloma. Such a lesion is usually benign, but it should be evaluated histologically after it is removed to rule out malignancy.

\section*{Breast Infections}

\section*{MASTITIS}

Mastitis, an inflammation or infection of breast tissue, occurs most commonly in breastfeeding women, although it may also occur in nonlactating women. The infection may result from a transfer of microorganisms to the breast by the patient's hands or those of others or from a breastfed infant with an oral, eye, or skin infection. Mastitis may also be caused by bloodborne organisms. As inflammation progresses, an infection of the ducts results, causing milk to stagnate in one or more of the lobules. The breast
texture becomes tough or doughy, and the patient complains of dull pain in the infected region. A nipple that is discharging purulent material, serum, or blood needs to be investigated.

Treatment consists of antibiotics and local heat. A broadspectrum antibiotic agent may be prescribed for 7 to 10 days. The patient should wear a snug bra and perform personal hygiene carefully. Adequate rest and hydration are important aspects of management.

\section*{LACTATIONAL ABSCESS}

A breast abscess may develop as a consequence of acute mastitis. In such a case, the area affected becomes tender and red. Purulent matter can usually be expressed from the nipple, and incision and drainage are usually required. At the time of drainage, specimens are obtained for culture.

\section*{Benign Conditions of the Breast}

Benign breast lesions include fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas, and cysts.

\section*{FIBROCYSTIC BREAST CHANGES}

Fibrocystic breast changes occur as ducts dilate and cysts form. This condition occurs most commonly in women ages 30 to 50 years. Although the cause is unknown, estrogen appears to be a factor because cysts usually disappear after menopause. Cystic
areas often fluctuate in size, depending on the menstrual cycle. They are usually larger premenstrually and smaller postmenstrually because of the retention of fluid in the days preceding the menstrual period. The cysts may be painless or may become very tender premenstrually. Occasionally, a patient may report breast pain, which is usually intermittent and can be shooting or a dull ache (Table 48-1 describes various breast masses). Breast pain (mastalgia) is usually related to hormonal fluctuations and their effect on the breasts or is stimulated by irritation of a nerve in the chest wall from an activity such as weight training.

\section*{Medical Management}

If pain and tenderness are severe, danazol (Danocrine) may be prescribed; this agent has an antiestrogenic effect, therefore decreasing breast pain and nodularity. Danazol is used only in severe cases because of its potential side effects, which include flushing, vaginitis, and androgenic changes (virilization).

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse may recommend that the patient wear a supportive bra both day and night for a week except during bathing, decrease her salt and caffeine intake, and take ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) as needed for its anti-inflammatory actions. Vitamin E supplements or oil of evening primrose (an over-the-counter herbal preparation) may also be helpful, but this recommendation is based on anecdotal information from patients, not on research.

\section*{Table 48-1 - Variations in Breast Masses}

The most common breast masses are due to fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas, or malignancy. Biopsy is usually needed for confirmation, but the following characteristics are diagnostic clues:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline CHARACTERISTICS & FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES & FIBROADENOMAS & MALIGNANCY \\

\end{tabular}

If diuretic agents or oral contraceptives are prescribed, the patient should know that symptoms usually recur after these medications are discontinued. Patients should also be reassured that breast pain is rarely indicative of cancer in its early stages. If the pain is not relieved after menses begins, however, the woman should see her primary health care provider.

\section*{FIBROADENOMAS}

Fibroadenomas are firm, round, movable, benign tumors of the breast that usually affect women in their late teens to late 30s. These masses are nontender and are sometimes removed for diagnostic certainty.

\section*{OTHER BENIGN CONDITIONS}

Cystosarcoma phyllodes is a fibroepithelial lesion that tends to grow rapidly. It is rarely malignant and is surgically excised. If it is malignant, mastectomy may follow. Fat necrosis is a rare condition of the breast that is often related to trauma from a blow; however, it may be indistinguishable from carcinoma, and the entire mass is usually excised.

Gigantomastia or macromastia (overly large breasts) is a problem for some women. Weight loss and various medications have been tried to little avail. Reduction mammoplasty (discussed later in this chapter) is an elective procedure for the patient who is physically or emotionally distressed by this condition. Superficial thrombophlebitis of the breast (Mondor's disease) is an uncommon condition that is usually associated with pregnancy, trauma, or breast surgery. Pain and redness occur as a result of a superficial thrombophlebitis in the vein that drains the outer part of the breast. The mass is usually linear, tender, and erythematous. Treatment consists of analgesics and heat.

\section*{BENIGN PROLIFERATIVE BREAST DISEASE}

The two most common diagnoses of benign proliferative breast disease found on biopsy are atypical hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. Both of these diagnoses increase a woman's risk for the development of breast cancer. Atypical hyperplasia is an abnormal increase in the ductal or lobular cells in the breast and is usually found incidentally in mammographic abnormalities. Atypical hyperplasia increases a woman's risk for breast cancer about $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ over a period of 10 years; the risk is greater for premenopausal women and decreases significantly after menopause (Hulka \& Moorman, 2001). Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is usually an incidental finding in breast tissue because it cannot be seen on mammography and does not form a palpable lump. Historically, LCIS was considered a premalignant condition, and treatment consisted of a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy; however, current research indicates that LCIS is a marker for the risk for invasive breast cancer, which can either be ductal or lobular in origin and can develop in either breast. LCIS increases a woman's risk for breast cancer by about $25 \%$ to $40 \%$ over a period of 25 years, and the risk does not diminish with time (Frykberg, 1999).

For women at higher risk, a newer technique called ductal lavage may be used. It involves inserting a microcatheter through the nipple while instilling saline and retrieving the fluid for analysis. It has been shown to identify atypical cells in this population (Dooley, Ljung, Veronisi et al., 2001), providing women with
more information regarding their risk. This procedure, which is done in the office and is well tolerated, was found to be more useful at detecting cellular changes within the breast tissue. Continued research is needed to determine its benefit in screening and early detection for women at high risk.

\section*{Medical Management}

After a woman has been diagnosed with a benign proliferative condition such as atypical hyperplasia or LCIS, she has three treatment options: long-term surveillance (observation), bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (a risk-reducing surgical procedure), or chemoprevention (using a medication to decrease the risk of developing breast cancer). Each of these options may be offered by a breast specialist, usually associated with a comprehensive breast center. Most women choose surveillance and attempt to modify certain risk factors, such as diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption. For some women, however, prophylactic mastectomy may be an option (see discussion later in this chapter); taking tamoxifen (Nolvadex) may be an option for others. Tamoxifen has recently been shown to decrease the incidence of invasive breast cancer for high-risk women by $49 \%$ (Fisher, Constantino, Wickerham et al., 1998). The risks and benefits of each of these options must be explained so that the woman can make a careful decision.

\section*{Malignant Conditions of the Breast}

Breast cancer is a major health problem in the United States. Its overall incidence rose by 54\% between 1950 and 1990. In the 1990s, the incidence leveled off and stabilized (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2002). At present, there is no cure for breast cancer. Between 1990 and 1994, the mortality for breast cancer decreased by $5.6 \%$, the largest short-term decline in more than 40 years, suggesting that the combination of early detection and better systemic treatment options is having an effect on overall survival.

Current statistics indicate that a woman's lifetime risk for developing breast cancer is 1 in 8 , but this risk is not the same for all age groups. For example, the risk for developing breast cancer by age 35 years is 1 in 622; the risk for developing breast cancer by age 60 years is 1 in 23. Approximately 80\% of breast cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 193,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year, with an estimated 40,000 deaths. About $1 \%$ of these cancers occur in men. Women who are diagnosed with earlystage localized breast cancer have a 5-year survival rate of 98\% (ACS, 2002).

\section*{CARCINOMA IN SITU (NONINVASIVE)}

In situ carcinoma of the breast is being detected more frequently with the widespread use of screening mammography. Since the introduction of widespread mammographic screening over the past two decades, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has accounted for approximately $20 \%$ of diagnosed breast cancers (Winchester, Jeske \& Goldschmidt, 2000). This disease is characterized by the proliferation of malignant cells within the ducts and lobules, without invasion into the surrounding tissue; therefore, it is a noninvasive form of cancer and is considered stage 0 breast cancer. There are two types of in situ carcinoma: ductal and lobular.

\section*{Ductal Carcinoma in Situ}

DCIS, the more common of the two types, is divided histologically into two major subtypes (comedo and noncomedo), but there are many different forms of noncomedo DCIS. Because DCIS has the capacity to progress to invasive cancer, the most traditional treatment is total or simple mastectomy (removal of the breast only), with a cure rate of $98 \%$ to $99 \%$ (Winchester et al., 2000). The use of breast-conserving surgery for invasive cancer led to the use of breast-conservation therapy (limited surgery followed by radiation) for patients with DCIS, and this option is appropriate for localized lesions. More than half of cases of DCIS are now being treated with breast-conservation therapy; however, the rate of local recurrence is $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ (Solin, Fourquet, Vicini et al., 2001). In some cases, lumpectomy alone is an option, but this is decided on a case-by-case basis. In 1999, a large study demonstrated that tamoxifen (Nolvadex) significantly reduced local recurrence rates (Fisher, Dignam, Wolmark et al., 1999). Following this, the FDA approved the use of tamoxifen for women with DCIS after treatment with surgery and radiation. It is usually prescribed for 5 years.

\section*{Lobular Carcinoma in Situ}

LCIS is characterized by proliferation of cells within the breast lobules. LCIS is usually an incidental finding discovered on pathologic evaluation of a breast biopsy for a breast change noted during physical examination or on screening mammography. It is commonly associated with multicentric disease and is rarely associated with invasive cancer. Historically, treatment was bilateral total mastectomy, but current thinking that LCIS is a marker of increased risk for the development of an invasive cancer (rather than an actual malignancy) has changed this approach. Long-term surveillance is one appropriate option. Another option is a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy to decrease risk; current research (Hartmann et al., 1999) suggests that a $90 \%$ reduction in risk is possible with this option. (Prophylactic mastectomy is discussed in more detail at the end of this chapter.) The other treatment option for LCIS is chemoprevention. In fall 1998, the FDA approved the use of tamoxifen (Nolvadex) as a chemopreventive agent prescribed for 5 years for women at high risk; however, as with any drug, tamoxifen has both benefits and risks, along with possible side effects.

\section*{INVASIVE CARCINOMA}

\section*{Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma}

Infiltrating ductal carcinomas are the most common histologic type of breast cancer and account for $75 \%$ of all breast cancers. These tumors are notable because of their hardness on palpation. They usually metastasize to the axillary nodes. Prognosis is poorer than for other cancer types.

\section*{Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma}

Infiltrating lobular carcinoma accounts for 5\% to 10\% of breast cancers. These tumors typically occur as an area of ill-defined thickening in the breast, as compared with the infiltrating ductal types. They are most often multicentric; that is, several areas of thickening may occur in one or both breasts. Infiltrating ductal and infiltrating lobular carcinomas usually spread to bone, lung, liver, or brain, whereas lobular carcinomas may metastasize to meningeal surfaces or other unusual sites.

\section*{Medullary Carcinoma}

Medullary carcinoma constitutes about $6 \%$ of breast cancers and grows in a capsule inside a duct. This type of tumor can become large, but the prognosis is often favorable.

\section*{Mucinous Cancer}

Mucinous cancer accounts for about $3 \%$ of breast cancers. A mucin producer, it is also slow-growing and thus has a more favorable prognosis than many other types.

\section*{Tubular Ductal Cancer}

Tubular ductal cancer accounts for only $2 \%$ of cancers. Because axillary metastases are uncommon with this histology, prognosis is usually excellent.

\section*{Inflammatory Carcinoma}

Inflammatory carcinoma is a rare type of breast cancer ( $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ ) with symptoms different from those of other breast cancers. The localized tumor is tender and painful, and the skin over it is red and dusky. The breast is abnormally firm and enlarged. Often, edema and nipple retraction occur. These symptoms rapidly grow more severe and usually prompt the woman to seek health care sooner than the woman with a small breast mass. The disease can spread to other parts of the body rapidly; chemotherapeutic agents play a major role in attempting to control the progression of this disease. Radiation and surgery are also used to control spread.

\section*{Paget's Disease}

Paget's disease of the breast accounts for $1 \%$ of diagnosed breast cancer cases. A scaly lesion and burning and itching around the nipple-areola complex are frequent symptoms. The neoplasm is ductal and may be in situ alone or may also have invasive cancer cells. Often, a tumor mass cannot be palpated underneath the nipple where this disease arises. Mammography may be the only diagnostic test that detects the tumor, but results of the mammogram are often negative, making biopsy of the lesion the only definitive test.

\section*{Current Research in Breast Cancer}

Because of the incidence, significant mortality, and lack of a cure, breast cancer survivors, advocates, and activists have brought social and political attention to this disease and put it in the national spotlight. Activists have demanded and obtained increased federal funding for a national program aimed at finding a cure for breast cancer.

Preventing the development of cancer through the use of medications is a relatively new and exciting area of research. In April 1998, the results of the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial were released to the general public. This nationwide, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated tamoxifen (Nolvadex) versus a placebo in more than 13,000 women considered to be at high risk for the development of breast cancer. The women who received tamoxifen had a $45 \%$ reduction in the incidence of breast cancer (Fisher et al., 1998). These results suggested that tamoxifen was an effective chemopreventive agent. Much attention has been focused on this medication, and it is
now available with FDA approval for high-risk women. Clinicians are still unclear, however, about who should receive the medication, and no consensus exists. Nurses can provide information to patients on the benefits, risks, and possible side effects of tamoxifen to help women in considering this option.

Another agent that shows promise for chemoprevention is raloxifene (Evista). This medication is FDA approved for the prevention of osteoporosis; however, in the studies that have been performed, incidental findings indicated that fewer of the women who received raloxifene developed breast cancer (Cummings, Eckert, Kreuger et al., 1999). This has led to the hypothesis that this drug may also be an effective chemopreventive agent. Researchers are conducting another nationwide, randomized clinical trial, the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, which is comparing these two agents in postmenopausal women for the prevention of breast cancer. Twenty-two thousand women are needed for this trial, so results will not be available until later in the decade.

\section*{Prophylactic Mastectomy}

Some women who are at high risk for breast cancer may elect to undergo prophylactic mastectomy. This procedure can reduce the risk for cancer by $90 \%$ (Hartmann et al., 1999; MeijersHeijboer, van Geel, van Putten et al., 2001), so a more appropriate term for this surgery is "risk-reducing" mastectomy. The procedure, performed by a breast surgeon, consists of a total mastectomy (removal of breast tissue only). Possible candidates are women with a strong family history of breast cancer, a diagnosis of LCIS or atypical hyperplasia, a diagnosis of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene mutation (see following discussion), an extreme fear of cancer ("cancer phobia"), or previous cancer in one breast. Many women opt for immediate reconstruction with the mastectomy.

The woman needs to understand that this surgery is elective and not emergent. To be sure that she understands the implications of surgery, the woman should be offered a consultation with a plastic surgeon, a genetic counseling session, and a psychological evaluation. Women who make an informed decision tend to demonstrate more satisfaction with the cosmetic results (Rowland, Desmond, Meyerowitz et al., 2000).

Nursing interventions for the woman considering a riskreducing mastectomy include ensuring that the patient has information about reconstructive options and providing referrals to the plastic surgeon, genetic counselor, and psychological counselor. Many women need time to think over the procedure, and the nurse can be helpful in answering questions about the procedure and its implications and in assisting the patient to decide whether the surgery is an appropriate option. The woman considering this option may wish to talk with a woman who has had the procedure.

\section*{Breast Cancer}

There is no single, specific cause of breast cancer; rather, a combination of hormonal, genetic, and possibly environmental events may contribute to its development.

\section*{Etiology}

Hormones produced by the ovaries have an important role in breast cancer. Two key ovarian hormones, estradiol and progesterone, are altered in the cellular environment by a variety of factors, and these may affect growth factors for breast cancer.

\section*{HORMONES}

The role of hormones and their relationship to breast cancer remain controversial. Research suggests that a relationship exists between estrogen exposure and the development of breast cancer. In laboratory studies, tumors grow much faster when exposed to estrogen, and epidemiologic research suggests that women who have longer exposure to estrogen have a higher risk for breast cancer. Early menarche, nulliparity, childbirth after 30 years of age, and late menopause are known but minor risk factors. The assumption is that these factors are all associated with prolonged exposure to estrogen because of menstruation. The theory is that each cycle (which has high levels of endogenous estrogen) provides the cells of the breast another chance to mutate, increasing the chance for cancer to develop. Estrogen itself does not cause breast cancer, but it is associated with its development.

\section*{GENETICS}

Growing evidence indicates that genetic alterations are associated with the development of breast cancer. These genetic alterations include changes or mutations in normal genes and the influence of proteins that either promote or suppress the development of breast cancer. Genetic alterations may be somatic (acquired) or germline (inherited). To date, two gene mutations have been identified that may play a role in the development of breast cancer. A mutation in the BRCA-1 gene has been linked to the development of breast and ovarian cancer, whereas a mutation in the BRCA-2 gene identifies risk for breast cancer, but less so for ovarian cancer (Houshmand, Campbell, Briggs et al., 2000). These gene mutations may also play a role in the development of colon, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, but this is far from clear at present. It has been estimated that 1 of 600 women in the general population has either a BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene mutation. For women who carry either mutation, the risk for developing breast cancer can range from $50 \%$ to $90 \%$ (Kauff, Satagopan, Robson et al., 2002).

At present, only 5\% to 10\% of all breast cancers are estimated to be associated with the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene mutations. It is thought, however, that breast cancer is genetic and that up to $80 \%$ of women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years have a genetic component to their disease (Boyd, 1996). This is believed to be linked to either unidentified BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 carriers or less penetrating genes that have yet to be identified through genetics research. A woman's risk for either BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 should be interpreted with caution and with an exhaustive look at all her other risk factors; this is usually carried out by a genetics counselor.

Abnormalities in either of the two genes can be identified by a blood test; however, women should be counseled about the risks and benefits before actually undergoing genetic testing. The risks and benefits of a positive or negative result should be explored. Treatment options for a positive result are long-term surveillance, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, or chemoprevention with tamoxifen, as discussed previously. A positive result can cause tremendous anxiety and fear, can unleash potential discrimination in employment and insurability, and can cause a woman to search for answers that may not be available. A negative result can produce survivor guilt in a person with a strong family history of cancer. For these women, the risk for breast cancer is similar to that of the general population, and routine screening guidelines should be followed. The decision to pursue genetic testing must be made carefully, and women should be asked what they will do differently after they know the results. Furthermore, because
testing is relatively new and health care providers have yet to determine a true benefit from a positive or negative result, genetic testing should be done under the auspices of clinical research protocols to protect the patient (because these data are kept separate from the patient's medical record). Nurses play a role in educating patients and their family members about the implications of genetic testing. Ethical issues related to genetic testing include possible employment discrimination, bias in insurability and possibly with insurance rates, and family members' concerns (eg, effect on siblings, children).

\section*{Risk Factors}

Although there are no specific known causes of breast cancer, researchers have identified a cluster of risk factors (Chart 48-3). These factors are important in helping to develop prevention programs. However, nearly $60 \%$ of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no identifiable risk factors other than their hormonal environment (Vogel, 2000). Thus, all women are considered at risk for developing breast cancer during their lifetime. Nonetheless, identifying risk factors provides a means for identifying women who may benefit from increased surveillance and early treatment. In addition, further research into risk factors will help in developing strategies to prevent or modify breast cancer in the future.

A high-fat diet was once thought to increase the risk of breast cancer. Epidemiologic studies of American and Japanese women showed that American women had a fivefold higher rate of breast cancer. Japanese women who moved to the United States were shown to have breast cancer rates similar to their Caucasian counterparts. Recent cohort studies show only weak or inconclusive relationships between a high-fat diet and breast cancer (Brown et al., 2001). Because fat intake is implicated in colon cancer and heart disease, however, women may benefit from lowering their intake of fat.

Oral contraceptives were once thought to increase the risk for breast cancer. Currently, no association is thought to exist in women in the general population, but there are no data about the effect on women considered to be at high risk.

The role of smoking in breast cancer remains unclear. Most studies suggest that smoking does not increase a woman's risk for breast cancer. Some studies, however, suggest that smoking does increase the risk for breast cancer and that the earlier a woman begins smoking, the higher her risk. Smoking does increase the risk for lung cancer, which is the leading cause of death in women with cancer (breast cancer is second). Smoking cessation is part of a healthy lifestyle, and nurses have a key role in providing women with information about smoking cessation programs.

Silicone breast implants can be associated with fibrous capsular contraction, and some women and medical professionals have claimed an association with certain immune disorders. There is no evidence, however, that breast implants are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

\section*{Protective Factors}

Certain factors may be protective in relation to the development of breast cancer. Regular, vigorous exercise has been shown to decrease risk, perhaps because it can delay menarche, suppress menstruation, and, like pregnancy, reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles. Also, exercise decreases body fat, where estrogens are stored and produced from other steroid hormones. Thus, decreased body fat can decrease extended exposure to estrogen.

\section*{Risk Factors for Breast Cancer}

BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genetic mutation
Women with gene mutation have a $50 \%$ to $90 \%$ chance of developing breast cancer and a 50/50 possibility of developing breast cancer before 50 years of age
Increasing age
Greatest risk for breast cancer occurs after age 50.
Personal or family history of breast cancer
Risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast increases about $1 \%$ per year.
Risk increases twofold if first-degree female relatives (sister, mother, or daughter) had breast cancer
Risk increases if the mother was affected with cancer before 60 years of age.
Risk increases four to six times if breast cancer occurred in two first-degree relatives.
Early menarche
Menses beginning before 12 years of age
Nulliparity and late maternal age at first birth
Women having their first child after 30 years of age have twice the risk for breast cancer as women having first child before 20 years of age.
Late menopause
Menopause after 55 years of age but women with bilateral oophorectomy before 35 years of age have one third the risk.
History of benign proliferative breast disease
Risk doubles in women with benign tumors with proliferative epithelial changes; risk quadruples with atypical hyperplasia or LCIS.
Exposure to ionizing radiation between puberty and 30 years of age.
Risk doubles; exposure to radiation causes potential aberrations while the breast cells are developing.
Obesity
Weak risk among obese postmenopausal women: estrogen is stored in body adipose tissue, and dietary fat increases pituitary prolactin, thus increasing estrogen production. Obese women diagnosed with breast cancer have a higher mortality rate, which may be related to these hormonal influences or perhaps a delayed diagnosis.
Hormone replacement therapy
Reported risk for breast cancer related to hormone replacement therapy varies.
Older women taking estrogen supplements for more than 5 years may have an increased risk; addition of progesterone to estrogen replacement decreases the incidence of endometrial cancer, but it does not decrease the risk of breast cancer.
Alcohol intake
As a risk factor, alcohol use remains controversial; however, a slightly increased risk is found in women who consume even one drink daily. The risk doubles among women drinking three drinks daily. In countries where wine is consumed daily (eg, France and Italy), the rate is slightly higher. Some research findings suggest that young women who drink alcohol are more vulnerable in later years.

Breastfeeding is also thought to decrease risk because it prevents the return of menstruation, again decreasing exposure to endogenous estrogen. Having had a full-term pregnancy before the age of 30 years is also thought to be protective. Protective hormones are released after delivery of the fetus, with the purpose of reverting to normal the proliferation of cells in the breast that occur with pregnancy.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Breast cancers occur anywhere in the breast, but most are found in the upper outer quadrant, where most breast tissue is located. Generally, the lesions are nontender rather than painful, fixed rather than mobile, and hard with irregular borders rather than encapsulated and smooth. Complaints of diffuse breast pain and tenderness with menstruation are usually associated with benign breast disease. Marked pain at presentation, however, may be associated with breast cancer in the later stages.

With the increased use of mammography, more women are seeking treatment at an earlier stage of disease. These women may have no symptoms and no palpable lump, but abnormal lesions are detected on mammography. Unfortunately, many women with advanced disease seek initial treatment only after ignoring symptoms. For example, they may seek attention for dimpling or for a peau d'orange (orange-peel) appearance of the skin (a condition caused by swelling that results from obstructed lymphatic circulation in the dermal layer). Nipple retraction and lesions fixed to the chest wall may also be evident. Involvement of the skin is manifested by ulcerating and fungating lesions. These classic signs and symptoms characterize breast cancer in the late stages. A high index of suspicion should be maintained with any breast abnormality, and abnormalities should be promptly evaluated.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Techniques to determine the histology and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer include FNA, excisional (or open) biopsy, incisional biopsy, needle localization, core biopsy, and stereotactic biopsy (all described previously). In addition to the staging criteria described below, other pathologic features and prognostic tests are used to identify different patient groups that may benefit from adjuvant treatment. Histologic examination of the cancer cells
helps determine the prognosis and leads to a better understanding of how the disease progresses.

\section*{Breast Cancer Staging}

Staging involves classifying the cancer by the extent of disease (see Fig. 48-5). Staging of any cancer is important because it helps the health care team identify and recommend the best treatment available, offer a prognosis, and compare the results of various treatment regimens. Several diagnostic tests and procedures are performed in the staging of the disease. These may include chest x-rays, bone scans, and liver function tests. Clinical staging involves the physician's estimate of the size of the breast tumor and the extent of axillary node involvement by physical examination (palpable nodes may indicate progression of the disease) and mammography. After the diagnostic workup and the definitive surgical treatment, the breast cancer is staged according to the TNM system (Greene, Page, Fleming, et al., 2002), which evaluates the size of the tumor, number of nodes involved, and evidence of distant metastasis. Pathologic staging based on histology provides information for a more accurate prognosis. Table 48-2 lists typical treatment guidelines by stage at diagnosis (see the following management section for details regarding these treatments).

\section*{Prognosis}

Several features of breast tumors contribute to the prognosis. Generally, the smaller the tumor, the better the prognosis. Carcinoma of the breast is not a pathologic entity that develops overnight. It starts with a genetic alteration in a single cell. It can take about 16 doubling times for a carcinoma to become 1 cm or larger, at which point it becomes clinically apparent. Assuming that it takes at least 30 days for each doubling time, it would take a minimum of 2 years for a carcinoma to become palpable. This

concept is important for nurses in teaching and counseling patients because once breast cancer is diagnosed, women have a safe period of several weeks to make a decision regarding treatment.

The prognosis also depends on whether the cancer has spread. For example, the overall 5 -year survival rate is greater than $98 \%$ when the tumor is confined to the breast (ACS, 2002). When the cancer cells have spread to the regional lymph nodes, however, the overall 5 -year survival rate falls to $76 \%$. The 5-year survival rate for women diagnosed with metastatic disease is $16 \%$. At diagnosis, about $37 \%$ of patients have evidence of regional or distant spread or metastasis. The most common route of regional spread is to the axillary lymph nodes. Table 48-3 describes the relationship between positive axillary lymph nodes and the risk for breast cancer recurrence. Other sites of lymphatic spread include the internal mammary and supraclavicular nodes (Fig. 48-6). Distant metastasis can affect any organ, but the most common sites are bone ( $71 \%$ ), lung ( $69 \%$ ), liver ( $65 \%$ ), pleura ( $51 \%$ ), adrenals ( $49 \%$ ), skin ( $30 \%$ ), and brain ( $20 \%$ ) (Winchester \& Cox, 1998).

In addition to tumor size, nodal involvement, evidence of metastasis, and histologic type, other measures help in determining prognosis. The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptor proteins indicates retention of regulatory controls of the mammary epithelium. The presence of both receptor proteins is associated with an improved prognosis; their absence is associated with a poorer prognosis. Similarly, a tumor with a high degree of differentiation is associated with a better prognosis than a poorly differentiated anaplastic tumor. The assessment of a tumor's proliferative rate (S-phase fraction) and DNA content (ploidy) by laboratory assay may help to determine prognosis because these two factors are strongly correlated with other prognostic factors, and research is ongoing to examine how helpful these two factors may actually be. Tumors classified as diploid (normal DNA content) are associated with a better prognosis than are tumors classified as aneuploid (abnormal DNA content).

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{CHANGING APPROACHES}

In 1990, the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Breast Cancer issued its third statement on the management of breast cancer. Based on worldwide data, breastconserving surgery (such as lumpectomy), along with radiation therapy, was found to result in a survival rate equal to that of modified radical mastectomy. In addition, recommendations were made for systemic treatment with chemotherapy based on the patient's menopausal status and the presence of hormone receptors. For a premenopausal woman without involvement of the lymph nodes, adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended if the woman was at high risk for recurrence. For a postmenopausal woman without involvement of the lymph nodes, adjuvant chemotherapy was not recommended regardless of hormonal receptor status. For a premenopausal woman with involvement of the nodes, adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended. In a postmenopausal woman, hormone therapy was recommended if the woman had an estrogen receptor-positive tumor. The section on hormonal therapy later in this chapter describes this in more depth.

In 1991, the National Cancer Institute issued a clinical alert that altered the recommendations of the 1990 Consensus Development Conference Statement. This alert recommended that all premenopausal, node-negative women at high risk for recurrent disease receive adjuvant chemotherapy. This clinical alert was issued before the results of clinical trials were published, creating confusion among clinicians and patients alike. The 2000 Consensus Development Conference Statement stated that all women with invasive breast cancer should consider systemic chemotherapy, not just women with tumors larger than 1 cm (NIH, 2000).

Decisions regarding local treatment with either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with radiation still vary widely. Mastectomy is still performed in many cases, and rates for breastconserving surgery are higher in metropolitan areas with teaching and research hospitals and medical centers. In the past, women have not routinely been presented with the option of breastconserving surgery by their physicians, and in many instances insurance reimbursement patterns favor mastectomy. Thus, women have not uniformly had the opportunity to exercise informed choice in their options for local treatment, but this is changing as women become more knowledgeable about breast cancer and its treatment. A second opinion regarding treatment options is usually helpful to women diagnosed with breast cancer.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The main goal of surgical treatment is to eradicate the local presence of the cancer. The procedures most often used for the local

management of invasive breast cancer are mastectomy with or without reconstruction and breast-conserving surgery combined with radiation therapy. These procedures are described below. Surgical treatment options are summarized in Table 48-4. For patients who undergo total mastectomy for the treatment of DCIS or as prophylactic surgery for the treatment for LCIS, the nursing care is similar to that of a modified radical mastectomy (described later in the text). However, total mastectomy does not involve the

\end{tabular}
removal of axillary lymph nodes; therefore, mobility of the arm on the affected side is regained much quicker, and there is no risk for lymphedema. Women still face the same psychosocial issues involving the diagnosis of cancer and the loss of the breast, and the nurse needs to address these in a similar manner.

Modified Radical Mastectomy. Modified radical mastectomy is removal of the entire breast tissue, along with axillary lymph nodes. The pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles remain intact. Before surgery, the surgeon plans an incision that will provide maximum opportunity to remove the tumor and the affected nodes. At the same time, efforts are made to avoid a scar that will be visible and restrictive. An objective of surgical treatment is to maintain or restore normal function to the hand, arm, and shoulder girdle on the affected side. Skin flaps and tissue are handled with great care to ensure proper viability, hemostasis, and drainage. If reconstructive surgery is planned, a consultation is made with a plastic surgeon before the mastectomy is performed.

After the tumor is removed, bleeding points are ligated and the skin is closed over the chest wall. Skin grafting is performed if the skin flaps are too small to close the wound. A nonadherent dressing (Adaptic) may be applied and covered by a pressure dressing. Two drainage tubes may be placed in the axilla and beneath the superior skin flap, and portable suction devices may be used; these remove the blood and lymph fluid that collect after surgery. The dressing may be held in place by wide elastic bandages or a surgical bra.

Breast-Conserving Surgery. Breast-conserving surgery consists of lumpectomy, wide excision, partial or segmental mastectomy, or quadrantectomy (resection of the involved breast quadrant) and removal of the axillary nodes (axillary lymph node dissection) for tumors with an invasive component, followed by a course of radiation therapy to treat residual, microscopic disease.

The goal of breast conservation is to remove the tumor completely with clear margins while achieving an acceptable cosmetic result. The axillary lymph nodes are also removed through a separate semicircular incision under the hair-bearing portion of the axilla. A drain is inserted into the axilla through a separate stab
wound to remove blood and lymph fluid. A dressing is applied over the breast and under the arm and is secured with wide elastic bandages or a surgical bra.

Survival rates after breast-conserving surgery are equivalent to those after modified radical mastectomy. The risk for local recurrence, however, is greater, at $1 \%$ per year after surgery (Winchester \& Cox, 1998). If the patient experiences a local recurrence, standard treatment is a completion or salvage mastectomy, in which the rest of the breast tissue is removed. Survival rates after this procedure are equivalent to those after mastectomy, but because the skin has been irradiated, the choices for reconstruction remain limited, and the woman should be informed of this possibility at the time of diagnosis and when considering her treatment options.

Postoperative Issues. The postoperative care of the patient undergoing a modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery is similar because both procedures involve an alteration to the breast and removal of lymph nodes from the axillary region. As with any surgical patient, the immediate focus is recovery from general anesthesia and pain management. In addition, the patient who has had breast surgery may experience both physical and psychological effects. Possible complications include the accumulation of blood (hematoma) at the incision site, infection, and late accumulation of serosanguineous fluid (seroma) after drain removal. Most patients who undergo breast surgery are discharged home with a drainage collection device in place. The nurse teaches the patient and family members to manage the drainage system.

Nerve trauma with resultant phantom breast sensations, numbness, tingling, or burning sensations may also occur and may persist for months or possibly years after surgery. Impaired arm and shoulder mobility can result from the axillary dissection. The disruption of lymphatic and venous drainage can leave the patient at risk for lymphedema (chronic swelling of the affected extremity) at any point after surgery (discussed later in this chapter). Psychological sequelae may include an altered body image or selfconcept as a result of the alteration or loss of the breast. Other major psychosocial concerns include uncertainty about the future, fear of recurrence, and the effects of breast cancer and its treatment on family and work roles.

Lymphatic Mapping and Sentinel Node Biopsy. In the mid 1990s, a new procedure was introduced for use in patients undergoing breast surgery for the treatment of invasive breast cancer. Approximately $60 \%$ of patients who undergo an axillary lymph node dissection to determine the extent of the disease have negative nodes (Veronesi, Galimberti, Zurrida et al., 2001). The use of lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy is changing the way these patients are treated because it provides the same prognostic information as the axillary dissection. A radiocolloid and/or blue dye is injected into the tumor site; the patient then undergoes the surgical procedure. The surgeon uses a hand-held probe to locate the sentinel node (the primary drainage site from the breast) and excises it, and it is examined by the pathologist. If the sentinel node is negative for metastatic breast cancer, a standard axillary dissection is not needed, thus sparing the patient the sequelae of the procedure (surgical drain, altered mobility of the extremity, paresthesias, risk for lymphedema). If the sentinel node is positive, the patient undergoes the standard axillary dissection. Reported results of this technique suggest a success rate of more than $90 \%$ in correctly identifying the sentinel node and correctly predicting axillary metastases (Hsueh, Hansen \& Guiliano, 2000), and many centers have incorporated this procedure into stan-
dards of care. Short-term follow-up demonstrates that the rate of lymphedema is approximately $1 \%$ for women who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy.

Nursing issues for this procedure focus on informing the patient about the expectations and possible implications. Because patients with a negative node are spared the axillary dissection, they may be discharged home the same day. Research is needed on the technique's sequelae, however. Questions to be addressed include: Do patients experience similar sensations in the affected arm as those who had an axillary dissection? Do patients demonstrate impaired mobility? Do these patients develop axillary seromas after the procedure? What is the risk for lymphedema? Initial nursing research on patient care issues related to sentinel node biopsy demonstrates that women who have sentinel node biopsy alone do have neuropathic sensations similar to those who undergo an axillary dissection, although the prevalence, severity, and distress are less so (Baron, Fey, Raboy et al., 2002).

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

With breast-conserving surgery, a course of external-beam radiation therapy usually follows excision of the tumor mass to decrease the chance of local recurrence and to eradicate any residual microscopic cancer cells. Radiation treatment is necessary to obtain results equal to those of removal of the breast. If radiation therapy is contraindicated, mastectomy is the patient's only option (Chart 48-4).

Radiation treatment typically begins about 6 weeks after the surgery to allow the incision to heal. If systemic chemotherapy is indicated, radiation therapy usually begins after completion of the chemotherapy. External-beam irradiation provided by a linear accelerator using photons is delivered on a daily basis over 5 to 7 weeks to the entire breast region. In addition, a concentrated radiation dose or "boost" is administered to the primary site by means of electrons. Before radiation therapy begins, the patient undergoes a planning session for radiation treatment that will serve as the model for daily treatments. Small permanent ink markings are used to identify the breast tissue to be irradiated. Patients need reassurance about the procedure and self-care instructions related to side effects and their management.

Postoperative radiation after mastectomy is not common today but is still used in certain cases: when tumors have spread regionally (chest wall involvement, four or more positive nodes, or tumors larger than 5 cm ). Occasionally, patients who have had a mastectomy require radiation treatment to the chest wall, generally after completion of systemic chemotherapy. Treatment usually consists of a course of external-beam irradiation to the area

\section*{Contraindications to Breast-Conservation Treatment}

Note: Breast-conservation treatment includes both surgery and radiation.

\section*{Absolute Contraindications}
- First or second trimester of pregnancy
- Presence of multicentric disease in the breast
- Prior radiation to the breast or chest region

Relative Contraindications
- History of collagen vascular disease
- Large tumor-to-breast ratio
- Tumor beneath nipple
for a period of several weeks, but the time frame is determined by the radiation oncologist. Some studies suggest that survival may be enhanced for high-risk premenopausal women who receive chest wall irradiation after mastectomy.

Another approach to radiation therapy is the use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), in which a single dose of radiation is delivered to the lumpectomy site immediately after the surgeon has performed the lumpectomy. The dosage is limited to the tumor area, as any errant cells are most likely to be within the approximate area. The typical side effects of skin changes and fatigue are minimized with this approach. It may be as effective as the standard 5- to 7-week radiation course, but long-term data are still needed to determine the effect on local recurrence and survival rates.

Postirradiation Reaction. Generally, radiation therapy is well tolerated. Side effects are temporary and usually consist of mild to moderate skin reaction and fatigue. Fatigue usually occurs about 2 weeks after treatment and may last for several weeks after the treatments are completed. Fatigue can be depressing, as can the frequent trips to the radiation oncology unit or department for treatment. The patient needs to be reassured that the fatigue is normal and not a sign of recurrence. Rare complications of radiation therapy to the breast include pneumonitis, rib fracture, and breast fibrosis.

Postirradiation Nursing Management. Self-care instructions for patients receiving radiation are based on maintaining skin integrity during and after radiation therapy:
- Use mild soap with minimal rubbing.
- Avoid perfumed soaps or deodorants.
- Use hydrophilic lotions (Lubriderm, Eucerin, Aquaphor) for dryness.
- Use a nondrying, antipruritic soap (Aveeno) if itching occurs.
- Avoid tight clothes, underwire bras, excessive temperatures, and ultraviolet light.
Patients may note increased redness and, rarely, skin breakdown at the booster site (tissue site that received concentrated radiation). Important aspects of follow-up care include teaching patients to minimize exposure of the treated area to the sun for 1 year and reassurance that minor twinges and shooting pain in the breast are normal reactions after radiation treatment.

\section*{CHEMOTHERAPY}

Chemotherapy is administered to eradicate the micrometastatic spread of the disease. An overview of chemotherapy is presented in Chapter 16. Although chemotherapy is generally initiated after breast surgery, no single standard exists for the sequencing of systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Ongoing clinical trials may help to determine which treatment sequence produces the best outcomes.

Chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer combine several agents to increase tumor cell destruction and to minimize medication resistance. The chemotherapeutic agents most often used in combination are cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) (C), methotrexate (M), fluorouracil (F), and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (A). Paclitaxel (Taxol) (T) has been recently introduced into the adjuvant chemotherapy setting, and the data from clinical trials suggest a slight survival benefit with its use (Norton, 2001). Additionally, a newer taxane, docetaxel (Taxotere) (T), is being used more frequently, but research remains limited on its difference. The combination regimen of CMF or CAF is a common treat-
ment protocol. AC, ACT (AC given first followed by T), and ATC, with all three agents given together, are other regimens that may be used (Levine, 2001). A new anthracycline agent, epirubicin (Ellence), which has been used more in Europe, is being used in certain regimens and protocols. Decisions regarding the chemotherapeutic protocol are based on the patient's age, physical status, and disease status and whether she is participating in a clinical trial. Chemotherapy treatment modalities are summarized in Table 48-5.

Reactions to Chemotherapy. Anticipatory anxiety is a common response among patients facing chemotherapy. Today, however, side effects can be managed well, with many women continuing their daily work and routine schedules. This has occurred in large measure because of the meticulous educational and psychological preparation provided to patients and their families by oncology nurses, oncologists, social workers, and other members of the health care team. The other factor is the availability of medication regimens that can alleviate the side effects of nausea and vomiting.

Common physical side effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer include nausea, vomiting, taste changes, alopecia (hair loss), mucositis, dermatitis, fatigue, weight gain, and bone marrow suppression. In addition, premenopausal women may experience temporary or permanent amenorrhea leading to sterility.

Less common side effects include hemorrhagic cystitis and conjunctivitis. Although its cause is unknown, weight gain of more than 10 pounds occurs in about half of all patients. Aerobic exercise and its anxiety-alleviating effects may be helpful to decrease weight gain and elevate mood. Side effects may vary with the chemotherapeutic agent used. CMF is generally well tolerated with only minimal side effects. Doxorubicin can be toxic to tissue if it infiltrates the vein, so it is usually diluted and infused through a large vein. Nausea and vomiting can occur. Antiemetics and tranquilizers may provide relief, as may visual imagery and relaxation exercises. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel usually cause alopecia, so obtaining a wig before hair loss occurs may prevent some of the associated emotional trauma. The patient needs reassurance that new hair will grow when treatment is completed, although the color and texture of the hair may differ. It is helpful to provide a list of wig suppliers in the patient's geographic region and to become familiar with creative ways to use scarves and turbans to reduce the patient's reactions to hair loss. The American Cancer Society offers a program called "Look Good, Feel Better" that provides useful tips for applying cosmetics during chemotherapy.

Nursing Management in Chemotherapy. Nurses working with patients receiving chemotherapy play an important role in assisting those who have difficulty with the side effects of treatment. Encouraging the use of medications to limit nausea, vomiting, and mouth sores reduces discomfort during chemotherapy. Some patients may receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a synthetic growth-stimulating factor injected subcutaneously daily for 10 days, which boosts the white blood cell count to prevent nadir fever (a fever that occurs with infection when the blood cell counts are at their lowest level) and infections. The nurse instructs the patient and family on injection technique and about symptoms that require follow-up with a physician (Chart 48-5).

Taking time to explain side effects and possible solutions may alleviate some of the anxiety of women who feel uncomfortable asking questions. The more informed a patient is about the side effects of chemotherapy and how to manage them, the better she can anticipate and deal with them.

Chemotherapy may negatively affect the patient's self-esteem, sexuality, and sense of well-being. Combined with the stress of a potentially life-threatening diagnosis, these changes can be overwhelming. Because many women are distressed by financial concerns and time spent away from the family, nursing support and teaching can reduce emotional distress during treatment. Important aspects of nursing care include communicating, facilitating support groups, encouraging patients to ask questions, and promoting trust in health care providers. Adequate time must be scheduled for clinical appointments to allow discussion and questions. Most women with breast cancer today are treated in a multidisciplinary environment, and referrals to the dietitian, social worker, psychiatrist, or spiritual advisor can assist in dealing with many of the issues of cancer treatment. In addition, numerous community supports and advocacy groups are available to these patients and their families.

\section*{HORMONAL THERAPY}

Decisions about hormonal therapy for breast cancer are based on the outcome of an estrogen and progesterone receptor assay of tumor tissue taken during the initial biopsy. The tissue requires special handling by laboratory technicians with expertise in assessment techniques. Normal breast tissue contains receptor sites for estrogen. About two thirds of breast cancers are estrogen dependent, or ER-positive (ER+). An ER+ assay indicates that tumor growth depends on estrogen supply; therefore, measures that reduce hormone production may limit the progression of the disease, and these receptors can be considered prognostic indicators. ER+ tumors may grow more slowly in general than those that do not depend on estrogen (ER-); thus, having an ER+ tumor indicates a better prognosis. A value less than $3 \mathrm{fmol} / \mathrm{mg}$ is considered negative. Values of 3 to 10 are questionable, and values greater than

McPhail, G., \& Smith, L. N. (2000). Acute menopausal symptoms during adjuvant systemic treatment for breast cancer. Cancer Nursing, 6(23), 430-443.

\section*{Purpose}

Early detection and improved treatment of breast cancer have increased the life expectancy of women who reach menopause after the diagnosis of breast cancer to near-normal. It has been suggested that menopause experienced by women receiving treatment for breast cancer may differ from natural menopause, although no empirical study has addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to determine if menopausal symptoms in women who were undergoing systemic chemotherapy differed from those in women who experience a natural menopause.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The sample in this case-control study comprised two groups of women ranging from 50 to 64 years of age: 200 women undergoing treatment for breast cancer with tamoxifen or chemotherapy and a control group of 200 women who had undergone breast screening and had no diagnosis of breast cancer. A self-report questionnaire addressed general health and menstrual history, breast cancer treatment and associated symptoms, and menopause and menopausal symptoms. The women with breast cancer completed all portions of the questionnaire, while women without breast cancer completed only the third section, which included the Greene Climacteric Scale, an established scale for menopausal symptoms. Questionnaires were mailed to the 400 women, and 238 completed and returned the questionnaires. The final sample included 139 women with breast cancer and 99 women without a diagnosis of breast cancer. Most of the women in both groups were perimenopausal or postmenopausal at the time of the study. Statistical
procedures were used to describe study results and to examine differences between the two groups.

\section*{Findings}

Women with breast cancer were more likely than those without cancer to report that they were currently experiencing menopause symptoms ( $p=0.04$ ) and were more likely to have a greater severity of symptoms as assessed by the Greene Climacteric Scale. Women who were receiving adjuvant systematic treatment for breast cancer perceived their menopause symptoms as a significant source of distress, with hot flushes second to tiredness as a side effect attributed to cancer treatment. Women receiving chemotherapy were more likely to report tiredness, and women receiving tamoxifen were more likely to report hot flushes. The group undergoing treatment and the control group differed on four specific symptoms: tiredness, hot flushes, night sweats, and headaches. The women undergoing breast cancer treatment reported more severe tiredness, hot flushes, and night sweats than the control group. The control group experienced more severe headaches.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses who care for patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy for treatment of breast cancer need to be aware of the greater potential for distressing side effects related to menopause. Management of these side effects is important to assist the woman through the treatment. Providing suggestions about strategies to manage fatigue and minimize hot flushes is an important nursing intervention.

10 are considered positive. The greater the value, the more beneficial the anticipated effect from hormone suppression can be. Patients with tumors that are positive for both estrogen and progesterone (PR+) generally have a more favorable prognosis than patients with tumors that are ER- and PR-. Most progesteronereceptive tumors also have a positive estrogen receptor status. The loss of progesterone receptors can be a sign of advancing disease. Premenopausal women and perimenopausal women are more likely to have non-hormone-dependent lesions; postmenopausal women are likely to have hormone-dependent lesions.

Hormonal therapy may include surgery to remove endocrine glands (eg, the ovaries, pituitary, or adrenal glands) with the goal of suppressing hormone secretion. Oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is one treatment option for premenopausal women with estrogen-dependent tumors. Tamoxifen is the primary hormonal agent used in breast cancer treatment today. Anastrazole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara), leuprolide (Lupron), megestrol (Megace), diethylstilbestrol (DES), fluoxymesterone (Halotestin), and aminoglutethimide (Cytadren) are other hormonal agents used to suppress hormone-dependent tumors. Most of these agents may be associated with menopausal symptoms such as vasomotor changes. Hypercalcemia may also occur and may necessitate discontinuing the agent. These hormonal agents are described in Table 48-5.

\section*{BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION}

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) involves removing bone marrow from the patient and then administering high-dose chemotherapy. The patient's bone marrow, spared from the effects of chemotherapy, is then reinfused intravenously. This procedure is usually performed in specialized transplantation centers, and specific patient preparation, education, and support must be given throughout the treatment course. In 1999, scientific misconduct was discovered in the only study that showed a benefit (Hagmann, 2000), casting doubt on the role that BMT may play in breast cancer treatment. The use remains controversial outside of clinical trials, since studies are not clear as to the true benefits in comparison to standard high-dose chemotherapy (Antman, 2001). BMT is described more fully in Chapter 16.

\section*{INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPY: THE FUTURE}

Research is underway to develop chemotherapeutic agents that modify multidrug resistance and agents that enhance or modify standard chemotherapy. Research in breast cancer treatment includes the following areas: peripheral stem cell transplants, oncogenes (tumor genes that control cell growth), growth factors (substances released by cancer cells to make the environment more conducive to growth), monoclonal antibodies (synthetic antibodies that fight cancer cells), biologic response modifiers (substances that help increase the body's immune system response), and vaccine studies.

Another treatment modality that has shown promise is trastuzumab (Herceptin). This monoclonal antibody was engineered from mouse antibodies and closely resembles a human antibody. Herceptin binds with the HER2 protein, and this protein regulates cell growth, thus inhibiting tumor cell growth. For women with metastatic breast cancer, about $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ of tumors overproduce HER2, and this monoclonal antibody can slow growth and possibly stimulate the immune response. In fall 1998, the FDA approved this agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Research is ongoing, but the addition of this agent to traditional chemotherapy has shown improved survival rates in clinical trials (Capriotti, 2001). Further research and clinical
experience will demonstrate the potential of this drug in the treatment of breast cancer, particularly on the role of Herceptin for women undergoing adjuvant therapy.

\section*{Special Issues in Breast Cancer Management RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY}

After mastectomy, some women elect to have reconstructive surgery, which provides considerable psychological benefit. Support groups and classes provide education and peer support for patients who are candidates for and interested in breast reconstruction. Some concerns that women may have about reconstructive surgery are cost, safety, and timing - whether to undergo reconstruction immediately (at the time of mastectomy) or delay it ( 6 months to 1 year after surgery). Cost to the patient may vary depending on her health insurance, but because reconstruction is considered rehabilitative surgery, it is often covered.

In regard to safety, there are the usual surgical risks for infection and reaction to anesthesia, as well as the risk for a cosmetically unsatisfactory result. Reconstructive surgery is contraindicated if a woman has locally advanced, metastatic, or inflammatory breast cancer. Otherwise, most women with either in situ or early-stage breast cancer are candidates for immediate reconstruction. Breast reconstruction does not interfere with systemic treatment, nor does it affect the risk of cancer recurrence.

If a woman decides to have reconstructive surgery at the time of mastectomy, she avoids future surgery, although the total operative time increases. Some women find that immediate reconstruction lessens the feelings of loss and disfigurement. Occasionally, reconstruction cannot be performed because skin and muscles are too tight. Loose, supple skin and subcutaneous tissue with a sufficient blood supply contribute to reconstructive success. Some women benefit by waiting until later because initially they are not sure about their choice. Reconstructive surgery is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

\section*{PROSTHETICS}

Not all women desire reconstruction, nor are all women candidates for reconstructive surgery. In these instances, patients may need information about prostheses (molds made of silicone shaped in the form of a breast) and the names of shops where they can be fitted for a prosthesis. The American Cancer Society's Reach to Recovery program can provide women with the names and addresses of local establishments where they can be fitted. Women should be encouraged to find a shop that has a comfortable, supportive atmosphere and employs a certified prosthetics consultant. Generally, medical supply shops are not recommended because they often do not have the appropriate resources to ensure the proper fit of a prosthesis.

Before the patient is discharged from the hospital (following a day-surgery procedure or an overnight hospital stay), the nurse usually provides the patient with a temporary cotton fluff that can be worn until the surgical incision is well healed ( 4 to 6 weeks). At that time, the woman can be fitted for a prosthesis. Insurance generally covers the cost of a prosthesis and the special bras that hold it in place. Women should be encouraged to wear the prosthesis because it provides a sense of psychological restoration and wholeness. The prosthesis also assists the woman in resuming proper posture, because it helps to balance the weight of the remaining breast.

\section*{QUALITY OF LIFE AND BREAST CANCER}

Despite current treatment, there has been only a slight overall improvement in survival for breast cancer patients. Consequently, quality-of-life considerations have become important issues in treatment and recovery. Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that includes functional (self-care) status, social and family functioning, and psychological and spiritual well-being. These parameters are important indicators of how well a patient is functioning after diagnosis and treatment.

Breast cancer is the most frequently investigated cancer in quality-of-life studies. Early psychosocial studies emphasized that the loss of the breast was the single most important factor in women's adjustment, especially in Western cultures. Thus, it is not surprising that studies of women's adjustment to breast cancer found similar results. A growing body of research, however, indicates that concerns related to uncertainty about the future, day-to-day issues in work and family relationships, and demands of illness are more important factors in adjusting to having breast cancer than the loss of the breast alone. For example, younger women are more vulnerable to issues of psychosocial adjustment than many older women (Hoskins \& Haber, 2000). They worry about their jobs and whether they will be able to keep their health care benefits. They are concerned about their work productivity and career advancement (Wonghongkul, Moore, Musil et al., 2000). They face many family concerns related to whether they can have children, whether they will live to see their children grow up, and whether their disease will recur and incapacitate them (Horden, 2000). Middle-aged women worry about their disease in relation to their family and work (Walker, Nail \& Croyle, 1999). They also worry about their aging parents and whether they will be able to care for them in the future. They are increasingly concerned about their daughters' risk for breast cancer. Older women are more vulnerable to chronic health problems. Living an average of 6 years longer than men, older women face loss of their social circles, must deal with the potential for other diseases, and worry about whether they will have the resources to pay for medications.

These concerns are intertwined with the effects of breast cancer on the family. Studies indicate that up to $35 \%$ of families of breast cancer patients experience significant changes in family functioning. More than $25 \%$ of children also experience problems related to their mothers' breast cancer (Hilton, Crawford \& Tarko, 2000). In addition, families shoulder substantial costs in caring for family members with advanced breast cancer. These out-of-pocket, unreimbursed expenses include lost wages and salaries and lost opportunities.

When faced with any life-threatening illness, spiritual and existential concerns usually surface. Patients with breast cancer often express the need to talk about the uncertainties of their future and their hope and faith that they will be able to manage whatever crisis or challenge comes their way.

\section*{PREGNANCY AND BREAST CANCER}

From 2\% to 5\% of breast cancers occur in relation to pregnancy (Dow, 2000; Moore \& Foster, 2000). The potent hormones released during pregnancy ( 1,000 times greater than those during a menstrual cycle) stimulate changes in breast tissue (Gemignani \& Petrek, 1999). Thus, detecting masses is more difficult during pregnancy. An important aspect of health promotion is to encourage BSE throughout pregnancy.

Utley, R. (1999). The evolving meaning of cancer for long-term survivors of breast cancer. Oncology Nursing Forum, 26(9), 1519-1523.

\section*{Purpose}

While the incidence of cancer is highest in women over 65 years of age, the highest survival rates also occur in this group, with a survival rate of $97 \%$ for localized breast cancer. Little is known about the experience of survivorship of women with breast cancer. Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the different meanings of cancer for older women who were long-term survivors of breast cancer.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A descriptive qualitative study was conducted to explore the experience of long-term survivors of breast cancer. The sample comprised eight women whose survival following treatment for breast cancer ranged from 5.5 to 29 years. Their ages at the time of the study ranged from 65 to 77 years. Four of the women had lumpectomy with radiation and chemotherapy, and one had lumpectomy with radiation only as her treatment. Three women had undergone mastectomy and one of them had received oral chemotherapy. Two of the women had positive axillary lymph nodes, and they had lumpectomy combined with radiation and chemotherapy.

Interviews lasting 60 to 90 minutes were conducted with the women in their homes; three life history interviews were conducted with each woman and audiotaped. The interviews were then transcribed and coded for themes and patterns. In addition, the researcher used a methodology log and reflexive journal.

\section*{Findings}

Three meanings of cancer emerged from the data: cancer as sickness and death, cancer as an obstacle, and cancer as transforming. Cancer as sickness and death was the initial perspective of the women at the time of diagnosis and during the early phases of their treatment. Cancer as obstacle reflected the women's perspective that breast cancer was an obstacle that was intrusive or in the way of their life path that they had to deal with before moving on. Cancer as transforming described the change in women's outlooks about life and their own strength as they put their diagnosis in perspective. They viewed their cancer treatment as past and moved on to renewing their interactions with their surroundings.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses need a better understanding of and sensitivity to the experience of women with breast cancer as they move beyond their disease and its treatment. By asking open-ended questions, the nurse can help women explore their experience so they can begin to shift their view of breast cancer from an experience of sickness and death to a surmountable challenge.

If a mass is found during pregnancy, ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic method because it involves no exposure to radiation, although mammography with appropriate shielding, fine-needle aspiration, and biopsy may also be indicated. Treatment is basically the same as in other women, although radiation is contraindicated in pregnancy. Some oncologists begin chemotherapy as early as the 16th week of pregnancy because fetal organs are already formed at this point. If systemic treatment is necessary, a cesarean section may be performed as soon as maturation of the fetus allows. If aggressive disease is detected early in pregnancy and chemotherapy is advised, termination of the pregnancy is an issue that some patients must face. If a mass is found while a woman is breastfeeding, she is urged to stop breastfeeding to allow the breast to involute (return to its baseline state) before any type of surgery is performed.

After a woman has completed treatment for breast cancer, she may consider having children. In this case, individual issues must be addressed, including the patient and her partner's desire for children and family, disease and prognostic concerns, age, fertility and infertility issues, and social, financial, ethical, and quality-oflife issues. Although recommendations vary, most women are advised to wait 2 years before becoming pregnant after completing treatment for breast cancer. Most retrospective studies indicate that pregnancy after treatment for breast cancer does not appear to increase the risk of the disease recurring (Gemignani \& Petrek, 1999); however, prospective studies are needed to confirm this. Counseling, providing accurate information, and active listening and caring are important nursing interventions when patients are involved in making difficult personal decisions about treatment options, childbearing, or termination of pregnancy.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH BREAST CANCER}

\section*{Assessment}

The health history includes an assessment of the patient's reaction to the diagnosis and her ability to cope with it. Pertinent questions include the following:
- How is the patient responding to the diagnosis?
- What coping mechanisms does she find most helpful?
- What psychological or emotional supports does she have and use?
- Is there a partner, family member, or friend available to assist her in making treatment choices?
- What are the most important areas of information she needs?
- Is the patient experiencing any discomfort?

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{PREOPERATIVE NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the health history and other assessment data, the patient's major preoperative nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge about breast cancer and treatment options
- Anxiety related to cancer diagnosis
- Fear related to specific treatments, body image changes, or possible death
- Risk for ineffective coping (individual or family) related to the diagnosis of breast cancer and related treatment options
- Decisional conflict related to treatment options

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the health history and other assessment data, the patient's major postoperative nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to surgical procedure
- Impaired skin integrity due to surgical incision
- Risk for infection related to surgical incision and presence of surgical drain
- Disturbed body image related to loss or alteration of the breast related to the surgical procedure
- Risk for impaired adjustment related to the diagnosis of cancer, surgical treatment, and fear of death
- Self-care deficit related to partial immobility of upper extremity on operative side
- Disturbed sensory perception (kinesthesia) related to sensations in affected arm, breast, or chest wall
- Risk for sexual dysfunction related to loss of body part, change in self-image, and fear of partner's responses
- Deficient knowledge: drain management after breast surgery
- Deficient knowledge: arm exercises to regain mobility of affected extremity
- Deficient knowledge: hand and arm care after an axillary lymph node dissection

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ \\ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Lymphedema
- Hematoma formation
- Infection

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include increased knowledge about the disease and its treatment; reduction of preoperative and postoperative fears, anxiety, and emotional stress; improvement of decision-making ability; pain management; maintenance of skin integrity; improved self-concept; improved sexual function; and the absence of complications.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{EXPLAINING BREAST CANCER AND TREATMENT OPTIONS}

The patient confronting the diagnosis of breast cancer reacts with fear, dread, and anxiety. In view of the usually overwhelming emotional reactions to the diagnosis, the patient must be given time to absorb the significance of the diagnosis and any information that will help her to evaluate treatment options.

The nurse caring for the woman who has just received a diagnosis of breast cancer needs to be knowledgeable about current treatment options and able to discuss them with the patient. The nurse should be aware of the information that has been given to the patient by the physician.

Information about the surgery, the location and extent of the tumor, and postoperative treatments involving radiation therapy and chemotherapy are details that the patient needs to enable her to make informed decisions. As appropriate, the nurse discusses with the patient medications, the extent of treatment, management of side effects, possible reactions after treatment, frequency and duration of treatment, and treatment goals. Methods to compensate for physical changes related to mastectomy (eg, prostheses and plastic surgery) are also discussed and planned. The amount and timing of the information provided are based on the patient's responses, coping ability, and readiness to learn.

\section*{REDUCING FEAR AND ANXIETY AND IMPROVING COPING ABILITY}

The patient's emotional preparation begins when the tentative diagnosis of cancer is made. Patients who have lost close relatives to breast cancer (or any cancer) may have difficulty coping with the possible diagnosis of breast cancer because memories of loss and death can emerge during their own crisis.

The patient may have the diagnostic procedure performed in the surgeon's office or in the hospital when she is admitted for ambulatory or same-day surgery for a biopsy. Fears and concerns are common and are discussed with the patient. If she will undergo a mastectomy, information about various resources and options is provided. Such services include prostheses, reconstructive surgery, and groups such as Reach to Recovery. Discussion with
a plastic surgeon about the various options for reconstructive surgery can be a valuable source of information and support.

The nurse provides anticipatory teaching and counseling at each stage of the process and identifies the sensations that can be expected during additional diagnostic procedures. The nurse also discusses the implications of each treatment option and how it may affect various aspects of the patient's treatment course and lifestyle. The patient is introduced to other members of the oncology team (eg, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, oncology nurse, and social worker) and is acquainted with the role of each in her care. After the treatment plan has been established, the nurse needs to promote preoperative physical, psychological, social, and nutritional well-being. The patient usually prefers to be active in her care and decision making. Some women find it helpful and reassuring to talk to a breast cancer survivor, someone who has completed treatment and has been trained as a volunteer to talk with newly diagnosed patients.

\section*{PROMOTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITY}

At times, a patient may demonstrate behavior that indicates she cannot make a decision about treatment. Careful guidance and supportive counseling are the interventions the nurse can use to help such a patient. Also, encouraging the patient to take one step of the treatment process at a time can be helpful. The advanced practice nurse or oncology social worker can be helpful for patients and family members in discussing some of the personal issues that may arise in relation to treatment. Some patients may need a mental health consultation before surgery to assist them in coping with the diagnosis and impending treatment. Such patients may have had a history of psychiatric problems or demonstrate behavior that leads the surgeon or nurse to initiate a referral to the psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychiatric clinical nurse specialist.

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT}

Ongoing nursing assessment of pain and discomfort is important because patients experience differing degrees of pain intensity. Some women may have more generalized pain and discomfort of the chest wall, affected breast, or affected arm. Moderate elevation of the involved extremity is one means of relieving pain because it decreases tension on the surgical incision, promotes circulation, and prevents venous congestion in the affected extremity. Intravenous or intramuscular opioid analgesic agents are another method to manage pain in the initial postoperative phase. After the patient is taking fluids and food and the anesthesia has cleared sufficiently (usually by the next morning), oral analgesic agents can be effective in relieving pain. Patient teaching before discharge then becomes important in managing discomfort after
surgery because pain intensity varies widely. Patients should be encouraged to take analgesic agents (opioid or nonopioid analgesic medications such as acetaminophen) before exercises or at bedtime and also to take a warm shower twice daily (usually allowed on the second postoperative day) to alleviate the discomfort that comes from referred muscle pain.

\section*{MAINTAINING SKIN INTEGRITY AND PREVENTING INFECTION}

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient will have a snug but not tight dressing or a surgical bra packed with gauze over the surgical site and one or more drainage tubes in place. A particular concern is preventing fluid from accumulating under the chest wall incision or in the axilla by maintaining the patency of the surgical drains. The dressings and drains should be inspected for bleeding and the extent of drainage monitored regularly.

If a hematoma develops, it usually occurs within the first 12 hours after surgery; thus, monitoring the incision is important. A hematoma could cause necrosis of the surgical flaps, although this complication is rare in breast surgery patients. If either of these complications occurs, the surgeon should be notified, and the patient should have an Ace wrap placed around the incision and an ice pack applied. Initially, the fluid in the surgical drain appears bloody, but it gradually changes to a serosanguinous and then a serous fluid during the next several days. The drain is usually left in place for 7 to 10 days and is then removed after the output is less than 30 mL in a 24-hour period. The patient is discharged home with the drains in place; therefore, teaching of the patient and family is important to ensure correct management of the drainage system (Chart 48-6).

Dressing changes present an opportunity for the nurse and patient to discuss the incision, particularly how it looks and feels and the progressive changes in its appearance. The nurse explains the care of the incision, sensations to expect, and the possible signs and symptoms of an infection. Generally, the patient may shower on the second postoperative day and wash the incision and drain site with soap and water to prevent infection. A dry dressing should be applied to the incision each day for 7 days. The patient needs to know that sensation is decreased in the operative area because the nerves were disrupted during surgery and that gentle care is needed to avoid injury. After the incision is completely healed (usually 4 to 6 weeks), lotions or creams may be applied to the area to increase skin elasticity. After the incision is fully healed, the patient may again use deodorant on the affected side, although many women note that they no longer perspire as much as before the surgery.

\section*{PROMOTING POSITIVE BODY IMAGE}

During teaching sessions, the nurse can address the patient's perception of the body image changes and physical alteration of the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_fb899c723c3eec9fde94g-477.jpg?height=447&width=1780&top_left_y=2163&top_left_x=112)
breast. Patients may initially be uncomfortable looking at the surgical incision. No matter how prepared a patient may be, the view of her incision and absence of her breast is often difficult for her. Exploring this sensitive area must be a careful nursing action, and cues provided by the patient must be respected and sensitively handled. Privacy is a consideration when assisting the woman to view her incision fully for the first time and allows the patient to express her feelings safely to the nurse. Asking the patient what she perceives, acknowledging her feelings, and allowing her to express her emotions are important nursing actions. Explaining that her feelings are a normal response to breast cancer surgery may be reassuring to the patient. Ideally, she will see the incision for the first time when she is with the nurse or another health care provider who is available for support. With short hospital stays, many women will view the incision for the first time with the home care nurse or ambulatory care nurse at the time of postoperative follow-up visits.

\section*{PROMOTING POSITIVE ADJUSTMENT AND COPING}

Ongoing assessment of the patient's concerns related to the diagnosis of cancer, the consequences of surgical treatment, and fear of death is important in determining her progress in adjusting and the effectiveness of her coping strategies. Assisting the patient in identifying and mobilizing her support systems is important. The patient's spouse or partner may need guidance, support, and
education as well. The patient and spouse may benefit from a wide network of available community resources, including the American Cancer Society's Reach to Recovery program, advocacy groups, or a spiritual advisor. Encouraging the patient to discuss issues and concerns with other patients who have had breast cancer may help her to understand that her feelings are normal and that other women who have had breast cancer can provide invaluable support and understanding.

Another important aspect of promoting the patient's adjustment and coping includes answering questions and addressing her concerns about the treatment options that may follow surgery. After the surgery has been completed, thoughts about what lies in the future in terms of additional treatment are normal, and this topic can cause understandable anxiety. Refocusing the patient on the recovery from surgery, while addressing her concerns and answering her questions, can be helpful. Being knowledgeable about the plan of care and encouraging the patient to ask questions of the appropriate members of the health care team will also promote coping during recovery.

A few women require additional support to adjust to the diagnosis and the changes that it brings. If a woman displays ineffective coping, counseling or consultation with a mental health practitioner may be indicated.

Ambulation is encouraged when the patient is free of postanesthesia nausea and is tolerating fluids. The nurse supports the patient on the nonoperative side. Exercises (hand, shoulder, arm, and respiratory) are initiated on the second postoperative day, although instruction occurs on the first postoperative day. The goals of the exercise regimen are to increase circulation and muscle strength, prevent joint stiffness and contractures, and restore

\section*{Chelpt \\ $48 \Rightarrow$ Talking with Patients \& Partners}

For patients in the diagnostic phase: We've talked about your recent breast cancer diagnosis. It's natural for you to be full of feelings, concerns, and fears about yourself and your family. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to speak freely with. Would you share what you've been thinking, feeling, and worrying about recently?
For partners in the diagnostic phase: We've talked about your partner's recent breast cancer diagnosis. It's natural for you to have a lot of feelings, concerns, and fears about your partner, yourself, and your family. Partners often feel that they have to be strong for the patient or for others and that they aren't entitled to express their own concerns. Would you share what you've been thinking about, feeling, or worrying about recently?
For patients in the postsurgical phase: Many women who have had breast surgery, especially mastectomy or extensive lumpectomy are concerned not only with their own loss, but with how their partner will accept it. How have you felt about losing [part of] your breast? How has it changed your body image? Your sense of your sexuality? Your desire for intimacy?
For partners in the postsurgical phase: Many partners of women who have had breast surgery are concerned, as are the women themselves, about how they'll respond to the loss. How have you felt about your partner's losing [part of] her breast? How has it changed her attractiveness for you? Your sexual feelings toward her? Your desire for intimacy?
For patients in the adjuvant therapy phase: Given the type of therapy (radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy) you're going to have, what side effects do you anticipate? What do you know about them? Let's talk about ways to reduce and handle potential side effects.
For partners in the adjuvant therapy phase: Given the type of therapy (radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy) your partner is going to have, what side effects do you anticipate? What do you know about them? Let's talk about ways to reduce and handle potential side effects, and how it might help you to be familiar with them.
For patients in the ongoing recovery phase: As you plan your return to a full work schedule, what measures-setting priorities, delegating responsibility, managing stress-might help you make the necessary physical and emotional adjustments? What have you learned about balancing work, family, and play in your life?
For partners in the ongoing recovery phase: As your partner plans her return to a full work-schedule, what strategies have you thought about using to make your own physical and emotional adjustments, so that you don't continue to be overburdened at work and at home?

full range of motion. Hand exercises are also important for the same reasons.

Postmastectomy exercises (Chart 48-8) are usually performed three times daily for 20 minutes at a time until full range of motion is restored (generally 4 to 6 weeks). Showering before exercising loosens stiff muscles, and taking an analgesic agent 30 minutes before beginning exercise increases the patient's ability to comply with the regimen. Also, self-care activities, such as brushing the teeth, washing the face, and combing and brushing the hair, are physically and emotionally therapeutic because they aid in restoring arm function and a sense of normalcy for the patient.

The nurse encourages the patient to use the muscles in both arms and to maintain proper posture. If a patient is favoring or splinting the affected side, or not standing up straight, any exercise will be ineffective. If a patient has skin grafts, a tense, tight surgical incision, or immediate reconstruction, exercises may need to be prescribed specifically and introduced gradually. Most patients find that after the drain is removed, range of motion returns quickly if they have been compliant with their exercise programs. This reinforcement may be provided in the outpatient setting by the ambulatory care nurse or the home care nurse.

Patients are instructed regarding activity limitations while healing postoperatively. Generally, heavy lifting is avoided, although normal household and work-related activities are promoted to maintain muscle tone. Driving may begin after the drain is removed and when the patient has full range of motion and is no longer taking opioid analgesic agents. General guidelines for activity focus on gradually introducing previous activities (eg, bowling, weight-training) when fully healed, although checking with the physician beforehand is usually indicated.

Transient edema in the affected extremity is common during the healing period, and women are encouraged to elevate the arm above the level of the heart on a pillow for 45 minutes at a time three times daily to promote circulation. Performing the prescribed exercises also assists in reducing the transient edema. Prevention of lymphedema is taught to patients before discharge. Hand and arm care after an axillary lymph node dissection focuses on the prevention of injury or trauma to the affected extremity, which increases the likelihood of developing lymphedema (Chart 48-9).

\section*{MANAGING POSTOPERATIVE SENSATIONS}

Because nerves in the skin are cut during breast surgery, patients experience a variety of sensations. Common sensations are tightness, pulling, burning, and tingling along the chest wall, in the axilla, and along the inside aspect of the upper arm. They tend to become more noticeable and increase as the patient begins to heal. They usually persist for several months up to a year and then begin to diminish. Explaining to the patient that this is a normal part of healing helps to reassure her that these sensations are not indicative of a problem. Performing the exercises may decrease the sensations. Acetaminophen (Tylenol), taken as needed, also assists in managing the discomfort. Many breast surgery patients report these sensations as one of the most bothersome aspects of having the surgery.

\section*{IMPROVING SEXUAL FUNCTION}

Most breast surgery patients are physically allowed to engage in sexual activity once discharged from the hospital. However, any change in the patient's body image and self-esteem or the partner's response may increase the couple's anxiety level and may affect sexual function. Some partners may have difficulty looking at the incision, whereas others appear to be unaffected and com-

1. Wall handclimbing. Stand facing the wall with feet apart and toes as close to the wall as possible. With elbows slightly bent, place the palms of the hand on the wall at shoulder level. By flexing the fingers, work the hands up the wall until arms are fully extended. Then reverse the process, working the hands down to the starting point.

fortable. Either response affects the patient's self-image, sexuality, and acceptance. Open discussion and clear communication about how the patient sees herself and about possible decreased libido related to fatigue, anxiety, or nausea may help to clarify issues for her and her partner. Encouraging discussion about fears, needs, and desires may reduce the couple's stress. Suggestions regarding varying the time of day for sexual activity (when the patient is less tired) or assuming positions that are more comfortable can be helpful, as are other options for expressing affection (eg, hugging, kissing, manual stimulation).

Most patients and their partners adjust with minimal difficulty if they openly discuss their concerns; however, if problems develop or persist, referral to a psychosocial resource (psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychiatric clinical nurse specialist, social worker, or sex therapist) can be helpful for the woman and her partner. To identify difficulty in sexual relationships, the ambulatory care nurse and home care nurse must be sensitive to this issue following treatment for breast cancer and must initiate discussion with the patient.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Lymphedema}

Lymphedema can occur any time after an axillary lymph node dissection. Lymphedema results if functioning lymphatic channels are inadequate to ensure a return flow of lymph fluid to the general circulation. After removal of axillary nodes, collateral or auxiliary circulation must take over their function. Transient edema in the postoperative period occurs until this collateral circulation has fully assumed functioning for the removed nodes, which generally occurs within a month by moving and exercising the affected arm. Patients need reassurance that this transient swelling is not lymphedema. Education about how to prevent lymphedema is an important part of hand and arm care after an axillary dissection. Lymphedema occurs in about $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of patients who undergo an axillary dissection. Risk factors for lymphedema are increasing age, obesity, presence of extensive axillary disease, radiation treatment, and injury or infection to the extremity. Patients should follow these guidelines to prevent injury to the affected extremity because lymphedema is subsequently associated with a trauma of some type.

If lymphedema occurs, the patient should contact the surgeon or nurse to discuss management because she may need a course of antibiotics or specific exercises to decrease the swelling. Emphasis should be placed on early intervention because lymphedema can be manageable if treated early; however, if allowed to progress without treatment, the swelling can become painful and difficult to reverse. Management consists of arm elevation with the elbow above the shoulder and the hand higher than the elbow, along with specific exercises, such as hand pumps. A referral to a physical therapist or rehabilitation specialist may be necessary for a custom-made elastic sleeve, exercises, manual lymph drainage, or a special pump to decrease swelling.

\section*{Hematoma Formation}

Hematoma formation may occur after either mastectomy or breast conservation. The nurse monitors the surgical site for excessive swelling and monitors the drainage device, if present. Gross swelling or output from the drain may indicate hematoma formation, and the surgeon should be notified promptly. Depending on the surgeon's assessment, an Ace wrap may be applied for compression of the surgical site along with ice packs for 24 hours, or the patient may be returned to surgery to identify the source of bleeding. The nurse monitors the site and reassures the patient that this complication is rare but does occur and that she will be assisted through its management. A calm demeanor on the part of the nurse helps prevent anxiety and panic on the part of the patient.

\section*{Infection}

Infection follows breast surgery in about 1 in 100 patients. Infection can occur for a variety of reasons, including concurrent conditions (diabetes, immune disorders, advanced age) and exposure to pathogens. In addition, cellulitis may occur after breast surgery. Both preoperatively and before discharge, patients are taught to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection (redness, foul-smelling drainage, temperature greater than $100.4^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ) and to contact the surgeon or nurse for evaluation. Treatment consists of oral or intravenous antibiotics for 1 or 2 weeks, depending on the severity of the infection. Cultures are taken of any foul-smelling discharge. Infections are a serious threat to women who have had breast reconstruction because they may lose the breast mound if the infection persists; there is a risk of lymphedema in women who develop an infection and have had an axillary lymph node dissection.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients who undergo breast surgery receive a tremendous amount of information before and after surgery. Additional teaching is necessary to prepare the patient and family to manage aspects of care after home discharge. Even though the ambulatory care nurse prepares the patient for what to expect postoperatively, the details often appear less important to the patient in light of the diagnosis of breast cancer. Thus, teaching may need to be repeated and reinforced postoperatively. Most patients are discharged 1 or 2 days after the surgery with the drains in place. The inpatient nurse assesses the patient's readiness to assume self-care and focuses on teaching the patient incision care; signs to report, such as an infection; pain management; arm exercises; hand and arm care; and management of the drainage system at home. Family members may be included in the discharge teaching, and many women find it reassuring and helpful to have another person assist them with
management of the drainage system. The ambulatory care nurse reinforces teaching by telephone follow-up and during postoperative visits in the office.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care may be indicated to assist the patient and family caregiver with postoperative care at home. The home care nurse assesses the patient's incision and drainage system, physical and psychological status, adequacy of pain management, and adherence to the exercise plan. In addition, the home care nurse reinforces previous teaching and communicates important physiologic findings or psychosocial issues to the patient's primary care provider, nurse, or surgeon.

Follow-up visits to the physician after diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer depend on the individual and on postoperative treatments, stage of disease at diagnosis, late effects from cancer, and the patient's adaptation. Visits every 3 months for 2 years, followed by every 6 months up to 5 years, may be then extended to annual examinations, depending on the patient's progress and the physician's preference. A disease-free state for as long as possible is the goal. Patients are also encouraged to do BSE on the remaining breast (and operative side if breast-conserving surgery was done) and the chest wall (after mastectomy) between appointments because the risk for cancer in the remaining breast (or recurrence in the operative breast) is about $1 \%$ per year after the original diagnosis. Additional screening is done with annual mammography. Ultrasound and MRI are being used more commonly with women who have survived breast cancer. Because it is common to ignore routine health care when a major health issue arises, the woman is reminded of the importance of participating in health promotion activities and other health screening. Because some problems with coping may not occur until the woman has returned to more usual routines, the ambulatory care nurse needs to be sensitive to this issue and encourage discussion throughout the recovery period.

\section*{RECURRENT BREAST CANCER}

The recurrence of breast cancer can be very difficult for patients and family members. Depending on the clinical presentation, progression of the disease can have different meanings. Generally, the longer the disease-free interval, the better the prognosis. Local recurrence either in the affected breast or along the chest wall can be treated, generally with surgery, radiation, or hormonal manipulation, although a metastatic disease workup may be in order to look for further evidence of disease. Although metastatic spread of the breast cancer (to the bone, lungs, brain, or liver) cannot be cured, a variety of treatments are available (chemotherapy, radiation treatment, hormonal manipulation, or possibly some form of surgery). In some patients, metastases progress very slowly and life functioning is generally not affected, whereas in others the disease progresses rapidly despite treatment, and death from the complications of metastatic disease is inevitable.

The patient with advanced breast cancer is monitored closely for signs that the tumor has recurred or that metastasis has occurred. The following studies are conducted to monitor for spread of disease: metastatic x-ray series (chest, skull, long bones, and pelvis); liver function tests (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [ALT] lactate dehydrogenase); mammogram of contralateral breast and ipsilateral breast (if breast-conserving surgery was originally performed); and bone, liver, and brain imaging. In half of all patients with recurrent disease, the cancer reappears locally (on the chest wall or in the conserved breast) or regionally in the remaining

lymph nodes, and in one fourth other organs become involved. Bone metastasis is the most common site for spread of the disease, usually involving the hips, spine, ribs, or pelvis. Other sites for metastatic spread are the brain, lungs, and liver.

\section*{Medical Management}

Regression or relief of the symptoms is the goal of nursing and medical management, and quality of survival time is an important focus of nursing intervention. Assessing the patient's physical and psychosocial status is a challenge for the nurse. Information from family members and significant others is valuable and should be included in planning care for the patient with advanced disease.

Palliative treatment, if indicated, is also an important aspect of care. Comfort and a pain-free existence, even if the disease cannot be eradicated, enhance the quality of remaining life. Palliative surgery may be offered if the patient has a fungating or necrotic tumor in the breast; the most common procedure is a modified radical mastectomy. In patients with bone metastases that cause pain or produce pathologic fractures, reparative or restorative surgery may also be an option; however, this may not
be indicated depending on the patient's medical status and personal choices. Hospice and home health care may be indicated as alternatives. Regardless, specific arrangements for these services should be discussed and planned early, before the actual need arises, to decrease patient distress. Severe anxiety and depression may occur. Treatment modes vary and depend on the patient's condition, the modalities available, and the patient's preferences for end-of-life care. Chapter 16 provides more information on the general care of the patient with advanced cancer. Chapter 17 discusses end-of-life care.

\section*{Reconstructive Breast Surgery}

Because the breast plays such an important part in self-image of many women, a perceived abnormality may lead to a request for mammoplasty (plastic surgery of the breast in which size, shape, or position is altered). Variations in the size of the breasts are a common reason for women to seek information about reconstructive breast surgery. Reduction mammoplasty is performed to reduce the size of the breast, whereas augmentation mammoplasty is performed to increase the size of the breast. Other women
desire surgery to reconstruct their breasts after mastectomy. There are several different procedures used for this type of reconstructive surgery. In addition, some women choose to undergo prophylactic (risk-reducing) mastectomy if they are at high risk for breast cancer. This type of mastectomy is included in this discussion because it is considered elective.

\section*{REDUCTION MAMMOPLASTY}

Reduction mammoplasty is usually performed on women who have breast hypertrophy (excessively large breasts). If the enlargement occurs early in life, it is called virginal breast hypertrophy. The condition is usually bilateral but may affect just one breast. Hypertrophy in later life almost always affects both breasts.

Tenderness, diffuse pain, and fatigue are common complaints of women with hypertrophy. Premenstrual tenderness and pain are marked. The weight of the enlarged breasts causes a dragging sensation in the shoulder, and support is commonly futile, despite use of the most supportive bra. Many women have deep grooves in their shoulders from the weight borne by bra straps. Poor posture, discomfort, and embarrassment when wearing bathing suits and participating in athletic events may limit the woman's social life. As a result, insecurity may develop from poor self-image.

After a surgical or plastic surgery consultation, a reduction mammoplasty may be performed under general anesthesia. One approach is an incision in the skin of the anterior breast in the shape of a keyhole or an anchor if a large amount of tissue needs to be removed. Another approach is through an incision around the areola complex. The surgeon then removes the excess tissue and transplants the nipple to a new location. Skin edges are approximated with sutures, and the nipple is secured with sutures. Drains are placed in the incision, where they remain for 1 to 2 days. Simple gauze dressings are applied, without pressure.

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Management}

After mammoplasty, the usual postoperative care is indicated. Patients are ambulatory fairly quickly and typically describe their surgery as nontraumatic, possibly because of the relief they experience. Hypertrophy does not recur, but if the patient gains weight, the breasts may enlarge. The newly transplanted nipple most likely becomes covered with a scab. As the nipple regains a new blood supply, the scab falls off, and the appearance approximates normal. Lactation may be impossible after this type of surgery, although half of women who have this surgery can breastfeed successfully. Sensory changes, such as numbness, are normal after this surgery but resolve after several months, although diminished sensation in the nipples can persist. Postoperatively, the woman may feel a mixture of euphoria, relief, sorrow over loss of a body part, and anxiety over these feelings. Providing reassurance is an important nursing measure.

\section*{AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY}

Augmentation mammoplasty is requested frequently by women desiring larger or fuller breasts. It is performed through an incision along the undermargin of the breast, in the axilla, or at the border of the areola. The breast is then elevated, and a pocket is formed between the breast and the chest wall into which various types of synthetic materials are inserted to enlarge and uplift the breast. The subpectoral approach is preferred because it interferes less with clinical breast examinations or mammography than do subglandular implants. These procedures may be performed on an outpatient basis with local anesthesia. Infection, an immedi-
ate complication that can occur, may require removal of the implant. A delayed complication, which usually occurs years after the surgery, is a capsular contracture (scar formation around the implant); further surgery may be needed to correct this problem.

Saline implants are typically used for augmentation mammography. Silicone implants were used in the past; however, because of the reported systemic complications associated with their use, they have been removed from the market. They are now available only to women enrolled in controlled clinical trials designed to study specific safety questions. Long-term risks associated with their use are also being studied. Women with breast implants need to be aware that accurate mammograms are more difficult, and they should seek radiologists at specialized breast centers who are familiar with reading mammograms of women who have breast implants.

\section*{RECONSTRUCTIVE PROCEDURES AFTER MASTECTOMY}

When a woman undergoes a mastectomy (either total or modified radical) for the treatment of breast cancer, she may desire to have immediate reconstruction at the time of surgery, or delayed reconstruction may be an option at a later point after all treatments have been completed. About $75 \%$ of women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy elect immediate reconstruction. A consultation with the surgeon may assist women in deciding whether reconstruction is something that they desire at the time of surgery. It is important for women to understand that reconstruction does not interfere with the treatment of their breast cancer, and they should also understand that although a good cosmetic result can be obtained, the reconstructed breast will never be what they once had. Another key point for women to understand is that reconstruction is a three-stage process that occurs over a period of months: the first is creation of the breast mound, the second is achieving symmetry with the contralateral breast, and the third is creation of the nipple-areola complex (described later). Women who undergo reconstruction with realistic expectations tend to be more pleased with the cosmetic result. Also, women who have mastectomy with immediate reconstruction may demonstrate a more positive adjustment afterward.

The choice of the surgical procedure is based on the patient's wishes, the condition of the overlying skin and underlying muscle, and any previous scars that may be present, because they may limit possible reconstructive options. Another important factor is any secondary medical conditions that may affect the healing process (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, or obesity).

\section*{Tissue Expanders With Permanent Implants}

One method of reconstruction is the tissue expander with permanent implant (Fig. 48-7). After the surgeon has completed the mastectomy, the plastic surgeon creates a pocket inside the pectoralis muscle and inserts a partially filled Silastic expander and a drainage device. Then, over a period of weeks, the patient comes to the office for injections of additional saline into the expander through a port that is under the skin; this temporary expander stretches the skin and muscle. When the implant is fully expanded (usually one third larger than the other breast to create a natural crease and droop to match the contralateral breast), the patient has the temporary implant exchanged for a permanent implant. This is usually performed as outpatient surgery. It may be done 4 to 6 months later to allow the tissue to soften and become more pliable before the permanent implant is inserted.

EIGURE 48-7 Breast reconstruction with tissue expander. (A) After mastectomy, a tissue expander is inserted to prepare for reconstruction. (B) The expander is gradually filled with saline solution through a tube to stretch the skin enough to accept an implant beneath the chest muscle. (C) The breast mound is restored. Although permanent, scars will fade with time. The nipple and areola are reconstructed later.

Postoperative care is similar to that of the patient undergoing breast surgery, although more discomfort can be expected due to the additional surgery. Nausea may take longer to clear because there was a greater period under general anesthesia. Patients receive instruction just as any other surgical breast cancer patient would, but usually they are not allowed to shower until the drain is removed.

\section*{Tissue Transfer Procedures}

Another method of reconstruction is using the patient's own tissue and transferring it to the mastectomy site. These flap surgeries can use the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM flap) (Fig. 48-8), gluteal muscle, or latissimus dorsi muscle (Fig. 48-9). The plastic surgeon transfers the muscle flap with attached circulatory structures, skin, and fatty tissue, rotates it to the operative site, and molds it to create a mound that simulates

the breast. These procedures are far more extensive and involve greater operative time (about 8 to 10 hours total time for the mastectomy and reconstruction) and duration of general anesthesia than does the tissue expander procedure. The risk for potential complications is greater (infection, bleeding, flap necrosis), but the benefits are a more natural-looking breast and avoidance of synthetic material. The recovery period is greater, and activity restrictions are different due to the cut muscles.

The TRAM flap is the most commonly used tissue transfer procedure, and postoperative care involves drain management and monitoring the operative site for changes in circulation. During the immediate postoperative period, patients are more limited in their activity and are at greater risk for respiratory complications, so pulmonary hygiene is essential. Measures to reduce tension on the incisions include elevating the head of the bed by 30 degrees and flexing the patient's knees to reduce tension on the abdominal incision. Antiemetic agents are administered to control nausea and vomiting, and analgesic medications are administered to reduce pain and discomfort. Assessing circulation by observing the color and temperature of the newly constructed breast area is an important nursing function. Mottling or an obvious decrease in skin temperature is reported to the surgeon immediately. Excessive drainage should also be reported.

During ambulation, the patient usually protects the surgical incision by splinting. Gradually, she will achieve a more upright position. The patient is instructed to avoid tight and underwire bras until the surgeon indicates that no injury will result. Elevating the arms above the shoulder and lifting more than 5 pounds of weight are avoided for 1 month after surgery to avoid stress on the incision.

\section*{Nipple-Areola Reconstruction}

After the breast mound has been created and the site has healed, some women choose to have a nipple-areola reconstruction. This consists of minor surgical procedures carried out either in the physician's office or as outpatient surgery. A nipple is created using a skin graft from the inner thigh or labia because this skin has darker pigmentation than the skin on the reconstructed breast. After the nipple graft has healed, the areolar complex is usually completed with micropigmentation (tattooing). The surgeon can usually match the reconstructed nipple-areola complex with that of the contralateral breast for an acceptable cosmetic result.

EIGURE 48-9 Breast reconstruction: latissimus dorsi flap. (A) Tissue taken from the back is tunneled to the front of the chest wall to support the reconstructed breast. (B) The transported tissue forms a flap that can hold a breast implant if there is not enough tissue to form a breast mound, or (C) tissue may be taken from the abdomen and tunneled to the breast or surgically transplanted to form a new breast mound. Adapted from "Breast Reconstruction," American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, Arlington Heights, IL.

\section*{Diseases of the Male Breast GYNECOMASTIA}

Gynecomastia, or overdeveloped breast tissue, is the most common breast condition in the male. Adolescent boys can be affected by this condition because of hormones secreted by the testes. Gynecomastia usually subsides in 1 or 2 years, but it can occur before or after puberty and in elderly men. It is usually unilateral and presents as a firm, tender mass underneath the areola. In adult men, gynecomastia may be diffuse and related to medications (ie, digitalis, reserpine, ergotamine, ranitidine, and phenytoin). Pain and tenderness are initial symptoms. Treatment depends on the man's feelings and preference. Observation is acceptable because it may resolve on its own; surgical removal of the tissue through an incision around the areola is another option. Liposuction of the tissue done by a plastic surgeon, another option, yields a positive cosmetic result.

\section*{MALE BREAST CANCER}

Cancer of the male breast accounts for $1 \%$ of all breast cancers; about 1,500 new cases of breast cancer and 400 deaths due to breast cancer occur annually (ACS, 2002b). Symptoms can include a painless lump beneath the areola, nipple retraction, nipple discharge, or skin ulceration. Diagnostic tests and treatment modalities are similar to those used for women. The average age of the patient at the time of diagnosis is 60 years, but it can occur in younger men, especially if there is a genetic link to the disease, because there may be a relationship to BRCA-2 in men with breast cancer. Risk factors may include a history of mumps orchitis, radiation exposure, and Klinefelter's syndrome (a chromosomal condition reflecting decreased testosterone levels).

Detection usually occurs well into the disease because cancer of the breast is not a common concern among men. Therefore, treatment generally consists of a modified radical mastectomy. If the pectoralis muscles are involved, a radical mastectomy is indicated. Radiation therapy may be used postoperatively. Prognosis varies depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis. Bone and soft tissue are the most common sites of advanced disease and metastasis. Orchiectomy (removal of the testes), adrenalectomy (removal of the adrenal gland), and hypophysectomy (removal of
B
C
the pituitary gland) may be used in advanced disease, but antihormonal agents are preferable because they are less invasive and disfiguring.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are caring for a patient who had breast augmentation surgery 10 years ago. When you ask her how often she examines her breasts, she states that she does not do so because she would be unable to detect masses because of her previous surgery. She also states that she does not think it is appropriate to touch her own breasts and that her physician performs a clinical breast examination each year when she has a Pap smear. How would you address the issues she has raised? Describe the teaching approach you would use.
2. Your 40-year-old patient has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her mother, aunt, and one of her sisters have all had breast cancer. She is very worried about her two daughters' risks for breast cancer and asks if they should undergo genetic testing. She also asks about the need for her daughters to have mammograms performed. What guidelines would you give to this patient about mammography and genetic testing that might be considered for her daughters? What issues must be taken into account when someone is considering genetic testing for breast cancer?
3. A 46-year-old woman reports to you that she wants to undergo mastectomy and oophorectomy because she has a positive family history of breast cancer and is terrified of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Describe the benefits and risks of these surgeries for prophylactic management in women at risk for breast cancer. What postoperative care and teaching are indicated if she has both mastectomy and oophorectomy performed to reduce her risks for breast and ovarian cancer?
4. Two weeks after having a mastectomy to treat breast cancer, a 37-year-old patient calls you. She is distraught because her husband, who moved out of their bedroom
immediately after her discharge so that he did not disturb her, has refused to sleep in the same bed or same room with her. How would you address this issue? What resources would you use to address the problem, and what resources would you provide to the patient and her spouse?
5. A 59-year-old woman with a history of cardiac disease is scheduled for a modified radical mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery. Describe the preoperative and postoperative care of this patient, including discharge planning.

\section*{Assessment and Management of Problems Related to Male Reproductive Processes}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe structures and function of the male reproductive system.
2. Discuss nursing assessment of the male reproductive system and identify diagnostic tests that complement assessment.
3. Discuss the causes and management of male sexual dysfunction.
4. Compare the types of prostatectomy with regard to advantages and disadvantages.
5. Use the nursing process as a framework for care of the patient undergoing prostatectomy.
6. Describe the nursing management of patients with testicular cancer.
7. Describe the various conditions affecting the penis, including pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management.

Disorders of the male reproductive system include a wide variety of conditions that usually affect both the urinary and reproductive systems. Because these disorders focus on the genitalia and in some instances sexuality, the patient may experience anxiety and embarrassment. Nurses must recognize the patient's need for privacy as well as his need for education. This requires an openness to discuss critical and sensitive issues with the patient as well as effective assessment, management, and communication on the part of the nurse.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

In the male, several organs serve as parts of both the urinary tract and the reproductive system. Disorders in the male reproductive organs may interfere with the functions of one or both of these systems. As a result, diseases of the male reproductive system are usually treated by a urologist. The structures in the male reproductive system are the testes, the vas deferens (ductus deferens) and the seminal vesicles, the penis, and certain accessory glands, such as the prostate gland and Cowper's gland (bulbourethral gland) (Fig. 49-1).

\section*{TESTICULAR DEVELOPMENT}

The testes are formed in the embryo within the abdominal cavity near the kidney. During the last month of fetal life, they descend posterior to the peritoneum and pierce the abdominal wall in the groin. Later, they progress along the inguinal canal into the scrotum. In this descent, they are accompanied by blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves, and ducts, which support the tissue and make up the spermatic cord. This cord extends from the internal inguinal ring through the abdominal wall and the inguinal canal to the scrotum. As the testes descend into the scrotum, a tubular extension of peritoneum accompanies them. Normally, this tissue is obliterated during fetal development, the only remaining portion being that which covers the testes, the tunica vaginalis. (When this peritoneal process is not obliterated but remains open into the abdominal cavity, a potential sac remains into which abdominal contents may enter to form an indirect inguinal hernia.)

The testes are encased in the scrotum, which keeps them at a slightly lower temperature than the rest of the body to facilitate spermatogenesis (production of sperm). The testes consist of numerous seminiferous tubules in which the spermatozoa form. Collecting tubules transmit the spermatozoa into the epididymis,
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): noncancerous enlargement or hypertrophy of the prostate. BPH is the most common pathologic condition in older men and the second most common cause of surgical intervention in men older than age 60 years.
Bowen's disease: form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the penile shaft
circumcision: excision of the foreskin, or prepuce, of the glans penis
cryosurgery of the prostate: localized treatment of the prostate by application of freezing temperatures
cryptorchidism: most common congenital defect, characterized by failure of one or both of the testes to descend into the scrotum
epididymitis: infection of the epididymis that usually descends from an infected prostate or urinary tract; also may develop as a complication of gonorrhea
erectile dysfunction: also called impotence; the inability to either achieve or maintain an erection sufficient to accomplish sexual intercourse
hydrocele: a collection of fluid, generally in the tunica vaginalis of the testis, although it also may collect within the spermatic cord
nocturia: urination during the night
orchiectomy: surgical removal of one or both of the testes
orchitis: inflammation of the testes (testicular congestion) caused by pyogenic, viral, spirochetal, parasitic, traumatic, chemical, or unknown factors
penile cancer: represents about $0.5 \%$ of malignancies in men in the United States; can involve the glans, the body of the
penis, the urethra, and regional or distant lymph nodes
penis: male organ for copulation and urination; consists of glans penis, body, and root
Peyronie's disease: buildup of fibrous plaques in the sheath of the corpus cavernosum, causing curvature of the penis when it is erect
phimosis: condition in which the foreskin is constricted so that it cannot be retracted over the glans; can occur congenitally or from inflammation and edema
priapism: an uncontrolled, persistent erection of the penis occurring from either neural or vascular causes, including medications, sickle cell thrombosis, leukemic cell infiltration, spinal cord tumors, and tumor invasion of the penis or its vessels
prostate cancer: the most common cancer in men; risk factors include increasing age, African American race, and possibly a higher-fat diet; the genetic association of prostate cancer and the increased incidence within certain families is being investigated
prostate gland: gland that lies just below the neck of the bladder, surrounds the urethra, and is traversed by the ejaculatory duct, a continuation of the vas deferens; produces a secretion that is chemically and physiologically suitable to the needs of the spermatozoa in their passage from the testes
prostate-specific antigen (PSA): substance that is produced by the prostate gland and measured in a blood specimen; PSA levels are increased with prostate cancer; the PSA test is used in combination with digital rectal examination to detect prostate cancer
prostatism: obstructive and irritative symptom complex that includes increased frequency and hesitancy in starting urination, a decrease in the volume and force of the urinary stream, acute urinary retention, and recurrent urinary tract infections
prostatitis: inflammation of the prostate gland caused by infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma) or various other problems (eg, urethral stricture, prostatic hyperplasia)
spermatogenesis: production of sperm in the testes
testes: the ovoid sex glands encased in the scrotum; the testes produce sperm
testicular cancer: the most common cancer in men 15 to 35 years of age and the second most common malignancy in those 35 to 39 years of age; its cause is unknown
testosterone: male sex hormone secreted by the testes; induces and preserves the male sex characteristics
transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR or TURP): resection of the prostate through endoscopy; the surgical and optical instrument is introduced directly through the urethra to the prostate, and the gland is then removed in small chips with an electrical cutting loop
varicocele: an abnormal dilation of the veins of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum (the network of veins from the testis and the epididymis, which constitute part of the spermatic cord)
vasectomy: also called male sterilization; ligation and transection of part of the vas deferens, with or without removal of a segment of the vas to prevent the passage of the sperm from the testes

a hoodlike structure lying on the testes and containing winding ducts that lead into the vas deferens. This firm, tubular structure passes upward through the inguinal canal to enter the abdominal cavity behind the peritoneum. It then extends downward toward the base of the bladder. An outpouching from this structure is the seminal vesicle, which acts as a reservoir for testicular secretions. The tract is continued as the ejaculatory duct, which passes through the prostate gland to enter the urethra. Testicular secretions take this pathway when they exit the penis during ejaculation.

\section*{GLANDULAR FUNCTION}

The testes have a dual function: the formation of spermatozoa from the germinal cells of the seminiferous tubules and the secretion of the male sex hormone testosterone, which induces and preserves the male sex characteristics.

The prostate gland lies just below the neck of the bladder. It surrounds the urethra and is traversed by the ejaculatory duct, a continuation of the vas deferens. This gland produces a secretion that is chemically and physiologically suitable to the needs of the spermatozoa in their passage from the testes.

Cowper's gland lies below the prostate within the posterior aspect of the urethra. This gland empties its secretions into the urethra during ejaculation, providing lubrication. The penis has a dual function: it is the organ for copulation and for urination. Anatomically, it consists of the glans penis, body, and root. The glans penis is the soft, rounded portion at the distal end of the penis. The urethra, the tube that carries urine, opens at the tip of the glans. The glans is naturally covered or protected by elongated
penile skin-the foreskin-which may be retracted to expose the glans. However, many men have had the foreskin removed (circumcision) as newborns. The body of the penis is composed of erectile tissues containing numerous blood vessels that become distended, leading to an erection during sexual excitement. The urethra, which passes through the penis, extends from the bladder through the prostate to the distal end of the penis.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

Assessment of male reproductive function begins with an evaluation of urinary function and symptoms. This assessment also includes a focus on sexual function as well as manifestations of sexual dysfunction. The patient is asked about his usual state of health and any recent change in general physical and sexual activity. Any symptoms or changes in function are explored fully and described in detail. These symptoms may include those associated with an obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate gland: increased urinary frequency, decreased force of urine stream, "double" or "triple" voiding (the patient needs to urinate two or three times over a period of several minutes to completely empty his bladder). The patient is also assessed for dysuria, hematuria, and hematospermia (blood in the ejaculate).

Assessment of sexual function and dysfunction is an essential part of every health history. The extent of the history will depend on the patient's presenting symptoms and the presence of factors that may affect sexual function: chronic illnesses (eg, diabetes,
multiple sclerosis, stroke, cardiac disease), use of medications that affect sexual function (eg, many antihypertensive and anticholesterolemic medications, psychotropic agents), stress, and alcohol use.

Discussing sexuality with patients with an illness or disability can be uncomfortable for nurses and other health care providers. Health care professionals may unconsciously have stereotypes related to sexuality about people who are ill or disabled (eg, ill or disabled persons are asexual or should remain sexually inactive). In addition, patients are often embarrassed to initiate a discussion about these issues with their health care providers (Hughes, 2000 ). Because changes in sexual functioning are a common concern of patients, it is important to address these issues when obtaining the health history. By initiating an assessment about sexual concerns, the nurse demonstrates that changes in sexual functioning are valid topics for discussion and provides a safe environment for discussing these sensitive topics. The PLISSIT (permission, limited information, specific suggestions, intensive therapy) model of sexual assessment and intervention may be used to provide a framework for nursing interventions (Annon, 1976). This model begins by asking the patient's permission to discuss sexual functioning. Limited information about sexual function may then be provided to the patient. As the discussion progresses, the nurse may offer specific suggestions for interventions. For some individuals, a professional who specializes in sex therapy may provide more intensive therapy as needed.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}

In addition to the customary aspects of the physical examination, two essential components address disorders of the male genital or reproductive system: the digital rectal examination and the testicular examination.

\section*{Digital Rectal Examination}

The digital rectal examination (DRE) is recommended as part of the regular health checkup for every man older than 40 years of age; it is invaluable in screening for cancer of the prostate gland. The DRE enables the examiner to assess the size, shape, and consistency of the prostate gland (Fig. 49-2). Tenderness of the prostate gland on palpation and the presence and consis-
tency of any nodules are noted. Although having this examination may be embarrassing for the patient, it is an important screening tool.

\section*{Testicular Examination}

The male genitalia are inspected for abnormalities and palpated for masses. The scrotum is palpated carefully for nodules, masses, or inflammation. Examining the scrotum can reveal such disorders as hydrocele, hernia, or tumor of the testis. The penis is inspected and palpated for ulcerations, nodules, inflammation, and discharge. The testicular examination provides an excellent opportunity to instruct the patient about techniques for testicular self-examination and its importance in early detection of testicular cancer (discussed later in this chapter). This selfexamination should begin during adolescence.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

As men age, the prostate gland enlarges, prostate secretion decreases, the scrotum hangs lower, the testes become smaller and more firm, and pubic hair becomes sparser and stiffer. Changes in gonadal function include a decline in plasma testosterone levels and reduced production of progesterone (Table 49-1). Other changes include decreasing sexual function, slower sexual responses, an increased incidence of genitourinary tract cancer, and urinary incontinence for various reasons.

Male reproductive capability is maintained with advancing age. Although degenerative changes occur in the seminiferous tubules, spermatogenesis (production of sperm) continues. Sexual function, however, involving libido (desire) and potency, decreases. Vascular problems cause about half of the cases of impotence in men older than 50 years of age.

Hypogonadism occurs in up to one fourth of older men. The relationship of hypogonadism to impotence is uncertain. This decline is more evident in men older than 70 years but is also noted in men in their 60 s. In older men, the sexual response slows. Erection takes longer in men older than 50 years of age, and full erections may not be attained until orgasm. Sexual function is affected by several factors, such as psychological problems, illnesses, and medications. In general, the sexual act takes longer. In older men, ejaculatory control increases; however, if the erection is partially

FIGURE 49-2 (A) Palpation of the prostate gland during digital rectal examination (DRE) enables the examiner to assess the size, shape, and texture of the gland. (B) The prostate is round, with a palpable median sulcus or groove separating the two lobes. It should feel rubbery and free of nodules and masses.

lost, there may be difficulty in attaining a full erection again, and resolution may occur without orgasm. Sexual activity is closely correlated with the man's sexual activity of his earlier years; if he was more active than average as a young man, he will most likely continue to be more active than average in his later years.

Cancers of the kidney, bladder, prostate, and penis all have increased incidence in men older than 50 years of age. DRE and screening tests for hematuria may uncover a higher percentage of malignancies at earlier stages.

Urinary incontinence in the elderly man may have many causes, including medications and age-related conditions, such as neurologic diseases or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; also referred to as hypertrophy and called an enlarged prostate by the lay public). Diagnostic tests are performed to exclude reversible causes of urinary incontinence. For some patients with severe incontinence, augmentation cystoplasty (repair of the bladder) with placement of an artificial urinary sphincter may help alleviate this problem.

\section*{Diagnostic Evaluation}

Diagnostic studies that relate to the male reproductive organs and the ability to participate in sexual activity include the following.

\section*{PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN TEST}

The prostate gland produces a substance known as prostatespecific antigen (PSA). It can be measured in a blood specimen, and levels increase with prostate cancer. Many factors can increase PSA levels, including BPH, prostate cancer, and infections of the prostate and urinary tract. PSA levels are measured in nanograms per milliliter ( $\mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ). The PSA test and DRE are used to detect prostate cancer (Smith, Cokkinides, von Eschenbach, et al., 2002).

The range of values considered normal is 0.2 to $4.0 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$. Values over 4.0 are considered elevated. An elevated PSA level is not a specific indicator of prostate cancer. A number of conditions (eg, BPH, transurethral resection of the prostate, acute urinary retention, and acute prostatitis) can also cause an elevated PSA level in the absence of prostate cancer. Despite these limitations, in combination with other procedures, PSA is useful in identifying men at risk and in monitoring patients following treatment for cancer of the prostate (Barry, 2001). A PSA test, along with DRE, is recommended by the American Cancer Society annually for men at high risk, specifically those with a family history of prostate cancer and for African American men.

\section*{ULTRASONOGRAPHY}

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) studies may be performed in patients with abnormalities detected by DRE or those with elevated PSA levels. After DRE, a lubricated, condom-covered, rectal probe transducer is inserted into the rectum along the anterior wall. Water may be introduced to the condom to help transmit sound waves to the prostate. TRUS may be used in detecting nonpalpable prostate cancers and in staging localized prostate cancer. Needle biopsies of the prostate are commonly guided by TRUS.

\section*{PROSTATE FLUID OR TISSUE ANALYSIS}

Specimens of prostate fluid or tissue may be obtained for culture when disease or inflammation of the prostate gland is suspected. A biopsy of the prostate gland may be necessary to obtain tissue for histologic examination. This may be performed at the time of prostatectomy or by means of a perineal or transrectal needle biopsy.

\section*{TESTS OF MALE SEXUAL FUNCTION}

If the patient cannot engage in sexual intercourse to his satisfaction, a detailed history is obtained. Nocturnal penile tumescence tests may be conducted in a sleep laboratory to monitor changes in penile circumference during sleep (using a mercury strain gauge placed around the penis); the results help to identify the cause of erectile dysfunction. Arterial blood flow to the penis is measured with the Doppler probe. Nerve conduction tests and psychological evaluations are also part of the diagnostic workup and are usually conducted by a specialized team of health care providers.

\section*{Disorders of Male Sexual Function}

\section*{ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION}

Erectile dysfunction, also called impotence, is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient to accomplish intercourse. The man may report decreased frequency of erections, inability to achieve a firm erection, or rapid detumescence (subsiding of erection). Incidence ranges from $25 \%$ to $50 \%$ in men older than 65 years of age. The physiology of erection and ejaculation is complex and involves sympathetic and parasympathetic components. At the time of erection, pelvic nerves carry parasympathetic impulses that dilate the smaller blood vessels of the region and increase blood flow to the penis, expanding the corpora cavernosa.

Erectile dysfunction has both psychogenic and organic causes. Psychogenic causes include anxiety, fatigue, depression, and pressure to perform sexually. Organic impotence, however, may account for more impotence than previously realized. Organic causes include occlusive vascular disease, endocrine disease (diabetes, pituitary tumors, hypogonadism with testosterone deficiency, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism), cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, genitouri-nary conditions (radical pelvic surgery), hematologic conditions (Hodgkin's disease, leukemia), neurologic disorders (neuropathies, parkinsonism, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis), trauma to the pelvic or genital area, alcohol, medications (Chart 49-1), and drug abuse.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction requires a sexual and medical history; an analysis of presenting symptoms; a physical examination, including a neurologic examination; a detailed assessment of all medications, alcohol, and drugs used; and various laboratory studies. Nocturnal penile tumescence tests are conducted in sleep laboratories to monitor changes in penile circumference. In healthy men, nocturnal penile erections closely parallel rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in occurrence and duration. Organically impotent men show inadequate sleeprelated erections that correspond to their waking performance. The nocturnal penile tumescence test can help to determine whether erectile impotence has an organic or psychological cause. Arterial blood flow to the penis is measured using a Doppler probe. In addition, nerve conduction tests and extensive psychological evaluations are carried out. Figure 49-3 describes the evaluation and treatment of men with erectile dysfunction.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment, which depends on the cause, can be medical, surgical, or both (Table 49-2). Nonsurgical therapy includes treating associated conditions, such as alcoholism, and readjusting hypertensive agents or other medications. Endocrine therapy may be instituted for erectile dysfunction secondary to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction and may reverse the condition. Insufficient penile blood flow may be treated with vascular surgery. Patients with erectile dysfunction from psychogenic causes are referred to a health care provider or therapist specializing in sexual dysfunction. Patients with erectile dysfunction secondary to organic causes may be candidates for penile implants.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Sildenafil (Viagra) is an oral medication for erectile dysfunction (Eid, 2000). When it is taken about 1 hour before sex, an erection can occur with stimulation; the erection can last about 60 to 120 minutes. Despite the effectiveness of this medication, it does have side effects: headache, flushing, and dyspepsia. Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients who take organic nitrates and should be used with caution in patients with retinopathy, especially those with diabetic retinopathy (Chart 49-2).

Other pharmacologic measures to induce erections include injecting vasoactive agents, such as alprostadil, papaverine, and phentolamine, directly into the penis. Complications include priapism (a persistent abnormal erection) and development of fibrotic plaques at the injection sites. Alprostadil is also formulated in a gel pellet that can be inserted into the urethra to create an erection.

\section*{PENILE IMPLANTS}

Penile implants are available in two types: the semirigid rod and the inflatable prosthesis. The semirigid rod (eg, the Small-Carrion prosthesis) leaves the man with a permanent semierection. The inflatable prosthesis simulates natural erections and natural flaccidity. Complications after implantation include infection, erosion of the prosthesis through the skin (more common with the semirigid rod than with the inflatable prosthesis), and persistent pain, which may require removal of the implant. Cystoscopic surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR or TURP), is more difficult with a semirigid rod than with the inflatable prosthesis. Factors to consider in choosing a prosthesis are the patient's activities of daily living and social activities and the expectations of the patient and his partner. Ongoing counseling for the patient and his partner is usually necessary to help them in adapting to the prosthesis.

\section*{NEGATIVE-PRESSURE DEVICES}

Negative-pressure (vacuum) devices may also be used to induce an erection. A plastic cylinder is placed over the flaccid penis, and negative pressure is applied. When an erection is attained, a constriction band is placed around the base of the penis to maintain the erection. Although many men find this method satisfactory, others experience premature loss of penile rigidity or pain when applying suction or during intercourse.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Personal satisfaction and the ability to sexually satisfy a partner are common concerns of patients. Men with illnesses and disabilities may need the assistance of a sex therapist to find, implement, and integrate their sexual beliefs and behaviors into a healthy and sat-
isfying lifestyle. The nurse can inform patients that support groups for men with erectile dysfunction and their partners have been established. Information about Impotence Anonymous for patients and I-Anon for their partners can be found at the end of this chapter.

\section*{EJACULATION PROBLEMS}

Premature ejaculation occurs when a man cannot control the ejaculatory reflex and, once aroused, reaches orgasm before or shortly after intromission. It is the most common dysfunction in men. Inhibited or retarded ejaculation is the involuntary inhibition of the ejaculatory reflex. The spectrum of responses includes occasional ejaculation through intercourse or self-stimulation or the complete inability to ejaculate under any circumstances.

Treatment modalities depend on the nature and severity of the ejaculation problem. Behavioral therapies may be indicated for people with premature ejaculation; these therapies often involve the man and his sexual partner. "Homework" assignments are often given to the couple to encourage them to identify their sexual needs and to communicate those needs to each other. In some cases, pharmacologic and behavioral therapy together may be effective.

Neurologic disorders (eg, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, neuropathy secondary to diabetes), surgery (prostatectomy), and medications are the most common causes of inhibited ejaculation. Chemical, vibratory, and electrical stimulation have been used with some success. Treatment is usually multidisciplinary and addresses the physical and psychological factors that are often involved in inhibited ejaculation (Lue, 2000).

For men with retrograde ejaculation, the urine may be collected after ejaculation; sperm is then collected from the urine for use in artificial insemination. In men with spinal cord injury, electroejaculation may be used to obtain sperm for artificial insemination.

The effects of trauma, chronic illness, and physical disability on sexual function can be profound. In addition to psychogenic factors, the physical changes associated with illness and injury can impair sexual function.

\section*{Infections of the Male Genitourinary Tract}

Acute uncomplicated cystitis in adult men is uncommon but occasionally occurs in men whose sexual partners have vaginal infections with Escherichia coli. Asymptomatic bacteriuria may also occur from genitourinary manipulation, catheterization, or instrumentation. Urinary tract infections in the male are discussed in Chapter 45.

The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is increasing in men and women. STDs are most common in young, sexually active people, with the incidence higher in men than women (U.S. Surgeon General, 2001). STDs affect people from all walks of life-from all social, educational, economic, and racial backgrounds. Several diseases are classified as STDs: urethritis (gonococcal and nongonococcal), genital ulcers (genital herpes infections, primary syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum), genital warts (human papillomavirus [HPV]), scabies, pediculosis pubis, molluscum contagiosum, hepatitis and enteric infections, proctitis, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Trichomoniasis and STDs characterized by genital ulcers are thought to increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trichomoniasis is associated with nonchlamydial, nongonococcal urethritis.

Treatment of STDs must be targeted at the patient as well as his or her sexual partners and sometimes the unborn child. A thorough history that includes a sexual history is crucial to identify patients at risk and to direct care and teaching. Partners of men with STDs must also be examined, treated, and counseled to prevent reinfection and complications in both partners and to
limit the spread of the disease. Sexual abstinence during treatment and recovery is advised to prevent the transmission of STDs (CDC, 2002). Using latex condoms for at least 6 months after completion of treatment is recommended to decrease transmission of HPV infections as well as other STDs. Because patients with one STD may also have another STD, it is important to
