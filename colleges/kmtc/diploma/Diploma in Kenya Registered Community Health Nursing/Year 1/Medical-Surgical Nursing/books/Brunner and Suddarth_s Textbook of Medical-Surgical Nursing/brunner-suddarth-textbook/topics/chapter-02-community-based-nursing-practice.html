                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As described in Chapter 1, the shift in the settings for health care delivery is a result of changes in federal legislation, tighter insurance regulations, decreasing hospital revenues, and the development of alternative health care delivery systems. As a result of federal legislation passed in 1983 and 1997, hospitals and other health care providers are now reimbursed at a fixed rate for patients with the same diagnosis as defined by diagnosis-related groups. Under this system, hospitals and other health care providers can cut costs and earn income by carefully monitoring the types of services they provide and discharging patients as soon as possible. Consequently, patients are being discharged from acute care facilities to their homes or to residential or long-term facilities at much earlier stages of recovery than in the past. Complex technical equipment, such as dialysis machinery, intravenous lines, and ventilators, is often part of home health care (Brown, 2000).</p>
                        <p>Alternative health care delivery systems, such as health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and managed health care systems, have also contributed to the drive to control costs and the availability of health care services. These regulations have dramatically reduced the length of hospital stay and have led to patients being treated more frequently in ambulatory care settings and at home. Chapter 1 provides a more thorough discussion of alternative health care delivery systems.</p>
                        <p>As more health care delivery shifts into the community, more nurses are working in a variety of public health and communitybased settings. These settings include public health departments, ambulatory health clinics, long-term care facilities, prenatal and well-baby clinics, hospice agencies, industrial settings (as occupational nurses), homeless shelters and clinics, nursing centers, home health agencies, urgent care centers, same day surgical centers, short-stay facilities, and patients' homes.</p>
                        <p>Nurses in these settings often deliver care without direct onsite supervision or the support of other health care personnel. They must be self-directed, flexible, adaptable, and tolerant of various lifestyles and living conditions. Expertise in independent decision making, critical thinking, assessment, and health education, and competence in basic nursing care are essential to function effectively in the community-based setting (Brown, 2000; Pierson, 1999).</p>
                        <p>Community-based nursing is a philosophy of care of individuals and families. The care is provided in a community as the individual or family move among various kinds of service providers outside of hospitals (Hunt, 2000). Although the phrase "community-based nursing" is often interchanged with "community health nursing," a distinction should be made. The phrase "community health nursing" has generally been equated to "public health nursing." Public health nursing is a specialty focused on total populations, although care may be given to individuals. Community-based nursing is broader and may incorporate community health-public health nursing; it is focused on individuals and families rather than total populations. Community-based nursing also includes home health nursing, school health nursing, and a host of other nursing services provided to individuals and groups in the community (Fig. 2-1).</p>
