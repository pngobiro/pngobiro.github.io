                        <p>Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage (Merskey & Bogduk, 1994). It is the most common reason for seeking health care. It occurs with many disorders, diagnostic tests, and treatments. It disables and distresses more people than any single disease. Since nurses spend more time with the patient in pain than do other health care providers, nurses need to understand the pathophysiology of pain, the physiologic and psychological consequences of acute and chronic pain, and the methods used to treat pain. Nurses encounter patients in pain in a variety of settings, including acute care, outpatient, and long-term care settings, as well as in the home. Thus, they must have the knowledge and skills to assess pain, to implement pain relief strategies, and to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, regardless of setting.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-1" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">The FifthVital Sign</span></h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pain management is considered such an important part of care that the American Pain Society coined the phrase "Pain: The 5th Vital Sign" (Campbell, 1995) to emphasize its significance and to increase the awareness among health care professionals of the importance of effective pain management. Documentation of pain assessment is now as prominent as the documentation of the "traditional" vital signs. Pain assessment and management are also mandated by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) (2003).</p>
                        <p>Calling pain the fifth vital sign suggests that the assessment of pain should be as automatic as taking a patient's blood pressure and pulse. The JCAHO (2003) has incorporated pain and pain management into its standards. JCAHO's standards state that "pain is assessed in all patients" and that "patients have the right to appropriate assessment and management of pain." These standards reflect the importance of pain management.</p>
                        <p>In health care, the primary care provider's role is to assess and ameliorate pain by administering medications and other treatments. The nurse collaborates with other health care professionals while administering most pain relief interventions, evaluating their effectiveness, and serving as patient advocate when the intervention is ineffective. In addition, the nurse serves as an educator to the patient and family, teaching them to manage the pain relief regimen themselves when appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The International Association for the Study of Pain definition mentioned earlier encompasses the multidimensional nature of pain (Merskey & Boduck, 1994). A broad definition of pain is "whatever the person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does" (McCaffery & Beebe, 1989, p.7). This definition emphasizes the highly subjective nature of pain and pain management. The patient is the best authority on the existence of pain. Therefore, validation of the existence of pain is based on the patient's report that it exists.</p>
                        <p>Although it is important to believe the patient who reports pain, it is equally important to be alert to patients who deny pain in situations where pain would be expected. A nurse who suspects pain in a patient who denies it should explore with the patient the reason for suspecting pain, such as the fact that the disorder or procedure is usually painful or that the patient grimaces when moving or avoids movement. Exploring why the patient may be denying pain is also helpful. Some people deny pain because they fear the treatment that may result if they report or admit pain. Others deny pain for fear of becoming addicted to opioids (previously referred to as narcotics) if these medications are prescribed.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-2" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Types of Pain</span></h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pain is categorized according to its duration, location, and etiology. Three basic categories of pain are generally recognized: acute pain, chronic (nonmalignant) pain, and cancer-related pain.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ACUTE PAIN</h3>
                        <p>Usually of recent onset and commonly associated with a specific injury, acute pain indicates that damage or injury has occurred. Pain is significant in that it draws attention to its existence and teaches the person to avoid similar potentially painful situations. If no lasting damage occurs and no systemic disease exists, acute pain usually decreases along with healing. For purposes of definition, acute pain can be described as lasting from seconds to 6 months. However, the 6-month time frame has been criticized (Brookoff, 2000) as inaccurate since many acute injuries heal within a few weeks and most heal by 6 weeks. In a situation where healing is expected in 3 weeks and the patient continues to suffer pain, it should be considered chronic and treated with interventions used for chronic pain. Waiting for the full 6-month time frame in this example could cause needless suffering.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CHRONIC (NONMALIGNANT) PAIN</h3>
                        <p>Chronic pain is constant or intermittent pain that persists beyond the expected healing time and that can seldom be attributed to a specific cause or injury. It may have a poorly defined onset, and it is often difficult to treat because the cause or origin may be unclear. Although acute pain may be a useful signal that something is wrong, chronic pain usually becomes a problem in its own right.</p>
                        <p>Chronic pain may be defined as pain that lasts for 6 months or longer, although 6 months is an arbitrary period for differentiating between acute and chronic pain. An episode of pain may assume the characteristics of chronic pain before 6 months have elapsed, or some types of pain may remain primarily acute in nature for longer than 6 months. Nevertheless, after 6 months, most pain experiences are accompanied by problems related to the pain itself. Chronic pain serves no useful purpose. If it persists, it may become the patient's primary disorder.</p>
                        <p>The nurse may come in contact with patients with chronic pain when they are admitted to the hospital for treatment or when they are seen out of the hospital for home care. Frequently the nurse is called on in community-based settings to assist patients in managing pain. For more information on common pain syndromes, see Chart 13-1.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span> Chart 13-1: Common Pain Syndromes</h4>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</h5>
                            <p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is the name given to a group of conditions previously described as causalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), and other diagnoses. Complex regional pain syndrome describes a variety of painful conditions that often follow an injury. The magnitude and duration of the pain far exceeds the expected duration and often results in significant impairment of motor function. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is categorized as CRPS type I and occurs after a relatively minor trauma. Characterized by unexplained diffuse burning pain, usually in the periphery of an extremity, CRPS type I is accompanied by weakness, a skin color and temperature change relative to the other extremity, limited range of motion, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, edema, altered hair growth, and sweating (Janig, 2001).</p>
                            <p>Pain, which worsens with movement, cutaneous stimulation, or stress, often occurs after surgery or trauma to the extremity but is not limited to the area of surgery or trauma. CRPS type I is more common than CRPS type II and is usually managed through a pain clinic. Currently, regional sympathetic blockade and regional IV bretylium offer promise for relief. Tricyclic antidepressants may be tried as well. Complex regional pain syndrome type II refers to causalgia. Type II is more likely to develop after trauma with detectable peripheral nerve lesions (Janig, 2001).</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Postmastectomy Pain Syndrome (PMP)</h5>
                            <p>Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMP) occurs after mastectomy with node dissection but is not necessarily related to the continuation of disease. Characterized by the sensation of constriction accompanied by a burning, prickling, or numbness in the posterior arm, axilla, or chest wall, PMP is often aggravated by movement of the shoulder, resulting in a frozen shoulder from immobilization (Miaskowski & Dibble, 1995).</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Post-traumatic headache disorder</h5>
                            <p>Post-traumatic headache disorder occurs after trauma to the head and is characterized by daily and persistent headache. It is more likely to follow mild head injury than moderate to severe injury (Uomoto & Esselman, 1993).</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Fibromyalgia (Fibrositis)</h5>
                            <p>Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome characterized by generalized musculoskeletal pain, trigger points, stiffness, fatigability, and sleep disturbances, is aggravated by stress and overexertion. Treatment consists of NSAIDs, trigger point injections with local anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, stress reduction, and regular exercise.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Hemiplegia-Associated Shoulder Pain</h5>
                            <p>Hemiplegia-associated shoulder pain is a pain syndrome that affects as many as 80% of stroke patients. It may result from stretching of the shoulder joint due to the uncompensated pull of gravity on the impaired arm. It may be preventable with functional electrical stimulation of involved shoulder muscles.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Pain Associated With Sickle Cell Disease</h5>
                            <p>Pain experienced by patients with sickle cell disease results from venous occlusion caused by the sickle shape of the blood cells, impaired circulation to a muscle or organ, ischemia, and infarction. Acute pain may be managed with IV opioid analgesics administered according to a schedule or by a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and NSAIDs. Warm soaks and elevating the affected body part may help as well. Meperidine (Demerol) therapy is not recommended in patients with compromised renal function, nor is cold therapy. Patients with sickle cell disease may have a long history of chronic pain. Some issues related to their history include tolerance, possible long-term dependence, racial prejudice, and inadequate pain treatment.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">AIDS-Related Pain</h5>
                            <p>As AIDS progresses, so do problems that produce increasing amounts of pain, such as neuropathy, esophagitis, headaches, postherpetic pain, and abdominal, back, bone, and joint pain. Pain relief interventions are individualized and may consist of NSAIDs, long-lasting opioids, such as fentanyl patches, and topical lidocaine. Tricyclic antidepressants may provide comfort in neuropathic and postherpetic pain.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Burn Pain</h5>
                            <p>Possibly the most severe pain, burn pain tends to be underrated by health care professionals the longer they work with burn patients. Besides administration of IV opioid analgesic agents, current therapies to ameliorate pain in burn patients include débridement under general anesthesia; anxiety reduction; intervention with PCA devices, such as hand-held nitrous oxide delivery system; and cognitive techniques, particularly hypnosis.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Guillain-Barré Syndrome and Pain</h5>
                            <p>A progressive, inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system, Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by flaccid paralysis accompanied by paresthesia and pain—muscle pain and severe, unrelenting, burning pain. Complaints of severe pain may be difficult to accept in the face of the characteristic flaccid facial response; therefore, the nurse must be sensitive and learn to disregard nonverbal cues that contradict the verbal report of pain. Treatment interventions include NSAIDs for muscle pain and opioids if NSAIDs are ineffective. Causalgia and neurogenic pain may be relieved by systemic or epidural opioids or, possibly, antiseizure agents or tricyclic antidepressants. To relieve the burning, some patients beg to have windows opened and clothing removed, even in cold weather. This suggests that gentle ice massage may help. Research is needed, however, to test this theory.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Opioid Tolerance</h5>
                            <p>Opioid tolerance is common among patients treated for chronic pain, especially patients being treated by multiple health care providers. Opioid tolerance should be suspected when a patient (1) complains of significantly more pain than is usually associated with the condition, (2) requires unusually high doses of opioids to achieve pain relief, or (3) experiences an unusually low incidence and severity of side effects from opioids. Cancer patients also often develop a tolerance to opioids, requiring larger and larger doses of medication to obtain pain relief. In such cases, the nurse must recognize what is happening, seek additional information from the patient or family, and then procure additional prescriptions for analgesics or an alternative intervention. In patients undergoing surgery, epidural local anesthetic agents provide excellent postoperative analgesia, but the problem of opioid tolerance must be elicited from the patient preoperatively.</p>
                            <p>Occasionally a recovering heroin addict is seen in an acute pain situation (surgery or trauma). This patient may be undergoing treatment with naltrexone (Trexan), a long-acting form of the opioid antagonist naloxone (Narcan). Both the short-acting naloxone and the longacting naltrexone act by binding to the opioid receptors, so opioids cannot be effective. If surgery is planned, the naltrexone should be discontinued a few days before the procedure. Should a patient receiving naltrexone be in immediate need of pain relief, very high doses of opioids are necessary. Alternative methods of pain relief (local or regional blockade and NSAIDs) should be incorporated in the pain management plan.</p>

                        <p>Pain associated with cancer may be acute or chronic. Pain resulting from cancer is so ubiquitous that after fear of dying, it is the second most common fear of newly diagnosed cancer patients (Lema, 1997). More than half of the 1,308 cancer patients included in a study conducted by Foley (1999) reported being in moderate to severe pain 50% of the time. Pain in the patient suffering from cancer can be directly associated with the cancer (eg, bony infiltration with tumor cells or nerve compression), a result of cancer treatment (eg, surgery or radiation), or not associated with the cancer (eg, trauma). Most pain associated with cancer, however, is a direct result of tumor involvement. An approach to cancer pain management is illustrated in Figure 13-1. This three-step approach illustrates the types of analgesic medications used for various levels of pain. A cancer pain algorithm developed as a set of analgesic guiding principles appears in Figure 13-2.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PAIN CLASSIFIED BY LOCATION</h3>
                        <p>The previous discussion of acute and chronic pain is an example of the categorization of pain according to duration. Pain is sometimes categorized according to location, such as pelvic pain, headache, and chest pain. This type of categorization is helpful in communicating and treating pain. For example, chest pain suggests angina or a myocardial infarction and indicates the need for treatment according to cardiac care standards.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PAIN CLASSIFIED BY ETIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>Categorizing pain according to etiology is another way to think about pain and its management. Burn pain and postherpetic neuralgia are examples of pain described by their etiology. Clinicians often can predict the course of pain and plan effective treatment using this categorization.</p>
