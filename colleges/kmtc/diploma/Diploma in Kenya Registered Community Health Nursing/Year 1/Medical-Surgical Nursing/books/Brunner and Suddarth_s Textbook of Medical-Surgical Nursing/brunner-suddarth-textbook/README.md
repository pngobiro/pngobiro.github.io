# Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing - Web Version

## Project Overview

This project converts the comprehensive medical-surgical nursing textbook "Brunner & Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing" into a modern, accessible web format following the Document to Web Conversion workflow.

## Current Status

**Structure Complete** - The web project structure has been created with:
- Table of Contents (index.html)
- MultiMarkdown source (content.mmd) 
- Extracted images (assets/images/)
- CSS styling (assets/css/styles.css)
- JavaScript navigation (js/navigation.js)
- Original PDF (pdf/original.pdf)

**Text Extraction Incomplete** - Due to PDF processing challenges:
- Mathpix OCR timed out after 30 attempts (Job ID: 2025_09_10_e215e42b160dded36264g)
- pdfseparate failed with internal PDF corruption error
- Full text extraction pending resolution of PDF issues

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### PDF Processing Issues
1. **Mathpix OCR Timeout**: Large 41MB PDF caused processing timeout after 30 polling attempts
2. **PDF Corruption**: pdfseparate reported "xref num 36577 not found" internal error
3. **Size Limitations**: Document too large for standard OCR processing

### Image Extraction Success
Despite text extraction challenges, pdfimages successfully extracted thousands of embedded images:
- Format: JPEG images named page-XXX.jpg (where XXX is page sequence)
- Total images: Extracted from all pages of the textbook
- Storage: assets/images/ directory

## Usage Instructions

### Viewing the Content
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Navigate through the table of contents to explore chapter structure
3. Images are available but lack contextual alt text until full content is populated

### Development Setup
1. No additional setup required - static HTML/CSS/JS
2. Images are already extracted and optimized for web use
3. CSS includes responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Adding Content
Once PDF processing is resolved:
1. Replace placeholder content in content.mmd with extracted text
2. Chunk content into individual chapter HTML files
3. Add appropriate alt text to images based on surrounding content
4. Implement search functionality across chapters

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **PDF Repair**: Use qpdf or Adobe Acrobat to repair PDF structure issues
2. **Alternative Extraction**: Try pdf2john or online PDF processing services
3. **Sectioned Processing**: Process PDF in smaller sections (e.g., 50 pages at a time)

### Content Population
1. Extract text using alternative tools once PDF is repaired
2. Create individual chapter HTML files following the topic template
3. Add navigation links between chapters
4. Generate descriptive alt text for medical images and diagrams

### Enhancement Features
1. Implement search across all chapters
2. Add MathJax for medical equations and formulas
3. Create interactive table of contents with progress tracking
4. Add keyboard navigation and ARIA labels for accessibility
