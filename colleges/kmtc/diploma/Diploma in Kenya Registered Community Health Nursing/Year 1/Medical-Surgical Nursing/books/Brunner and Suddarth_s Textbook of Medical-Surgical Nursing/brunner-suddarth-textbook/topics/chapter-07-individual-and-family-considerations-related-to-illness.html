                        <p>When people experience threats to their health, they seek out various care providers for the purpose of maintaining or restoring health. In recent years, both the patient and the family have become more involved participants in health care and health promotion activities. At the same time, greater numbers of consumers and practitioners have recognized the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit in sustaining well-being and overcoming or coping with illness. This holistic approach to health and wellness and the increased consumer involvement reflect a renewed emphasis on the concepts of choice, healing, and patientpractitioner partnerships. The holistic perspective focuses not only on promoting well-being but also on understanding how one's emotional state contributes to health and illness. By using this knowledge, people are better able to prevent the reoccurrence or exacerbation of problems and to develop strategies to improve their future health status.</p>

                        <p>Since the 1980s, holistic therapies have more frequently accompanied traditional health care. A survey on the use of holistic health practices reported that about 34% of the 1539 respondents in a national random sample of adults older than 18 years of age (732 women and 807 men) had consulted with at least one holistic health care practitioner within the past year. The study further noted that although many of the people were also seeing a traditional health care provider, 72% did not inform the physician that they were obtaining holistic treatment (Eisenberg, et al., 1993). Several additional research studies (Sparber, et al., 2000; Wynia, Eisenberg, & Wilson, 1999) support the original work of Eisenberg's group indicating that adult clients, even clients participating in clinical research trials, frequently use complementary therapies to assist them in coping with their illnesses and treatments. The need to discuss the use of these adjunct therapies with clients in all settings is imperative. During their clinical assessments, nurses must obtain information about the client's use of complementary therapies. Some of the most commonly used complementary therapies are listed in Chart 7-1.</p>

                        <p>For some people, the holistic approach is viewed as a way to capitalize on personal strengths and recultivate the values and beliefs about health that were common before the age of technological innovations and the sophistication of biomedical science. A lack of focus on the individual patient, the family, and the environment by some health care providers has created feelings of disillusionment and depersonalization in many patients. The cost of illness, especially chronic illness care, continues to escalate and accounts for an increasing percentage of health care dollars. At the same time, patient satisfaction with the health care received has decreased.</p>
                        <p>Active participation of the patient and family in promoting health supports the self-care model historically embraced by the nursing profession. This model is congruent with the philosophy that seeks to balance and integrate the use of crisis medicine and advanced technology with the influence of the mind and spirit on healing. A holistic approach to health reconnects the traditionally separate approaches to mind and body. Factors such as the physical environment, economic conditions, sociocultural issues, emotional state, interpersonal relationships, and support systems can work together or alone to influence health. The connections among physical health, emotional health, and spiritual well-being must be understood and considered when providing health care. It is the nurse's conceptual integration of the physiologic health condition with the emotional and social context, along with the tasks and developments of the patient's life stage, that allows for the development of a holistic plan of nursing care.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Research on brain structure and function, neurochemical messenger systems (neurotransmitters), and brain-body connections suggests fundamental, delicate, two-way relationships between the brain's environment and mood, behavior, and resistance to disease (Cohen & Herbert, 1996). One focus of brain research has been to identify and integrate traditional medical and psychiatric knowledge with new psychobiologic and psychoneuroimmunologic data. Researchers in the field of psychobiology study the biologic basis of mental disturbances and have established some relationships between mental disorders and changes in the structure and function of the brain. Researchers in the field of psychoneuroimmunology study the connections between the emotions, the central nervous system, the neuroendocrine system, and the immune system and have established compelling evidence that psychosocial variables can affect the functioning of the immune system.</p>
                        <p>As this neuroscientific research continues, data about neurotransmitters and the functioning of the brain will augment existing understanding of emotions, intelligence, memory, and many aspects of general body functioning. In the future, an accepted definition of mental illness may well include biologic information. By enhancing the biologic knowledge base about the brain and nervous system, scientists establish the foundation for breakthroughs in the treatment of both symptoms and illnesses.</p>
                        <p>These findings suggest that the health care community ought to place as much emphasis on emotional health as it places on physiologic health and ought to recognize how biologic, emotional, and societal problems combine to affect individual patients, families, and communities. Some problems that nurses and other health care providers must address include substance abuse, homelessness, family violence, eating disorders, trauma, and chronic mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. To focus attention on these and other mental health problems, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiated a mental health agenda for the nation in the document entitled Healthy People 2010 (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000). The objectives identified are summarized in Chart 7-2. Nurses in all settings encounter patients with mental health problems and have an integral role in helping to achieve the national goals by recognizing and treating emotional distress and promoting emotional health.</p>
