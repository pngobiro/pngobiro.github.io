FIGURE 22-1 Pathophysiologic processes in rhinitis and sinusitis. Although pathophysiologic processes are similar in rhinitis and sinusitis, they affect different structures. In rhinitis (A), the mucous membranes lining the nasal passages become inflamed, congested, and edematous. The swollen nasal conchae block the sinus openings, and mucus is discharged from the nostrils. Sinusitis (B) is also marked by inflammation and congestion, with thickened mucous secretions filling the sinus cavities and occluding the openings.

A Pathophysiology Displaysutilize illustrations and algorithms to demonstrate processes.

\section*{堭 \\ Chart 25-3 - PATIENT EDUCATION Breathing Exercises}

General Instructions
- Breathe slowly and rhythmically to exhale completely and empty the lungs completely.
- Inhale through the nose to filter, humidify, and warm the air before it enters the lungs.
- If you feel out of breath, breathe more slowly by prolonging the exhalation time.
- Keep the air moist with a humidifier.

Diaphragmatic Breathing
Goal: To use and strengthen the diaphragm during breathing
- Place one hand on the abdomen (just below the ribs) and the other hand on the middle of the chest to increase the awareness of the position of the diaphragm and its function in breathing.
- Breathe in slowly and deeply through the nose, letting the abdomen protrude as far as possible.
- Breathe out through pursed lips while tightening (contracting) the abdominal muscles.
- Press firmly inward and upward on the abdomen while breathing out.
- Repeat for 1 minute; follow with a rest period of 2 minutes.
- Gradually increase duration up to 5 minutes, several times a day (before meals and at bedtime).
Pursed-Lip Breathing
Goal: To prolong exhalation and increase airway pressure during expiration, thus reducing the amount of trapped air and the amount of airway resistance.
- Inhale through the nose while counting to 3-the amount of time needed to say "Smell a rose."
- Exhale slowly and evenly against pursed lips while tightening the abdominal muscles. (Pursing the lips increases intratracheal pressure; exhaling through the mouth offers less resistance to expired air.)
- Count to 7 while prolonging expiration through pursed lips-the length of time to say "Blow out the candle."
- While sitting in a chair: Fold arms over the abdomen.
Inhale through the nose while counting to 3 .
Bend forward and exhale slowly through pursed lips while counting to 7.
- While walking:

Inhale while walking two steps.
Exhale through pursed lips while walking four or five steps.

\end{figure}

Evaluation of the effectiveness and toxic potential of promising new modalities for preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer is accomplished through clinical trials. Before new chemotherapy agents are approved for clinical use, they are subjected to rigorous and lengthy
evaluations to identify beneficial effects, adverse effects, and safety.
- Phase I clinical trials determine optimal dosing, scheduling, and toxicity.
- Phase II trials determine effectiveness with specific tumor types and further define toxicities. Participants in these early trials are most often those who have not responded to standard forms of treatment. Because phase I and II trials may be viewed as last-chance efforts, patients and families are therapies. Although it is hoped that investigational therapy will effectively treat the disease, the purpose of early phase trials is to gather information concerning maximal tolerated doses, adverse effects, and effects of the antineoplastic agents on tumor growth.
- Phase III clinical trials establish the effectiveness of new medications or procedures as compared with conventional approaches. Nurses may assist in the recruitment, consent, and education processes for patients who participate. In many cases, nurses are instrumental in monitoring adherence, assisting patients to adhere to the parameters of the trial, and documenting data describing patients' responses. The physical and emotional needs of patients in clinical trials are addressed in much the same way as those of patients
who receive standard forms of cancer treatment.

Identification of Agitation in Patients with Alxheiner's Disease

Whall, A. L., Black, M. E. A., Yankou, D. J., et al. (1999). Nurse aides' identification of onset and level of agitation in late stage dementia patients. American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 14, 202-206.

\section*{Purpose}

Nursing assistants provide the majority of care to patients in nursing homes. They are vital links in the early identification, and therefore in the treatment, of agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nurses' aides (NAs) are sometimes characterized as unwilling or unable to manage patients' agitation. This study examines the process by which nurses' aides can successfully identify this agitation.

\section*{Design}

NAs from five different nursing homes owned by the same corporate entity were asked to participate in the study. Criteria to participate included being employed for at least 1 year. (Rese demonstrates that NAs who remain at a facility longer than 1 usually have a commitment to those they serve.) The NAs dic receive any additional wages and were only promised a letter t dicate that they had participated in the study. Each NA receive proximately 1 hour of training via audio tapes and conversation nurse experts. Each NA was then paired with a nurse expert t sess his or her skill at appropriately identifying levels of agitatic patients with late-stage Alzheimer's disease.

\section*{Conclusions}

This study demonstrated that NAs with a minimum of 1 ye employment did an excellent job in acquiring new observ: skills with only 1 hour of training and positive reinforcement letter noting their participation in this study. The NAs' assessı of signs of agitation agreed with that of the nurse expert more $90 \%$ of the time. All the NAs involved reported gaining helpfi sights in managing agitated behavior as a result of participatic the study.

Situation
A 68-year-old attorney was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx 8 years ago. He was treated successfully with radiation therapy, resulting in an altered voice quality. Recently, he has complained of shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing. In the past few months, he also has noticed a marked change in his voice and physical condition, which he attributed to "winter colds."

After a complete physical exam and an extensive diagnostic workup and biopsy, it is determined that the cancer has recurred at a new primary site. His health care provider recommends surgery (a total laryngectomy) and chemotherapy as the best options. The patient states that he is not willing to "lose my voice and my livelihood" but instead will "take my chances." He has also expressed concern about his quality of life after surgery. His family has approached you about trying to convince him to have surgery.
Dilemma
The patient's right to refuse treatment conflicts with the family's wishes and recommendation from his health care provider.
Discussion
1. Is the patient making a decision based upon all pertinent information concerning his health status, treatment, options, risk/benefits, and long-term prognosis?
2. What arguments can be made to support the patient's decision to forego treatment?

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}
1. Assess patient for weaning criteria: Vital capacity- 10 to $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) at least $-20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ Tidal volume- 7 to $9 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ Minute ventilation - $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$
Rapid/shallow breathing index-below 100 breaths/minute/L $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ greater than 60 mm Hg with $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ less than $40 \%$
2. Monitor activity level, assess dietary intake, and monitor results of laboratory tests of nutritional status.
3. Assess the patient's and family's understanding of the weaning process and address any concerns about the process. Explain that the patient may feel short of breath initially and provide encouragement as needed. Reassure the patient that he or she will be attended closely and that if the weaning attempt is not successful, it can be tried again later.
4. Implement the weaning method prescribed: A/C, IMV, SIMV, PSV, PAV, CPAP, or T-piece.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. Careful assessment of multiple weaning indices helps to determine readiness for weaning. When the criteria have been met, the patient's likelihood of successful weaning increases.
2. Reestablishing independent spontaneous ventilation can be physically exhausting. It is crucial that the patient have enough energy reserves to succeed. Providing periods of rest and recommended nutritional intake can increase the likelihood of successful weaning.
3. The weaning process can be psychologically tiring; emotional support can help promote a sense of security. Explaining that weaning will be attempted again later helps reduce the sense of failure if the first attempts are unsuccessful.
4. The prescribed weaning method should reflect the patient's individualized criteria for weaning and weaning history. By having different methods to choose from, the physician can select the one that best fits the patient.
5. Monitoring the patient closely provides ongoing indications of success or failure.
6. These values can be compared to baseline measurements to evaluate weaning. Suctioning helps to reduce the risk of aspiration and maintain the airway.
7. These signs and symptoms indicate an unstable patient at risk for hypoxia and ventricular dysrhythmias. Continuing the weaning process can lead to cardiopulmonary arrest.

\section*{Preface}

Athe 21st century begins, nurses face a future characterized by changes comparable to those of no preceding century:
- Science and technology have made the world smaller by making it more accessible.
- Mass communication is more widespread, and information is now just an instant away and very easy to obtain.
- Economies are more global than regional.
- Industrial and social changes have made world travel and cultural exchange common.

Today's nurses enter a realm of opportunities and challenges for providing high-quality, evidence-based care in traditional as well as new and innovative health care settings. The rapid changes in health care mandate that nurses be prepared to provide or plan care across the continuum of settings-from hospital or clinic, to home, to community agencies or hospice settings-and during all phases of illness. Recent research has indicated that nurses make significant contributions to the health care outcomes of patients who are hospitalized. Therefore, today's nurses must be prepared to identify patients' short- and long-term needs quickly and to collaborate effectively with patients and families, other members of the health care team, and community agencies to create a seamless system of care. The continued emphasis on health promotion efforts to keep well people healthy and to promote a higher level of well-being among those with acute and chronic illnesses requires today's nurses to assist patients in adopting healthy lifestyles and strategies. Mapping of the human genome and other advances in genetics have moved the issue of genetics to the bedside and increased the need for nurses to become knowledgeable about genetics-related issues.

In preparing for these vast opportunities and responsibilities, today's nurses must be well informed and up-to-date, not only in nursing knowledge and skills but also in research findings, scientific advances, and the ethical dilemmas inherent in many areas of clinical practice. More than ever, today's nurses need to think critically, creatively, and compassionately.

This tenth edition of Brunner \& Suddarth's Textbook of MedicalSurgical Nursing is designed for the 21st century and nurses' need to be knowledgeable, highly skilled, perceptive, caring, and compassionate. A goal of the textbook is to provide balanced attention to the art and science of adult medical-surgical nursing. It addresses nursing care issues from a physiological, pathophysiological, and psychosocial context and assists the reader to identify priorities of care from that context.

\section*{ABOUT THE TENTH EDITION}

The tenth edition of Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook of Medical Surgical Nursing was constructed to provide today's nursing students with an understanding of the nurse's role in health and illness within evolving practice environments and across the spectrum of health and illness. The textbook's content has been revised and updated by experts in the field to reflect current practice and advances in health care and technology.

\section*{NEW CHAPTERS: GENETICS, END-OF-LIFE CARE, AND BIOTERRORISM}

Nursing knowledge is constantly expanding. Chapter 9, Genetics Perspectives in Nursing Practice, was written in response to genetics information identified during the last few years. Every nurse needs to be aware of the influence of genetics on health and illness, and every nurse needs to have the knowledge and skill to answer patients' questions concerning their heredity and health. In addition to Chapter 9, genetics content has been incorporated into each clinical unit of the textbook.

Chapter 17, End-of-Life Care, also new to the tenth edition, addresses some of the questions posed by technologies that can prolong life, often in the face of insurmountable obstacles. The chapter discusses the nurse's role as it pertains to quality of life, prolongation of dying, pain relief, allocation of resources, ethical issues, communication, healing, spirituality, and patient and family care. It emphasizes the pivotal role of the nurse in providing end-of-life care.

A third new chapter-Chapter 72, Terrorism, Mass Casualty, and Disaster Nursing - completes the text by reviewing the nurse's role in relation to patients affected by terrorism and other disasters. Among the issues addressed are emergency preparedness and planning, triage in cases of mass casualty, radiation, chemical and biologic weapons, ethical conflict, stress management, and survival.

\section*{NANDA, NIC, NOC: LINKS, LANGUAGES, AND CONCEPT MAPS}

Although Brunner \& Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing has long used nursing diagnoses developed by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA), this edition presents the links between the NANDA diagnoses and the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) and Nursing-sensitive Outcomes Classification (NOC). The opening page of each unit presents a concept map illustrating these three classification systems and their relationships. Each unit's concept map is accompanied by a case study and a chart presenting examples of actual NANDA, NIC, and NOC terminologies related to the case study. This material is included to introduce the reader to the NIC and NOC language and classifications and bring them to life in the clinical realm. Faculty and students alike may use some of the issues presented in the case studies as a springboard for developing their own concept maps.

\section*{RECENT NURSING RESEARCH AND OTHER FEATURES}

As before, Nursing Research Profiles included in the chapters identify the implications and applications of recent nursing research findings for nursing practice. The chapters also include charts and text detailing special considerations in caring for the elderly patient and for those with disabilities.

\section*{TEACHING TOOLBOX}

Each chapter opens with Learning Objectives and a Glossary. Throughout the text the reader will find Nursing Alerts as well as specialized charts focusing on
- Physiology/Pathophysiology
- Risk Factors
- Assessment
- Plans of Nursing Care
- Pharmacology
- Home Care
- Patient Education
- Health Promotion
- Ethics and Related Issues

\section*{Health Care Delivery and Nursing Practice}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Define health and wellness.
2. Describe factors causing significant changes in the health care delivery system and their impact on the health care field and the nursing profession.
3. Describe the practitioner, leadership, and research roles of the nurse.
4. Describe nursing care delivery models.
5. Discuss expanded nursing roles.

$T_{h}$he health care industry, like other industries in U.S. society, has experienced profound changes during the past several decades. Nursing, as a health care profession and a major component of the health care delivery system, is significantly affected by shifts in the health care industry. In addition, nursing has been and will continue to be an important force in shaping the future of the health care system.

\section*{The Health Care Industry and the Nursing Profession}

Although the delivery of nursing care has been affected by changes occurring in the health care system, the definition of nursing has continued to distinguish nursing care and identify the major aspects of nursing care.

\section*{NURSING DEFINED}

Since the time of Florence Nightingale, who wrote in 1858 that the goal of nursing was "to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him," nursing leaders have described nursing as both an art and a science. However, the definition of nursing has evolved over time. The American Nurses Association (ANA), in its Social Policy Statement (ANA, 1995), defined nursing as "the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to health and illness" and provided the following illustrative list of phenomena that are the focus for nursing care and research:
- Self-care processes
- Physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in areas such as rest, sleep, respiration, circulation, reproduction, activity, nutrition, elimination, skin, sexuality, and communication
- Comfort, pain, and discomfort
- Emotions related to experiences of health and illness
- Meanings ascribed to health and illnesses
- Decision making and ability to make choices
- Perceptual orientations such as self-image and control over one's body and environments
- Transitions across the life span, such as birth, growth, development, and death
- Affiliative relationships, including freedom from oppression and abuse
- Environmental systems

Nurses have a responsibility to carry out their role as defined in the Social Policy Statement, to comply with the nurse practice act of the state where they practice, and to comply with the code for nurses as spelled out by the International Council of Nurses and the ANA. Understanding the needs of health care consumers and the health care delivery system, including the forces that affect nursing and health care delivery, will provide a foundation for examining the delivery of nursing care.

\section*{THE PATIENT/CLIENT: CONSUMER OF NURSING AND HEALTH CARE}

The central figure in health care services is, of course, the patient. The term patient, which is derived from a Latin verb meaning "to suffer," has traditionally been used to describe those who are recipients of care. The connotation commonly attached to the
word is one of dependence. For this reason, many nurses prefer to use the term client, which is derived from a Latin verb meaning "to lean," connoting alliance and interdependence. For the purposes of this book, the term patient will be used throughout, but with the understanding that either term is acceptable.

The patient who seeks care for a health problem or problems (increasing numbers of people have multiple health problems) is also an individual, a member of a family, and a citizen of the community. Patients' needs vary depending on their problem, associated circumstances, and past experiences. One of the nurse's important functions in health care delivery is to identify the patient's immediate needs and take measures to address them.

\section*{The Patient's Basic Needs}

Certain needs are basic to all people and require satisfaction accordingly. Such needs are addressed on the basis of priority, meaning that some needs are more pressing than others. Once an essential need is met, the person experiences a need on a higher level. Approaching needs according to priority reflects Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Fig. 1-1).

\section*{Maslow's Hierarchy}

Maslow ranked human needs as follows: physiologic needs; safety and security; belongingness and affection; esteem and self-respect; and self-actualization, which includes self-fulfillment, desire to know and understand, and aesthetic needs. Lower-level needs always remain, but a person's ability to pursue higher-level needs indicates that he or she is moving toward psychological health and well-being. Such a hierarchy of needs is a useful organizational framework that can be applied to the various nursing models for assessment of a patient's strengths, limitations, and need for nursing interventions.

\section*{HEALTH CARE IN TRANSITION}

Changes occurring in health care delivery and nursing are the result of societal, economic, technological, scientific, and political forces that have evolved throughout the 20th and into the 21st century. Among the most significant changes are shifts in population demographics, particularly the increase in the aging population and the cultural diversity of the population; changing patterns of diseases; increased technology; increased consumer expectations; the high costs of health care and changes in health care financing; and other health care reform efforts. These changes have led to institutional restructuring, staff downsizing, increased outpatient care services, decreased lengths of hospital stay, and more care being provided in the community and in the home. Such changes are having a dramatic influence on where nurses practice, with an increasing trend for nurses to provide health care in community and home settings. Indeed, these changes have a dynamic influence on our view of health and illness and therefore affect the focus of nursing and health care.

As an increasing proportion of the population reaches age 65 years and older, and with the shift in disease patterns from acute illnesses to chronic illnesses, the traditional disease management and care focus of the health care professions has expanded. There is growing concern about emerging infectious diseases, trauma, and bioterrorism. The health care focus must center more on prevention, health promotion, and management of chronic conditions than in previous times. This shift in focus coincides with a nationwide emphasis on cost control and resource management directed toward providing cost-efficient and cost-effective health care services to the population as a whole.

\section*{Health, Wellness, and Health Promotion}

The health care system of the United States, which traditionally has been disease oriented, is currently placing greater emphasis on health and its promotion. Similarly, a significant portion of nursing's workforce formerly was focused on the care of patients with acute conditions, but now a growing portion is directing its efforts toward health promotion and disease prevention.

\section*{HEALTH}

How health is perceived depends on how health is defined. In the preamble to its constitution, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a "state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity" (Hood \& Leddy, 2002). Such a definition of health does not allow for any variation in degrees of wellness or illness. On the other hand, the concept of a health-illness continuum allows for a greater range in describing a person's health status. By viewing health and illness on a continuum, it is possible to consider a person as having neither complete health nor complete illness. Instead, a person's state of health is ever-changing and has the potential to range from high-level wellness to extremely poor health and imminent death. The model of the health-illness continuum makes it possible to view a person as simultaneously possessing degrees of both health and illness.

The limitations of the WHO definition of health are clear in relation to chronic illness and disability. A chronically ill person cannot meet the standards of health as established by the WHO definition. However, when viewed from the perspective of the health-illness continuum, people with chronic illness or disabil-
ity can be understood as having the potential to attain a high level of wellness, if they are successful in meeting their health potential within the limits of their chronic illness or disability.

\section*{WELLNESS}

Wellness has been defined as being equivalent to health. Cookfair (1996) indicated that wellness "includes a conscious and deliberate approach to an advanced state of physical, psychological, and spiritual health and is a dynamic, fluctuating state of being" (p. 149). Leddy and Pepper (1998) contended that wellness is indicated by the capacity of the person to perform to the best of his or her ability, the ability to adjust and adapt to varying situations, a reported feeling of well-being, and a feeling that "everything is together" and harmonious. With this in mind, it becomes evident that the goal of health care providers is to promote positive changes that are directed toward health and well-being. The fact that the sense of wellness has a subjective aspect emphasizes the importance of recognizing and responding to patient individuality and diversity in health care and nursing.

\section*{HEALTH PROMOTION}

Today, increasing emphasis is placed on health, health promotion, wellness, and self-care. Health is seen as resulting from a lifestyle that is oriented toward wellness. The result has been the evolution of a wide range of health promotion strategies, including multiphasic screening, genetic testing, lifetime health monitoring programs, environmental and mental health programs, risk reduction, and nutrition and health education. A growing interest in self-care skills is evidenced by the large number of healthrelated publications, conferences, and workshops designed for the lay public.

Individuals are increasingly knowledgeable about their health and are encouraged to take more interest in and responsibility for their health and well-being. Organized self-care education programs emphasize health promotion, disease prevention, management of illness, self-medication, and judicious use of the professional health care system. In addition, well over 500,000 self-help groups and numerous web sites and chat groups exist for the purpose of sharing experiences and information about self-care with others who have similar conditions, chronic diseases, or disabilities.

Special efforts are being made by health care professionals to reach and motivate members of various cultural and socioeconomic groups concerning lifestyle and health practices. Stress, improper diet, lack of exercise, smoking, drugs, high-risk behaviors (including risky sexual practices), and poor hygiene are all lifestyle behaviors known to have a negative effect on health. Health care professionals are concerned with encouraging behavior that promotes health. The goal is to motivate people to make improvements in the way they live, to modify risky behaviors, and to adopt healthy behaviors.

\section*{Influences on Health Care Delivery}

The health care delivery system is rapidly changing as the population and its health care needs and expectations change. The shifting demographics of the population, the increase in chronic illnesses and disability, the greater emphasis on economics, and technological advances have resulted in changing emphases in health care delivery and in nursing.

\section*{POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS}

Changes in the population in general are affecting the need for and the delivery of health care. The 2000 U.S. census data indicated that there were $281,421,906$ people in the country (PluvioseFenton, 2001). This population expansion is attributed in part to improved public health services and improved nutrition.

Not only is the population increasing, but the composition of the population is also changing. The decline in birth rate and the increase in life span attributed to improved health care have resulted in fewer school-age children and more senior citizens, most of whom are women. Much of the population resides in highly congested urban areas, with a steady migration of minority groups to the inner cities and a migration of middle-class people to suburban areas. The number of homeless people, including entire families, has increased significantly. The population has become more culturally diverse as increasing numbers of people from different national backgrounds enter the country. Because of such population changes, the need for health care for specific age groups, for women, and for a diverse group of people within specific geographic locations is altering the effectiveness of traditional means of providing health care and is necessitating far-reaching changes in the overall health care delivery system.

\section*{Aging Population}

The elderly population in the United States has increased significantly and will continue to grow in future years. In 1999, the nation's 34.5 million adults older than 65 years of age constituted $12.7 \%$ of the population, with a ratio of 141 older women to 100 older men. The number of people in the United States older than 65 years of age is expected to reach $20 \%$ of the population by the year 2030. In addition, persons age 85 years and older constitute one of the fastest-growing segments of the population. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (2000), the number of people age 65 to 74 years was 8 times larger in 1999 than in 1900, and the number of people age 75 to 84 years was 16 times largerbut the number of people age 85 years and older was 34 times larger in 1999 than in 1900.

Many elderly people suffer from multiple chronic conditions that are exacerbated by acute episodes. Elderly women, whose conditions are frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, are of particular concern. There are approximately three women for every two men in the older population, and elderly women are expected to continue to outnumber elderly men. The health care needs of older adults are complex and demand significant investments, both professional and financial, by the health care industry.

\section*{Cultural Diversity}

An appreciation for the diverse characteristics and needs of individuals from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds is important in health care and nursing. Some projections indicate that by 2030 racial and ethnic minority groups will comprise $40 \%$ of the population of the United States (Gooden, Porter, Gonzalez, \& Mims, 2000). With increased immigration, both legal and illegal, this figure could easily increase to more than $50 \%$ by the year 2030 or even earlier. As the cultural composition of the population changes, it becomes increasingly important to address cultural considerations in the delivery of health care. Patients from diverse sociocultural groups bring to the health care setting different health care beliefs, values, and practices, as well as different risk factors for some disease conditions and unique reactions to treat-
ment. These factors significantly affect the way an individual responds to health care problems or illness, to those who provide the care, and to the care itself. Unless these factors are understood and respected by health care providers, the care delivered may be ineffective and health care outcomes may be negatively affected.

Culture is defined as learned patterns of behavior, beliefs, and values that can be attributed to a particular group of people. Included among the many characteristics that distinguish cultural groups are the manner of dress, language spoken, values, rules or norms of behavior, gender-specific practices, economics, politics, law and social control, artifacts, technology, dietary practices, and health beliefs and practices.

Health promotion, illness prevention, causes of sickness, treatment, coping, caring, dying, and death are part of the healthrelated component of every culture. Every person has a unique belief and value system that has been shaped at least in part by his or her cultural environment. This belief and value system is very important and guides the individual's thinking, decisions, and actions. It provides direction for interpreting and responding to illness and to health care.

To promote an effective nurse-patient relationship and positive outcomes of care, nursing care must be culturally competent, appropriate, and sensitive to cultural differences. All attempts should be made to help the individual retain his or her unique cultural characteristics. Providing special foods that have significance and arranging for special religious observances may enable the patient to maintain a feeling of wholeness at a time when he or she may feel isolated from family and community.

Knowing the cultural and social significance that particular situations have for each patient helps the nurse avoid imposing a personal value system when the patient has a different point of view. In most cases, cooperation with the plan of care is greatest when communication among the nurse, the patient, and the patient's family is directed toward understanding the situation or the problem and respecting each other's goals.

\section*{CHANGING PATTERNS OF DISEASE}

During the past 50 years, the health problems of the American people have changed significantly. Many infectious diseases have been controlled or eradicated; others, such as tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and sexually transmitted diseases, are on the rise. An increasing number of infectious agents are becoming resistant to antibiotic therapy as a result of widespread inappropriate use of antibiotics. Therefore, conditions that were once easily treated have become complex and more life-threatening than ever before.

The chronicity of illnesses and disability is increasing because of the lengthening life span of Americans and the expansion of successful treatment options for conditions such as cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and spina bifida; many people with these conditions live decades longer than in earlier years. Chronically ill people are the largest group of health care consumers in the United States (Davis \& Magilvy, 2000). Because the majority of health problems seen today are chronic in nature, many people are learning to protect and maximize their health within the constraints of chronic illness and disability.

As chronic conditions increase, health care broadens from a focus on cure and eradication of disease to include the prevention or rapid treatment of exacerbations of chronic conditions. Nursing, which has always encouraged patients to take control of their conditions, plays a prominent role in the current focus on management of chronic illness and disability.

\section*{ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND GENETICS}

Advances in technology and genetics have occurred with greater frequency during the past several decades than in all other periods of civilization. Sophisticated techniques and devices have revolutionized surgery and diagnostic testing, making it possible to perform many procedures and tests on an outpatient basis. Increased knowledge and understanding of genetics has resulted in expanded screening, diagnostic testing, and treatments for a variety of conditions. This is also an era of sophisticated communication systems that connect most parts of the world, with the capability of rapid storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information. Such scientific and technological advances are themselves stimulating brisk change as well as swift obsolescence in health care delivery strategies. The advances in technology and genetics have raised many ethical issues for the health care system, health care providers, and society.

\section*{ECONOMIC CHANGES}

The philosophy that comprehensive, quality health care should be provided for all citizens prompted governmental concern about spiraling health care costs and wide variations in charges among providers. These concerns led to the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) and the use of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs).

In 1983, the U.S. Congress passed the most significant health legislation since the Medicare program was enacted in 1965. The government was no longer able to afford to reimburse hospitals for patient care that was delivered without any defined limits or costs. Therefore, it approved a PPS for hospital inpatient services. This system of reimbursement, based on DRGs, set the rates for Medicare payments for hospital services. Hospitals receive payment at a fixed rate for patients with diagnoses that fall into a specific DRG. A fixed payment has been predetermined for more than 470 possible diagnostic categories, covering the majority of medical diagnoses of all patients admitted to the hospital. Hospitals receive the same payment for every patient with a given diagnosis or DRG. If the cost of the patient's care is lower than the payment, the hospital gains a profit; if the cost is higher, the hospital incurs a loss. As a result, hospitals now place greater emphasis on reducing costs, utilization of services, and length of patient stay.

In addition, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 added new rate requirements for ambulatory payment classifications (APCs) to hospitals and other providers of ambulatory care services. These providers must evaluate all services provided with greater efforts toward cost-effectiveness and reduction of costs.

To qualify for Medicare reimbursement, care providers and hospitals must contract with peer review organizations (PROs) to perform quality and utilization review. The PROs monitor admission patterns, lengths of stay, transfers, and the quality of services and validate the DRG coding. The DRG system has provided hospitals with an incentive to cut costs and discharge patients as quickly as possible.

Nurses in hospitals now care for patients who are older and sicker and require more nursing services; nurses in the community are caring for patients who have been discharged earlier and need acute care services with high-technology and long-term care. The importance of an effective discharge planning program, along with utilization review and a quality improvement program, is unquestionable. Nurses in acute care settings must assume responsibility with other health care team members for
maintaining quality care while facing pressures to discharge patients and decrease staffing costs. These nurses must also work with nurses in community settings to ensure continuity of care.

\section*{DEMAND FOR QUALITY CARE}

The general public has become increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about health care and health promotion. This awareness has been stimulated by television, newspapers, magazines, and other communications media and by political debate. The public has become more health conscious and has in general begun to subscribe strongly to the belief that health and quality health care constitute a basic right, rather than a privilege for a chosen few.

In 1977, the National League for Nursing (NLN) issued a statement on nurses' responsibility to uphold patients' rights. The statement addressed patients' rights to privacy, confidentiality, informed participation, self-determination, and access to health records. This statement also indicated ways in which respect for patients' rights and a commitment to safeguarding them could be incorporated into nursing education programs and upheld and reinforced by those in nursing service. Nurses can directly involve themselves in ensuring specific rights, or they can make their influence felt indirectly (NLN, 1977).

The ANA has worked diligently to promote the delivery of quality health and nursing care. Efforts by the ANA range from assessing the quality of health care provided to the public in these changing times to lobbying legislators to pass bills related to issues such as health insurance or length of hospital stay for new mothers.

Legislative changes have promoted both delivery of quality health care and increased access by the public to this care. The National Health Planning and Resources Act of 1974 emphasized the need for planning and providing quality health care for all Americans through coordinated health services, staffing, and facilities at the national, state, and local levels. Medically underserved populations were the target for the primary care services provided for by this act. By the passage of bills supporting health insurance reform, barring discrimination against individuals with preexisting conditions, and expanding the portability of health care coverage, Congress has acknowledged the needs of consumers for adequate health insurance in this time of longer life spans and chronic illnesses. Efforts in some states to provide full health care coverage for citizens, particularly children, represent measures by state governments to promote access to health care. Legislative support of advanced practice nurses in individual practice is a recognition of the contribution of nursing to the health of consumers, particularly underserved populations.

\section*{Quality Improvement and Evidence-Based Practice}

In the 1980s, hospitals and other health care agencies implemented ongoing quality assurance (QA) programs. These programs were required for reimbursement for services and for accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). QA programs sought to establish accountability on the part of the health professions to society for the quality, appropriateness, and cost of health services provided.

The JCAHO developed a generic model that required monitoring and evaluation of quality and appropriateness of care. The model was implemented in health care institutions and agencies through organization-wide QA programs and reporting systems.

Many aspects of the programs were centralized in a QA department. In addition, each patient care and patient services department was responsible for developing its own plan for monitoring and evaluation. Objective and measurable indicators were used to monitor, evaluate, and communicate the quality and appropriateness of care delivered.

In the early 1990s, it was recognized that quality of care as defined by regulatory agencies continued to be difficult to measure. QA criteria were identified as measures to ensure minimal expectations only; they did not provide mechanisms for identifying causes of problems or for determining systems or processes that need improvement. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) was identified as a more effective mechanism for improving the quality of health care. In 1992, the revised standards of the JCAHO mandated that health care organizations implement a CQI program. Recent amendments to JCAHO standards have specified that patients have the right to care that is considerate and preserves dignity; that respects cultural, psychosocial, and spiritual values; and that is age specific (Krozok \& Scoggins, 2001). Quality improvement efforts have focused on ensuring that the care provided meets or exceeds JCAHO standards.

Unlike QA, which focuses on individual incidents or errors and minimal expectations, CQI focuses on the processes used to provide care, with the aim of improving quality by assessing and improving those interrelated processes that most affect patient care outcomes and patient satisfaction. CQI involves analyzing, understanding, and improving clinical, financial, or operational processes. Problems identified as more than isolated events are analyzed, and all issues that may affect the outcome are studied. The main focus is on the processes that affect quality.

As health care agencies continue to implement CQI, nurses have many opportunities to be involved in quality improvement. One such opportunity is through facilitation of evidence-based practice. Evidence-based practice-identifying and evaluating current literature and research and incorporating the findings into care guidelines-has been designated as a means of ensuring quality care. Evidence-based practice includes the use of outcome assessment and standardized plans of care such as clinical guidelines, clinical pathways, or algorithms. Many of these measures are being implemented by nurses, particularly by nurse managers and advanced practice nurses. Nurses directly involved in the delivery of care are engaged in analyzing current data and refining the processes used in CQI. Their knowledge of the processes and conditions that affect patient care is critical in designing changes to improve the quality of the care provided.

\section*{Clinical Pathways and Care Mapping}

Many hospitals, managed care facilities, and home health services nationwide use clinical pathways or care mapping to coordinate care for a caseload of patients (Klenner, 2000). Clinical pathways serve as an interdisciplinary care plan and as the tool for tracking a patient's progress toward achieving positive outcomes within specified time frames. Clinical pathways have been developed for certain DRGs (eg, open heart surgery, pneumonia with comorbidity, fractured hip), for high-risk patients (eg, those receiving chemotherapy), and for patients with certain common health problems (eg, diabetes, chronic pain). Using current literature and expertise, pathways identify best care. The pathway indicates key events, such as diagnostic tests, treatments, activities, medications, consultation, and education, that must occur within specified times for the patient to achieve the desired and timely outcomes.

A case manager often facilitates and coordinates interventions to ensure that the patient progresses through the key events and achieves the desired outcomes. Nurses providing direct care have an important role in the development and use of clinical pathways through their participation in researching the literature and then developing, piloting, implementing, and revising clinical pathways. In addition, nurses monitor outcome achievement and document and analyze variances. Figure 1-2 presents an example of a clinical pathway. Other examples of clinical pathways can be found in Appendix A.

Care mapping, multidisciplinary action plans (MAPs), clinical guidelines, and algorithms are other evidence-based practice tools that are used for interdisciplinary care planning. These tools are used to move patients toward predetermined outcome markers using phases and stages of the disease or condition. Algorithms are used more often in an acute situation to determine a particular treatment based on patient information or response. Care maps, clinical guidelines, and MAPs (the most detailed of all tools) provide coordination of care and education through hospitalization and after discharge (Cesta \& Falter, 1999).

Because care mapping and guidelines are used for conditions in which the patient's progression often defies prediction, specific time frames for achieving outcomes are excluded. Patients with highly complex conditions or multiple underlying illnesses may benefit more from care mapping or guidelines than from clinical pathways, because the use of outcome markers (rather than specific time frames) is more realistic in such cases.

Through case management and the use of clinical pathways or care mapping, patients and the care they receive are continually assessed from preadmission to discharge-and in many cases after discharge in the home care and community settings. These tools are used in hospitals and alternative health care delivery systems to facilitate the effective and efficient care of large groups of patients. The resultant continuity of care, effective utilization of services, and cost containment are expected to be major benefits for society and for the health care system.

\section*{ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS}

The rising cost of health care over the last few decades has led to the use of managed health care and alternative health care delivery systems, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs).

\section*{Managed Care}

The PPS has given rise to a much broader pattern of reimbursement and cost control: managed health care. Managed care is an important trend in health care. The failure of the regulatory efforts of past decades to cut costs and the escalation of health care costs to $15 \%$ to $22 \%$ of the gross domestic product have prompted business, labor, and government to assume greater control over the financing and delivery of health care. The common features that characterize managed care include prenegotiated payment rates, mandatory precertification, utilization review, limited choice of provider, and fixed-price reimbursement. The scope of managed care has expanded from inhospital services; to HMOs or variations such as PPOs; to various ambulatory, long-term, and home care services, as well as related diagnostic and therapeutic services. Over time there has been a significant expansion of managed health care to the point that distinctions among different providers-including HMOs,

PPOs, exclusive provider arrangements, managed indemnity plans, and self-insured managed care-are blurring.

Managed care has contributed to a dramatic reduction in inpatient hospital days, continuing expansion of ambulatory care, fierce competition, and marketing strategies that appeal to consumers as well as to insurers and regulators. Hospitals are faced with declining revenues, a declining number of patients, more severely ill patients with shorter lengths of stay, and a need to incorporate cost-effective outpatient or ambulatory care services. As patients return to the community, they have more health care needs, many of which are complex. The demand for home care and community-based services is escalating. Despite their successes, managed care organizations are faced with the challenge of providing quality services under even greater resource constraints. Case management is the methodology used by many organizations to meet this challenge.

\section*{Case Management}

Case management has become a prominent method for coordinating health care services to ensure cost-effectiveness, accountability, and quality care. The case management process dates back to the public health programs of the early 1900s, in which public health nursing played a dominant role. Over the years, the process has varied in form and function, but the basic theme has remained. The premise of case management is that the responsibility for meeting patient needs rests with one individual or team whose goals are to provide the patient and family with access to required services, to ensure coordination of these services, and to evaluate how effectively these services are delivered.

The reasons case management has gained such prominence can be traced to the decreased cost of care associated with decreased length of hospital stay, coupled with rapid and frequent interunit transfers from specialty to standard care units. The case manager role, instead of focusing on direct patient care, focuses on managing the care of an entire caseload of patients and collaborating with the nurses and other health care personnel who care for the patients. In most instances, the caseload is limited in scope to patients with similar diagnoses, needs, and therapies, and the case managers function across units. They are experts in their specialty areas and coordinate the inpatient and outpatient services needed by patients. The goals of this coordination include quality, appropriateness, and timeliness of services as well as cost reduction. The case manager follows the patient throughout hospitalization and at home after discharge in an effort to promote coordination of health care services that will avert or delay rehospitalization. Evidence-based pathways or similar plans are often used in care management of similar patient populations.

\section*{Health Maintenance Organizations}

HMOs are prepaid, group health practice systems designed to deliver comprehensive health care services to a defined group of voluntarily enrolled individuals. Members pay premiums as well as designated copayments for services and medications. Individuals receive care from a preselected group of physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), or other care provider members of the HMO, although some programs allow selection of outside providers for a higher fee. HMOs are based on the holistic concept of care. They provide outpatient (ambulatory) and preventive teaching and health care, as well as inpatient care that meets the health care needs of the whole person. The goal of HMOs is to give comprehensive health care that is of the best quality and quantity
for the money available, while eliminating fragmentation and duplication of services. As HMOs have grown, they have expanded to include specialist services and programs for Medicare and Medicaid populations. Some studies show that HMOs are cost-effective and that the quality of care provided by these health care delivery systems is comparable to that provided elsewhere in the same communities. However, concerns have surfaced regarding the limitations on choice of health care provider, diagnostic testing, and length of hospitalization; high case loads; and problematic paperwork that might be imposed by some HMOs (Cesta \& Falter, 1999). To address these concerns, some employer and federal health insurance providers offer alternative plans to HMOs.

\section*{Preferred Provider Organizations}

HMOs have paved the way and served as the model for private fee-for-service (FFS) organizations that offer some choice to consumers. PPOs, point of service (POS) plans, provider service organizations (PSOs), Medicare+Choice plans, and coordinated care plans are some examples of variations on the HMO. These plans allow consumers, including Medicare beneficiaries, to choose their hospitals and physicians and allow providers to be reimbursed on an FFS basis.

In contrast to the HMO, the PPO, POS, or similar organization is not a distinct entity; rather, it is a business arrangement between a group of providers, usually hospitals and physicians, who contract to provide health care to subscribers, usually businesses, for a negotiated fee that often is discounted. Organizations like PPOs allow businesses to decrease their expenses for employee health care benefits, and hospitals and physicians to market their services to employers.

Some advanced practice nurses serve as preferred providers through nursing centers or in individual or joint practice. Advanced practice nurses provide health care delivery that is unique, client-based, and holistic. These nurses often provide care to vulnerable populations, allowing direct access to nursing services. In nursing centers, nurses provide the majority of services, control the budget, and function as chief executive officers. The role of many advanced practice nurses emphasizes primary care with collaborative, interdisciplinary models of practice.

\section*{Roles of the Nurse}

As stated earlier, nursing is the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to health and illness and therefore focuses on a broad array of phenomena. There are three major roles assumed by the nurse when caring for patients. These roles are often used in concert with one another to provide comprehensive care.

The professional nurse in institutional, community-based or public health, and home care settings has three major roles: the practitioner role, which includes teaching and collaborating; the leadership role; and the research role. Although each role carries specific responsibilities, these roles relate to one another and are found in all nursing positions. These roles are designed to meet the immediate and future health care and nursing needs of consumers who are the recipients of nursing care.

\section*{PRACTITIONER ROLE}

The practitioner role of the nurse involves those actions that the nurse takes when assuming responsibility for meeting the health care and nursing needs of individual patients, their families, and
significant others. This role is the dominant role of nurses in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care settings and in home care and community nursing. It is a role that can be achieved only through use of the nursing process, the basis for all nursing practice. The nurse helps patients meet their needs through direct intervention, by teaching patients and family members to perform care, and by coordinating and collaborating with other disciplines to provide needed services.

\section*{LEADERSHIP ROLE}

The leadership role of the nurse has traditionally been perceived as a specialized role assumed only by those nurses who have titles that suggest leadership and who are the leaders of large groups of nurses or related health care professionals. However, the constant fluctuation of health care delivery demands and consumers requires a broader definition of nursing leadership, one that identifies the leadership role as inherent within all nursing positions. The leadership role of the nurse involves those actions the nurse executes when assuming responsibility for the actions of others that are directed toward determining and achieving patient care goals.

Nursing leadership is a process involving four components: decision making, relating, influencing, and facilitating. Each of these components promotes change and the ultimate outcome of goal achievement. Basic to the entire process is effective communication, which determines the accomplishment of the process. Leadership in nursing is a process in which the nurse uses interpersonal skills to effect change in the behavior of others. The components of the leadership process are appropriate during all phases of the nursing process and in all settings.

\section*{RESEARCH ROLE}

The research role of the nurse was traditionally viewed as one carried out only by academicians, nurse scientists, and graduate nursing students. Today, participation in the research process is also considered to be a responsibility of nurses in clinical practice.

The primary task of nursing research is to contribute to the scientific base of nursing practice. Studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions and nursing care. Through such research efforts, the science of nursing will grow and a scientifically based rationale for making changes in nursing practice and patient care will be generated. Evidence-based practice will be facilitated, with a resultant increase in the quality of patient care.

Nurses who have preparation in research methods can use their research knowledge and skills to initiate and implement timely, relevant studies. This is not to say that nurses who do not initiate and implement nursing research studies do not play a significant role in nursing research. Every nurse has valuable contributions to make to nursing research and a responsibility to make these contributions. All nurses must constantly be alert for nursing problems and important issues related to patient care that can serve as a basis for the identification of researchable questions.

Those nurses directly involved in patient care are often in the best position to identify potential research problems and questions. Their clinical insights are invaluable. Nurses also have a responsibility to become actively involved in ongoing research studies. This participation may involve facilitating the data collection process, or it may include actual collection of data. Explaining the study to other health care professionals or to patients
and their families is often of invaluable assistance to the nurse who is conducting the study.

Above all, nurses must use research findings in their nursing practice. Research for the sake of research alone is meaningless. As stated previously, evidence-based practice requires the inclusion of valid research. Only with the use and evaluation of research findings in nursing practice will the science of nursing be furthered. Research findings can be substantiated only through use, validation, replication, and dissemination. Nurses must continually be aware of studies that are directly related to their own area of clinical practice and critically analyze those studies to determine the applicability of their conclusions and the implications for specific patient populations. Relevant conclusions and implications can be used to improve patient care.

\section*{Models of Nursing Care Delivery}

Nursing care can be carried out through a variety of organizational methods. The model of nursing care used varies greatly from one facility to another and from one set of patient circumstances to another. A review of past and current models provides a background for understanding the nursing models and methods needed for today's changing health care delivery system.

\section*{TEAM NURSING}

Team nursing, which had its origins in the 1950s and 1960s, involved use of a team leader and team members to provide various aspects of nursing care to a group of patients. In team nursing, medications might be given by one nurse while baths and physical care are given by a nursing assistant under the supervision of a nurse team leader. Skill mixes include registered nurses (RNs), often as team leaders; licensed practical nurses; and nursing assistants or unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP). With the current emphasis on cost containment in health care agencies, variations of team nursing are being used, and UAPs are increasingly being included as team members. There has been little substantiation, however, that team nursing is cost-effective. The quality of patient care with this system is questionable, and fragmentation of care is of concern.

\section*{PRIMARY NURSING}

Primary nursing (not to be confused with primary health care, which pertains to first-contact general health care) refers to comprehensive, individualized care provided by the same nurse throughout the period of care. This type of nursing care allows the nurse to give direct patient care rather than manage and supervise the functions of others who provide direct care for the patient. This care method is rejected by many institutions as too costly; the patient-nurse ratio is small, and a larger professional staff is needed, because the primary nurse is usually an RN. However, primary nursing may provide a foundation for transition to case management in some institutions.

The primary nurse accepts total 24 -hour responsibility for a patient's nursing care. Nursing care is directed toward meeting all of the individualized patient needs. The primary nurse is responsible and accountable for involving the patient and family directly in all facets of care and has autonomy in making decisions in this regard. The primary nurse communicates with other members of the health care team regarding the patient's health care. This process promotes continuity of care and collaborative efforts directed toward quality patient care.

During times when the primary nurse is not scheduled to work, an associate nurse or co-nurse assists in overseeing the delivery of care. The associate nurse implements the nursing plan of care and provides feedback to the primary nurse for evaluating the plan of care. The primary nurse assumes responsibility for making appropriate referrals and for ensuring that all relevant information is provided to those who will be involved in the patient's continuing care, including the family.

The long-term survival of primary nursing as it is currently designed is uncertain. As cost-containment measures continue and patient acuity increases, staffing ratios of patients to nurses are increasing. Many nursing service departments and agencies are meeting the increased workload demands by making modifications in their approach to primary nursing or by reverting to team or functional systems for delivering care. Others are changing their staffing mix and redesigning their models of practice to accommodate nurse-extender roles. Still others are changing to more innovative systems such as case management.

\section*{COMMUNITY-BASED NURSING AND COMMUNITY HEALTHPUBLIC HEALTH NURSING}

Community-based care and community health-public health (CH-PH) nursing are not new concepts for nursing. Nursing has played a vital role in the community since the middle to late 1800s, as visiting nurses provided care to the sick and poor in their homes and communities and educated patients and family members. Although community health (CH) nursing, public health (PH) nursing, community-based nursing, and home health nursing may be discussed together and aspects of care in each type do overlap, there are distinctions among these terms. Confusion exists regarding the differences, and the similar settings may blur these distinctions (Hunt, 2000; Kovner, 2001). The central idea of $\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{PH}$ nursing is that nursing intervention can promote wellness, reduce the spread of illness, and improve the health status of groups of citizens. CH-PH nursing practice is concerned with the general and comprehensive care of the community at large, with emphasis on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Nurses in these settings have traditionally focused on health promotion, maternal and child health, and chronic care.

Community-based nursing occurs in a variety of settings within the community and is directed toward individuals and families (Hunt, 2000). It includes home health care nursing. Most community-based and home health care is directed toward specific patient groups with identified needs; these needs usually relate to illness, injury, or disability resulting most often from advanced age or chronic illness. However, both community-based and CH-PH nurses are now expanding to meet the needs of many groups of patients with a variety of problems and needs. Home health care will be a major aspect of community-based care discussed throughout this text. Home health care services are provided by communitybased programs and agencies for specific populations (eg, the elderly, ventilator-dependent patients), as well as by hospital-based home health care agencies, hospices, independent professional nursing practices, and freestanding health care agencies.

As trends continue toward shortened hospital stays and increased use of outpatient health care services, the need for nursing care in the home and community setting has increased dramatically. Because nursing services are being provided outside as well as within the hospital, nurses have a choice of practicing in a variety of health care delivery settings. These settings include acute care medical centers, ambulatory care settings, clinics, urgent care centers, outpatient departments, neighborhood health
centers, home health care agencies, independent or group nursing centers, and managed care agencies.

Community nursing centers, which have emerged over the past two decades with the advent of NPs, are nurse managed and provide primary care services that include ambulatory and outpatient care, immunizations, health assessment and screening services, and patient and family education and counseling. The populations that these centers serve are varied, but most typically they include a high proportion of patients who are rural, very young, very old, poor, or members of racial minorities-groups that are generally underserved.

The numbers and kinds of agencies that provide care in the home and community have expanded because of the expanding needs of patients requiring care. Home health care nurses are challenged because patients are discharged from acute care institutions to their homes and communities early in the recovery process and with more complex needs. Many are elderly, and many have multiple medical and nursing diagnoses and multisystem health problems that require acute and intensive nursing care. Medical technologies such as ventilatory support and intravenous or parenteral nutrition therapy, once limited to acute care settings, have been adapted to the home care setting.

As a result, the community-based care setting is becoming one of the largest practice areas for nursing. Home care nursing is now a specialty area that requires advanced knowledge and skills in general nursing practice, with emphasis on community health and acute medical-surgical nursing. Also required are high-level assessment skills, critical thinking, and decision-making skills in a setting where other health care professionals are not available to validate observations, conclusions, and decisions.

Home care nurses often function as acute care nurses in the home, providing "high-tech, high-touch" services to patients with acute health care needs. In addition, they are responsible for patient and family teaching and for contacting community resources and coordinating the continuing care of the patient. For these reasons, the scope of medical-surgical nursing encompasses not only the acute care setting within the hospital but also the acute care setting as it expands into the community and the home. Throughout this textbook, emphasis is placed on the home health care needs of patients, with particular attention given to the teaching, self-care management, and health maintenance needs of patients and their families.

\section*{Expanded Nursing Roles}

Professional nursing is adapting to meet changing health needs and expectations. One such adaptation is through the expanded role of the nurse, which has developed in response to the need to improve the distribution of health care services and to decrease the cost of health care. NPs, clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), certified nurse-midwives, and certified registered nurse anesthetists are identified as advanced practice nurses. The nurse who functions in an advanced practice role provides direct care to patients through independent practice, practice within a health care agency, or collaboration with a physician. Specialization has evolved within the expanded roles of nursing as a result of the recent explosion of technology and knowledge.

Nurses may receive advanced education in such specialties as family, critical care, coronary care, respiratory care, oncologic care, maternal and child health care, neonatal intensive care, rehabilitation, trauma, rural health, and gerontologic nursing, to name just a few. With the expanded role of the nurse, various titles have emerged that attempt to specify the functions as well as the educational preparation of nurses, although functions are less distinct
than in previous years. In medical-surgical nursing, the most significant of these titles are nurse practitioner and clinical nurse specialist, and the more recent title of advanced practice nurse, which encompasses both NPs and CNSs.

Initially the educational preparation for NPs was in certificate programs. Most states now require both NPs and CNSs to have a graduate-level education. The two programs, which originally differed significantly in scope and in their definition of role components, now have many similarities and areas of overlap.

NPs are, for the most part, prepared as generalists (eg, pediatric NP, geriatric NP). They define their role in terms of direct provision of a broad range of primary health care services to patients and families. The focus is on providing primary health care to patients and collaborating with other health professionals. NPs practice in both acute and nonacute care settings. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act provided for NPs to receive direct Medicare reimbursement. In addition, in some states-and with new legislation possibly nationwide-NPs have prescriptive authority (Boyd, 2000).

CNSs, on the other hand, are prepared as specialists who practice within a circumscribed area of care (eg, cardiovascular CNS, oncology CNS). They define their role as having five major components: clinical practice, education, management, consultation, and research. Studies have shown that in reality the CNS focus is often on the education and consultation roles: education and counseling of patients and families and education, counseling, and consultation with nursing staff. Some states have granted CNSs prescriptive authority if they have the required educational preparation. CNSs practice in a variety of settings, including the community and the home, although most practice in acute care settings. Recently, CNSs have been identified by many nursing leaders as ideal case managers. They have the educational background and the clinical expertise to organize and coordinate services and resources to meet the patient's health care needs in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

With advanced practice roles has come a continuing effort by professional nursing organizations to define more clearly the practice of nursing. Nurse practice acts have been amended to give nurses the authority to perform functions that were previously restricted to the practice of medicine. These functions include diagnosis (nursing), treatment, performance of selected invasive procedures, and prescription of medications and treatments. The board of nursing in each state stipulates regulations regarding these functions. The board defines the education and experience required and determines the clinical situations in which a nurse may perform these functions.

In general, initial care, ambulatory health care, and anticipatory guidance are all becoming increasingly important in nursing practice. Advanced practice roles enable nurses to function interdependently with other health care professionals and to establish a more collegial relationship with physicians. As changes in health care continue, the role of advanced practice nurses, especially in primary care settings, is expected to increase in terms of scope, responsibility, and recognition.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE}

Throughout this chapter we have explored the changing role of nursing. Many references have been made to the significance of the nurse as a member of the health care team. As the unique competencies of nurses are becoming more clearly articulated, there is increasing evidence that nurses provide certain health care services distinct to the profession. However, nursing continues to recognize the importance of collaboration with other health care disciplines in meeting the needs of patients.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 1-3 Collaborative practice model.}
\end{figure}

Some institutions use the collaborative practice model (Fig. 1-3). Nurses, physicians, and ancillary health personnel function within a decentralized organizational structure, collaboratively making clinical decisions. A joint practice committee, with representation from all care providers, may function at the unit level to monitor, support, and foster collaboration. Collaborative practice is further enhanced with integration of the clinical record and with joint patient care record reviews.

The collaborative model, or a variation of it, should be a primary goal for nursing-a venture that promotes shared participation, responsibility, and accountability in a health care environment that is striving to meet the complex health care needs of the public.

$T_{h}$he changes that have occurred in the health care system in the past two decades have increased the need for care in ambulatory settings and in the home. These changes have created a demand for highly skilled and well-prepared nurses to provide community-based care.

\section*{The Growing Need for Community-Based Health Care}

As described in Chapter 1, the shift in the settings for health care delivery is a result of changes in federal legislation, tighter insurance regulations, decreasing hospital revenues, and the development of alternative health care delivery systems. As a result of federal legislation passed in 1983 and 1997, hospitals and other health care providers are now reimbursed at a fixed rate for patients with the same diagnosis as defined by diagnosis-related groups. Under this system, hospitals and other health care providers can cut costs and earn income by carefully monitoring the types of services they provide and discharging patients as soon as possible. Consequently, patients are being discharged from acute care facilities to their homes or to residential or long-term facilities at much earlier stages of recovery than in the past. Complex technical equipment, such as dialysis machinery, intravenous lines, and ventilators, is often part of home health care (Brown, 2000).

Alternative health care delivery systems, such as health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and managed health care systems, have also contributed to the drive to control costs and the availability of health care services. These regulations have dramatically reduced the length of hospital stay and have led to patients being treated more frequently in ambulatory care settings and at home. Chapter 1 provides a more thorough discussion of alternative health care delivery systems.

As more health care delivery shifts into the community, more nurses are working in a variety of public health and communitybased settings. These settings include public health departments, ambulatory health clinics, long-term care facilities, prenatal and well-baby clinics, hospice agencies, industrial settings (as occupational nurses), homeless shelters and clinics, nursing centers, home health agencies, urgent care centers, same day surgical centers, short-stay facilities, and patients' homes.

Nurses in these settings often deliver care without direct onsite supervision or the support of other health care personnel. They must be self-directed, flexible, adaptable, and tolerant of various lifestyles and living conditions. Expertise in independent decision making, critical thinking, assessment, and health education, and competence in basic nursing care are essential to function effectively in the community-based setting (Brown, 2000; Pierson, 1999).

Community-based nursing is a philosophy of care of individuals and families. The care is provided in a community as the individual or family move among various kinds of service providers outside of hospitals (Hunt, 2000). Although the phrase "community-based nursing" is often interchanged with "community health nursing," a distinction should be made. The phrase "community health nursing" has generally been equated to "public health nursing." Public health nursing is a specialty focused on total populations, although care may be given to individuals. Community-based nursing is broader and may incorporate community health-public health nursing; it is focused on individuals and families rather than total populations. Community-based nursing also includes home health nursing, school health nurs-

ing, and a host of other nursing services provided to individuals and groups in the community (Fig. 2-1).

\section*{COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Community-based nursing practice focuses on promoting and maintaining the health of individuals and groups, preventing and minimizing the progression of disease, and improving quality of life (Hunt, 2000). Although nursing interventions used by public health nurses may involve individuals, families, or small groups, the central focus remains promotion of health and prevention of disease in the entire community. The actions of community health nurses may include provision of direct care to patients and families as well as political advocacy to secure resources for aggregate populations (eg, the aged population). The community health nurse may function as an epidemiologist, a case manager for a group of patients, a coordinator of services provided to an aggregate of patients, an occupational health nurse, a school nurse, a visiting nurse, or a parish nurse. (In parish nursing, the members of the religious community-the parish-are the recipients of care.) The commonality of these various roles is that the nurse maintains a focus on community needs as well as on the needs of the individual patient. Community-based care is generally focused on the individual or family; although efforts may be undertaken to improve the health of the whole community, the individual or family unit is the main focus. The primary concepts of community-based nursing care are self-care and preventive care within the context of culture and community. Two other important concepts are continuity of care and collaboration (Hunt, 2000). Some community-based nursing fields have become specialties in their own right, such as school health nursing and home health nursing.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of preventive care are used by nurses in community-based practice. The focus of primary prevention is on health promotion and prevention of illness or disease, including interventions such as teaching regarding healthy lifestyles (Hunt, 2000). Secondary prevention centers on health maintenance and is aimed at early detection and prompt intervention to prevent or minimize loss of function and independence; it includes interventions such as health screening and health risk appraisal. Tertiary prevention focuses on minimizing deterioration and improving quality of life. Tertiary care may include rehabilitation to assist patients in achieving their maximum potential by working through their physical or psychological challenges (Hunt, 2000).

\section*{HOME HEALTH CARE}

Home health care is becoming one of the largest practice areas for nurses. Because of the high acuity level of patients, nurses with acute care and high-technology experience are in demand in this field. Tertiary preventive nursing care, which focuses on rehabilitation and restoring maximum health function, is a major goal for home care nurses, although primary and secondary prevention are also included in care. Health care visits may be intermittent or periodic, and telephonic case management may be used to promote communication with home care consumers.

Home care nursing is a unique aspect of community-based nursing. Home care visits are made by nurses who work for home care agencies, public health agencies, and visiting nurse associations; by nurses who are employed by hospitals; and by parish nurses who voluntarily work with the members of their religious communities to promote health. Such visits may also be part of the responsibilities of school nurses, clinic nurses, or occupational health nurses. The type of nursing services provided to patients in their homes varies from agency to agency. Nurses working for home care or hospice agencies make home visits to provide skilled nursing care, follow-up care, and teaching to promote health and prevent complications. Clinic nurses may conduct home visits as part of patient follow-up. Public health, parish, and school nurses may make visits to provide anticipatory guidance to high-risk families and follow-up care to patients with communicable diseases. Many home care patients are acutely ill, and many have chronic health problems and disabilities, requiring nurses to provide more education and monitoring to the patient and family to facilitate compliance.

Holistic care is provided in the home through the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team that includes professional nurses; home health aides; social workers; physical, speech, and occupational therapists; and the physician (Touchard \& Berthelot, 1999). The team provides health and social services with oversight of the total health care plan by a case manager, clinical nurse specialist, or nurse practitioner. Parish nurses may work to provide home care training to members of their congregations.

Health care services are provided by official, publicly funded agencies; nonprofit agencies; private businesses; proprietary chains; and hospital-based agencies. Some agencies specialize in high-technology services. Most agencies are reimbursed from a variety of sources, including Medicare and Medicaid programs, private insurance, and direct payments by patients. Each funding source has its own requirements for services rendered, number of visits allowed, and amount of reimbursement the agency will receive. Many home health care expenditures are financed by Medicare and are affected by provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

The elderly are the most frequent users of home care services. To be eligible for service, the patient must be acutely ill, homebound, and in need of skilled nursing services. Nursing care includes skilled assessment of the patient's physical, psychological, social, and environmental status. Nursing interventions may include intravenous therapy and injections (Fig. 2-2), parenteral nutrition, venipuncture, catheter insertion, pressure ulcer treatment, wound care, ostomy care, and patient and family teaching. The nurse instructs the patient and family in skills and self-care strategies and in health maintenance and promotion activities (eg, nutritional counseling, exercise programs, stress management).

Medicare allows nurses to manage and evaluate patient care for seriously ill patients who have complex, labile conditions and are at high risk for rehospitalization. The nurse serves as a case

manager and monitors the delivery of care provided to patients in their homes.

\section*{Hospital and Community-Based Nursing}

Providing nursing care in a patient's home is different from providing care in a hospital. Patients must sign a release form to stay and receive treatment in a hospital. They have little control over what happens to them, and they are expected to comply with the hospital's rules, regulations, and schedule of activities. They sleep in the hospital's beds and often wear hospital gowns or clothes. They are given care, treatments, baths, and medications at times that are usually determined by institutional schedules rather than convenience for the patient. Although hospitalized patients may select meals from a daily menu, there is a limited choice in the type of food they are offered. Family members and friends visit during the hospital's visiting hours.

By contrast, the home care nurse is considered a guest in the patient's home and needs permission to visit and give care. The nurse has minimal control over the lifestyle, living situation, and health practices of the patients he or she visits. This lack of full decision-making authority can create a conflict for the nurse and lead to problems in the nurse-patient relationship. To work successfully with patients, no matter what the setting, it is important for the nurse to be nonjudgmental and to convey respect for the patient's beliefs, even if they differ sharply from the nurse's. This can be difficult when a patient's lifestyle involves activities that the nurse considers harmful or unacceptable, such as smoking, use of alcohol, drug abuse, or overeating.

The cleanliness of a patient's home may not meet the standards of a hospital. Although the nurse can provide teaching points about maintaining clean surroundings, the patient and family determine whether they will implement the nurse's suggestions. The nurse must accept the reality of the situation and deliver the care required regardless of the sanitary conditions of the surroundings.

The kind of equipment and the supplies or resources that usually are available in acute care settings are often unavailable in the patient's home. The nurse has to learn to improvise when providing care, such as when changing a dressing or catheterizing a patient in a regular bed that is not adjustable and lacks a bedside table (Johnson, Smith-Temple, \& Carr, 1998).

Infection control is as important in the home as it is in the hospital, but it can be more challenging and requires creative approaches. As in any situation, it is important to cleanse one's hands before and after giving direct patient care, even in a home that does not have running water. If aseptic technique is required, the nurse must have a plan for implementing this technique before going to the home. This applies also to standard precautions, transmission-based precautions, and disposal of bodily secretions and excretions.

If injections are given, the nurse should use a closed container to dispose of syringes. Injectable and other medications must be kept out of the reach of children during visits and must be stored in a safe place if they are to remain in the house. Nurses who perform invasive procedures need to be up-to-date with their immunizations, including hepatitis B and tetanus.

The home environment often has more distractions than a hospital. The home can be filled with background noise and crowded with people and objects. A nurse may have to request that the television be turned down during the visit or that the patient move to a more private place to be interviewed.

Friends, neighbors, or family members may ask the nurse about the patient's condition. A patient has a right to confidentiality, and information should be shared only with the patient's permission. If the nurse carries the patient's medical record into the house, it must be put in a secure place to prevent it from being picked up by others or misplaced.

\section*{Discharge Planning for Home Care}

To prepare for early hospital discharge and the possible need for follow-up care in the home, discharge planning begins with the patient's admission. Several different personnel or agencies may be involved in the planning process. In hospitals, social workers or nurses may serve as the discharge planners. Some home care agencies have liaison nurses who work with discharge planners to ensure that the patient's needs are met when he or she is released from the hospital. Professionals in ambulatory health care settings may refer patients for home care services to prevent hospitalization. Public health nurses care for patients referred for anticipatory guidance with high-risk families, for case finding, and for follow-up treatment (eg, patients with communicable diseases). Parish nurses may have patients referred, or they may be contacted directly by members of the parish community who need guidance or referrals related to physical or psychosocial health care concerns (Palmer, 2001).

The development of a comprehensive discharge plan requires collaboration with professionals at both the referring agency and the home care agency, public health agency, or other community resource. The process involves identifying the patient's needs and developing a thorough plan to meet them. Communication with and cooperation of the patient and family are essential.

\section*{Community Resources and Referrals}

Home health nurses and public health nurses act as case managers. After assessing the patient's needs, they may make referrals to other team members, such as home health aides and social workers. They work collaboratively with the health team and the agency or person who referred the patient for service. Continuous coordinated care among all health care providers involved in the patient's care is essential to avoid duplication of effort by the various personnel caring for the patient.

Home care and public health nurses are responsible for providing the patient and family with information about other community resources that are available to meet their needs. During the initial and subsequent visits, they help patients identify these community services and encourage the patient and family to contact the appropriate agencies. When appropriate, the nurse makes the initial contact (Pierson, 1999).

A community-based nurse needs to be knowledgeable about community resources available to patients as well as services provided by local agencies, eligibility requirements, and any possible charges for the services. Most communities have directories of health and social service agencies that the nurse can consult. These directories need to be continually updated as resources change. If a community does not have a resource booklet, the agency may develop one for its staff. It should include the commonly used community resources that patients need, the costs of the services, and eligibility requirements. The patient's place of worship or parish may serve as an important resource for services. The telephone book is often a useful resource for helping patients identify the locations of grocery and drug stores, banks, health care facilities, ambulances, physicians, dentists, pharmacists, social service agencies, and senior citizens programs.

\section*{Preparing for a HomeVisit}

Most agencies have a policy manual that states their philosophy and procedures and defines the services they provide. Becoming familiar with these policies is an essential step before initiating a home visit. It is also important to know the agency's policies and the state law regarding what actions to take if the nurse finds a patient dead, encounters an abusive situation in the family, or determines that a patient cannot safely remain at home.

Before making a home visit, the nurse should review the patient's referral form and other pertinent data concerning the patient. It may be necessary to contact the referring agency if the purpose for the referral is unclear or if important information is missing.

The first step is to call the patient to obtain permission to visit, schedule a time for the visit, and verify the address. This initial phone conversation provides an opportunity to introduce oneself, identify the agency, and explain the reason for the visit.

If a patient does not have a telephone, the nurse should see whether those who made the referral have a number where a phone message can be left for the patient. If an unannounced visit must be made to a patient's home, the nurse should ask permission to come in before entering the house. Explaining the purpose of the referral at the outset and setting up the times for future visits before leaving are also recommended approaches.

Most agencies provide nurses with bags that contain standard supplies and equipment needed during home visits. It is important to keep the bag properly supplied and to bring any additional items that might be needed for the visit. Patients usually do not have the medical supplies they need for treatment.

\section*{Conducting a Home Visit}

\section*{PERSONAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS}

Whenever a nurse makes a home visit, the agency should know the nurse's schedule and the locations of the visits. The nurse should learn about the neighborhood and obtain directions for reaching the expected destination. A plan of action should always be established in case of emergencies.

Nurses are not expected to disregard their personal safety in an effort to make or complete home visits. If nurses encounter dangerous situations during visits, they should return to their agencies and contact their supervisors or law enforcement officials, or both. Suggested precautions to take when making a home visit are presented in Chart 2-1.

\section*{INITIAL HOME VISIT}

The first visit sets the tone for subsequent visits and is a crucial step in establishing the nurse-patient relationship. The situations encountered can vary depending on numerous factors. Patients may be in pain and unable to care for themselves. Families may be overwhelmed and doubt their ability to care for their loved one. They may not understand why the patient was sent home from the hospital before being totally rehabilitated. They may not comprehend what home care is or why they cannot have 24 -hour nursing services. It is critical that the nurse try to convey an understanding of what the patient and family are experiencing and how the illness is affecting their lives.

During the initial home visit, which usually lasts less than an hour, the patient is evaluated and a plan of care is established to be followed or modified on subsequent visits. The nurse informs the patient of the agency's practices, policies, and hours of operation. If the agency is to be reimbursed for the visit, the nurse asks for insurance information, such as a Medicare or Medicaid card.

\section*{Safety Precautions in Home Health Care}
- Learn, or preprogram a cellular phone with the telephone numbers of the agency, police, and emergency services.
- Let the agency know your daily schedule and the telephone numbers of your patients so that you can be located if you do not return when expected.
- Know where the patient lives before leaving to make the visit and carry a map for quick referral.
- Keep your car in good working order and have sufficient gas in the tank.
- Park the car near the patient's home and lock it during the visit.
- Do not drive an expensive car or wear expensive jewelry when making visits.
- Know the regular bus schedule and know the routes when using public transportation or walking to the patient's house.
- Carry agency identification and have enough change to make telephone calls in case you get lost or have problems. Most agencies provide cellular phones for their nurses so that the agency can contact the nurse, and so that the nurse can contact the agency in case of an emergency or unexpected situation.
- When making visits in high-crime areas, visit with another person rather than alone.
- Schedule visits only during daylight hours.
- Never walk into a patient's home uninvited.
- If you do not feel safe entering a patient's home, leave the area.
- Become familiar with the layout of the house, including exits from the house.
- If a patient or family member is intoxicated, hostile, or obnoxious, reschedule the visit and leave.
- If a family is having a serious argument or abusing the patient or anyone else in the household, reschedule the visit, contact your supervisor, and report the abuse to the appropriate authorities.

The initial assessment includes evaluating the patient, the home environment, the patient's self-care abilities or the family's ability to provide care, and the patient's need for additional resources. Identifying possible hazards, such as cluttered walk areas, potential fire risks, air or water pollution, or inadequate sanitation facilities, is also part of the initial assessment.

Documentation considerations for home visits follow fairly specific regulations. The patient's needs and the nursing care given are documented accurately to ensure that the agency will qualify for payment for the visit. Medicare, Medicaid, and thirdparty payers require documentation of the patient's homebound status and the need for skilled professional nursing care. The medical diagnosis and specific detailed information on the functional limitations of the patient are usually part of the documentation. The goals and the actions appropriate for attaining them need to be identified. Expected outcomes of the nursing interventions must be stated in terms of patient behaviors and must be realistic and measurable. They must reflect the nursing diagnosis or the patient's problems and must specify those actions that are expected to solve the patient's problems. If the documentation is not done correctly, the agency may not be paid for the visit.

\section*{DETERMINING THE NEED FOR FUTURE VISITS}

While conducting an assessment of the patient's situation, the nurse evaluates the need for future visits and the frequency with which those visits may need to be made. To make these judgments, the nurse may find it helpful to consider the following factors:
- Current health status: How well is the patient progressing? How serious are the present signs and symptoms? Has the patient shown signs of progressing as expected, or does it seem that recovery will be delayed?
- Home environment: Are worrisome safety factors apparent? Are family or friends available to provide care, or is the patient alone?
- Level of self-care abilities: Is the patient capable of self-care? What is the patient's level of independence? Is the patient ambulatory or bedridden? Does the patient have sufficient energy or is he or she frail and easily fatigued?
- Level of nursing care needed: What level of nursing care does the patient require? Does the care require basic skills or more complex interventions?
- Prognosis: What is the expectation for recovery in this particular instance? What are the chances that complications may develop if nursing care is not provided?
- Patient education needs: How well has the patient or family grasped the teaching points made? Is there a need for further follow-up and retraining? What level of proficiency does the patient or family show in carrying out the necessary care?
- Mental status: How alert is the patient? Are there signs of confusion or thinking difficulties? Does the patient tend to be forgetful or have a limited attention span?
- Level of adherence: Is the patient following the instructions provided? Does the patient seem capable of doing so? Are the family members helpful in this regard, or are they unwilling or unable to assist in caring for the patient as expected?

With each subsequent visit, these same factors are evaluated to determine the continuing health needs of the patient. As progress is made and the patient, with or without the help of significant others, becomes more capable of self-care and more independent, the need for home visits may decline.

\section*{CLOSING THE VISIT}

As the visit comes to a close, it is important to summarize the main points of the visit for the patient and family and to identify expectations for future visits or patient achievements. The following points should be considered at the end of each visit:
- What are the main points the patient or family should remember from the visit?
- What positive attributes have been noted about the patient and the family that will give them a sense of accomplishment?
- What were the main points of the teaching plan or the treatments needed to ensure that the patient and family understand what they must do? A written set of instructions should be left with the patient or family, provided they can read and see (alternative formats include video or audio recordings). Printed material should be in the patient's primary language and in large print when indicated.
- Whom should the patient or family call in case they need to contact someone immediately? Are current emergency telephone numbers readily available? Is telephone service available or can an emergency cell phone service be provided?
-What signs of complications should be reported immediately?
- What is the day and time of the next visit? Will a different nurse make the visit? How frequently will visits be made, and for how long (if determinable at this time)?

\section*{Other Community-Based Health Care Settings}

\section*{AMBULATORY SETTINGS}

Ambulatory health care is provided for patients in community or hospital-based settings. The types of agencies that provide ambulatory health care are medical clinics, ambulatory care units, urgent care centers, cardiac rehabilitation programs, mental health centers, student health centers, community outreach programs, and nursing centers. Some ambulatory centers provide care to a specific population, such as migrant workers or Native Americans. Neighborhood health centers provide services to patients who live in a geographically defined area. The centers may operate in freestanding buildings, storefronts, or mobile units. Agencies may provide ambulatory health care in addition to other services, such as offering an adult day care or health program. The kinds of services offered and the patients served depend on the agency's mission.

Nursing responsibilities in ambulatory health care settings include providing direct patient care, conducting patient intake screenings, treating patients with acute or chronic illnesses or emergency conditions, referring patients to other agencies for additional services, teaching patients self-care activities, and offering health education programs that promote health maintenance. A useful tool for the community-based nurse might be the classification scheme developed by the Visiting Nurses Association of Omaha, which contains patient-focused problems that are in one of four domains: environmental, psychosocial, physiologic, and health-related behaviors (Cookfair, 1996).

Nurses also work as clinic managers, direct the operation of clinics, and supervise other health team members. Nurse practitioners, educated in primary care, often practice in ambulatory care settings with a focus on gerontology, pediatrics, family or adult health, or women's health. Constraints imposed by federal legislation and ambulatory payment classifications (APCs) require efficient and effective management of patients in ambulatory settings. Nurses can play an important part in facilitating the function of the ambulatory care facility.

\section*{OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAMS}

Federal legislation, especially the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), has had a major impact on health conditions in the workplace. The law is directed at creating safer and healthier work conditions. It is in an employer's interest to try to provide a safe working environment, because the result is reduced costs associated with employee absenteeism, hospitalization, and disability.

Occupational nurses may work in solo units in an industrial setting, or they may serve as consultants on a limited or part-time basis. They may also be members of an interdisciplinary team composed of a variety of health care workers such as nurses, physicians, exercise physiologists, health educators, counselors, nutritionists, safety engineers, and industrial hygienists. The occupational health nurse functions in several ways and may provide direct care to employees who become ill or injured, conduct health education programs for company staff members, or set up health programs aimed at establishing specific health behaviors, such as eating properly and getting enough exercise. The nurse must also be knowledgeable about federal regulations pertaining to occupational health and familiar with other pertinent legislation, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. The occupational health nurse may monitor employees' hearing, vision, blood pressure, or blood glucose levels (Capriotti, Kirby, \& Smeltzer, 2000). Exposures to radiation, infectious diseases, and toxic substances are also tracked and reported to government agencies as required.

\section*{SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAMS}

School health programs provide valuable services for students and may also serve the school's community. School-age children and adolescents with health problems are at major risk for underachieving or failing in school. The leading health problems of elementary-school children are injuries, infections (including influenza and pneumonia), malnutrition, dental disease, and cancer. The leading problems for high-school students are alcohol and drug abuse, injuries, homicide, pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, sports injuries, dental disease, and mental and emotional problems. Ideally, school health programs have an interdisciplinary health team consisting of physicians, nurses, dentists, social workers, counselors, school administrators, parents, and students. The school may serve as the site for a family health clinic that offers primary health and mental health services to children and adolescents as well as to all family members in the community. Many school nurses have baccalaureate degrees, and advanced practice nurses are ideally suited to provide the primary care in these settings. Some school nurse programs provide community care. Physical examinations are performed by advanced practice nurses who then diagnose and treat students and families for acute and chronic illnesses. These clinics are cost-effective and are especially beneficial for students from low-income fami-
lies who lack access to traditional health care or have no health insurance.

The roles of the school nurse are care provider, health educator, consultant, and counselor. The school nurse collaborates with students, parents, administrators, and other health and social service professionals regarding a student's health problems. Nurses perform health screenings, give basic care for minor injuries and complaints, administer medications, monitor the immunization status of students and families, and identify children with health problems. They need to be knowledgeable about state and local regulations affecting school-age children, such as ordinances for excluding students from school because of communicable diseases or parasites such as lice or scabies.

The school nurse is also a health education consultant for teachers. In addition to providing information on health practices, teaching health classes, or participating in the development of the health education curriculum, the school nurse educates the teacher and class when one of the students has a special problem, a disability, or a disease such as hemophilia or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

\section*{CARE FOR THE HOMELESS}

No exact figures exist on the number of homeless people in the United States. Homelessness is a growing problem, and the homeless population includes increasing numbers of women with children (often victims of abuse) and elderly people. The homeless are a heterogeneous group, including members of dysfunctional families, the unemployed, and those who cannot find affordable housing. A large number of homeless persons, about $85 \%$, are chronically mentally ill or abuse alcohol or other drugs (Walker, 1998). Some are temporarily homeless as a result of catastrophic natural disasters.

The homeless often have difficulty affording or gaining access to health care. Because of numerous obstacles, they seek health care late in the course of a disease and deteriorate more quickly than other patients. Many of the health problems they experience are related in large part to their living situations. Street life exposes homeless persons to the extremes of hot and cold environments and compounds their health risks.

Homeless persons have high rates of trauma, tuberculosis, upper respiratory tract infections, poor nutrition and anemia, lice, scabies, peripheral vascular problems, sexually transmitted diseases, dental problems, arthritis, hypothermia, skin disorders, and foot problems. Common chronic health problems of the homeless include diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, AIDS, and mental illness. These problems are made more difficult by living on the street and by being discharged to a transitory, homeless situation in which follow-up is unlikely (Hunter, Crosby, Ventura, \& Warkentin, 1997; Walker, 1998). Homeless persons who live in shelters frequently encounter overcrowded, unventilated quarters that provide an ideal environment for the spread of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis.

Community-based nurses who work with the homeless must be nonjudgmental, patient, and understanding. They must be proficient in dealing with many different kinds of people who have a wide variety of health problems and needs. Nursing interventions are aimed at attempting to obtain health care services for the homeless and evaluating the health care needs of those who reside in the shelters.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Recall a difficult discharge planning situation in which you have been involved. Evaluate the effectiveness of the processes used to accomplish the goals. What changes could have been made that would have improved the processes and the outcomes?
2. A homeless young mother was referred for follow-up home care after discharge from the hospital. During the nurse's initial visit, to the homeless shelter, the patient's daughter asks how often visits will be made and for how long. What assessment criteria would you use to develop answers to these questions? What factors affect the patient's eligibility for home care services versus ambulatory health services?

\title{
Critical Thinking, Ethical Decision Making, and the Nursing Process
}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Define the characteristics of critical thinking and critical thinkers.
2. Describe the critical thinking process.
3. Define ethics and nursing ethics.
4. Identify several ethical dilemmas common to the medical-surgical area of nursing practice.
5. Specify strategies that can be helpful to nurses in ethical decision making.

7. Describe the nursing process.
8. Develop a plan of nursing care for a patient using strategies of critical thinking.

$I_{n}$n today's health care arena, the nurse is faced with increasingly complex issues and situations resulting from advanced technology, greater acuity of patients in hospital and community settings, an aging population, and complex disease processes, as well as ethical and cultural factors. Traditionally, nurses have used a problem-solving approach in planning and providing nursing care. Today the decision-making part of problem solving has become increasingly complex and requires critical thinking.

\section*{Definition of CriticalThinking}

Critical thinking is a multidimensional skill, a cognitive or mental process or set of procedures. It involves reasoning and purposeful, systematic, reflective, rational, outcome-directed thinking based on a body of knowledge, as well as examination and analysis of all available information and ideas. Critical thinking leads to the formulation of conclusions and the most appropriate, often creative, decisions, options, or alternatives (Ignatavicius, 2001; Prideaux, 2000).

Critical thinking includes metacognition, the examination of one's own reasoning or thought processes while thinking, to help strengthen and refine thinking skills (Wilkinson, 2001). Independent judgments and decisions evolve from a sound knowledge base and the ability to synthesize information within the context in which it is presented. Nursing practice in today's society mandates the use of high-level critical thinking skills within the nursing process. Critical thinking enhances clinical decision making, helping to identify patient needs and to determine the best nursing actions that will assist the patient in meeting those needs.

Critical thinking and critical thinkers have distinctive characteristics. As indicated in the above definition, critical thinking is a conscious, outcome-oriented activity; it is purposeful and intentional. The critical thinker is an inquisitive, fair-minded truthseeker with an open-mindedness to the alternative solutions that might surface.

\section*{CriticalThinking Process}

\section*{RATIONALITY AND INSIGHT}

Critical thinking is systematic and organized. The skills involved in critical thinking are developed over time through effort, practice, and experience. Skills needed in critical thinking include interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation (Ignatavicius, 2001). Critical thinking requires background knowledge and knowledge of key concepts as well as standards of good thinking (Prideaux, 2000). The critical thinker uses reality-based deliberation to validate the accuracy of data and the reliability of sources, being mindful of and questioning inconsistencies. Interpretation is used to determine the significance of data that are gathered, and analysis is used to identify patient problems indicated by the data. The nurse uses inference to draw conclusions. Explanation is the justification of actions or interventions used to address patient problems and to help a patient move toward desired outcomes. Evaluation is the process of determining whether outcomes have been or are being met, and self-regulation is the process of examining the care provided and adjusting the interventions as needed (Ignatavicius, 2001).

Critical thinking is also reflective, involving metacognition, active evaluation, and refinement of the thinking process. The critical thinker considers the possibility of personal bias when interpreting data and determining appropriate actions. The criti-
cal thinker must be insightful and have a sense of fairness and integrity, the courage to question personal ethics, and the perseverance to strive continuously to minimize the effects of egocentricity, ethnocentricity, and other biases on the decisionmaking process (Alfaro-LeFevre, 1999).

\section*{COMPONENTS OF CRITICAL THINKING}

Certain cognitive or mental activities can be identified as key components of critical thinking. When thinking critically, a person will do the following:
- Ask questions to determine the reason why certain developments have occurred and to see whether more information is needed to understand the situation accurately.
- Gather as much relevant information as possible to consider as many factors as possible.
- Validate the information presented to make sure that it is accurate (not just supposition or opinion), that it makes sense, and that it is based on fact and evidence.
- Analyze the information to determine what it means and to see whether it forms clusters or patterns that point to certain conclusions.
- Draw on past clinical experience and knowledge to explain what is happening and to anticipate what might happen next, acknowledging personal bias and cultural influences.
- Maintain a flexible attitude that allows the facts to guide thinking and takes into account all possibilities.
- Consider available options and examine each in terms of its advantages and disadvantages.
- Formulate decisions that reflect creativity and independent decision making.
Critical thinking requires going beyond basic problem solving into a realm of inquisitive exploration, looking for all relevant factors that affect the issue, and being an "out-of-the-box" thinker. It includes questioning all findings until a comprehensive picture emerges that explains the phenomenon, possible solutions, and creative methods for proceeding (Wilkinson, 2001). Critical thinking in nursing practice results in a comprehensive patient plan of care with maximized potential for success.

\section*{CRITICAL THINKING IN NURSING PRACTICE}

Using critical thinking to develop a plan of nursing care requires considering the human factors that might influence the plan. The nurse interacts with the patient, family, and other health care providers in the process of providing appropriate, individualized nursing care. The culture, attitude, and thought processes of the nurse, the patient, and others will affect the critical thinking process from the data-gathering stage through the decision-making stage; therefore, aspects of the nurse-patient interaction must be considered (Wilkinson, 2001). Nurses must use critical thinking skills in all practice settings-acute care, ambulatory care, extended care, and in the home and community. Regardless of the setting, each patient situation is viewed as unique and dynamic. The unique factors that the patient and nurse bring to the health care situation are considered, studied, analyzed, and interpreted. Interpretation of the information presented then allows the nurse to focus on those factors that are most relevant and most significant to the clinical situation. Decisions about what to do and how to do it are then developed into a plan of action.

Fonteyn (1998) identified 12 predominant thinking strategies used by nurses, regardless of their area of clinical practice:
- Recognizing a pattern
- Setting priorities
- Searching for information
- Generating hypotheses
- Making predictions
- Forming relationships
- Stating a proposition ("if-then")
- Asserting a practice rule
- Making choices (alternative actions)
- Judging the value
- Drawing conclusions
- Providing explanations

Fonteyn further identified other, less prominent thinking strategies the nurse might use:
- Pondering
- Posing a question
- Making assumptions (supposing)
- Qualifying
- Making generalizations

These thought processes are consistent with the characteristics of critical thinking and cognitive activities discussed earlier. Fonteyn asserted that exploring how these thinking strategies are used in various clinical situations, and practicing using the strategies, might assist the nurse-learner in examining and refining his or her own thinking skills.

Because developing the skill of critical thinking takes time and practice, critical thinking exercises are offered throughout this book as a means of practicing one's ability to think critically. Additional exercises can be found in the study guide that accompanies the text. The questions listed in Chart 3-1 can serve as a guide in working through the exercises, although it is important to remember that each situation is unique and calls for an approach that fits the particular circumstances being described.

\section*{Ethical Nursing Care}

In the complex modern world, we are surrounded by ethical issues in all facets of our lives. Consequently, there has been a heightened interest in the field of ethics, in an attempt to gain a better understanding of how these issues influence us. Specifically, in health care the focus on ethics has intensified in response to controversial developments, including advances in technology and genetics, as well as diminished health care and financial resources.

Today, sophisticated technology can prolong life well beyond the time when death would have occurred in the past. Expensive experimental procedures and medications are available for attempting to preserve life, even when such attempts are likely to fail. The development of technological support has had an influence on all stages of life. For example, the prenatal period has been influenced by genetic screening, in vitro fertilization, the harvesting and freezing of embryos, and prenatal surgery. In the early stages of life, premature infants are given a chance for survival by the use of technical support. Children and adults who would have died as a result of organ failure are living longer because of organ transplantation. Technological advances have also contributed to an increase in the average life expectancy. These advances in technology, however, have been a mixed blessing. Questions have been raised about whether, and under what circumstances, it is appropriate to use such technology. Although many individuals are afforded a better quality of life, others face

The Inquiring Mind: Critical Thinking in Action
Throughout the critical thinking process, a continuous flow of questions evolves in the thinker's mind. Although the questions will vary according to the particular clinical situation, certain general inquiries can serve as a basis for reaching conclusions and determining a course of action.

When faced with a patient situation, it is often helpful to seek answers to some or all of the following questions in an attempt to determine those actions that are most appropriate:
- What relevant assessment information do I need, and how do I interpret this information? What does this information tell me?
- To what problems does this information point? Have I identified the most important ones? Does the information point to any other problems that I should consider?
- Have I gathered all the information I need (signs/symptoms, laboratory values, medication history, emotional factors, mental status)? Is anything missing?
- Is there anything that needs to be reported immediately? Do I need to seek additional assistance?
- Does this patient have any special risk factors? Which ones are most significant? What must I do to minimize these risks?
- What possible complications must I anticipate?
- What are the most important problems in this situation? Do the patient and the patient's family recognize the same problems?
- What are the desired outcomes for this patient? Which have the highest priority? Does the patient see eye to eye with me on these points?
- What is going to be my first action in this situation?
- How can I construct a plan of care to achieve the goals?
- Are there any age-related factors involved, and will they require some special approach? Will I need to make some change in the plan of care to take these factors into account?
- How do the family dynamics affect this situation, and will this have an affect on my actions or the plan of care?
- Are there cultural factors that I must address and consider?
- Am I dealing with an ethical problem here? If so, how am I going to resolve it?
- Has any nursing research been conducted on this subject?
extended suffering as a result of efforts to prolong life, usually at great expense. Ethical issues also surround those practices or policies that seem to allocate health care resources unjustly on the basis of age, race, gender, disability, or social mores.

\section*{Domain of Nursing Ethics}

The ethical dilemmas a nurse may encounter in the medicalsurgical arena are numerous and diverse. An awareness of underlying philosophical concepts will help the nurse to reason through these dilemmas. Basic concepts related to moral philosophy, such as ethics terminology, theories, and approaches, are included in this chapter. Understanding the role of the professional nurse in ethical decision making will assist nurses in articulating their ethical positions and in developing the skills needed to make ethical decisions.

\section*{ETHICS VERSUS MORALITY}

The terms ethics and morality are used to describe beliefs about right and wrong and to suggest appropriate guidelines for action. In essence, ethics is the formal, systematic study of moral beliefs,
whereas morality is the adherence to informal personal values. Because the distinction between the two is slight, they are often used interchangeably.

\section*{ETHICS THEORIES}

One classic theory in ethics is teleologic theory or consequentialism, which focuses on the ends or consequences of actions. The most well-known form of this theory, utilitarianism, is based on the concept of "the greatest good for the greatest number." The choice of action is clear under this theory, because the action that maximizes good over bad is the correct one. The theory poses difficulty when one must judge intrinsic values and determine whose good is the greatest. Additionally, the question must be asked whether good consequences can justify any amoral actions that might be used to achieve them.

Another theory in ethics is the deontologic or formalist theory, which argues that moral standards or principles exist independently of the ends or consequences. In a given situation, one or more moral principles may apply. The nurse has a duty to act based on the one relevant principle, or the most relevant of several moral principles. Problems arise with this theory when personal and cultural biases influence the choice of the most primary moral principle.

\section*{APPROACHES TO ETHICS}

Two approaches to ethics are metaethics and applied ethics. An example of metaethics (understanding the concepts and linguistic terminology used in ethics) in the health care environment would be analysis of the concept of informed consent. Nurses are aware that patients must give consent before surgery, but sometimes a question arises as to whether the patient is truly informed. Delving more deeply into the concept of informed consent would be a metaethical inquiry.

Applied ethics is the term used when questions are asked of a specific discipline to identify ethical problems within that discipline's practice. Various disciplines use the frameworks of general ethical theories and moral principles and apply them to specific problems within their domain. Common ethical principles that apply in nursing include autonomy, beneficence, confidentiality, double effect, fidelity, justice, nonmaleficence, paternalism, respect for people, sanctity of life, and veracity. Brief definitions of these important principles can be found in Chart 3-2.

Nursing ethics may be considered a form of applied ethics because it addresses moral situations that are specific to the nursing profession and patient care. Some ethical problems that affect nursing may also apply to the broader area of bioethics and health care ethics. However, the nursing profession is a "caring" rather than

\section*{Common Ethical Principles}

The following common ethical principles may be used to validate moral claims.

\section*{Autonomy}

This word is derived from the Greek words autos ("self") and nomos ("rule" or "law"), and therefore refers to self-rule. In contemporary discourse it has broad meanings, including individual rights, privacy, and choice. Autonomy entails the ability to make a choice free from external constraints.

\section*{Beneficence}

Beneficence is the duty to do good and the active promotion of benevolent acts (eg, goodness, kindness, charity). It may also include the injunction not to inflict harm (see nonmaleficence).

\section*{Confidentiality}

Confidentiality relates to the concept of privacy. Information obtained from an individual will not be disclosed to another unless it will benefit the person or there is a direct threat to the social good.

\section*{Double Effect}

This is a principle that may morally justify some actions that produce both good and evil effects.

All four of the following criteria must be fulfilled:
1. The action itself is good or morally neutral.
2. The agent sincerely intends the good and not the evil effect (the evil effect may be foreseen but is not intended).
3. The good effect is not achieved by means of the evil effect.
4. There is proportionate or favorable balance of good over evil.

\section*{Fidelity}

Fidelity is promise keeping; the duty to be faithful to one's commitments. It includes both explicit and implicit promises to another person.

\section*{Justice}

From a broad perspective, justice states that like cases should be treated alike. A more restricted version of justice is distributive justice,
which refers to the distribution of social benefits and burdens based on various criteria that may include the following:

Equality
Individual need
Individual effort
Societal contribution
Individual merit
Legal entitlement
Retributive justice is concerned with the distribution of punishment.

\section*{Nonmaleficence}

This is the duty not to inflict harm as well as to prevent and remove harm. Nonmaleficence may be included within the principle of beneficence, in which case nonmaleficence would be more binding.

\section*{Paternalism}

Paternalism is the intentional limitation of another's autonomy, justified by an appeal to beneficence or the welfare or needs of another. Under this principle, the prevention of evils or harm takes precedence over any potential evils caused by interference with the individual's autonomy or liberty.

\section*{Respect for Persons}

Respect for persons is frequently used synonymously with autonomy. However, it goes beyond accepting the notion or attitude that people have autonomous choice, to treating others in such a way that enables them to make the choice.

\section*{Sanctity of Life}

This is the perspective that life is the highest good. Therefore, all forms of life, including mere biologic existence, should take precedence over external criteria for judging quality of life.

\section*{Veracity}

Veracity is the obligation to tell the truth and not to lie or deceive others.
a predominantly "curing" profession; therefore, it is imperative that one not equate nursing ethics solely with medical ethics, because the medical profession has a "cure" focus. Nursing has its own professional code of ethics.

\section*{MORAL SITUATIONS}

Many situations exist in which ethical analysis is needed. Some are moral dilemmas, situations in which a clear conflict exists between two or more moral principles or competing moral claims, and the nurse must choose the lesser of two evils. Other situations represent moral problems, in which there may be competing moral claims or principles but one claim or principle is clearly dominant. Some situations result in moral uncertainty, when one cannot accurately define what the moral situation is, or what moral principles apply, but has a strong feeling that something is not right. Still other situations may result in moral distress, in which the nurse is aware of the correct course of action but institutional constraints stand in the way of pursuing the correct action (Jameton, 1984).

For example, a patient tells a nurse that if he is dying he wants everything possible done. The surgeon and family have made the decision not to tell the patient he is terminally ill and not to resuscitate him if he stops breathing. From an ethical perspective, patients should be told the truth about their diagnoses and should have the opportunity to make decisions about treatments. Ideally, this information should come from the physician, with the nurse present to assist the patient in understanding the terminology and to provide further support, if necessary. A moral problem exists because of the competing moral claims of the family and physician, who wish to spare the patient distress, and the nurse, who wishes to be truthful with the patient as the patient has requested. If the patient's competency were questionable, a moral dilemma would exist because no dominant principle would be evident. The nurse could experience moral distress if the hospital threatens disciplinary action or job termination if the information is disclosed without the agreement of the physician or the family, or both.

It is essential that nurses freely engage in dialogue concerning moral situations, even though such dialogue is difficult for everyone involved. Improved interdisciplinary communication is supported when all members of the health care team can voice their concerns and come to an understanding of the moral situation. The use of an ethics consultant or consultation team could be helpful to assist the health care team, patient, and family to identify the moral dilemma and possible approaches to the dilemma. The nurse should be familiar with agency policy supporting patient self-determination and resolution of ethical issues. The nurse should be an advocate for patient rights in each situation (Trammelleo, 2000).

\section*{TYPES OF ETHICAL PROBLEMS IN NURSING}

As a profession, nursing is accountable to society. This accountability is spelled out in the American Hospital Association's Patient Care Partnership (Chart 3-3), which reflects social beliefs about health and health care. In addition to accepting this document as one measure of accountability, nursing has further defined its standards of accountability through a formal code of ethics that explicitly states the profession's values and goals. The code (Chart 3-4), established by the American Nurses Association (ANA), consists of ethical standards, each with its own interpretive statements (ANA, 2001). The interpretive statements provide guidance to address and resolve ethical dilemmas by incorporat-
ing universal moral principles (ANA's Code of Ethics Project Task Force, 2000). The code is an ideal framework for nurses to use in ethical decision making.

Ethical issues have always affected the role of the professional nurse. The accepted definition of professional nursing has inspired a new advocacy role for nurses. The ANA, in Nursing's Social Policy Statement (1995), defines nursing as "the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to health and illness." This definition supports the claim that nurses must be actively involved in the decision-making process regarding ethical concerns surrounding health care and human responses. Efforts to enact this standard may cause conflict in health care settings in which the traditional roles of the nurse are delineated within a bureaucratic structure. If, however, nurses learn to present ethical conflicts within a logical, systematic framework, struggles over jurisdictional boundaries may decrease. Health care settings in which nurses are valued members of the team promote interdisciplinary communication and may enhance patient care. To practice effectively in these settings, nurses must be aware of ethical issues and assist patients in voicing their moral concerns.

The basic ethical framework of the nursing profession is the phenomenon of human caring. Nursing theories that incorporate the biopsychosocial-spiritual dimensions emphasize a holistic viewpoint, with humanism or caring as the core. As the nursing profession strives to delineate its own theory of ethics, caring is often cited as the moral foundation. For nurses to embrace this professional ethos, it is necessary to be aware not only of major ethical dilemmas but also of those daily interactions with health care consumers that frequently give rise to ethical challenges that are not as easily identified. Although technological advances and diminished resources have been instrumental in raising numerous ethical questions and controversies, including life-and-death issues, nurses should not ignore the many routine situations that involve ethical considerations. Some of the most common issues faced by nurses today include confidentiality, use of restraints, trust, refusing care, genetics, and end-of-life concerns.

\section*{Confidentiality}

We all need to be aware of the confidential nature of information obtained in daily practice. If information is not pertinent to a case, the nurse should question whether it is prudent to record it in the patient's chart. In the practice setting, discussion of the patient with other members of the health care team is often necessary. These discussions should, however, occur in a private area where it is unlikely that the conversation will be overheard.

Another threat to keeping information confidential is the widespread use of computers and the easy access people have to them. This may increase the potential for misuse of information, which may have negative social consequences (Zolot, 1999). For example, laboratory results regarding testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or genetic screening may lead to loss of employment or insurance if the information is disclosed. Because of these possibilities of maleficence (see Chart 3-2) to the patient, sensitivity to the principle of confidentiality is essential.

\section*{Restraints}

The use of restraints (including physical and pharmacologic measures) is another issue with ethical overtones. It is important to weigh carefully the risks of limiting a person's autonomy and increasing the risk of injury by using restraints against the risks of not using restraints. Before restraints are used, other strategies, such as

\section*{The Patient Care Partnership: Understanding Expectations, Rights, and Responsibilities}

When you need hospital care, your doctor and the nurses and other professionals at our hospital are committed to working with you and your family to meet your health care needs. Our dedicated doctors and staff serve the community in all its ethnic, religious, and economic diversity. Our goal is for you and your family to have the same care and attention we would want for our families and ourselves.

The sections below explain some of the basics about how you can expect to be treated during your hospital stay. They also cover what we will need from you to care for you better. If you have questions at any time, please ask them. Unasked or unanswered questions can add to the stress of being in the hospital. Your comfort and confidence in your care are very important to us.

\section*{What to Expect During Your Hospital Stay}

High quality hospital care. Our first priority is to provide you the care you need, when you need it, with skill, compassion, and respect. Tell your caregivers if you have concerns about your care or if you have pain. You have the right to know the identity of doctors, nurses, and others involved in your care, as well as when they are students, residents, or other trainees.
A clean and safe environment. Our hospital works hard to keep you safe. We use special policies and procedures to avoid mistakes in your care and keep you free from abuse or neglect. If anything unexpected and significant happens during your hospital stay, you will be told what happened and any resulting changes in your care will be discussed with you.
Involvement in your care. You and your doctor often make decisions about your care before you go to the hospital. Other times, especially in emergencies, those decisions are made during your hospital stay. When they take place, making decisions should include:
- Discussing your medical condition and information about medically appropriate treatment choices. To make informed decisions with your doctor, you need to understand several things:
- The benefits and risks of each treatment.
- Whether it is experimental or part of a research study.
- What you can reasonably expect from your treatment and any long-term effects it might have on your quality of life.
- What you and your family will need to do after you leave the hospital.
- The financial consequences of using uncovered services or out-ofnetwork providers.
Please tell your caregivers if you need more information about treatment choices.
- Discussing your treatment plan. When you enter the hospital, you sign a general consent to treatment. In some cases, such as surgery or experimental treatment, you may be asked to confirm in writing that you understand what is planned and agree to it. This process protects your right to consent to or refuse a treatment. Your doctor will explain the medical consequences of refusing recommended treatment. It also protects your right to decide if you want to participate in a research study.
- Getting information from you. Your caregivers need complete and correct information about your health and coverage so that they can make good decisions about your care. That includes:
- Past illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays.
- Past allergic reactions.
- Any medicines or diet supplements (such as vitamins and herbs) that you are taking.
- Any network or admission requirements under your health plan.
- Understanding your health care goals and values. You may have health care goals and values or spiritual beliefs that are important to your well-being. They will be taken into account as much as possible throughout your hospital stay. Make sure your doctor, your family, and your care team know your wishes.
- Understanding who should make decisions when you cannot. If you have signed a health care power of attorney stating who should speak for you if you become unable to make health care decisions for yourself, or a "living will" or "advance directive" that states your wishes about end-of-life care, give copies to your doctor, your family and your care team. If you or your family need help making difficult decisions, counselors, chaplains and others are available to help.
Protection of your privacy. We respect the confidentiality of your relationship with your doctor and other caregivers, and the sensitive information about your health and health care that are part of that relationship. State and federal laws and hospital operating policies protect the privacy of your medical information. You will receive a Notice of Privacy Practices that describes the ways that we use, disclose and safeguard patient information and that explains how you can obtain a copy of information from our records about your care.
Help preparing you and your family for when you leave the hospital. Your doctor works with hospital staff and professionals in your community. You and your family also play an important role. The success of your treatment often depends on your efforts to follow medication, diet and therapy plans. Your family may need to help care for you at home.
You can expect us to help you identify sources of follow-up care and to let you know if our hospital has a financial interest in any referrals. As long as you agree we can share information about your care with them, we will coordinate our activities with your caregivers outside the hospital. You can also expect to receive information and, where possible, training about the self-care you will need when you go home.
Help with your bill and filing insurance claims. Our staff will file claims for you with health care insurers or other programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. They will also help your doctor with needed documentation. Hospital bills and insurance coverage are often confusing. If you have questions about your bill, contact our business office. If you need help understanding your insurance coverage or health plan, start with your insurance company or health benefits manager. If you do not have health coverage, we will try to help you and your family find financial help or make other arrangements. We need your help with collecting needed information and other requirements to obtain coverage or assistance.
While you are here, you will receive more detailed notices about some of the rights you have as a hospital patient and how to exercise them. We are always interested in improving. If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please contact $\qquad$ .

asking family members to sit with the patient, should be tried (Rogers \& Bocchino, 1999). The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) have designated standards for use in care of patients with restraints; these standards are available on the website listed at the end of this chapter (Schiff, 2001).

\section*{Trust Issues}

Telling the truth (veracity) is one of the basic principles of our culture. Two ethical dilemmas in clinical practice that can directly conflict with this principle are the use of placebos (non-
active substances used to treat symptoms) and not revealing a diagnosis to the patient. Both involve the issue of trust, which is an essential element in the nurse-patient relationship. Placebos may be used in experimental research, where the patient is involved in the decision-making process and is aware that placebos are being used in the treatment regimen. However, the use of a placebo as a substitute for an active drug to show that the patient does not have real symptoms is deceptive. This practice may severely undermine the nurse-patient relationship.

Informing patients of their diagnoses when the family and physician have chosen to withhold information is a common ethical situation in nursing practice. The nursing staff often use

\section*{American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Nurses}
1. The nurse, in all professional relationships, practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness of every individual, unrestricted by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems.
2. The nurse's primary commitment is to the patient, whether an individual, family, group, or community.
3. The nurse promotes, advocates for, and strives to protect the health, safety, and rights of the patient.
4. The nurse is responsible and accountable for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delegation of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimum patient care.
5. The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety, to maintain competence, and to continue personal and professional growth.
6. The nurse participates in establishing, maintaining, and improving health care environments and conditions of employment conducive to the provision of quality health care and consistent with the values of the profession through individual and collective action.
7. The nurse participates in the advancement of the profession through contributions to practice, education, administration, and knowledge development.
8. The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public in promoting community, national, and international efforts to meet health needs.
9. The profession of nursing, as represented by associations and their members, is responsible for articulating nursing values, for maintaining the integrity of the profession and its practice, and for shaping social policy.

evasive comments with the patient as a means to maintain professional relationships with other health practitioners. This area is indeed complex because it challenges the nurse's integrity. Trust and connection with the patient play an important part in optimizing care (Day \& Stannard, 1999). Strategies the nurse could consider in this situation include the following:
- Not lying to the patient
- Providing all information related to nursing procedures and diagnoses
- Communicating to the family and physician the patient's requests for information

Families often are unaware of the patient's repeated questions to the nurse. With a better understanding of the situation, families may change their perspective. Finally, although providing the information may be the morally appropriate behavior, the manner in which the patient is told is important. Nurses must be compassionate and caring while informing patients; disclosure of information merely for the sake of patient autonomy does not convey respect for others.

\section*{Refusing to Provide Care}

Any nurse who feels compelled to refuse to provide care for a particular type of patient faces an ethical dilemma. The reasons given for refusal range from a conflict of personal values to fear of personal risk of injury. Such instances have increased since the advent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a major health problem. In one survey, the number of nurses who stated they might refuse to care for a patient with AIDS declined over a 10 -year period, from $75 \%$ to $20 \%$. The number who might refuse to care for a patient with AIDS who was violent or uncooperative, however, rose from $72 \%$ to $82 \%$ (Ventura, 1999).

The ethical obligation to care for all patients is clearly identified in the first statement of the Code of Ethics for Nurses. To avoid facing these moral situations, a nurse can follow certain strategies. For example, when applying for a job, one should ask questions regarding the patient population. If one is uncomfortable with a particular situation, then not accepting the position would be an option. Denial of care, or providing substandard nursing care to some members of our society, is not acceptable nursing practice.

\section*{End-of-Life Issues}

Dilemmas that center on death and dying are prevalent in medicalsurgical nursing practice and frequently initiate moral discussion. The dilemmas are compounded by the fact that the idea of curing is paramount in health care. With advanced technology, it may be difficult to accept the fact that nothing more can be done, or that technology may prolong life but at the expense of comfort and quality of life. Focusing on the caring as well as the curing role may assist nurses in dealing with these difficult moral situations. End-of life issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 17.

\section*{PAIN CONTROL}

The use of opioids to alleviate a patient's pain may present a dilemma for nurses. Patients with excruciating pain may require large doses of analgesics. Fear of respiratory depression or unwarranted fear of addiction should not prevent nurses from attempting to alleviate pain for the dying patient or for a patient experiencing an acute pain episode. In the case of the terminally ill patient, for example, the actions may be justified by the principle of double effect (see Chart 3-2). The intent or goal of nursing interventions is to alleviate pain and suffering while promoting comfort. The risk of respiratory depression is not the intent of the actions and should not be used as an excuse for withholding analgesia. However, the patient's respiratory status should be carefully monitored and any signs of respiratory depression reported to the physician. The administration of analgesia should be governed by the patient's needs.

\section*{DO-NOT-RESUSCITATE ORDERS}

The "do not resuscitate" (DNR) order is a controversial issue. When a patient is competent to make decisions, his or her choice for a DNR order should be honored, according to the principles of autonomy or respect for the individual (Trammelleo, 2000). However, a DNR order is at times interpreted to mean that the patient requires less nursing care, when actually these patients may have significant medical and nursing needs, all of which demand attention. Ethically, all patients deserve and should receive appropriate nursing interventions, regardless of their resuscitation status.

\section*{LIFE SUPPORT}

In contrast to the previous situations are those in which a DNR decision has not been made by or for a dying patient. The nurse may be put in the uncomfortable position of initiating life-support measures when, because of the patient's physical condition, they appear futile. This frequently occurs when the patient is not competent to make the decision and the family (or surrogate decision maker) refuses to consider a DNR order as an option. The nurse may be told to perform a "slow code" (ie, not to rush to resuscitate the patient) or may be given a verbal order not to resuscitate the patient; both are unacceptable medical orders. The best recourse for nurses in these situations is to be aware of hospital policy related to the Patient Self-Determination Act (discussed later) and execution of advance directives. The nurse should communicate with the physician. Discussing the matter with the physician may lead to further communication with the family and to a reconsideration of their decision, especially if they are afraid to let a loved one die with no further efforts to resuscitate (Trammelleo, 2000). Finally, when working with colleagues who are confronting such difficult situations, it helps to talk and listen to their concerns as a way of providing support.

\section*{FOOD AND FLUID}

In addition to requesting that no heroic measures be taken to prolong life, a dying patient may request that no more food or fluid be administered. Many individuals think that food and hydration are basic human needs, not "invasive measures," and therefore should always be maintained. However, some consider food and hydration as means of prolonging suffering. In evaluating this issue, nurses must take into consideration the potential harm as well as the benefit to the patient of either administering or withdrawing sustenance. Research has not supported the belief that withholding fluids results in a painful death due to thirst (Smith, 1997; Zerwekh, 1997).

Evaluation of harm requires a careful review of the reasons the person has requested the withdrawal of food and hydration. Although the principle of autonomy has considerable merit and is supported by the Code of Ethics for Nurses, there may be situations when the request for withdrawal of food and hydration cannot be upheld. For patients with decreased decision-making capacity, the issues are more complex. Some of these cases have reached courts of law, and different states have different case law precedents forbidding withdrawal of sustenance. Although an advance directive may provide some answers, at present there are no firm guidelines to assist nurses in this area.

\section*{Preventive Ethics}

As previously mentioned, a dilemma refers to a conflict between two alternatives. In such instances, one's moral decision is to choose the lesser evil of the two. However, various preventive strategies are available to help nurses anticipate or avoid certain kinds of ethical dilemmas.

Frequently, dilemmas occur when the health care practitioners are unsure of the patient's wishes because the person is unconscious or too cognitively impaired to communicate directly. One famous court case in this area of clinical ethics is that of Nancy Cruzan. Cruzan was a young woman involved in a singlecar crash, after which she remained in a persistent vegetative state. Her family endured a 3-year legal battle to have her feeding tube removed so that she could be allowed to die. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that a state could require "clear and convincing
evidence" of the patient's wishes before withdrawing life support. This ruling and the public response to it served as an impetus for legislation on advance directives, entitled the Patient SelfDetermination Act, which became effective in December 1991. The intent of this legislation is to encourage people to prepare advance directives in which they indicate their wishes concerning the degree of supportive care to be provided if they become incapacitated. The regulatory language is quite broad and allows for different institutions to have latitude in implementing the person's directives. This legislation does not require a patient to have an advance directive, but it does require that the patient be informed about them by the staff of the health care facility. Consequently, this is an area where nursing can play a significant role in patient education.

\section*{ADVANCE DIRECTIVES}

Advance directives are legal documents that specify a patient's wishes before hospitalization and provide valuable information that may assist health care providers in decision making. A living will is one type of advance directive. In most situations, living wills are limited to situations in which the patient's medical condition is deemed terminal. Because it is difficult to define "terminal" accurately, the living will is not always honored. Another potential drawback to the living will is that these documents are frequently written while the person is in good health. It is not unusual for people to change their minds as their illness progresses. Therefore, the patient retains the option to nullify the document.

Another type of advance directive is the durable power of attorney for health care, in which the patient identifies another individual to make health care decisions on his or her behalf. In this type of directive, the patient may have clarified his or her wishes concerning a variety of medical situations. As such, the power of attorney for health care is a less restrictive type of advance directive. Laws concerning advance directives vary among state jurisdictions. Even in states where these documents are not legally binding, however, they provide helpful information and assist health care providers to determine the patient's prior expressed wishes in situations where this information can no longer be obtained directly.

Institutional ethics committees, which exist in many hospitals to assist practitioners with ethical dilemmas, also aid in preventive ethics. The purpose of these multidisciplinary committees varies among institutions. In some hospitals, the committee exists solely for the purpose of developing policies; in others it may have a strong educational or consultation focus. Because these committees usually comprise individuals with some advanced training in ethics, they are important resources to the health care team, patient, and family. Nurses with a particular interest or expertise in the area of ethics are valuable members of ethics committees and can serve as valuable resources for staff nurses.

The heightened interest in ethical decision making has resulted in many continuing education programs, ranging from small seminars or workshops to full-semester courses offered by local colleges or professional organizations. In addition, nursing and medical journals contain articles on ethical issues, and numerous textbooks on clinical ethics or nursing ethics are available. These are valuable resources because they cover the ethical theory and dilemmas of practice in greater depth. The ANA also has publications available to assist nurses with ethical decision making.

\section*{Ethical Decision Making}

As noted in the preceding discussions, ethical dilemmas are common and diverse in nursing practice. Although the situations vary and experience indicates that there are no clear solutions to these dilemmas, the fundamental philosophical principles are the same, and the process of moral reflection will help nurses to justify their actions. The approach to ethical decision making can follow the steps of the nursing process. Chart 3-5 outlines the steps of an ethical analysis.

\section*{Steps of the Nursing Process}

The nursing process is a deliberate problem-solving approach for meeting a person's health care and nursing needs. Although the steps of the nursing process have been stated in various ways by different writers, the common components cited are assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The ANA's Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice (1998) include an additional component entitled "outcome identification" and establish the sequence of steps in the following order: assessment, diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation. For the purposes of this text, the nursing process will be based on the traditional five steps and will delineate two components in the diagnosis step: nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems. After the diagnoses or problems have been determined, the desired outcomes are often evident. The traditional steps are defined as follows:
1. Assessment: The systematic collection of data to determine the patient's health status and identify any actual or potential health problems. (Analysis of data is included as part of the assessment. For those who wish to emphasize its importance, analysis may be identified as a separate step of the nursing process.)
2. Diagnosis: Identification of the following two types of patient problems:
a. Nursing diagnoses: Actual or potential health problems that can be managed by independent nursing interventions
b. Collaborative problems: "Certain physiologic complications that nurses monitor to detect onset or changes in status. Nurses manage collaborative problems using physician-prescribed and nursing-prescribed interventions to minimize the complications of the events" (Carpenito, 1999, p. 7).
3. Planning: Development of goals and outcomes, as well as a plan of care designed to assist the patient in resolving the diagnosed problems and achieving the identified goals and desired outcomes.
4. Implementation: Actualization of the plan of care through nursing interventions.
5. Evaluation: Determination of the patient's responses to the nursing interventions and the extent to which the outcomes have been achieved.
Dividing the nursing process into distinct steps serves to emphasize the essential nursing actions that must be taken to resolve the patient's nursing diagnoses and manage any collaborative problems or complications. Dividing the process into separate steps is, however, artificial: the process functions as an integrated whole, with the steps being interrelated, interdependent, and recurrent (Fig. 3-1). Chart 3-6 presents an overview of the nursing activities involved in applying the nursing process.

\section*{Using the Nursing Process}

\section*{ASSESSMENT}

Assessment data are gathered through the health history and the physical assessment. In addition, ongoing monitoring is crucial to remain aware of patient needs and the effectiveness of the nursing care that the patient receives.

\section*{Steps of an Ethical Analysis}

The following are guidelines to assist nurses in ethical decision making. These guidelines reflect an active process in decision making, similar to the nursing process detailed in this chapter.

\section*{Assessment}
1. Assess the ethical/moral situations of the problem. This step entails recognition of the ethical, legal, and professional dimensions involved.
a. Does the situation entail substantive moral problems (conflicts among ethical principles or professional obligations)?
b. Are there procedural conflicts? (For example, who should make the decisions? Any conflicts among the patient, health care providers, family and guardians?)
c. Identify the significant people involved and those affected by the decision.
Planning
2. Collect information.
a. Include the following information: the medical facts, treatment options, nursing diagnoses, legal data, and the values, beliefs, and religious components.
b. Make a distinction between the factual information and the values/beliefs.
c. Validate the patient's capacity, or lack of capacity, to make decisions.
d. Identify any other relevant information that should be elicited.
e. Identify the ethical/moral issues and the competing claims.

\section*{Implementation}
3. List the alternatives. Compare alternatives with applicable ethical principles and professional code of ethics. Choose either of the frameworks below, or other frameworks, and compare outcomes.
a. Utilitarian approach: Predict the consequences of the alternatives; assign a positive or negative value to each consequence; choose the consequence that predicts the highest positive value or "the greatest good for the greatest number."
b. Deontological approach: Identify the relevant moral principles; compare alternatives with moral principles; appeal to the "higher-level" moral principle if there is a conflict.

\section*{Evaluation}
4. Decide and evaluate the decision.
a. What is the best or morally correct action?
b. Give the ethical reasons for your decision.
c. What are the ethical reasons against your decision?
d. How do you respond to the reasons against your decision?

\end{figure}

\section*{Health History}

The health history is conducted to determine the individual's state of wellness or illness and is best accomplished as part of a planned interview. The interview is a personal dialogue between the patient and the nurse that is conducted in order to obtain information. The nurse's approach to the patient will largely determine the amount and quality of the information that is received. Achieving a relationship of mutual trust and respect requires the ability to communicate a sincere interest in the patient. Examples of effective therapeutic communication techniques that can be used to achieve this goal are found in Table 3-1.

The use of a health history guide may help in obtaining pertinent information and in directing the course of the interview. A variety of health history formats designed to guide the interview are available, but they must be adapted to the responses, problems and needs of the individual. If a previous history is available, it should be used to reduce the need for the patient to repeat information. An experienced interviewer will develop a comfortable style and format for conducting an interview and will be flexible in adapting the format to suit the individual situation, while still obtaining the essential information. Various frameworks are available for acquiring the assessment data, such as functional health patterns, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and Erikson's "eight stages of man." The information gathered will relate to the patient's physical, psychological, social, emotional, intellectual, developmental, cultural, and spiritual needs.

In some instances, it may be appropriate for the patient to fill out a health history form. When a form is used, the nurse verifies and clarifies the information provided by the patient and seeks any additional information necessary to identify the individual's nursing needs.

\section*{Chelpt \\ 3-6}

\section*{Steps of the Nursing Process}

\section*{Assessment}
1. Conduct the health history.
2. Perform the physical assessment.
3. Interview the patient's family or significant others.
4. Study the health record.
5. Organize, analyze, synthesize, and summarize the collected data.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Nursing Diagnosis
1. Identify the patient's nursing problems.
2. Identify the defining characteristics of the nursing problems.
3. Identify the etiology of the nursing problems.
4. State nursing diagnoses concisely and precisely.

Collaborative Problems
1. Identify potential problems or complications that require collaborative interventions.
2. Identify health team members with whom collaboration is essential.

\section*{Planning}
1. Assign priority to the nursing diagnoses.
2. Specify the goals.
a. Develop immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals.
b. State the goals in realistic and measurable terms.
3. Identify nursing interventions appropriate for goal attainment.
4. Establish expected outcomes.
a. Make sure that the outcomes are realistic and measurable.
b. Identify critical times for the attainment of outcomes.
5. Develop the written plan of nursing care.
a. Include nursing diagnoses, goals, nursing interventions, expected outcomes, and critical times.
b. Write all entries precisely, concisely, and systematically.
c. Keep the plan current and flexible to meet the patient's changing problems and needs.
6. Involve the patient, family or significant others, nursing team members, and other health team members in all aspects of planning.

\section*{Implementation}
1. Put the plan of nursing care into action.
2. Coordinate the activities of the patient, family or significant others, nursing team members, and other health team members.
3. Record the patient's responses to the nursing actions.

\section*{Evaluation}
1. Collect data.
2. Compare the patient's actual outcomes with the expected outcomes. Determine the extent to which the expected outcomes were achieved.
3. Include the patient, family or significant others, nursing team members, and other health care team members in the evaluation.
4. Identify alterations that need to be made in the nursing diagnoses, collaborative problems, goals, nursing interventions, and expected outcomes.
5. Continue all steps of the nursing process: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation.

\section*{Physical Assessment}

A physical assessment may be carried out before, during, or after the health history, depending on the patient's physical and emotional state and the immediate priorities of the situation.

The purpose of the health assessment is to identify those aspects of the patient's physical, psychological, and emotional state that indicate a need for nursing care. It requires the use of sight, hearing, touch, and smell as well as the appropriate interview
skills and techniques. Physical examination techniques as well as techniques and strategies for assessing behaviors and role changes are discussed in Chapters 5 and 7.

\section*{Other Components of the Database}

Additional relevant information should be obtained from the patient's family or significant others, from other members of the health team, and from the patient's health record or chart. Depending on the patient's immediate needs, this information may have been obtained before the health history and the physical assessment were done. Whatever the sequence of events, it is important to use all available sources of pertinent data to complete the nursing assessment.

\section*{Recording the Database}

After the health history and physical assessment are completed, the information obtained is recorded in the patient's permanent record. This record provides a means of communication among members
of the health care team and facilitates coordinated planning and continuity of care. The record fulfills other functions as well:
- It serves as the business and legal record for the health care agency and for the professional staff members who are responsible for the patient's care.
- It serves as a basis for evaluating the quality and appropriateness of care and for reviewing the effective use of patient care services.
- It provides data that are useful in research, education, and short- and long-range planning.
A variety of systems are used for documenting patient care, and each health care agency selects the system that best meets its needs. The types of systems available include the problem-oriented health record system, focus charting, patient outcome charting, problem intervention evaluation (PIE) charting, and charting by exception (CBE). In addition, many health care agencies have moved toward computerized documentation systems; these appear to save time, improve the monitoring of quality improvement issues, and make it easier to gain access to patient information.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

The assessment component of the nursing process serves as the basis for identifying nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems. Soon after the completion of the health history and the physical assessment, the nurse organizes, analyzes, synthesizes, and summarizes the data collected and determines the patient's need for nursing care.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Nursing, unlike medicine, does not yet have a complete taxonomy, or classification system, of diagnostic labels. Classification of discrete items into meaningful categories organizes components of knowledge into coherent units of related information. Some reasons for establishing taxonomies are to help identify what is known about a field of study, to discover what gaps in knowledge exist, to provide a common language that enhances communication among colleagues, and to facilitate the coding of standardized information for use in databases. Nursing diagnoses, the first taxonomy created in nursing, have fostered the development of autonomy and accountability in nursing and have helped to delineate the scope of practice. Many state nurse practice acts include nursing diagnosis as a nursing function, and nursing diagnosis is included in the ANA's Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice and the standards of many nursing specialty organizations.

The official organization that has assumed responsibility for developing the taxonomy of nursing diagnoses and formulating nursing diagnoses acceptable for study is the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA). NANDA has grouped diagnoses according to patterns of human responses (Chart 3-7). The diagnostic labels identified by NANDA have been generally accepted but require further validation, refinement, and expansion based on clinical use and research; they are not yet complete or mutually exclusive, and more investigation is needed to determine their validity and clinical applicability.

\section*{Choosing a Nursing Diagnosis}

When choosing the nursing diagnoses for a particular patient, the nurse must first identify the commonalities among the assessment data collected. These common features lead to the categorization of related data that reveal the existence of a problem and the need for nursing intervention. The patient's identified problems are then defined in the nursing diagnoses. The most commonly selected nursing diagnoses are compiled and categorized by NANDA in a taxonomy that is updated at least every 2 years. It is important to remember that nursing diagnoses are not medical diagnoses; they are not medical treatments prescribed by the physician; and they are not diagnostic studies. Nursing diagnoses are not the equipment used to implement medical therapy, and they are not the problems that the nurse experiences while caring for the patient. They are the patient's actual or potential health problems that independent nursing actions can resolve. Nursing diagnoses that are succinctly stated in terms of the specific problems of the patient will guide the nurse in the development of the nursing plan of care.

To give additional meaning to the diagnosis, the characteristics and the etiology of the problem must be identified and included as part of the diagnosis. For example, the nursing diagnoses and their defining characteristics and etiology for a patient who has rheumatoid arthritis may include
- Impaired physical mobility related to pain and stiffness with joint movement
- Self-care deficits (bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, feeding, toileting) related to fatigue and joint stiffness
- Low self-esteem (chronic, situational, risk for situational) related to loss of independence
- Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements related to fatigue and inadequate food intake

\section*{Collaborative Problems}

In addition to nursing diagnoses and their related nursing interventions, nursing practice involves certain situations and interventions that do not fall within the definition of nursing diagnoses. These activities pertain to potential problems or complications that are medical in origin and require collaborative interventions with the physician and other members of the health care team. The term collaborative problem is used to identify these situations.

Collaborative problems are certain physiologic complications that nurses monitor to detect changes in status or onset of complications. Nurses manage collaborative problems using physicianprescribed and nursing-prescribed interventions to minimize complications (Carpenito, 1999, p. 7). A primary focus of the nurse when treating collaborative problems is monitoring the patient for the onset of complications or changes in the status of existing complications. The complications are usually related to the patient's disease process, treatments, medications, or diagnostic studies. The nurse prescribes nursing interventions that are appropriate for managing the complications and implements the treatments prescribed by the physician. Figure 3-2 depicts the differences between nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems. After the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems have been identified, they are recorded on the plan of nursing care.

\section*{PLANNING}

Once the nursing diagnoses have been identified, the planning component of the nursing process begins. This phase entails the following:
1. Assigning priorities to the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems
2. Specifying expected outcomes
3. Specifying the immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals of nursing action
4. Identifying specific nursing interventions appropriate for attaining the outcomes
5. Identifying interdependent interventions
6. Documenting the nursing diagnoses, collaborative problems, expected outcomes, nursing goals, and nursing interventions on the plan of nursing care
7. Communicating to appropriate personnel any assessment data that point to health needs that can best be met by other members of the health care team

\section*{Setting Priorities}

Assigning priorities to the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems is a joint effort by the nurse and the patient or family members. Any disagreement about priorities is resolved in a way that is mutually acceptable. Consideration must be given to the

urgency of the problems, with the most critical problems receiving the highest priority. Maslow's hierarchy of needs provides a useful framework for prioritizing problems, with importance being given first to physical needs; once those lower-level needs are met, higher-level needs can be addressed.

\section*{Establishing Expected Outcomes}

Expected outcomes of the nursing interventions are stated in terms of the patient's behaviors and the time period in which they are to be achieved, as well as any special circumstances related to achieving the outcome (Smith-Temple \& Johnson, 2002). These outcomes must be realistic and measurable. The Nursing-Sensitive Outcomes Classification (NOC) (Chart 3-8) and standard outcome criteria for people with specific health problems established by health care agencies are resources for identifying appropriate expected outcomes. These outcomes can be associated with nursing diagnoses and interventions and can be used when appropriate (Aquilino \& Keenan, 2000). However, NOC may need to be adapted to establish realistic criteria for the specific patient involved.

The expected outcomes that define the desired behavior of the patient will be used to measure to what extent progress toward resolving the problem has been made. The expected outcomes also serve as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the nursing interventions and for deciding whether additional nursing care is needed or whether the plan of care needs to be revised.

\section*{Establishing Goals}

After the priorities of the nursing diagnoses and expected outcomes have been established, the immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals and the nursing actions appropriate for attain-
ing the goals are identified. The patient and his or her family are included in establishing goals for the nursing actions. Immediate goals are those that can be reached within a short period. Intermediate and long-term goals require a longer time to be achieved and usually involve preventing complications and other health problems and promoting self-care and rehabilitation. For example, goals for a patient with diabetes and a nursing diagnosis of deficient knowledge related to the prescribed diet may be stated as follows:

Immediate goal: Demonstrates oral intake and tolerance of 1500-calorie diabetic diet spaced in three meals and one snack per day
Intermediate goal: Plans meals for 1 week based on diabetic exchange list
Long-term goal: Adheres to prescribed diabetic diet

\section*{Determining Nursing Actions}

In planning appropriate nursing actions to achieve the desired goals and outcomes, the nurse, with input from the patient and significant others, identifies individualized interventions based on the patient's circumstances and preferences that will address each outcome. Interventions should identify the activities needed and who will carry them out. Determination of interdisciplinary activities is made in collaboration with other health care providers as needed.

The nurse identifies and plans patient teaching and return demonstrations as needed to assist the patient in learning self-care activities to be performed. Planned interventions should be ethical and appropriate to the patient's culture, age, and gender. Standardized interventions, such as those found on institutional care plans or in the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC)

(Aquilino \& Keenan, 2000; McCloskey \& Bulechek, 2000) can be used. Chart 3-9 describes the NIC system and provides an example of an NIC system intervention. It is important to individualize prewritten interventions to promote optimal effectiveness for each patient.

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}

The implementation phase of the nursing process involves carrying out the proposed plan of nursing care. The nurse assumes responsibility for the implementation. Performance of interventions, however, may be carried out by the patient and the family, other members of the nursing team, or other members of the health care
team as appropriate. The nurse coordinates the activities of all those involved in implementation so that the schedule of activities facilitates the patient's recovery. The plan of nursing care serves as the basis for implementation:
- The immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals are used as a focus for the implementation of the designated nursing interventions.
- While implementing nursing care, the nurse continually assesses the patient and his or her response to the nursing care.
- Revisions are made in the plan of care as the patient's condition, problems, and responses change and when reassignment of priorities is required
Implementation includes direct or indirect execution of the planned interventions. It is focused on resolving the patient's nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems and achieving expected outcomes, thus meeting the patient's health needs.

Included among nursing interventions are assisting with hygienic care; promoting physical and psychological comfort; supporting respiratory and elimination functions; facilitating the ingestion of food, fluids, and nutrients; managing the patient's immediate surroundings; providing health teaching; promoting a therapeutic relationship; and carrying out a variety of therapeutic nursing activities. Judgment, critical thinking, and good decision-making skills are essential in the selection of appropriate scientifically and ethically based nursing interventions. All nursing interventions are patient-focused and outcome-directed and are implemented with compassion, confidence and a willingness to accept and understand the patient's responses.

Although many nursing actions are independent, others are interdependent, such as carrying out prescribed treatments, administering medications and therapies, and collaborating with other health care team members to accomplish specific expected outcomes and to monitor and manage potential complications. Such interdependent functioning is just that-interdependent. Requests or orders from other health care team members should not be followed blindly but should be assessed critically and questioned when necessary. The implementation phase of the nursing process ends when the nursing interventions have been completed.

\section*{EVALUATION}

Evaluation, the final step of the nursing process, allows the nurse to determine the patient's response to the nursing interventions and the extent to which the objectives have been achieved. The plan of nursing care is the basis for evaluation. The nursing diagnoses, collaborative problems, priorities, nursing interventions, and expected outcomes provide the specific guidelines that dictate the focus of the evaluation. Through evaluation, the nurse can answer the following questions:
- Were the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems accurate?
- Did the patient achieve the expected outcomes within the critical time periods?
- Have the patient's nursing diagnoses been resolved?
- Have the collaborative problems been resolved?
- Have the patient's nursing needs been met?
- Should the nursing interventions be continued, revised, or discontinued?
- Have new problems evolved for which nursing interventions have not been planned or implemented?
- What factors influenced the achievement or lack of achievement of the objectives?
- Do priorities need to be reassigned?
- Should changes be made in the expected outcomes and outcome criteria?
Objective data that provide answers to these questions are collected from all available sources (eg, patient, family, significant others, and health care team members). These data are included in the patient's record and must be substantiated by
direct observation of the patient before the outcomes are recorded.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION OF OUTCOMES AND REVISION OF PLAN}

Outcomes are documented concisely and objectively. Documentation should relate outcomes to the nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems, describe the patient's responses to the interventions, indicate whether the outcomes were met, and include any additional pertinent data (see Plan of Nursing Care).

\section*{Plan of Nausing Care \\ Example of an Individualized Plan of Nursing Care}

Mr. John Lee, a 50-year-old management consultant, was admitted to the nursing unit from his physician's office. A routine physical examination 3 months previously had revealed essential hypertension with BP 170/110 and decreased urine creatinine clearance. During the subsequent 3 months the blood pressure elevation did not respond to diet therapy. Mr. Lee admitted that he had not been successful in adhering to the low-sodium, low-cholesterol weight-reduction diet that had been prescribed for him. He stated, "My life is just too busy-I work all hours of the day and night." He indicated that in addition to his work he and his wife share the responsibility for raising their two teenage daughters. He drinks five to seven cups of coffee daily and drinks alcohol only at social occasions. Admission physical examination revealed BP 194/112, P 96, R $20, \mathrm{~T} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, height $5^{\prime} 10^{\prime \prime}$, weight 210 lbs , and slight edema of the ankles and feet. Mr. Lee stated that his feet are "always puffy at night." There were several darkened areas ( 2 cm in diameter) on the anterior lower legs bilaterally. A brief hospitalization was planned for thorough evaluation and initiation of therapy. The physician's orders on admission included activity as desired; Lasix, 40 mg bid; monitor vital signs every 4 hours while awake; and 1500 calorie, 1 g sodium, low-cholesterol diet.

The plan of care is subject to change as the patient's needs change, as the priorities of the needs shift, as needs are resolved, and as additional information about the patient's state of health is collected. As the nursing interventions are implemented, the patient's responses are evaluated and documented and the plan of care is revised accordingly. A well-developed, continuously updated plan of care is the greatest assurance that the patient's nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems will be addressed and his or her basic needs will be met.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are an acute care nurse and you have been assigned to the outpatient unit for the shift. How does the approach to critical thinking differ among nursing practice settings (acute care versus ambulatory care settings)?
2. You have just completed the health history for your assigned patient. How would you identify the patient's nursing diagnoses? Describe the kind of resources that are available to help you with identifying these diagnoses.
3. A terminally ill patient's daughter tells you she is not ready to let her father go. The next day you note a "Do Not Resuscitate" order on the chart. Describe which critical thinking skills you could use to address the issue and to develop a plan of care for the patient and family. How did you integrate your critical thinking into the nursing process? What changes might you make in your plan of care consid-
ering the DNR order? What ethical problems or dilemmas might you anticipate?
4. The spouse of your patient tells you information about the patient that the patient has not revealed. How would you determine whether you should communicate this information to the patient's primary nurse?

\section*{Chapter 4}

\section*{Health Education and Health Promotion}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the purposes and significance of health education.
2. Describe the concept of adherence to a therapeutic regimen.
3. Identify variables influencing the elderly person's adherence to a therapeutic regimen.
4. Distinguish the variables that affect learning readiness.
5. Describe strategies that facilitate elderly adults' learning abilities.
6. Describe the relationship of the teaching-learning process to the nursing process.
7. Develop a teaching plan for a patient.
8. Define the concepts of health, wellness, and health promotion.
9. Discuss major health promotion theories.
10. Describe the health promotion principles of self-responsibility, nutrition, stress management, and exercise.
11. Specify the variables that affect health promotion activities for children, young and middle-aged adults, and elderly adults.
12. Describe the role of the nurse in health promotion.

Effective health education lays a solid foundation for individual and community wellness. Teaching is an integral tool that all nurses use to assist patients and families in developing effective health behaviors and in altering lifestyle patterns that predispose people to health risks. Health education is an influential factor directly related to positive patient care outcomes.

\section*{Health EducationToday}

The changes in today's health care environment mandate the use of an organized approach to health education so that patients can meet their specific health care needs. Significant factors for the nurse to consider when planning patient education include the availability of health care outside the conventional hospital setting, the employment of diverse health care providers to accomplish care management goals, and the increased use of alternative strategies rather than traditional approaches to care. The careful consideration of these factors can provide patients with the comprehensive information that is essential for making informed decisions about health care. Demands from consumers for comprehensive information about their health issues throughout the life cycle accentuate the need for holistic health education to occur in every patient-nurse encounter.

The nurse as a teacher is challenged, not only to provide specific patient and family education, but also to focus on the educational needs of communities. Health education is important to nursing care, because it can determine how well individuals and families are able to perform behaviors conducive to optimal self-care.

Teaching, as a function of nursing, is included in all state nurse practice acts and in the Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice of the American Nurses Association (ANA, 1998). Health education is an independent function of nursing practice and is a primary responsibility of the nursing profession. All nursing care is directed toward promoting, maintaining, and restoring health; preventing illness; and assisting people to adapt to the residual effects of illness. Many of these nursing activities are accomplished through health education or patient teaching.

Every contact a nurse has with a health care consumer, whether that person is ill or not, should be considered an opportunity for health teaching. Although the person has a right to decide whether or not to learn, the nurse has the responsibility to present information that will motivate the person to recognize the need to learn. Therefore, the nurse must seize opportunities both inside and outside health care settings to facilitate wellness. Educational environments can include homes, hospitals, community health centers, places of business, service organizations, shelters, and consumer action or support groups.

\section*{THE PURPOSE OF HEALTH EDUCATION}

This emphasis on health education stems in part from the public's right to comprehensive health care, which includes up-to-date health information. It also reflects the emergence of an informed public that is asking more significant questions about health and the health care services it receives. Because of the importance American society places on health and the responsibility each of us has to maintain and promote our own health, members of the health care team, specifically nurses, are obligated to make health education consistently available. Without adequate knowledge and training in self-care skills, consumers cannot make effective decisions about their health.

People with chronic illnesses are among those most in need of health education. As the life span of our population continues to increase, the number of people with such illnesses will also increase. People with chronic illness need health care information to participate actively in and assume responsibility for much of their own care. Health education can help these individuals to adapt to illness, prevent complications, carry out prescribed therapy, and solve problems when confronted with new situations. It can also prevent crisis situations and reduce the potential for rehospitalization resulting from inadequate information about selfcare. The goal of health education is to teach people to live life to its healthiest-that is, to strive toward achieving their maximum health potential.

In addition to the public's right to and desire for health education, patient education is also a strategy for reducing health care costs by preventing illness, avoiding expensive medical treatments, decreasing lengthy hospital stays, and facilitating earlier discharge. For health care agencies, offering community wellness programs is a public relations tool for increasing patient satisfaction and for developing a positive image of the institution. Patient education is also a cost-avoidance strategy for those who believe that positive staff-patient relationships avert malpractice suits.

\section*{Adherence to the Therapeutic Regimen}

One of the goals of patient education is to encourage people to adhere to their therapeutic regimen. Adherence to a therapeutic regimen usually requires that the person make one or more lifestyle changes to carry out specific activities that promote and maintain health. Common examples of behaviors facilitating health include taking prescribed medications, maintaining a healthy diet, increasing daily activities and exercise, self-monitoring for signs and symptoms of illness, practicing specific hygienic measures, seeking periodic health evaluations, and performing other therapeutic and

preventive measures. The fact that many people do not adhere to their prescribed regimens cannot be ignored or minimized; rates of adherence are generally low, especially when the regimens are complex or of long duration.

Nonadherence to prescribed therapy has been the subject of many studies. For the most part, the findings have been inconclusive, and no one predominant causative factor has been found. Instead, a wide range of variables appears to influence the degree of adherence:
- Demographic variables, such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and level of education
- Illness variables, such as the severity of the illness and the relief of symptoms afforded by the therapy
- Therapeutic regimen variables, such as the complexity of the regimen and uncomfortable side effects
- Psychosocial variables, such as intelligence, availability of significant and supportive people (especially family members), attitudes toward health professionals, acceptance or denial of illness, and religious or cultural beliefs
- Financial variables, especially the direct and indirect costs associated with a prescribed regimen
The nurse's success with health education is determined by ongoing assessment of the variables affecting the patient's capacity to adopt specific behaviors, to obtain resources, and to maintain a helpful social environment (Murray \& Zentner, 2001). Teaching programs are more likely to succeed if the variables affecting the patient's adherence are identified and considered in the teaching plan.

The problem of nonadherence to therapeutic regimens is a substantial one that must be remedied before patients can achieve their maximum self-care capabilities and health potential. Surprisingly, a patient's need for knowledge has not been found to be a sufficient stimulus for acquiring knowledge and thereby enabling complete adherence to a health regimen. Teaching programs directed toward stimulating patient motivation produce varying degrees of adherence. The variables of choice, establishment of mutual goals, and the quality of the patient-provider relationship directly influence the behavioral changes that can result from patient education (Rankin \& Stallings, 2000). These factors are directly linked to motivation for learning.

Using a learning contract can also be a motivator for learning. Such a contract is based on the assessment of patient needs, health care data, and specific, measurable goals (Redman, 2000). A welldesigned learning contract is realistic and positive; it also includes measurable goals, with a specific time frame and reward system for goal achievement. The learning contract is recorded in writing and contains methods for ongoing evaluation.

The value of the contract lies in its clarity, specific delineation of what is to be accomplished, and usefulness for evaluating behavioral change. In a typical learning contract, a series of goals is established, beginning with small, easily attainable objectives and progressing to more advanced goals. Frequent, positive reinforcement is provided as the person moves from one goal to the next. An example of incremental goals would be a weight reduction program based on losing 1 to 2 pounds per week rather than one that merely identifies a general goal of losing 30 pounds.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Nonadherence to therapeutic regimens is a significant problem for elderly people, leading to increased morbidity and mortality and increased cost of treatment (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000).

Many nursing home admissions and hospital admissions are linked to nonadherence.

Elderly people frequently have one or more chronic illnesses that are managed with numerous medications and complicated by periodic acute episodes. Elderly people may also have other problems that affect adherence to therapeutic regimens, such as increased sensitivity to medications and their side effects, difficulty in adjusting to change and stress, financial constraints, forgetfulness, inadequate support systems, lifetime habits of self-treatment with over-the-counter medications, visual and hearing impairments, and mobility limitations. To promote adherence among the elderly, time and effort must be taken to assess all variables that may affect health behavior (Fig. 4-1). The nurse must also consider that cognitive deficiencies may be manifested by the elderly person's inability to draw inferences, apply information, or understand the major teaching points (Eliopoulos, 2000). The patient's strengths and limitations must be assessed in order to use existing strengths to compensate for limitations. Above all, health care professionals must work together to provide continuous, coordinated care; otherwise, the efforts of one health care professional may be negated by those of another.

\section*{The Nature of Teaching and Learning}

Learning can be defined as acquiring knowledge, attitudes, or skills. Teaching is defined as helping another person to learn. These definitions indicate that the teaching-learning process is an active one, requiring the involvement of both teacher and learner in the effort to reach the desired outcome, a change in behavior. The teacher does not simply give knowledge to the learner, but instead serves as a facilitator of learning.

In general, there is no definitive theory about how learning occurs and how it is affected by teaching. However, learning can be affected by factors such as readiness to learn, the learning environment, and the teaching techniques employed (Bastable, 1997; Green \& Kreuter, 1999).

\section*{LEARNING READINESS}

One of the most significant factors influencing learning is the person's learning readiness. For adults, readiness is based on culture, personal values, physical and emotional status, and past experiences

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-073.jpg?height=570&width=866&top_left_y=1880&top_left_x=1119}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 4-1 Taking time to teach patients about their medication and treatment program promotes interest and cooperation.

\end{figure}
in learning. The teachable moment for an adult occurs when the content and skills being taught are congruent with the task to be accomplished (Redman, 2000).

Culture encompasses values, ideals, and behaviors, and the traditions within each culture provide the framework for solving the issues and concerns of daily living. Because people with different cultural backgrounds hold different values, lifestyles and choices about health care vary. Culture is a major variable influencing readiness to learn because it affects how a person learns and what information can be learned. Sometimes people will not accept health teaching because it conflicts with culturally mediated values. Before beginning health teaching, the nurse must perform an individual cultural assessment instead of relying only on generalized assumptions about a particular culture. A patient's social and cultural patterns must be appropriately incorporated into the teaching-learning interaction. Chart 4-1 describes cultural assessment components to consider when formulating a teaching plan.

An individual's values include beliefs about what are desirable and undesirable behaviors. The nurse must know what value the patient places on health and health care. In clinical situations, patients express their values through the actions performed and the level of knowledge pursued (Andrews \& Boyle, 1998). When the nurse lacks knowledge about the cultural values of the patient being instructed, misunderstanding, lack of cooperation, and negative health outcomes may occur (Leininger, 1991). Each person's values and behaviors can be either an asset or a deficit to the readiness to learn. Therefore, no amount of health education will be accepted by patients unless their values and beliefs about health and illness are respected (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999).

Physical readiness is of vital importance, because until a person is physically capable of learning, attempts at teaching and learning may be both futile and frustrating. For example, someone in acute pain will be unable to focus attention away from the pain long enough to concentrate on learning. Likewise, a person who is short of breath will concentrate on breathing rather than on learning.

Emotional readiness also affects the motivation to learn. A person who has not accepted an existing illness or the threat of illness will not be motivated to learn. People who do not accept a therapeutic regimen, or who view it as conflicting with their present lifestyle, may consciously avoid learning about it. Until a

When formulating a teaching plan, consider the patient's beliefs about
- Body size, shape, boundaries, and functions
- Beauty and strength
- Value of the mind or brain
- Nature and function of blood
- Diet and nutrition
- Communication
- Gender
- Family and social support
- Physical health and illness
- Mental health and illness
- Pain
- Medicine, herbs, and talismans
- Spirituality or religion
- Where a person's essence or soul lies
person recognizes the need to learn and demonstrates an ability to learn, teaching efforts may be thwarted. However, it is not always wise to wait for a patient to become emotionally ready to learn, because that time might never come unless efforts are made by the nurse to stimulate the individual's motivation.

Illness and the threat of illness are usually accompanied by anxiety and stress. The nurse who recognizes such reactions can use simple explanations and instructions to alleviate these anxieties and provide further motivation to learn. Because learning involves changes in behavior, it normally produces mild anxiety, which can often be a useful motivating factor.

Emotional readiness can be promoted by creating a warm, accepting, positive atmosphere and by establishing realistic learning goals. When learners achieve success and a feeling of accomplishment, they experience further motivation for participating in additional learning opportunities.

Feedback about progress also motivates learning. Such feedback should be presented in the form of positive reinforcement when learners are successful and in the form of constructive suggestions for improvement when they are unsuccessful.

Experiential readiness refers to past experiences that influence a person's ability to learn. Previous educational experiences and life experiences in general are significant determinants of an individual's approach to learning. A person who has had little or no formal education may not be able to understand the instructional materials presented. A person who has had difficulty learning in the past may be hesitant to try again. Many behaviors required for reaching maximum health potential demand a rather extensive background of knowledge, physical skills, and attitudes. Without this background on which to build, learning may be very difficult and very slow. For example, someone who does not understand the basics of normal nutrition may not be able to understand the restrictions of a specific diet. A person who does not view the desired learning as personally meaningful may reject teaching efforts. A person who is not future-oriented may be unable to appreciate many aspects of preventive health teaching. Experiential readiness is closely related to emotional readiness because motivation tends to be stimulated by an appreciation for the need to learn and by those learning tasks that are familiar, interesting, and meaningful.

Before initiating a teaching-learning program, it is important to assess the learner's physical and emotional readiness to learn, as well as his or her ability to learn what is being taught. This information then becomes the basis for establishing goals that can motivate the person to learn. Involving the learner in the establishment of mutually acceptable goals serves the purpose of encouraging active involvement in the learning process and a willingness to share the responsibility for learning.

\section*{THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT}

Although learning can take place without a teacher, most people who are attempting to learn new or altered health behaviors will need the services of a nurse for at least part of the time. The interpersonal interaction between the learner and the nurse who is attempting to meet the individual's learning needs may be formal or informal, depending on the method and techniques of teaching that are found to be most appropriate.

Learning can be optimized by minimizing external variables that interfere with the learning process. For example, the room temperature, lighting, noise levels, and other environmental conditions should be appropriate to the learning situation. Also, the time selected for teaching should be suited to the individual's
needs. Scheduling a teaching session at a time of day when the patient is fatigued, uncomfortable, or anxious about a pending diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, or when visitors are present, does not provide an environment conducive to learning. However, if family members are to participate in providing care, the sessions should be timed to take place when the family is present so that they can learn any necessary skills or techniques.

\section*{TEACHING TECHNIQUES}

Teaching techniques and methods enhance learning if they are appropriate to the individual's needs. Numerous techniques are available, including lectures, group teaching, and demonstrations, all of which can be enhanced with specially prepared teaching materials. The lecture or explanation method of teaching is commonly used but should always be accompanied by discussion. Discussion is important because it affords the learner an opportunity to express feelings and concerns, to ask questions, and to receive clarification.

Group teaching is appropriate for some people because it allows them not only to receive needed information, but also to feel secure as members of a group. Those with similar problems or learning needs have the opportunity to identify with each other and gain moral support and encouragement. However, not everyone relates or learns well in groups, and some people may not benefit from such experiences. Also, if group teaching is used, assessment and follow-up of each individual are imperative to ensure that each has gained sufficient knowledge and skills.

Demonstration and practice are essential ingredients of a teaching program, especially when teaching skills. It is best to demonstrate the skill and then allow the learner ample opportunity for practice. When special equipment is involved, such as syringes for injections, colostomy bags, dialysis equipment, dressings, or suction apparatus, it is important to teach with the same equipment that will be used in the home setting. Learning to perform a skill with one kind of equipment and then having to change to a different kind may lead to confusion, frustration, and mistakes.

Teaching aids that are available to enhance learning include books, pamphlets, pictures, films, slides, audio and video tapes, models, programmed instruction, and computer-assisted learning modules. Such teaching aids are invaluable when used appropriately and can save a significant amount of personnel time and related cost. However, all such aids should be reviewed before use to ensure that they meet the individual's learning needs. Human interaction and discussion cannot be replaced by teaching technologies but may be enhanced by them (Nursing Research Profile 4-1).

Reinforcement and follow-up are important because learning takes time. Allowing ample time to learn and reinforcing what is learned are important teaching strategies; a single teaching session is rarely adequate. Follow-up sessions are imperative to promote learners' confidence in their abilities and to plan for additional teaching sessions. For hospitalized patients who may not be able to transfer what they have learned in the hospital to the home setting, follow-up after discharge is essential to ensure that they have realized the full benefits of a teaching program.

\section*{TEACHING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES}

When providing health information to people who are affected by disabilities, the individual needs of the person must be assessed and incorporated into the teaching plan; teaching techniques and

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 4-1}

\section*{Patient Education}

Mahon, S. M., \& Williams, M. (2000). Information needs regarding menopause. Cancer Nursing, 23(3), 176-185.

\section*{Purpose}

There were two main purposes for conducting this study. The first purpose was to evaluate the relevance and usefulness of a brochure designed to facilitate understanding about menopause and other related female health concerns. The second purpose was to describe the information needs of healthy women at menopause.

\section*{Study and Sample Design}

The study design was descriptive-correlational and utilized a questionnaire designed by the researchers. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed, and 161 women (ages 26 to 69 years) completed the survey. This convenience sample consisted of women who came to a nurse-managed cancer screening center. These women saw the brochure on display at the center; if they asked for a copy, they were also given a questionnaire to complete and return.

\section*{Findings}

The participants indicated that they were premenopausal ( $45 \%$ ), postmenopausal ( $40 \%$ ), or uncertain of menopausal status ( $15 \%$ ). Ninety-nine percent of the women said that the brochure was very easy to read and understand. Eighty percent found the information very relevant and important, while $31 \%$ found it somewhat relevant and important. Eighty-eight percent thought that the material in the brochure would motivate them to talk with their health care provider, and $10 \%$ did not know if it would. The topics most likely to be discussed with a health care provider were hormone replacement therapy, bone mineral density testing, risk and prevention of osteoporosis, and management of menopause.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Written educational materials are useful strategies for providing health information. Women want and will seek out information regarding menopause, particularly information that helps them to make menopause management decisions. Nurses need to obtain detailed and accurate health histories from women in order to assist them to determine their menopausal status and other individual health needs.
the imparting of information may need to be altered to accommodate them. Specific groups of people with physical disabilities, emotional disabilities, hearing and visual impairments, learning disabilities, and developmental disabilities require that the nurse be aware of their health promotion needs and institute new or modified approaches to teach them about their health. Table 4-1 outlines some of the teaching strategies to use when teaching a person with a disability.

\section*{GERONTOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS}

Nurses caring for elderly people must be aware of how the normal changes that occur with aging affect learning abilities and how an elderly person can be assisted to adjust to these changes. Above all, it is important to recognize that just because a person is elderly does not mean that he or she cannot learn. Studies have shown that older adults can learn and remember if information is paced appropriately, is relevant, and is followed by appropriate feedback strategies that apply to all learners (Rankin \& Stallings, 2000). Because changes associated with aging vary

\end{table}
significantly among elderly people, the nurse should conduct a thorough assessment of each person's level of physiologic and psychological functioning before teaching begins.

Changes in cognition with age may include slowed mental functioning; decreased short-term memory, abstract thinking, and concentration; and slowed reaction time. These changes are often accentuated by the health problems that cause the elderly to seek health care in the first place. Effective teaching strategies include a slow-paced presentation of small amounts of material at a time, frequent repetition of information, and the use of reinforcement techniques, such as audiovisual and written materials and repeated practice sessions. Distracting stimuli should be minimized as much as possible in the teaching environment.

Sensory changes associated with aging also affect teaching and learning. Teaching strategies to accommodate decreased visual acuity include large-print and easy-to-read materials printed on non-glare paper. Because color discrimination is often impaired, the use of color-coded or highlighted teaching materials may not be effective. To maximize hearing, the teacher must speak distinctly with a normal or lowered pitch, facing the person so that lip reading can occur as needed. Visual cues often help to reinforce verbal teaching.

Family members should be involved in teaching sessions when possible. They provide another source for reinforcement of material and can help the learner to recall instructions later. They can also provide valuable assessment information about the person's living situation and related learning needs.

When the nurse, the family, and other involved health care professionals work collaboratively to facilitate an elderly person's learning, the chances of success will be maximized. Successful learning for the elderly should result in improved self-care management skills, enhanced self-esteem, and a willingness to learn in future sessions.

\section*{The Nursing Process in PatientTeaching}

The steps of the nursing process-assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation-are used when constructing a teaching plan to meet an individual's teaching and learning needs (Chart 4-2).

\section*{ASSESSMENT}

Assessment in the teaching-learning process is directed toward the systematic collection of data about the person's learning needs, the person's readiness to learn, and the family's learning needs. All internal and external variables that affect the patient's readiness to learn are identified. A learning assessment guide may be used for this purpose. Some of the available guides are very general and are directed toward the collection of general health information, whereas others are specific to common medication regimens or disease processes. Such guides facilitate the assessment but must be adapted to the individual's responses, problems, and needs.

As soon as possible after completing the assessment, the nurse organizes, analyzes, synthesizes, and summarizes the data collected and determines the patient's need for teaching.

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS}

Formulating nursing diagnoses makes educational goals and evaluations of progress more specific and meaningful. Teaching is an integral intervention implied by all nursing diagnoses, and for some diagnoses education is the primary intervention. Ineffective therapeutic regimen management, Impaired home maintenance, Health-seeking behaviors, and Decisional conflict are examples of nursing diagnoses that direct planning for educational needs. The diagnosis "Deficient knowledge" should be used cautiously, because knowledge deficit is not a human response but a factor relating to or causing the diagnosis (eg, Ineffective therapeutic regimen management related to a deficiency of information about wound care is a more appropriate nursing diagnosis than "Deficient knowledge") (Carpenito, 1999). A nursing diagnosis that relates specifically to the patient's and family's learning needs will serve as a guide in the development of the teaching plan.

\section*{PLANNING}

Once the nursing diagnoses have been identified, the planning component of the teaching-learning process is established in accordance with the steps of the nursing process:
1. Assigning priorities to the diagnoses
2. Specifying the immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals of learning
3. Identifying specific teaching strategies appropriate for attaining goals

\end{tabular}
4. Specifying the expected outcomes
5. Documenting the diagnoses, goals, teaching strategies, and expected outcomes on the teaching plan
As in the nursing process, the assignment of priorities to the diagnoses should be a joint effort by the nurse and the learner or family members. Consideration must be given to the urgency of the individual's learning needs, with the most critical needs receiving the highest priority.

After the priorities of the diagnoses have been established, the immediate and long-term goals and the teaching strategies appropriate for attaining the goals are identified. Teaching is most effective when the objectives of both the learner and the nurse are in agreement (Lorig, et al., 1996). Learning begins with the establishment of goals that are appropriate to the situation and realistic in terms of the individual's ability and desire to achieve them. Involving the patient and family in establishing goals and subsequently in the planning of teaching strategies promotes their cooperation in the implementation of the teaching plan.

Expected outcomes of teaching strategies can be stated in terms of behaviors of the person, the family, or both. Outcomes should be realistic and measurable, and the critical time periods for attaining them should also be identified. The desired outcomes and the critical time periods will serve as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the teaching strategies.

During the planning phase, the nurse must consider the sequence in which the subject matter will be presented in each of the teaching strategies. Critical information (eg, survival skills for the person with diabetes) and material that the person or family identifies to be of particular importance receive high priority. An outline is often helpful for arranging the subject matter and for ensuring that all necessary information is included. Also during this time, appropriate teaching aids to be used in implementing the teaching strategies are prepared or selected.

The entire planning phase of the teaching-learning process is concluded with the formulation of the teaching plan. This teaching plan communicates the following information to all members of the nursing team:
1. The nursing diagnoses that specifically relate to the individual's learning needs and the priorities of these diagnoses
2. The goals of the teaching strategies
3. The teaching strategies, expressed in the form of teaching orders
4. The expected outcomes, which identify the desired behavioral responses of the learner
5. The critical time period within which each outcome is expected to be met
6. The individual's behavioral responses (which must be documented on the teaching plan)
The same rules that apply to writing and revising the plan of nursing care apply to the teaching plan.

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}

In the implementation phase of the teaching-learning process, the patient, the family, and other members of the nursing and health care teams carry out the activities outlined in the teaching plan. The nurse coordinates all the activities.

Flexibility during the implementation phase of the teachinglearning process and ongoing assessment of the individual's responses to the teaching strategies support modification of the teaching plan as necessary. Creativity in promoting and sustaining the learner's motivation to learn is essential. New learning
needs that may arise after discharge from the hospital or after home care visits have ended should also be taken into account.

The implementation phase is concluded when the teaching strategies have been completed and when the individual's responses to the actions have been recorded. This record serves as the basis for evaluating how well the defined goals and expected outcomes have been achieved.

\section*{EVALUATION}

Evaluation of the teaching-learning process determines how effectively the person has responded to the teaching strategies and to what extent the goals have been achieved. An important part of the evaluation phase addresses the question, "What can be done to improve the teaching and enhance the learning?" Answers to this question will direct the changes to be made in the teaching plan.

An evaluation must be made of what was done well, and what needs to be changed or reinforced. It cannot be assumed that individuals have learned just because teaching has occurred: learning does not automatically follow teaching. A variety of measurement techniques can be used to identify changes in behavior as evidence that learning has taken place. These techniques include directly observing the behavior; using rating scales, checklists, or anecdotal notes to document the behavior; and indirectly measuring results through oral questioning and written tests. Measurement of actual behavior (direct measurement) is the most accurate and appropriate technique in many patient teaching situations. Nurses often do comparative analysis using patient admission data as the baseline: selected data points observed during the period when nursing care is given and self-care was initiated are compared with the patient's baseline data.

Some examples of indirect measurements are patient satisfaction surveys, attitude surveys, and instruments that evaluate specific health status variables. All direct measurements should be supplemented with indirect measurements whenever possible. Using more than one measuring technique enhances the reliability of the resulting data and decreases the potential for error from a specific measurement strategy.

Measuring is only the beginning of evaluation. It must be followed by interpreting the data and making value judgments about the learning and teaching. Such evaluation should be conducted periodically throughout the teaching-learning program, at its conclusion, and at varying periods after the teaching has ended.

Evaluation of learning after hospitalization is highly desirable, because the analysis of teaching outcomes must extend into home care. With shortened lengths of hospital stay and with shortstay and same-day surgical procedures, follow-up evaluation in the home is especially important. Coordination of efforts and sharing of information between hospital-based and communitybased nursing personnel facilitates post-discharge teaching and home care evaluation.

Evaluation is not the end step in the teaching-learning process, but the beginning of a new patient assessment. The information gathered during evaluation should be used to redirect teaching actions, with the goal of improving the learner's responses and outcomes.

\section*{Health Promotion}

Health teaching and health promotion are linked by a common goal-to encourage people to achieve as high a level of wellness as possible so that they can live maximally healthy lives and avoid
preventable illnesses. The call for health promotion has become a cornerstone in health policy because of the need to control costs and reduce unnecessary sickness and death.

The nation's first public health agenda was established in 1979 and set goals for improving the health of all Americans. Additional goals defined as the "1990 Health Objectives" identified improvements to be made in health status, risk reduction, public awareness, health services, and protective measures (U.S. Public Health Service, 1990).

Health goals for the nation were also established in the publication, Healthy People 2000. The priorities from this initiative were identified as health promotion, health protection, and the use of preventive services. The most recent publication, Healthy People 2010, defines the current national health promotion and disease prevention initiative for the nation. The two essential goals from this report are (1) to increase the quality and years of healthy life for people, and (2) to eliminate health disparities among various segments of the population (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000) (Chart 4-3).

\section*{HEALTH AND WELLNESS}

The concept of health promotion has evolved because of a changing definition of health and an awareness that wellness exists at many levels of functioning. The definition of health as the mere absence of disease is no longer accepted. Today, health is viewed as a dynamic, ever-changing condition that enables a person to function at an optimum potential at any given time. The ideal health status is one in which people are successful in achieving their full potential regardless of any limitations they might have.

Wellness, as a reflection of health, involves a conscious and deliberate attempt to maximize one's health. Wellness does not just happen; it requires planning and conscious commitment and is the result of adopting lifestyle behaviors for the purpose of attaining one's highest potential for well-being. Wellness is not the same for every person. The person with a chronic illness or disability may still be able to achieve a desirable level of wellness. The key to wellness is to function at the highest potential within the limitations over which there is no control.

A significant amount of information has shown that people, by virtue of what they do or fail to do, influence their own health. Today, many of the major causes of illness are chronic diseases that have been closely related to lifestyle behaviors (eg, heart disease, lung and colon cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,

hypertension, cirrhosis, traumatic injury, HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] infection, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]). Consequently, a person's health status to a large extent is reflective of lifestyle.

\section*{HEALTH PROMOTION MODELS}

Since the 1950s, many health-promotion models have been constructed to identify health-protecting behaviors and to help explain what makes people engage in these preventive behaviors. A health-protecting behavior is defined as any behavior performed by people, regardless of their actual or perceived health condition, for the purpose of promoting or maintaining their health, whether or not the behavior produces the desired outcome (Downie, Fyfe, \& Tannahill, 1990). One framework, the health belief model, was devised to foster understanding of what made some healthy people choose actions to prevent illness while others refused to engage in these protective recommendations (Becker, 1974).

Another model, the resource model of preventive health behavior (Downie, Fyfe, \& Tannahill, 1990), addresses the ways that people use resources to promote health. Nurse educators can use this model to assess how demographic variables, health behaviors, and social and health resources influence health promotion. LaLonde's (1977) health determinants model views human biology, environment, lifestyle, and the health care delivery system as the four determinants of a person's health.

A model for promotion of health, designed by Becker and colleagues (1993), is based on the premise that four variables influence the selection and use of health promotion behaviors. The first variable, demographic and disease factors, includes client characteristics such as age, gender, education, employment, severity of illness or disability, and length of illness. Barriers, the next component, are defined as factors that lead to unavailability or difficulty in gaining access to a specific health promotion alternative. The third variable, resources, encompasses such items as financial and social support. The last variable, perceptual factors, consists of how people view their health status, self-efficacy, and the perceived demands of their illness. The developers of this model conducted research to substantiate that these four variables have a positive correlation with a person's quality of life.

The health promotion model developed by Pender (1996), is based on social learning theory and emphasizes the importance of motivational factors that influence the acquiring and sustaining of health-promotion behaviors. This model explores how cognitive-perceptual factors affect one's view of the importance of health. It also examines perceived control of health, self-efficacy, health status, and the benefits and barriers to health promoting behaviors.

These models, along with other examples that can be found in the health promotion literature, can serve as an organizing framework for clinical work and research that supports the enhancement of health. Further efforts, however, are needed to advance understanding of the health promotion behaviors of families and communities.

\section*{DEFINITION OF HEALTH PROMOTION}

Health promotion can be defined as those activities that assist individuals in developing resources that will maintain or enhance well-being and improve their quality of life. These activities involve a person's efforts to remain healthy in the absence of symptoms and do not require the assistance of a health care team member.

The purpose of health promotion is to focus on a person's potential for wellness and to encourage appropriate alterations in personal habits, lifestyle, and environment in ways that will reduce risks and enhance health and well-being. Health promotion is an active process; that is, it is not something that can be prescribed or dictated. It is up to the individual to decide whether to make the changes that will promote a higher level of wellness. Choices must be made, and only the individual can make these choices.

The concepts of health, wellness, health promotion, and disease prevention have been extensively addressed in the lay literature and news media as well as in professional journals. The result has been a public demand for health information and a response by health care professionals and agencies to provide this information. Health-promotion programs that were once limited to hospital settings have now moved into community settings such as clinics, schools, churches, businesses, and industry. The workplace is quickly becoming an important site for health promotion programs, as employers strive to reduce costs associated with absenteeism, health insurance, hospitalization, disability, excessive turnover of personnel, and premature death.

\section*{HEALTH PROMOTION PRINCIPLES}

Certain principles underlie the concept of health promotion as an active process: self-responsibility, nutritional awareness, stress reduction and management, and physical fitness.

\section*{Self-Responsibility}

Taking responsibility for oneself is the key to successful health promotion. The concept of self-responsibility is based on the understanding that individuals control their lives. Each of us alone must make those choices that determine how healthy our lifestyle is. As more people recognize the significant effects that lifestyle and behavior have on health, they may assume responsibility for avoiding high-risk behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, overeating, driving while intoxicated, risky sexual practices, and other unhealthy habits. They may also assume responsibility for adopting routines that have been found to have a positive influence on health, such as engaging in regular exercise, wearing a seat belt, and eating a balanced diet.

A variety of different techniques have been used to encourage people to accept responsibility for their health, ranging from extensive educational programs to reward systems. No one technique has been found to be superior to any other. Instead, self-responsibility for health promotion is very individualized and depends on a person's desires and inner motivations. Health promotion programs are important tools for encouraging people to assume responsibility for their health and to develop behaviors that improve health.

\section*{Nutrition}

Nutrition as a component of health promotion has become the focus of considerable attention and publicity. A vast array of books and magazine articles address the topics of special diets, natural foods, and the hazards of certain substances, such as sugar, salt, cholesterol, artificial colors, and food additives. Good nutrition has been suggested as the single most significant factor in determining health status and longevity.

Nutritional awareness involves an understanding of the importance of a properly balanced diet that supplies all of the es-
sential nutrients. Understanding the relationship between diet and disease is an important facet of a person's self-care. Some clinicians believe that a healthy diet is one that substitutes "natural" foods for processed and refined ones and reduces the intake of sugar, salt, fat, cholesterol, caffeine, alcohol, food additives, and preservatives.

Chapter 5 contains detailed information about the assessment of an individual's nutritional status. The chapter covers physical signs indicating nutritional status, assessment of food intake (food record, 24 -hour recall), comparison of food intake with the dietary guidelines outlined in the Food Guide Pyramid, and calculation of ideal body weight.

\section*{Stress Management}

Stress management and stress reduction are important aspects of health promotion. Studies have shown the negative effects of stress on health and a cause-and-effect relationship between stress and infectious diseases, traumatic injuries (eg, motor vehicle crashes), and some chronic illnesses. Stress has become inevitable in contemporary societies in which demands for productivity have become excessive. More and more emphasis is placed on encouraging people to manage stress appropriately and to reduce stress that is counterproductive. Techniques such as relaxation training, exercise, and modification of stressful situations are often included in health promotion programs that deal with stress. Further information on stress management, including health risk appraisal and stress reduction methods such as biofeedback and the relaxation response, can be found in Chapter 6.

\section*{Exercise}

Physical fitness is another important component of health promotion. Clinicians and researchers (Anspaugh, Hamrick \& Rosata, 1994; Edelman \& Mandle, 1998; U.S. Department of Health \& Human Services, 1996) examining the relationship between health and physical fitness have found that a regular exercise program can promote health by improving the function of the circulatory system and the lungs, decreasing cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations, lowering body weight by increasing calorie expenditure, delaying degenerative changes such as osteoporosis, and improving flexibility and overall muscle strength and endurance. On the other hand, exercise can be harmful if it is not started gradually and increased slowly in accordance with the individual's response. An exercise program should be designed specifically for the individual, with consideration given to age, physical condition, and any known cardiovascular or other risk factors. An appropriate exercise program can have a significantly positive effect on the individual's performance capacity, appearance, and general state of physical and emotional health (Nursing Research Profile 4-2).

\section*{Health PromotionThroughout the Life Span}

Health promotion is a concept and a process that extends throughout the life span. Studies have shown that the health of a child can be affected either positively or negatively by the health practices of the mother during the prenatal period. Therefore, health promotion starts before birth and extends through childhood, adulthood, and old age.

Health promotion includes health screening. The American Academy of Family Physicians has developed recommendations for periodic health examinations that identify the age

Wall, L. (2000). Changes in hope and power in lung cancer patients who exercise. Nursing Science Quarterly, 13(3), 234-242.

\section*{Purpose}

Cancer is often viewed as a life-threatening disease for which there is little hope for the future and relatively little ability to create change. The purposes of this study were to explore changes in hope and power among lung cancer patients who participated in a preoperative exercise program and to examine hope and power over time.

\section*{Sample and Study Design}

A sample of 104 preoperative lung cancer patients with a clinical diagnosis of stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or IIIA non-small cell carcinoma was recruited for the study. The participants were randomly assigned to the exercise or nonexercise group. To assess for changes in hope and power, the subjects were asked to complete questionnaires on hope (Health Hope Index) and power (Power as Knowing Participation in Change Test) at the time of diagnosis, on the day before surgery, and 4 to 6 days after surgery. The exercise group was instructed about the exercise by the investigator after completion of the first set of questionnaires. The exercise group performed the exercises daily before surgery and recorded their compliance in a journal. The nonexercise group received usual preoperative care that did not include a prescribed exercise program.

\section*{Findings}

There were no statistically significant relationships between hope or power and the number of days of exercise completed. Both groups had high levels of hope and positive expectations for the future. There were differences in power (defined as the capacity to knowingly participate in change) between the two groups, with power increased in the exercise group compared with the nonexercise group.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

It is useful for the nurse to understand how patients can effectively participate in change and promote strategies that enhance wellbeing. By encouraging preoperative exercise, nurses can help patients purposefully participate in change, make decisions about their care, and determine factors that enhance and impede them from taking steps to actively participate in their care.
groups for which specific screening interventions are appropriate. Table 4-2 presents the general population guidelines; specific population standards and guidelines have also been recommended.

\section*{CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS}

Health screening has traditionally been an important aspect of childhood health care. The goal has been to detect health problems at an early age so that they can be treated early in a child's life. Today, health promotion goes beyond the mere screening of children for disabilities and includes extensive efforts to promote positive health practices at a very young age. Because health habits and practices are formed early in life, children should be encouraged to develop positive health attitudes. For this reason, more and more programs are being offered to school-age children and to adolescents to help them develop good health habits. Although the negative results of practices such as smoking, risky sexual activities, alcohol and drug abuse, and poor nutrition are explained in these educational programs, emphasis is also placed on values training, self-esteem, and healthy lifestyle practices. The projects are designed to appeal to
a particular age group, with emphasis on learning experiences that are fun, interesting, and relevant.

\section*{YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS}

Young and middle-aged adults represent an age group that not only expresses an interest in health and health promotion but also responds enthusiastically to suggestions that show how lifestyle practices can improve health. Adults are frequently motivated to change their lifestyles in ways that are believed to enhance their health and wellness. Many adults who wish to improve their health turn to health-promotion programs to help them make the desired changes in their lifestyles. They respond in overwhelming numbers to programs that focus on topics such as general wellness, smoking cessation, exercise, physical conditioning, weight control, conflict resolution, and stress management. Because of the nationwide emphasis on health during the reproductive years, young adults actively seek programs that address prenatal health, parenting, family planning, and women's health issues.

Programs that provide health screening, such as those that screen for cancer, high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, and hearing impairments, are quite popular with this age group. Programs that cover health promotion for people with specific chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and pulmonary disease are also popular. It is becoming more evident that chronic disease and disability do not preclude health and wellness; rather, positive health attitudes and practices can promote optimal health for people who must live with the limitations imposed by their chronic illnesses and disabilities.

Health-promotion programs can be offered almost anywhere in the community. Common sites include local clinics, elementary schools, high schools, community colleges, recreation centers, churches, and even private homes. Health fairs are frequently held in civic centers and shopping malls. The outreach idea for health-promotion programs has served to meet the needs of many adults who otherwise would not avail themselves of opportunities to strive toward a healthier lifestyle.

The workplace has become a center for health-promotion activity as employers become increasingly concerned about the rising costs of health care insurance to treat illnesses that are related to lifestyle behaviors. They are also concerned about increased absenteeism and lost productivity. For these reasons, many businesses have instituted health-promotion programs in the workplace. Some employ health-promotion specialists to develop and implement the program, and others purchase packaged programs that have already been developed by health care agencies or private health-promotion corporations.

Programs offered at the workplace usually include employee health screening and counseling, physical fitness, nutritional awareness, work safety, and stress management and stress reduction. In addition, efforts are made to promote a safe and healthy work environment. Many large businesses provide exercise facilities for their employees and offer their health-promotion programs to retirees. If employers can show cost-containment benefits from such programs, their dollars will be considered well spent, and more businesses will provide health-promotion programs as a benefit of employment.

\section*{ELDERLY ADULTS}

Health promotion is as important for the elderly as it is for other age groups. Despite the fact that $80 \%$ of people older than 65 years of age have one or more chronic illnesses and about

$50 \%$ are limited in their activity, the elderly as a group experience significant gains from health promotion. Clinical work indicates that the elderly are very health-conscious and that most view their health positively and are willing to adopt practices that will improve their health and well-being (Ebersole \& Hess, 1997; Staab \& Hodges, 1996). Although their chronic illnesses and disabilities cannot be eliminated, these adults can benefit from activities that help them maintain independence and achieve an optimal level of health.

Various health-promotion programs have been developed to meet the needs of older Americans, many of which began within the Department of Health and Human Services. Both public and private organizations continue to be responsive to health promotion, and more programs that serve the elderly are emerging. Many of these programs are offered by health care agencies, churches, community centers, senior citizen residences, and a variety of other organizations. The activities directed toward health promotion for
the elderly are the same as those for other age groups: physical fitness and exercise, nutrition, safety, and stress management.

\section*{Implications for Nursing}

Nurses, by virtue of their expertise in health and health care and their long-established credibility with consumers, play a vital role in health promotion. In many instances they have initiated healthpromotion programs or have participated with other health care personnel in developing and providing wellness services in a variety of settings (Fig. 4-2).

As health care professionals, nurses have a responsibility to promote activities that foster well-being, self-actualization, and personal fulfillment. Every interaction with consumers of health care must be viewed as an opportunity to promote positive health attitudes and behaviors.

5. Discuss the techniques of measurement of body mass index, biochemical assessment, clinical examination, and assessment of food intake to assess a person's nutritional status.
6. Identify ethical considerations necessary for protecting the individual's rights related to data collected in the health history or physical examination.
7. Describe factors that may contribute to altered nutritional status in high-risk groups such as adolescents and the elderly.
8. Conduct a health history and physical and nutritional assessment of the patient at home.

$T_{\text {he }}$he ability to assess the patient is one of the most important skills of the nurse, regardless of the practice setting. In all settings where nurses interact with patients and provide care, eliciting a complete health history and using appropriate assessment skills are critical to identifying physical and psychological problems and concerns experienced by the patient. As the first step in the nursing process, patient assessment is necessary to obtain data that will enable the nurse to make a nursing diagnosis, identify and implement nursing interventions, and assess their effectiveness.

\section*{The Role of the Nurse in Assessment}

The role of the nurse in health assessment includes obtaining the patient's health history and performing a physical assessment. This role can be carried out in a variety of settings, including the acute care setting, clinic or outpatient office, school, long-term care facility, and the home. A growing list of nursing diagnoses is used by nurses to identify and categorize patient problems that nurses have the knowledge, skills, and responsibility to treat independently. All members of the health care team-physicians, nurses, nutritionists, social workers, and others-use their unique skills and knowledge to contribute to the resolution of patient problems by first obtaining a health history and physical examination. Because the focus of each member of the health care team is unique, a variety of health history and physical examination formats have been developed. Regardless of the format, the database obtained by the nurse is complementary to the databases obtained by other members of the health care team and focuses on nursing's unique concern for the patient.

\section*{Basic Guidelines for Conducting a Health Assessment}

People who seek health care for a specific problem often feel anxious. Their anxiety may be increased by fear about potential diagnoses, possible disruption of lifestyle, and other concerns. With this in mind, the nurse attempts to establish rapport, put the person at ease, encourage honest communication (Fuller \& SchallerAyers, 2000), make eye contact, and listen carefully to the person's responses to questions about health issues (Fig. 5-1).

EIGURE 5-1 A comfortable, relaxed atmosphere and an attentive interviewer are essential for a successful clinical interview.

When obtaining the health history or performing the physical examination, the nurse must be aware of his or her own nonverbal communication as well as that of the patient. The nurse takes into consideration the educational and cultural background as well as language proficiency of the patient. Questions and instructions to the patient are phrased in a way that is easily understandable. Technical terms and medical jargon are avoided. In addition, the examiner needs to be aware of the patient's disabilities or impairments (hearing, vision, cognitive, and physical limitations) and takes these into consideration during the history as well as the physical examination. At the end of the assessment, the examiner may summarize and clarify the information obtained and ask if the person has any questions; this provides an opportunity to correct misinformation and add facts that may have been omitted.

\section*{Ethical Use of History or Physical Examination Data}

A particularly important guideline for use whenever information is elicited from a person through the health history or physical examination is that the person has the right to know why the information is sought and how it will be used. For this reason, it is important to explain what the history and physical examination are, how the information will be obtained, and how it will be used (Fuller \& Schaller-Ayers, 2000). It is also important that the individual be aware that the decision to participate is voluntary. A private setting for the history interview and physical examination promotes trust and encourages open, honest communication. After the history collection and examination, the nurse selectively records the data pertinent to the patient's health status. This written record of the patient's history and physical examination findings is then maintained in a secure place and made available only to those health professionals directly involved in the care of the patient. This protects confidentiality and promotes professional conduct.

\section*{The Health History}

Throughout assessment, and particularly when obtaining the history, attention is focused on the impact of psychosocial, ethnic, and cultural background on the person's health, illness, and health-promotion behaviors. The interpersonal and physical environments, as well as the person's lifestyle and activities of daily living, are explored in depth. Many nurses are responsible for obtaining a detailed history of the person's current health problems, past medical history, family history, and a review of the person's functional status. This results in a total health profile that focuses on health as well as illness and is more appropriately called a health history rather than a medical or a nursing history.

The format of the health history traditionally combines the medical history and the nursing assessment, although formats based on nursing frameworks, such as functional health patterns, have also become a standard. Both the review of systems and patient profile are expanded to include individual and family relationships, lifestyle patterns, health practices, and coping strategies. These components of the health history are the basis of nursing assessment and can be easily adapted to address the needs of any patient population in any setting, institution, or agency.

Combining the information obtained by the physician and the nurse in one health history prevents duplication of information and minimizes efforts on the part of the person to provide
this information. This also encourages collaboration among members of the health care team who share in the collection and interpretation of the data (Butler, 1999).

\section*{THE INFORMANT}

The informant, or the person providing the health history, may not always be the patient, as in the case of a developmentally delayed, mentally impaired, disoriented, confused, unconscious, or comatose patient. The interviewer assesses the reliability of the informant and the usefulness of the information provided. For example, a disoriented patient is often unable to provide a reliable database; people who abuse drugs and alcohol often deny using these substances. The interviewer must make a judgment about the reliability of the information (based on the context of the entire interview), and he or she includes this evaluation in the record.

\section*{CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS}

When obtaining the health history, the interviewer takes into account the person's cultural background (Weber \& Kelley, 2003). Cultural attitudes and beliefs about health, illness, health care, hospitalization, the use of medications, and the use of complementary therapies are derived from each person's experiences. They vary according to the person's ethnic and cultural background. A person from another culture may have a different view of personal health practices than the health care practitioner.

Similarly, people from some ethnic and cultural backgrounds will not complain of pain, even when it is severe, because outward expressions of pain are considered unacceptable. In some instances they may refuse to take analgesics. Other cultures have their own folklore and beliefs about the treatment of illnesses. All such differences in outlook must be taken into account and accepted when caring for members of other cultures. Attitudes and beliefs about family relationships and the role of women and elderly members of a family must be respected even if those attitudes and beliefs conflict with those of the interviewer.

\section*{CONTENT OF THE HEALTH HISTORY}

When the patient is seen for the first time by a member of the health care team, the first requirement is a database (except in emergency situations). The sequence and format of obtaining data about the patient vary, but the content, regardless of format, usually addresses the same general topics. A traditional approach includes the following:
- Biographical data
- Chief complaint
- Present health concern (or present illness)
- Past history
- Family history
- Review of systems
- Patient profile

\section*{Biographical Data}

Biographical information puts the patient's health history in context. This information includes the person's name, address, age, gender, marital status, occupation, and ethnic origins. Some interviewers prefer to ask more personal questions at this part of the interview, while others wait until more trust and confidence have been established or until the patient's immediate or urgent needs
are first addressed. The patient in severe pain or with another urgent problem is unlikely to have a great deal of patience for an interviewer who is more concerned about marital or occupational status than with quickly addressing the problem at hand.

\section*{Chief Complaint}

The chief complaint is the issue that brings the person to the attention of the health care provider. Questions such as, "Why have you come to the health center today?" or "Why were you admitted to the hospital?" usually elicit the chief complaint. In the home setting, the initial question might be, "What is bothering you most today?" When a problem is identified, the person's exact words are usually recorded in quotation marks (Orient, 2000). However, a statement such as, "My doctor sent me" should be followed up with a question that identifies the probable reason why the person is seeking health care; this reason is then identified as the chief complaint.

\section*{Present Health Concern or Illness}

The history of the present health concern or illness is the single most important factor in helping the health care team to arrive at a diagnosis or determine the person's needs. The physical examination is helpful but often only validates the information obtained from the history. A careful history assists in correct selection of appropriate diagnostic tests. While diagnostic test results can be helpful, they often support rather than establish the diagnosis.

If the present illness is only one episode in a series of episodes, the entire sequence of events is recorded. For example, a history from a patient whose chief complaint is an episode of insulin shock describes the entire course of the diabetes to put the current episode in context. The details of the health concern or present illness are described from onset until the time of contact with the health care team. These facts are recorded in chronological order, beginning with, for example, "The patient was in good health until . . ." or "The patient first experienced abdominal pain 2 months prior to seeking help."

The history of the present illness or problem includes such information as the date and manner (sudden or gradual) in which the problem occurred, the setting in which the problem occurred (at home, at work, after an argument, after exercise), manifestations of the problem, and the course of the illness or problem. This includes self-treatment (including complementary therapies), medical interventions, progress and effects of treatment, and the patient's perceptions of the cause or meaning of the problem.

Specific symptoms (pain, headache, fever, change in bowel habits) are described in detail, along with the location and radiation (if pain), quality, severity, and duration. The interviewer also asks if the problem is persistent or intermittent, what factors aggravate or alleviate it, and if any associated manifestations exist.

Associated manifestations are symptoms that occur simultaneously with the chief complaint. The presence or absence of such symptoms may shed light on the origin or extent of the problem, as well as on the diagnosis. These symptoms are referred to as significant positive or negative findings and are obtained from a review of systems directly related to the chief complaint. For example, if the person reports a vague symptom such as fatigue or weight loss, all body systems are reviewed and included in this section of the history. If, on the other hand, the person's chief complaint is chest pain, only the cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal systems may be included in the history of the present illness. In either situation, both positive and negative findings are recorded to define the problem further.

\section*{Past Health History}

A detailed summary of the person's past health is an important part of the database. After determining the general health status, the interviewer may inquire about immunization status and any known allergies to medications or other substances. The dates of immunization are recorded, along with the type of allergy and adverse reactions. The person is asked to provide information, if known, about his or her last physical examination, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, eye examination, hearing tests, dental checkup, as well as Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and mammogram (if female), digital rectal examination of the prostate gland (if male), and any other pertinent tests. Previous illnesses are then discussed. Negative as well as positive responses to a list of specific diseases are recorded. Dates, or the age of the patient at the time of illness, as well as the names of the primary health care provider and hospital, the diagnosis, and the treatment are also recorded. A history of the following areas is elicited:
- Childhood illness-rubeola, rubella, polio, whooping cough, mumps, chickenpox, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, strep throat
- Adult illnesses
- Psychiatric illnesses
- Injuries-burns, fractures, head injuries
- Hospitalizations
- Surgical and diagnostic procedures
- Current medications-prescription, over-the-counter, home remedies, complementary therapies
- Use of alcohol and other drugs

If a particular hospitalization or major medical intervention is related to the present illness, the account of it is not repeated; rather, the report refers to the appropriate part of the report, such as "see history of present illness" or "see HPI" on the data sheet.

\section*{Family History}

The age and health status, or the age and cause of death, of firstorder relatives (parents, siblings, spouse, children) and secondorder relatives (grandparents, cousins) are elicited to identify diseases that may be genetic in origin, communicable, or possibly environmental in cause. The following diseases are generally included: cancer, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, mental illness, tuberculosis, kidney disease, arthritis, allergies, asthma, alcoholism, and obesity. One of the easiest methods of recording such data is by using the family tree or genogram (Fig. 5-2). The results of genetic testing or screening, if known, are recorded. See Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion of genetics.

\section*{Review of Systems}

The systems review includes an overview of general health as well as symptoms related to each body system. Questions are asked about each of the major body systems in terms of past or present symptoms. Reviewing each body system helps reveal any relevant data. Negative as well as positive answers are recorded. If the patient responds positively to questions about a particular system, the information is analyzed carefully. If any illnesses were previously mentioned or recorded, it is not necessary to repeat them in this part of the history. Instead, reference is made to the appropriate place in the history where the information can be found.

A review of systems can be organized in a formal checklist, which becomes a part of the health history. One advantage of a checklist is that it can be easily audited and is less subject to error than a system that relies heavily on the interviewer's memory.

\section*{Patient Profile}

In the patient profile, more biographical information is gathered. A complete composite, or profile, of the patient is critical to an analysis of the chief complaint and of the person's ability to deal with the problem. A complete patient profile is summarized in Chart 5-1.

The information elicited at this point in the interview is highly personal and subjective. During this stage, the person is encouraged to express feelings honestly and to discuss personal experiences. It is best to begin with general, open-ended questions and to move to direct questioning when specific facts are needed. The patient is often less anxious when the interview progresses from information that is less personal (birthplace, occupation, education) to information that is more personal (sexuality, body image, coping abilities).

A general patient profile consists of the following content areas:
- Past life events related to health
- Education and occupation
- Environment (physical, spiritual, cultural, interpersonal)
- Lifestyle (patterns and habits)
- Presence of a physical or mental disability
- Self-concept
- Sexuality
- Risk for abuse
- Stress and coping response

\section*{PAST LIFE EVENTS RELATED TO HEALTH}

The patient profile begins with a brief life history. Questions about place of birth and past places of residence help focus attention on the earlier years of life. Personal experiences during childhood or adolescence that have special significance may be elicited by asking, "Was there anything that you experienced as a child or adolescent that would be helpful for me to know about?"

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE}

New and exciting discoveries emerging from human genome research are clarifying genetic aspects of health and disease and expanding health opportunities for individuals, families, and communities around the world. These advances call for all nurses to have a heightened awareness of genetics as the core understanding of the mechanisms of disease. Genetics concepts are central to every step of the nursing process.

\section*{GENETIC ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND NURSING PRACTICE}

Nurses in all areas of practice carry out five main practice activities:
- Help to collect, report, and record genetics information
- Offer genetics information and resources
- Participate in the informed consent process and facilitate informed decision making
- Participate in ongoing management of patients with genetic conditions
- Evaluate and monitor the impact of genetic conditions, testing, and treatment on the individual and family

\section*{COMMUNITY-BASED NURSING PRACTICE}

Nurses providing community-based care:
- Participate in genetic screening (eg, prenatal screening and newborn screening)
- Provide health care regarding genetic risk factors and management of genetically related disorders in a way that respects the beliefs and concerns of specific ethnic communities
- Educate the public about the contribution of genetics to health and disease
- Engage in dialogue with the public about ethical, legal, and social issues related to genetics discoveries

\section*{CRITICAL THINKING AND DECISION MAKING}

Nurses use these skills in providing genetic-related health care when they:
- Assess and analyze family history data for genetic risk factors
- Identify those individuals and families in need of referral for genetic testing or counseling
- Ensure the privacy and confidentiality of genetics information

\section*{HEALTH EDUCATION AND PROMOTION}

Nurses in all settings should be prepared to:
- Inquire about patients' and families' desired health outcomes with regard to genetic-related conditions or risk factors
- Refer patients for genetics services when indicated
- Identify barriers to accessing genetic-related health services
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources

\section*{HEALTH ASSESSMENT}

Nurses incorporate a genetics focus into the following health assessments:
- Family history-assess for genetic-related risk factors
- Cultural, social, and spiritual assessment-assess for individual and family perceptions and beliefs around genetics topics
- Physical assessment-assess for clinical features that may suggest a genetic condition is present (eg, unusually tall stature-Marfan syndrome)
- Ethnic background-since many conditions are more common in specific ethnic populations, the nurse gathers information about ethnic background (eg, Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi Jewish populations or thalassemia in Southeast Asian populations)

\section*{GENETICS RESOURCES FOR NURSES AND PATIENTS ON THE WEB}

Genetic Alliance http://www.geneticalliance.org-a directory of support groups for patients and families with genetic conditions
Gene Clinics http://www.geneclinics.org-a listing of common genetic disorders with up-to-date clinical summaries, genetic counseling and testing information
National Organization of Rare Disorders http://www.rare diseases.org-a directory of support groups and information for patients and families with rare genetic disorders
OMIM: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/stats/html-a complete listing of inherited genetic conditions

The interviewer's intent is to encourage the person to make a quick review of his or her earlier life, highlighting information of particular significance. Although many patients may not recall anything significant, others may share information such as a personal achievement, a failure, a developmental crisis, or an instance of physical or emotional abuse.

\section*{EDUCATION AND OCCUPATION}

Inquiring about current occupation can reveal much about a person's economic status and educational preparation. A statement such as, "Tell me about your job" often elicits information about role, job tasks, and satisfaction with the position. Direct questions about past employment and career goals may be asked if the person does not provide this information.

Asking the person what kind of educational requirements were necessary to attain his or her present job is a more sensitive approach to educational background than asking whether he or she graduated from high school. Information about the patient's general financial status may be obtained by questions such as, "Do you have any financial concerns at this time?" or "Sometimes there just doesn't seem to be enough money to make ends meet. Are you finding this true?" Inquiry about the person's insurance coverage and plans for health care payment is also appropriate.

\section*{ENVIRONMENT}

The person's physical environment and its potential hazards, spiritual awareness, cultural background, interpersonal relationships, and support system are included in the concept of environment.

Past Events Related to Health
Place of birth
Places lived
Significant childhood/adolescent experiences
Education and Occupation

\section*{Physical Environment}

Information is elicited about the type of housing (apartment, duplex, single-family) in which the person lives, its location, the level of safety and comfort within the home and neighborhood, and the presence of environmental hazards (eg, isolation, potential fire risks, inadequate sanitation). The patient's environment takes on special importance if the patient is homeless or living in a homeless shelter or has a disability.

\section*{Spiritual Environment}

The term "spiritual environment" refers to the degree to which a person thinks about or contemplates his or her existence, accepts challenges in life, and seeks and finds answers to personal questions. Spirituality may be expressed through identification with a particular religion. Spiritual values and beliefs often direct a person's behavior and approach to health problems and can influence responses to sickness. Illness may create a spiritual crisis and can place considerable stress on a person's internal resources and beliefs. Inquiring about spirituality can identify possible support systems as well as beliefs and customs that need to be considered in planning care. Thus, information is gathered in the following three areas:
- The extent to which religion is a part of the person's life
- Religious beliefs related to the person's perception of health and illness
- Religious practices

The following questions can be used in a spiritual assessment:
- Is religion or God important to you?
- If yes, in what way?
- If no, what is the most important thing in your life?
- Are there any religious practices that are important to you?
- Do you have any spiritual concerns because of your present health problem?

\section*{Interpersonal and Cultural Environment}

Cultural influences, relationships with family and friends, and the presence or absence of a support system are all a part of one's interpersonal environment. The beliefs and practices that have been shared from generation to generation are known as cultural or ethnic patterns. They are expressed through language, dress, dietary choices, and role behaviors, in perceptions of health and illness, and in health-related behaviors. The influence of these beliefs and customs on how a person reacts to health problems and interacts with health care providers cannot be underestimated (Fuller \& Schaller-Ayers, 2000). For this reason, the health history includes information about ethnic identity (cultural and social) and racial identity (biologic). The following questions may assist in obtaining relevant information:
- Where did your parents or ancestors come from? When?
- What language do you speak at home?
- Are there certain customs or values that are important to you?
- Is there anything special you do to keep in good health?
- Do you have any specific practices for treating illness?

\section*{Family Relationships and Support System}

An assessment of family structure (members, ages, roles), patterns of communication, and the presence or absence of a support system is an integral part of the patient profile. Although the traditional family is recognized as a mother, a father, and children, many different types of living arrangements exist within our society. "Family" may mean two or more people bound by emotional ties or commitments. Live-in companions, roommates, and close friends can all play a significant role in an individual's support system.

\section*{LIFESTYLE}

The lifestyle section of the patient profile provides information about health-related behaviors. These behaviors include patterns of sleep, exercise, nutrition, and recreation, as well as personal habits such as smoking and the use of drugs, alcohol, and caffeine. Although most people readily describe their exercise patterns or recreational activities, many are unwilling to report their smoking, alcohol use, and drug use; many deny or understate the degree to which they use such substances. Questions such as, "What kind of alcohol do you enjoy drinking at a party?" may elicit more accurate information than, "Do you drink?" The specific type of alcohol (eg, wine, liquor, beer) and the amount ingested per day or per week (eg, 1 pint of whiskey daily for 2 years) are described.

When alcohol abuse is suspected, additional information may be obtained by using common alcohol screening questionnaires such as the CAGE (Cutting down, Annoyance by criticism, Guilty feelings, and Eye-openers), AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), TWEAK (Tolerance, Worry, Eye-opener, Amnesia, Kut down), or SMAST (Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test). Chart 5-2 shows the CAGE Questions Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGEAID).

Similar questions can be used to elicit information about smoking and caffeine consumption. Questions about drug use follow naturally after questions about smoking, caffeine consumption, and alcohol use. A nonjudgmental approach will make
it easier for the person to respond truthfully and factually. If street names or unfamiliar terms are used to describe drugs, the person is asked to define the terms used.

Investigation of lifestyle should also include questions about complementary and alternative therapies. It is estimated that as many as $40 \%$ of Americans use some type of complementary or alternative therapies, including special diets, the use of prayer, visualization, or guided imagery, massage, meditation, herbal products, and many others (Evans, 2000; King, Pettigrew \& Reed, 1999; Kuhn, 1999). Marijuana is used for symptom management, especially pain, in a number of chronic conditions (Mathre, 2001).

\section*{PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY}

The general patient profile also needs to contain questions about any hearing, vision, cognitive, or physical disability. The presence of an obvious physical deformity-for instance, if the patient walks with crutches or needs a wheelchair to get around-needs further investigation. The etiology of the disability should be elicited; the length of time the patient has had the disability and the impact on function and health access are important to assess.

\section*{SELF-CONCEPT}

Self-concept refers to one's view of oneself, an image that has developed over many years. To assess self-concept, the interviewer might ask the person how he or she views life: "How do you feel about your life in general?" A person's self-concept can be threatened very easily by changes in physical function or appearance or other threats to health. The impact of certain medical conditions or surgical interventions, such as a colostomy or a mastectomy, can threaten body image. Asking, "Do you have any particular concerns about your body?" may elicit useful information about self-image.

\section*{SEXUALITY}

No area of assessment is more personal than the sexual history. Interviewers are frequently uncomfortable with such questions and ignore this area of the patient profile or conduct a very cursory interview at this point. Lack of knowledge about sexuality and anxiety about one's own sexuality may hamper the interviewer's effectiveness in dealing with this subject (Ross, ChannonLittle \& Rosser, 2000).

Sexual assessment can be approached at the end of the interview, at the time interpersonal or lifestyle factors are assessed, or it can be a part of the genitourinary history within the review of systems. For instance, it may be easier to approach a discussion of sexuality after a discussion of menstruation. A similar discussion with the male patient would follow questions related to the urinary system.

Obtaining the sexual history provides an opportunity to discuss sexual matters openly and gives the person permission to express sexual concerns to an informed professional. The interviewer must be nonjudgmental and must use language appropriate to the patient's age and background. It is advisable to begin the assessment with a general question concerning the person's developmental stage and the presence or absence of intimate relationships. Such questions may lead to a discussion of concerns related to sexual expression or the quality of a relationship, or to questions about contraception, risky sexual behaviors, and safer sex practices.

Finding out whether a person is sexually active should precede any attempts to explore issues related to sexuality and sexual function. Care should be taken to initiate conversations about sexu-
ality with elderly patients and not to treat them as asexual beings (Miller, Zylstra \& Stranridge, 2000). Questions are worded in such a way that the person feels free to discuss his or her sexuality regardless of marital status or sexual preference. Direct questions are usually less threatening when prefaced with such statements as, "Most people feel that . . ." or "Many people worry about. . . ." This suggests the normalcy of such feelings or behavior and encourages the person to share information that might otherwise be omitted from fear of seeming "different."

If the person answers abruptly or does not wish to carry the discussion any further, then the interviewer should move to the next topic. However, introducing the subject of sexuality indicates to the person that a discussion of sexual concerns is acceptable and can be approached again in the future if so desired. Further discussion of the sexual history is presented in Chapters 46 and 49.

\section*{RISK FOR ABUSE}

A topic of growing importance in today's society is physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. Such abuse occurs at all ages, to men and women from all socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural groups (Little, 2000; Marshall, Benton \& Brazier, 2000). Few patients, however, will discuss this topic unless they are asked specifically about it. Therefore, it is important to ask direct questions, such as:
- Is anyone physically hurting you?
- Has anyone ever hurt you physically or threatened to do so?
- Are you ever afraid of anyone close to you (your partner, caretaker, or other family members)?

If the person's response indicates that abuse is a risk, further assessment is called for and efforts are made to ensure the person's safety and provide access to appropriate community and professional resources and support systems. Further discussion

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

A health history from the elderly patient should be obtained in a calm, unrushed manner. Because of the increased incidence of impaired hearing and sight in the elderly, lighting should be adequate but not glaring, and distracting noises should be kept to a minimum (Miller, Zylstra \& Standridge, 2000). The interviewer should assume a position that enables the person to read lips and facial expressions. People who normally use a hearing aid are asked to use it during the interview. The interviewer should also recognize that there is wide diversity among the elderly population and that differences exist in health, gender, income, and functional status (Bakshi \& Miller, 1999; Ludwick, Dieckman \& Snelson, 1999).

Elderly people often assume that new physical problems are a result of age rather than a treatable illness. In addition, the signs and symptoms of illness in the elderly are often more subtle than those in younger people and may go unreported. Therefore, the interviewer inquires about subtle physical symptoms and recent changes in function and well-being. Special care is taken in obtaining a complete history of medications used, because many elderly people take many different kinds of prescription and over-the-counter medications (Palmer, 1999). Although elderly people may experience a decline in mental function, it should not be assumed that an elderly person is unable to provide an adequate history. Including a member of the family in the interview process, however (ie, spouse, adult child, sibling, or caretaker), may validate information and provide missing details. Further details about assessment of the elderly are provided in Chapter 12.
of domestic violence and abuse is presented in Chapter 46. When questioned directly, elderly patients rarely admit to abuse (Marshall, Benton \& Brazier, 2000). Health care professionals should assess for risk factors, such as high levels of stress or alcoholism in caregivers, evidence of violence, high emotions as well as financial, emotional, or physical dependency. Patients who are elderly or disabled are at increased risk for abuse and should be asked about it as a routine part of assessment.

\section*{STRESS AND COPING RESPONSES}

Each person handles stress differently. How well we adapt depends on our ability to cope. During a health history, past coping patterns and perceptions of current stresses and anticipated outcomes are explored to identify the person's overall ability to handle stress. It is especially important to identify expectations that the person may have of family, friends, and caregivers in providing financial, emotional, or physical support.

\section*{OTHER HEALTH HISTORY FORMATS}

The health history format discussed in this chapter is only one possible format that is useful in obtaining and organizing information about a person's health status. Some consider this traditional format to be inappropriate for nurses because it does not focus exclusively on the assessment of human responses to actual or potential health problems. Several attempts have been made to develop an assessment format and database with this focus in mind. One example is the nursing database prototype based on the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association's (NANDA) Unitary Person Framework and its nine human response patterns: exchanging, communicating, relating, valuing, choosing, moving, perceiving, knowing, and feeling. Although there is support in nursing for using this approach, no consensus for its use has been reached.

The National Center for Health Services Research of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other groups from the public and private sectors have focused on assessing not only biologic health but also other dimensions of health. These dimensions include physical, functional, emotional, mental, and social health. Modern efforts to assess health status have focused on the manner in which disease or disability affects the patient's functional status-that is, the ability of the person to function normally and perform his or her usual physical, mental, and social activities. An emphasis on functional assessment is viewed as more holistic than the traditional health or medical history. Instruments to assess health status in these ways may be used by nurses along with their own clinical assessment skills to determine the impact of illness, disease, disability, and health problems on functional status.

Health concerns that are not complex (earache, tonsillectomy) and can be resolved in a short period of time usually do not require the depth or detail that is required when a person is experiencing a major illness or health problem. Additional assessments that go beyond the general patient profile may be used when the patient's health problems are acute and complex or when the illness is chronic. Individuals should be asked about their continuing health promotion and screening practices. Patients who have not been involved in these practices in the past are educated about their importance and are referred to appropriate health care providers.

Regardless of the assessment format used, the nurse's focus during data collection is different from that of the physician and other health team members; however, it complements these approaches and encourages collaboration among the health care providers, as each member brings his or her own expertise and focus to the situation.

\section*{Physical Assessment}

Physical assessment, or the physical examination, is an integral part of nursing assessment. The basic techniques and tools used in performing a physical examination are described in general in this chapter. The examination of specific systems, including special maneuvers, is described in the appropriate chapters throughout the book. Because the patient's nutritional status is an important factor in health and well-being, a section on nutritional assessment is included in this chapter.

The physical examination is usually performed after the health history is obtained. It is carried out in a well-lighted, warm area. The patient is asked to undress and draped appropriately so that only the area to be examined is exposed. The person's physical and psychological comfort is considered at all times. Procedures and sensations to expect are described to the patient before each part of the examination. The examiner's hands are washed before and immediately after the examination. Fingernails are kept short to avoid injuring the patient. The examiner wears gloves when there is a possibility of coming into contact with blood or other body secretions during the physical examination.

An organized and systematic examination is the key to obtaining appropriate data in the shortest time. Such an approach encourages cooperation and trust on the part of the patient. The individual's health history provides the examiner with a health profile that guides all aspects of the physical examination. Although the sequence of physical examination depends on the circumstances and on the patient's reason for seeking health care, the complete examination usually proceeds as follows:
- Skin
- Head and neck
- Thorax and lungs
- Breasts
- Cardiovascular system
- Abdomen
- Rectum
- Genitalia
- Neurologic system
- Musculoskeletal system

In clinical practice, all relevant body systems are tested throughout the physical examination, not necessarily in the sequence described (Weber \& Kelley, 2003). For example, when the face is examined, it is appropriate to check for facial asymmetry and, thus, for the integrity of the seventh cranial nerve; the examiner does not need to repeat this as part of a neurologic examination. When systems are combined in this manner, the patient does not need to change positions repeatedly, which can be exhausting and timeconsuming.

A "complete" physical examination is not routine. Many of the body systems are selectively assessed on the basis of the individual's presenting problem. If, for example, a healthy 20 -year-old college student requires an examination to play basketball and reports no history of neurologic abnormality, the neurologic assessment is brief. Conversely, a history of transient numbness and diplopia (double vision) usually necessitates a complete neurologic investigation. Similarly, a person with chest pain receives a much more intensive examination of the chest and heart than the person with an earache. In general, the individual's health history guides the examiner in obtaining additional data for a complete picture of the patient's health.

The process of learning physical examination requires repetition and reinforcement in a clinical setting. Only after basic phys-
ical assessment techniques are mastered can the examiner tailor the routine screening examination to include thorough assessments of a particular system, including special maneuvers.

The basic tools of the physical examination are vision, hearing, touch, and smell. These human senses may be augmented by special tools (eg, stethoscope, ophthalmoscope, and reflex hammer) that are extensions of the human senses; they are simple tools that anyone can learn to use well. Expertise comes with practice, and sophistication comes with the interpretation of what is seen and heard. The four fundamental techniques used in the physical examination are inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation (Weber \& Kelley, 2003).

\section*{INSPECTION}

The first fundamental technique is inspection or observation. General inspection begins with the first contact with the patient. Introducing oneself and shaking hands provide opportunities for making initial observations: Is the person old or young? How old? How young? Does the person appear to be his or her stated age? Is the person thin or obese? Does the person appear anxious or depressed? Is the person's body structure normal or abnormal? In what way, and how different from normal? It is essential to pay attention to the details in observation. Vague, general statements are not a substitute for specific descriptions based on careful observation; for example:
- "The person appears sick." In what way does he or she appear sick? Is the skin clammy, pale, jaundiced, or cyanotic; is the person grimacing in pain; is breathing difficult; does he or she have edema? What specific physical features or behavioral manifestations indicate that the person is "sick"?
- "The person appears chronically ill." In what way does he or she appear chronically ill? Does the person appear to have lost weight? People who lose weight secondary to muscle-wasting diseases (eg, AIDS, malignancy) have a different appearance than those who are merely thin, and weight loss may be accompanied by loss of muscle mass or atrophy. Does the skin have the appearance of chronic ill-ness-that is, is it pale, or does it give the appearance of dehydration or loss of subcutaneous tissue? These important observations are documented in the patient's chart or health record.

Among general observations that should be noted in the initial examination of the patient are posture and stature, body movements, nutrition, speech pattern, and vital signs.

\section*{Posture and Stature}

The posture that a person assumes often provides valuable information about the illness. Patients who have breathing difficulties (dyspnea) secondary to cardiac disease prefer to sit and may report feeling short of breath lying flat for even a brief time. People with obstructive pulmonary disease not only sit upright but also may thrust their arms forward and laterally onto the edge of the bed (tripod position) to place accessory respiratory muscles at an optimal mechanical advantage. Those with abdominal pain due to peritonitis prefer to lie perfectly still; even slight jarring of the bed will cause agonizing pain. In contrast, patients with abdominal pain due to renal or biliary colic are often restless and may pace the room. Patients with meningeal irritation may experience head or neck pain on bending the head or flexing their knees.

\section*{Body Movements}

Abnormalities of body movement may be of two general kinds: generalized disruption of voluntary or involuntary movement, and asymmetry of movement. The first category includes tremors of a wide variety; some tremors may occur at rest (Parkinson's disease), whereas others occur only on voluntary movement (cerebellar ataxia). Other tremors may exist during both rest and activity (alcohol withdrawal syndrome, thyrotoxicosis). Some voluntary or involuntary movements are fine, others quite coarse. At the extreme are the convulsive movements of epilepsy or tetanus and the choreiform (involuntary and irregular) movements of patients with rheumatic fever or Huntington's disease. Other aspects of body movement that are noted on inspection include spasticity, muscle spasms, and an abnormal gait.

Asymmetry of movement, in which only one side of the body is affected, may occur with disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), principally in those patients who have had cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). The patient may have drooping of one side of the face, weakness or paralysis of the extremities on one side of the body, and a foot-dragging gait. Spasticity (increased muscle tone) may also be present, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis.

\section*{Nutrition}

Nutritional status is important to note. Obesity may be generalized as a result of excessive intake of calories or may be specifically localized to the trunk in those with endocrine disorders (Cushing's disease) or those who have been taking corticosteroids for long periods of time. Loss of weight may be generalized as a result of inadequate caloric intake or may be seen in loss of muscle mass with disorders that affect protein synthesis. Nutritional assessment is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

\section*{Speech Pattern}

Speech may be slurred because of CNS disease or because of damage to cranial nerves. Recurrent damage to the laryngeal nerve will produce hoarseness, as will disorders that produce edema or swelling of the vocal cords. Speech may be halting, slurred, or interrupted in flow in some CNS disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis).

\section*{Vital Signs}

The recording of vital signs is a part of every physical examination. Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature measurements are obtained and recorded. Acute changes and trends over time are documented; unexpected changes and values that deviate significantly from the patient's normal values are brought to the attention of the patient's primary health care provider. The "fifth vital sign," pain, is also assessed and documented, if indicated.

Fever is an increase in body temperature above normal. A normal oral temperature for most people is an average of $37.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ); however, some variation is normal. Some people's temperatures are quite normal at $36.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ and others at $37.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $99^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ). There is a normal diurnal variation of a degree or two in body temperature throughout the day; with temperature usually lowest in the morning and rising during the day to between $37.3^{\circ}$ and $37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(99^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.99.5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, then decreasing again during the night.

\section*{PALPATION}

Palpation is a vital part of the physical examination. Many structures of the body, although not visible, may be assessed through the techniques of light and deep palpation (Fig. 5-3). Examples include superficial blood vessels, lymph nodes, the thyroid, the organs of the abdomen and pelvis, and the rectum. When the abdomen is examined, auscultation is performed before palpation and percussion to avoid altering bowel sounds.

Sounds generated within the body, if within specified frequency ranges, also may be detected through touch. Thus, certain murmurs generated in the heart or within blood vessels (thrills) may be detected. Thrills cause a sensation to the hand much like the purring of a cat. Voice sounds are transmitted along the bronchi to the periphery of the lung. These may be perceived by touch and may be altered by disorders affecting the lungs. The phenomenon is called tactile fremitus and is useful in assessing diseases of the chest. The significance of these findings is discussed in the relevant chapters of this book.

\section*{PERCUSSION}

The technique of percussion (Fig. 5-4) translates the application of physical force into sound. It is a skill requiring practice but one that yields much information about disease processes in the chest and abdomen. The principle is to set the chest wall or abdominal wall into vibration by striking it with a firm object. The sound produced reflects the density of the underlying structure. Certain densities produce sounds as percussion notes. These sounds, listed in a se-

FIGURE 5-4 Percussion technique. The middle finger of one hand strikes the terminal phalanx of the middle finger of the other hand, which is placed firmly against the body. If the action is performed sharply, a brief resonant tone will be produced. The clarity of the tone depends on the brevity of the action. The intensity of the tone varies with the force used.

quence that proceeds from the least to the most dense, are called tympany, hyperresonance, resonance, dullness, and flatness. Tympany is the drumlike sound produced by percussing the air-filled stomach. Hyperresonance is audible when one percusses over inflated lung tissue in someone with emphysema. Resonance is the sound elicited over air-filled lungs. Percussion of the liver produces a dull sound, whereas percussion of the thigh results in flatness.

Percussion allows the examiner to assess such normal anatomic details as the borders of the heart and the movement of the diaphragm during inspiration. One may determine the level of pleural effusion (fluid in the pleural cavity) and the location of a consolidated area caused by pneumonia or atelectasis (collapse) of a lobe of the lung. The use of percussion is described further with disorders of the thorax and abdomen.

\section*{AUSCULTATION}

Auscultation is the skill of listening to sounds produced within the body created by the movement of air or fluid. Examples include breath sounds, the spoken voice, bowel sounds, cardiac murmurs, and heart sounds. Physiologic sounds may be normal (eg, first and second heart sounds) or pathologic (eg, heart murmurs in diastole, or crackles in the lung). Some normal sounds may be distorted by abnormalities of structures through which the sound must travel (eg, changes in the character of breath sounds as they travel through the consolidated lung of the patient with lobar pneumonia).

Sound produced within the body, if of sufficient amplitude, may be detected with the stethoscope, which functions as an extension of the human ear and channels sound. Two end pieces are available for the stethoscope: the bell and the diaphragm. The bell is used to assess very-low-frequency sounds such as diastolic heart murmurs. The entire surface of the bell's disc is placed lightly on the skin surface to avoid flattening the skin and reducing audible vibratory sensations. The diaphragm, the larger disc, is used to assess high-frequency sounds such as heart and lung sounds and is held in firm contact with the skin surface (Fig. 5-5). Touching the tubing or rubbing other surfaces (hair, clothing) during auscultation is avoided to minimize extraneous noises.

Sound produced by the body, like any other sound, is characterized by intensity, frequency, and quality. Intensity, or loudness, associated with physiologic sound is low; thus, the use of the

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}
stethoscope is needed. Frequency, or pitch, of physiologic sound is in reality "noise" in that most sounds consist of a frequency spectrum as opposed to the single-frequency sounds that we associate with music or the tuning fork. The frequency spectrum may be quite low, yielding a rumbling noise, or comparatively high, producing a harsh or blowing sound. Quality of sound relates to overtones that allow one to distinguish between different sounds. Sound quality enables the examiner to distinguish between the musical quality of high-pitched wheezing and the lowpitched rumbling of a diastolic murmur.

\section*{Nutritional Assessment}

An additional area of concern that is often integrated into the health history and physical examination is an in-depth nutritional assessment. Nutrition is important to maintain health and to prevent disease and death (Kant, Schatzkin, Graubard \& Schairer, 2000; Landi, Onder, Gambassi et al., 2000; Stampfer, Hu \& Manson, 2000). Disorders caused by nutritional deficiency, overeating, or eating poorly balanced meals are among the leading causes of illness and death in the United States today. The three leading causes of death are related, in part, to consequences of unhealthy nutrition: heart disease, cancer, and stroke (Hensrud, 1999). Other examples of health problems associated with poor nutrition include obesity, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, diverticulitis, and eating disorders. When illness or injury occurs, optimal nutrition is an essential factor in promoting healing and resisting infection and other complications (Braunschweig, Gomez \& Sheean, 2000). Assessment of a person's nutritional status provides information on obesity, undernutrition, weight loss, malnutrition, deficiencies in specific nutrients, metabolic abnormalities, the effects of medications on nutrition, and special problems of the hospitalized patient and the person who is cared for in the home and in other community settings.

Certain signs and symptoms that suggest possible nutritional deficiency are easy to note because they are specific. Other physical signs may be subtle and must be carefully assessed. A physical sign that suggests a nutritional abnormality should be pursued further. For example, certain signs that may appear to indicate nutritional deficiency may actually reflect other systemic conditions (eg, endocrine disorders, infectious disease). Others may result from impaired digestion, absorption, excretion, or storage of nutrients in the body.

The sequence of assessment of parameters may vary, but evaluation of nutritional status includes one or more of the following methods: measurement of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference; biochemical measurements (albumin, transferrin, prealbumin, retinol-binding protein, total lymphocyte count, electrolyte levels, creatinine/height index); clinical examination findings; and dietary data.

\section*{BODY MASS INDEX}

BMI is a ratio based on body weight and height. The obtained value is compared to the established standards; however, trends or changes in values over time are considered more useful than isolated or one-time measurements. BMI (Fig. 5-6) is highly correlated with body fat, but increased lean body mass or a large body frame can also increase the BMI. Individuals who have a BMI below 24 (or who are $80 \%$ or less of their desirable body weight for height) are at increased risk for problems associated with poor nutritional status. In addition, a low BMI is associated with higher mortality rates in hospitalized patients and community-dwelling elderly (Landi et al., 2000; Landi, Zuccala, Gambassi et al., 1999).

Those who have a BMI of 25 to 29 are considered overweight; those with a BMI of 30 to 39 are considered obese; above 40 is considered extreme obesity (National Institutes of Health, 2000).

It is important to assess for usual body weight and height. Current weight does not provide information about recent changes in weight; therefore, the patient is asked about his or her

\section*{Calculating Ideal Body Weight}

Women
- Allow 100 lb for 5 feet of height.
- Add 5 lb for each additional inch over 5 feet.
- Subtract $10 \%$ for small frame; add $10 \%$ for large frame.

Men
- Allow 106 lb for 5 feet of height.
- Add 6 lb for each additional inch over 5 feet.
- Subtract $10 \%$ for small frame, add $10 \%$ for large frame.

Example: Ideal body weight for a $5^{\prime} 6^{\prime \prime}$ adult is

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
& Female & Male \\
\hline $5^{\prime}$ of height & 100 lb & 106 lb \\
Per additional inch & $6^{\prime \prime} \times 5 \mathrm{lb} /$ inch & $6^{\prime \prime} \times 6 \mathrm{lb} /$ inch \\
& $=30 \mathrm{lb}$ & $=36 \mathrm{lb}$ \\
Ideal body weight & $130 \mathrm{lb} \pm 13 \mathrm{lb}$ & $142 \mathrm{lb} \pm 14 \mathrm{lb}$ \\
& depending on & depending on \\
& frame size & frame size
\end{tabular}
usual body weight (Chart 5-3). Decreased height may be due to osteoporosis, an important problem related to nutrition, especially in postmenopausal women. A loss of 2 or 3 inches of height may indicate osteoporosis.

In addition to the calculation of BMI, waist circumference measurement is particularly useful for patients who are catego-

rized as of normal weight or overweight. To measure waist circumference, a tape measure is placed in a horizontal plane around the abdomen at the level of the iliac crest. Men who have waist circumferences greater than 40 inches and women who have waist circumferences greater than 35 inches have excess abdominal fat. Those with a high waist circumference are at increased risk of diabetes, dyslipidemias, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (National Institutes of Health, 2000).

\section*{BIOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT}

Biochemical assessment reflects both the tissue level of a given nutrient and any abnormality of metabolism in the utilization of nutrients. These determinations are made from studies of serum (serum protein, serum albumin and globulin, transferrin, retinolbinding protein, hemoglobin, serum vitamin A, carotene, and vitamin C) and studies of urine (creatinine, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and iodine). Some of these tests, while reflecting recent intake of the elements detected, can also identify below-normal levels when there are no clinical symptoms of deficiency (see Table 5-1 for a description of serum protein indices).

Low serum albumin and transferrin levels are often used as measures of protein deficits in adults and are expressed as percentages of normal values. Albumin synthesis depends on normal liver function and an adequate supply of amino acids. Because the body stores a large amount of albumin, the serum albumin level may not decrease until malnutrition is severe; thus, its usefulness in detecting recent protein depletion is limited. Decreased albumin levels may be due to overhydration, liver or renal disease, and excessive protein loss because of burns, major surgery, infection, and cancer (Dudek, 2000). Transferrin is a protein that binds and carries iron from the intestine through the serum. Because of its short half-life, decreased transferrin levels respond more quickly to protein depletion than albumin. Serial measurements of these, as well as prealbumin levels, are used to assess the results of nutritional therapy.

Although not available from many laboratories, retinol-binding protein may be a useful means of monitoring acute, short-term changes in protein status.

Reduced total lymphocyte count in people who become acutely malnourished as a result of stress and low-calorie feeding are associated with impaired cellular immunity (Dudek, 2000). Anergy, the absence of an immune response to injection of small concentrations of recall antigen under the skin, may also indicate malnutrition because of delayed antibody synthesis and response.

Serum electrolyte levels provide information about fluid and electrolyte balance and kidney function. The creatinine/height index calculated over a 24 -hour period assesses the metabolically active tissue and indicates the degree of protein depletion, comparing expected body mass for height and actual body cell mass. A 24 -hour urine sample is obtained, and the amount of creatinine is measured and compared to normal ranges based on the

patient's height and gender. Values less than normal may indicate loss of lean body mass and protein malnutrition.

\section*{CLINICAL EXAMINATION}

The state of nutrition is often reflected in a person's appearance. Although the most obvious physical sign of good nutrition is a normal body weight with respect to height, body frame, and age, other tissues can serve as indicators of general nutritional status and adequate intake of specific nutrients; these include the hair, skin, teeth, gums, mucous membranes, mouth and tongue, skeletal muscles, abdomen, lower extremities, and thyroid gland (Table 5-2). Specific aspects of clinical examination useful in identifying nutritional deficits include oral examination and assessment of skin for turgor, edema, elasticity, dryness, subcutaneous tone, poorly healing wounds and ulcers, purpura, and bruises. The musculoskeletal examination also provides information about muscle wasting and weakness.

\section*{DIETARY DATA}

The appraisal of food intake considers the quantity and quality of the diet and also the frequency with which certain food items and nutrients are consumed. Commonly used methods of determining individual eating patterns include the food record and the 24-hour food recall, which can help estimate if the food intake is adequate and appropriate. If these methods are used, instructions about measurement and recording food intake are given when the patient's dietary history is obtained.

The food record is used most often in nutritional status studies. The person is instructed to keep a record of food actually consumed over a period of time, varying from 3 to 7 days, and to accurately estimate and describe the specific foods consumed. Food records are fairly accurate if the person is willing to provide factual information and able to estimate food quantities.

\section*{24-Hour Recall}

The 24 -hour recall method is, as the name implies, a recall of food intake over a 24 -hour period. The person is asked by the interviewer to recall all food eaten during the previous day and to estimate the quantities of the food consumed. Because information does not always represent usual intake, at the end of the interview the patient is asked if the previous day's food intake was a typical one. To obtain supplementary information about the typical diet, the interviewer also asks how frequently the person eats foods from the major food groups.

\section*{CONDUCTING THE DIETARY INTERVIEW}

The success of the interviewer in obtaining information for dietary assessment depends on effective communication, which requires that good rapport be established to promote respect and trust. The interviewer explains the purpose of the interview. It is conducted in a nondirective and exploratory way, allowing the respondent to express feelings and thoughts while encouraging him or her to answer specific questions. The manner in which questions are asked will influence the respondent's cooperation. Thus, the interviewer must be nonjudgmental and avoid expressing disapproval, either verbally or by facial expression.

\section*{Character of General Intake}

Several questions may be necessary to elicit the information needed. When attempting to elicit information about the type and quantity of food eaten at a particular time, the interviewer avoids leading questions, such as, "Do you use sugar or cream in your coffee?" Also, assumptions are not made about the size of servings; instead, questions are phrased so that quantities are more clearly determined. For example, to help determine the size of one hamburger eaten, the patient may be asked, "How many servings were prepared with the pound of meat you bought?" Another approach to determining quantities is to use food models of known sizes in estimating portions of meat, cake, or pie or to record quantities in common measurements, such as cups or spoonfuls (or according to the size of containers, when discussing intake of bottled beverages).

In recording a particular combination dish, such as a casserole, it is useful to ask for the ingredients in the recipe, recording the largest quantities first. When recording quantities of ingredients, one notes whether the food item was raw or cooked and the number of servings provided by the recipe. When the client lists the foods for the recall questionnaire, it may be helpful to read back the list of foods and ask if anything was forgotten, such as fruit, cake, candy, between-meal snacks, or alcoholic beverages.

Additional information obtained during the interview should include methods of preparing food, sources available for food (donated foods, food stamps), food-buying practices, vitamin and mineral supplements, and income range.

\section*{Cultural and Religious Considerations}

An individual's culture determines to a large extent which foods are eaten and how they are prepared and served. Culture and religious practices together often determine if certain foods are prohibited and if certain foods and spices are eaten on certain holidays or at specific family gatherings. Because of the importance of culture and religious beliefs to many individuals, it is important to be sensitive to these factors when obtaining a dietary history. It
is, however, equally important not to stereotype individuals and assume that because they are from a certain culture or religious group, they adhere to specific dietary customs.

Culturally sensitive materials, such as the food pagoda, are available for making appropriate dietary recommendations (The Chinese Nutrition Society, 1999).

\section*{EVALUATING THE DIETARY INFORMATION}

After the dietary information has been obtained, the nurse evaluates the patient's dietary intake. If the goal is to determine if the person generally eats a healthful diet, the food intake may be compared to the dietary guidelines outlined in the USDA's Food Guide Pyramid (Fig. 5-7). The pyramid divides foods into five major groups and offers recommendations for variety in the diet, proportion of food from each food group, and moderation in eating fats, oils, and sweets. The person's food intake is compared with recommendations based on various food groups for various age levels.

If the nurse or dietitian is interested in knowing about the intake of specific nutrients, such as vitamin A, iron, or calcium, the patient's food intake is analyzed by consulting a list of foods and their composition and nutrient content. The diet is then analyzed in terms of grams and milligrams of specific nutrients. The total nutritive value is then compared with the recommended dietary allowances that are specific for different age categories, gender, and special circumstances such as pregnancy or lactation (Monsen, 2000). The nurse frequently participates in the nutrition screening of patients and communicates the information to the dietitian and the rest of the team for more detailed assessment and for clinical nutrition intervention.

\section*{FACTORS INFLUENCING NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN VARIED SITUATIONS}

One sensitive indicator of the body's gain or loss of protein is its nitrogen balance. An adult is said to be in nitrogen equilibrium when the nitrogen intake (from food) equals the nitrogen output

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 5-7 The Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes foods from the five major food groups shown in the three lower sections of the pyramid. Each of these food groups provides some, but not all, of the nutrients an adult needs. Foods in one group cannot replace those in another. No one of these major food groups is more important than another. To receive adequate vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, and protein, an average adult should eat at least the lowest number of servings from the five major groups. Examples of 1 serving of a food group follow: Fats and sweets: use sparingly; milk, yogurt, cheese (dairy): 1 C milk or yogurt, $1 \frac{1}{2}$ oz natural cheese, 2 oz processed cheese; meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts (proteins): $1 / 2 \mathrm{C}$ cooked beans, $1 \mathrm{egg}, 2$ to 3 oz cooked lean meat, poultry or fish ( 2 T peanut butter $=1 \mathrm{oz}$ cooked lean meat); vegetables: 1 C raw leafy vegetables, $1 / 2 \mathrm{C}$ other vegetables (cooked or chopped, raw), $3 / 4 \mathrm{C}$ vegetable juice; fruits: 1 medium apple, banana, orange, $1 / 2 \mathrm{C}$ chopped or cooked or canned fruit, $3 / 4 \mathrm{C}$ fruit juice; bread, cereal, rice, pasta: 1 slice bread, 1 oz ready-to-eat cereal, $1 / 2 \mathrm{C}$ cooked cereal, rice or pasta.

\end{figure}
(in urine, feces, and perspiration); it is a sign of health. A positive nitrogen balance exists when nitrogen intake exceeds nitrogen output and indicates tissue growth, such as occurs during pregnancy, childhood, recovery from surgery, and rebuilding of wasted tissue. Negative nitrogen balance indicates that tissue is breaking down faster than it is being replaced. In the absence of an adequate intake of protein, the body converts protein to glucose for energy. This can occur with fever, starvation, surgery, burns, and debilitating diseases. Each gram of nitrogen loss in excess of intake represents the depletion of 6.25 g of protein or 25 g of muscle tissue. Therefore, a negative nitrogen balance of $10 \mathrm{~g} /$ day for 10 days could mean the wasting of 2.5 kg ( 5.5 lb ) of muscle tissue as it is converted to glucose for energy.

When conditions that result in negative nitrogen balance are coupled with anorexia (loss of appetite), they can lead to mal-
nutrition. Malnutrition interferes with wound healing, increases susceptibility to infection, and contributes to an increased incidence of complications, longer hospital stay, and prolonged confinement of the patient to bed (Bender, Pusateri, Cook et al., 2000).

The patient who is hospitalized may have an inadequate dietary intake because of the illness or disorder that necessitated the hospital stay or because the hospital's food is unfamiliar or unappealing (Dudek, 2000; Wilkes, 2000). The person who is cared for at home may feel too sick or fatigued to shop and prepare food or may be unable to eat because of other physical problems or limitations. Limited or fixed incomes or the high costs of medications may result in insufficient money to buy nutritious foods. Patients with inadequate housing or inadequate cooking facilities are unlikely to have an adequate nutritional intake.

Because complex treatments (eg, ventilators, intravenous infusions, chemotherapy) once used only in the hospital setting are now being provided in the home and outpatient settings, nutritional assessment of the patient in these settings is an important aspect of home and community-based care as well as hospitalbased care (Dabrowski \& Rombeau, 2000; Worthington, Gilbert \& Wagner, 2000).

Many medications influence nutritional status by suppressing the appetite, irritating the mucosa, or causing nausea and vomiting. Others may influence bacterial flora in the intestine or directly affect nutrient absorption so that secondary malnutrition results. People who must take many medications in a single day often report feeling too full to eat. The person's use of prescription and over-the-counter medications and their effect on appetite and dietary intake are assessed. Many of the factors that contribute to poor nutritional status are identified in Table 5-3.

\section*{ANALYSIS OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

Measurement of BMI and biochemical, clinical, and dietary data are used together to determine the patient's nutritional status. Often the BMI, biochemical measures, and dietary data provide more information about the patient's nutritional status than the clinical examination; the clinical examination may not detect subclinical deficiencies unless such deficiencies become so advanced that overt signs develop. A low intake of nutrients over a period of time may lead to low biochemical levels and without nutritional intervention may result in characteristic and observable signs and symptoms (see Table 5-2). A plan of action for nutritional intervention is based on the results of the dietary assessment and the patient's profile. To be effective, the plan
must meet the patient's need for a balanced diet, maintain or control weight, and compensate for increased nutritional needs.

\section*{Adolescent Considerations}

Adolescence is a time of critical growth and acquisition of lifelong eating habits, and therefore nutritional assessment and analysis are critical. In the past two decades the percentage of adolescents who are overweight has almost tripled (USDHHS, 2001). Despite this, total milk consumption has decreased by $36 \%$ compared to prior years (Cavadini, Siega-Riz \& Popkin, 2000). Fruit and vegetable consumption is also below the recommended five servings per day.

Adolescent girls are at particular nutritional risk as iron, folate, and calcium intake is below recommended levels (Cavadini, SiegaRiz \& Popkin, 2000). Persons with other nutritional disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, have a better chance for recovery if these disorders are identified in the adolescent years compared to adulthood (Orbanic, 2001).

\section*{Assessment in the Home and Community}

Assessment of the person in community settings, including the home, consists of collecting information specific to existing health problems, including the patient's physiologic and emotional status, the community and home environment, the adequacy of support systems or care given by family and other care providers, and the availability of needed resources. In addition, the ability of the individual and family to cope with and address their respective needs is evaluated. The physical assessment in the community and home consists of the same techniques used in the

A call made to the patient's home before the first home visit lets the patient know when to expect the home care nurse and also provides the opportunity for the patient's primary caregiver to be available. During the home visit, the nurse's assessment is not limited to physical assessment of the patient. Other aspects of assessment include the home environment, safety factors (eg, smoke alarms, obstacles, safety bars in the bathroom), adequacy of facilities required for the patient's care and recovery, food preparation and storage facilities, bathroom facilities, access to a telephone, and the availability of family and community supports.

> Between $5 \%$ and $10 \%$ of community-dwelling elderly are estimated to be malnourished, and the prevalence ranges from $30 \%$ to $60 \%$ in home-bound or elderly living in retirement homes (Griep, Mets, Colly et al., 2000). Elderly people who are malnourished tend to have longer and more expensive hospital stays than those who are adequately nourished; the risk of costly complications is also increased in those who are malnourished (Bender et al., 2000; Braunschweig, Gomez \& Sheean, 2000; Cammon \& Hackshaw, 2000).

> Inadequate dietary intake in the elderly may result from physiologic changes in the gastrointestinal tract, social and economic factors, drug interactions, disease, excessive use of alcohol, and poor dentition or missing teeth. Malnutrition is a common consequence of these factors and in turn leads to illness and frailty of the elderly. Important aspects of care of the elderly in the hospital, home, outpatient setting, or extended care facility include recognizing risk factors and identifying those at risk for inadequate nutrition (Bender et al., 2000; Cammon \& Hackshaw, 2000; Morley, 2000).

> Many elderly people take excessive and inappropriate medications; this is referred to as polypharmacy. The number of adverse reactions increases proportionately with the number of prescribed and over-the-counter medications taken. Age-related physiologic and pathophysiologic changes may alter the metabolism and elimination of many medications. Medications can influence food intake by producing side effects such as nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and changes in sensorium (Morley, 2000). They may also interfere with the distribution, utilization, and storage of nutrients. Disorders affecting any part of the gastrointestinal tract can alter nutritional requirements and health status in people of any age; however, they are likely to occur quickly and more frequently in the elderly.

> Nutritional problems in the elderly often occur or are precipitated by such illnesses as pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Acute and chronic diseases may affect the metabolism and utilization of nutrients, which already are altered by the aging process. Flu and pneumonia immunizations, prompt treatment of bacterial infections, and social programs such as Meals on Wheels may reduce the risk of illness-associated malnutrition.

> Even the well elderly may be nutritionally at risk because of decreased odor perception, poor dental health, limited ability to shop and cook, financial hardship, and the fact that they often eat alone (Griep, Mets, Colly et al., 2000). Also, reduction in exercise with age without concomitant changes in carbohydrate intake places the elderly at risk for obesity. Nutritional screening in the elderly is a first step in maintaining adequate nutrition and replacing nutrient losses to maintain the individual's health and well being.

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Compare the approach and techniques you would use in assessing a patient who is experiencing severe abdominal pain. How would your approach and technique differ if your patient has dementia? If your patient has dementia and is blind or hard of hearing? If your patient is from a culture with very different values from yours?
2. Your health history and physical examination of an elderly patient alerts you to the possibility of abuse. Explain how you would pursue this further. What assessments are available to assist in assessing this in a more comprehensive manner?
3. You are conducting a health history on a patient who is admitted to the emergency room after he was hit by a car while walking down the center of a major street at 10 PM . He is responsive and able to talk and has no apparent major physical injuries. The ambulance crew that brought him to the emergency room tells you that the patient has probably been drinking. How would this history affect your assessment? How would you assess history of alcohol use in an emergency room setting? How would you do so in a patient in a primary care office? Explain the rationale for your responses.
4. Your nutritional assessment reveals that a female adolescent patient has a high fat intake and minimal calcium intake. What dietary recommendations would you make for this clent? What dietary instructions would you develop for her if she is a vegetarian?
5. You have received a referral for home care for a 75-yearold patient who has recently had a stroke and who lives alone in a travel trailer. What physical and environmental factors are important to assess on the initial home visit? Identify the elements in the home that would be safety hazards and those that would be safety factors.

\section*{Homeostasis, Stress, and Adaptation}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to:}

5. Describe the general adaptation syndrome as a theory of adaptation to biologic stress.
6. Describe the relationship of the process of negative feedback to the maintenance of the steady state.
7. Compare the adaptive processes of hypertrophy, atrophy, hyperplasia, dysplasia, and metaplasia.
8. Describe the inflammatory and reparative processes.
9. Assess the health patterns of an individual and determine their effects on maintenance of the steady state.

Whhen the body is threatened or suffers an injury, its response may involve functional and structural changes; these changes may be adaptive (having a positive effect) or maladaptive (having a negative effect). The defense mechanisms that the body exhibits determine the difference between adaptation and maladaptationhealth and disease.

\section*{Stress and Function}

Physiology is the study of the functional activities of the living organism and its parts. Pathophysiology is the study of disordered function of the body. Each different body system performs specific functions to sustain optimal life for the organism. Mechanisms for adjusting internal conditions promote the normal steady state of the organism and ultimately its survival. These mechanisms are compensatory in nature and work to restore balance in the body. An example of this restorative effort is the development of rapid breathing (hyperpnea) after intense exercise in an attempt to compensate for an oxygen deficit and excess lactic acid accumulated in the muscle tissue.

Pathophysiologic processes result when cellular injury occurs at such a rapid rate that the body's compensatory mechanisms can no longer make the adaptive changes necessary to remain healthy. An example of a pathophysiologic change is the development of heart failure: the body reacts by retaining sodium and water and increasing venous pressure, which worsens the condition. These pathophysiologic mechanisms give rise to signs that are observed by the patient, nurse, or other health care provider, or symptoms that are reported by the patient. These observations, plus a sound knowledge of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, can assist in determining the existence of a problem and can guide the nurse in planning the appropriate course of action.

\section*{Dynamic Balance:The Steady State}

Physiologic mechanisms must be understood in the context of the body as a whole. The person, as a living system, has both an internal and an external environment, between which information

\end{figure}
and matter are continuously exchanged. Within the internal environment each organ, tissue, and cell is also a system or subsystem of the whole, each with its own internal and external environment, each exchanging information and matter (Fig. 6-1). The goal of the interaction of the body's subsystems is to produce a dynamic balance or steady state (even in the presence of change), so that all subsystems are in harmony with each other. Four concepts-constancy, homeostasis, stress, and adaptationenhance the nurse's understanding of steady state.
adaptation: a change or alteration designed to assist in adapting to a new situation or environment
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): a hormone produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland that stimulates the secretion of cortisone and other hormones by the adrenal cortex
antidiuretic hormone (ADH): a hormone secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland that constricts blood vessels, elevates blood pressure, and reduces the excretion of urine
catecholamines: any of the group of amines (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine) that serve as neurotransmitters
coping: the cognitive and behavioral strategies used to manage the stressors that tax a person's resources
dysplasia: a change in the appearance of a cell after exposure to chronic irritation
glucocorticoids: the group of steroid hormones, such as cortisol, that are produced
by the adrenal cortex; they are involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and have anti-inflammatory properties
gluconeogenesis: the formation of glucose, especially by the liver from noncarbohydrate sources such as amino acids and the glycerol portion of fats
guided imagery: use of the imagination to achieve relaxation or direct attention away from uncomfortable sensations or situations
homeostasis: a steady state within the body; the stability of the internal environment
hyperplasia: an increase in the number of new cells
hypoxia: inadequate supply of oxygen to the cell
infectious agents: biologic agents, such as viruses, bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes, that cause disease in people
inflammation: a localized, protective reaction of tissue to injury, irritation, or infec-
tion, manifested by pain, redness, heat, swelling, and sometimes loss of function
metabolic rate: the speed at which some substances are broken down to yield energy for bodily processes and other substances are synthesized
metaplasia: a cell transformation in which a highly specialized cell changes to a less specialized cell
negative feedback: feedback that decreases the output of a system
positive feedback: feedback that increases the output of a system
steady state: a stable condition that does not change over time, or when change in one direction is balanced by change in an opposite direction
stress: a disruptive condition that occurs in response to adverse influences from the internal or external environments
vasoconstriction: the narrowing of a blood vessel

\section*{HISTORICAL THEORIES OF THE STEADY STATE}

Claude Bernard, a 19th-century French physiologist, developed the biologic principle that for life there must be a constancy or "fixity of the internal milieu" despite changes in the external environment. The internal milieu was the fluid that bathed the cells, and the constancy was the balanced internal state maintained by physiologic and biochemical processes. His principle implied a static process.

Later, Walter Cannon used the term homeostasis to describe the stability of the internal environment, which, he said, was coordinated by homeostatic or compensatory processes that responded to changes in the internal environment. Any change within the internal environment initiated a "righting" response to minimize the change. These biologic processes sought physiologic and chemical balance and were under involuntary control.

Rene Jules Dubos (1965) provided further insight into the dynamic nature of the internal environment with his theory that two complementary concepts, homeostasis and adaptation, were necessary for balance. Homeostatic processes occurred quickly in response to stress, rapidly making the adjustments necessary to maintain the internal environment. Adaptive processes resulted in structural or functional changes over time. Dubos also emphasized that acceptable ranges of response to stimuli existed and that these responses varied for different individuals: "Absolute constancy is only a concept of the ideal." Homeostasis and adaptation were both necessary for survival in a changing world.

Homeostasis, then, refers to a steady state within the body. When a change or stress occurs that causes a body function to deviate from its stable range, processes are initiated to restore and maintain the dynamic balance. When these adjustment processes or compensatory mechanisms are not adequate, the steady state is threatened, function becomes disordered, and pathophysiologic mechanisms occur. The pathophysiologic processes can lead to disease and may be active during disease, which is a threat to the steady state. Disease is an abnormal variation in the structure or function of any part of the body. It disrupts function and therefore limits the person's freedom of action.

\section*{STRESS AND ADAPTATION}

Stress is a state produced by a change in the environment that is perceived as challenging, threatening, or damaging to the person's dynamic balance or equilibrium. The person is, or feels, unable to meet the demands of the new situation. The change or stimulus that evokes this state is the stressor. The nature of the stressor is variable; an event or change that will produce stress in one person may be neutral for another, and an event that produces stress at one time and place for one person may not do so for the same person at another time and place. A person appraises and copes with changing situations. The desired goal is adaptation, or adjustment to the change so that the person is again in equilibrium and has the energy and ability to meet new demands. This is the process of coping with the stress, a compensatory process with physiologic and psychological components.

Adaptation is a constant, ongoing process that requires a change in structure, function, or behavior so that the person is better suited to the environment; it involves an interaction between the person and the environment. The outcome depends on the degree of "fit" between the skills and capacities of the person, the type of social support available, and the various challenges or stressors being confronted. As such, adaptation is an individual
process: each individual has varying abilities to cope or respond. As new challenges are met, this ability to cope and adapt can change, thereby providing the individual with a wide range of adaptive ability. Adaptation occurs throughout the life span as the individual encounters many developmental and situational challenges, especially related to health and illness. The goal of these encounters is to promote adaptation. In situations of health and illness, this goal is realized by optimal wellness.

Because both stress and adaptation may exist at different levels of a system, it is possible to study these reactions at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels. Biologists are concerned mainly with subcellular components or with subsystems of the total body. Behavioral scientists, including many nurse researchers, study stress and adaptation in individuals, families, groups, and societies; they focus on how a group's organizational features are modified to meet the requirements of the social and physical environment in which they exist. Adaptation is a continuous process of seeking harmony in an environment. The desired goals of adaptation for any system are survival, growth, and reproduction.

\section*{Stressors:Threats to the Steady State}

Each person operates at a certain level of adaptation and regularly encounters a certain amount of change. Such change is expected; it contributes to growth and enhances life. Stressors, however, can upset this equilibrium. A stressor may be defined as an internal or external event or situation that creates the potential for physiologic, emotional, cognitive, or behavioral changes in an individual.

\section*{TYPES OF STRESSORS}

Stressors exist in many forms and categories. They may be described as physical, physiologic, or psychosocial. Physical stressors include cold, heat, and chemical agents; physiologic stressors include pain and fatigue. Examples of psychosocial stressors are fear of failing an examination and losing a job. Stressors can also occur as normal life transitions that require some adjustment, such as going from childhood into puberty, getting married, or giving birth.

Stressors have also been classified as: (1) day-to-day frustrations or hassles; (2) major complex occurrences involving large groups, even entire nations; and (3) stressors that occur less frequently and involve fewer people. The first group, the day-to-day stressors, includes such common occurrences as getting caught in a traffic jam, experiencing computer downtime, and having an argument with a spouse or roommate. These experiences vary in effect; for example, encountering a rainstorm while one is vacationing at the beach will most likely evoke a more negative response than it might at another time. These less dramatic, frustrating, and irritating events-daily hassles-have been shown to have a greater health impact than major life events because of the cumulative effect they have over time. They can lead to high blood pressure, palpitations, or other physiologic problems (Jalowiec, 1993).

The second group of stressors influences larger groups of people, possibly even entire nations. These include events of history, such as terrorism and war, which are threatening situations when experienced either directly, in the war zone, or indirectly, as through live news coverage. The demographic, economic, and technological changes occurring in society also serve as stressors. The tension produced by any stressor is sometimes a result not only of the change itself, but also of the speed with which the change occurs.

The third group of stressors has been studied most extensively and concerns relatively infrequent situations that directly affect the individual. This category includes the influence of life events such as death, birth, marriage, divorce, and retirement. It also includes the psychosocial crises described by Erikson as occurring in the life cycle stages of the human experience. More enduring chronic stressors have also been placed in this category and may include such things as having a permanent functional disability or coping with the difficulties of providing long-term care to a frail elderly parent.

A stressor can also be categorized according to duration. It may be
- An acute, time-limited stressor, such as studying for final examinations
- A stressor sequence-a series of stressful events that result from an initial event such as job loss or divorce
- A chronic intermittent stressor, such as daily hassles
- A chronic enduring stressor that persists over time, such as chronic illness, a disability, or poverty

\section*{STRESS AS A STIMULUS FOR DISEASE}

Relating life events to illness (the theoretical approach that defines stress as a stimulus) has been a major focus of psychosocial studies. This can be traced to Adolph Meyer, who in the 1930s observed in "life charts" of his patients a linkage between illnesses and critical life events. Subsequent research revealed that people under constant stress have a high incidence of psychosomatic disease.

Holmes and Rahe (1967) developed life events scales that assign numerical values, called life-change units, to typical life events. Because the items in the scales reflect events that require a change in a person's life pattern, and stress is defined as an accumulation of changes in one's life that require psychological adaptation, one can theoretically predict the likelihood of illness by checking off the number of recent events and deriving a total score. The Recent Life Changes Questionnaire (Tausig, 1982) contains 118 items such as death, birth, marriage, divorce, promotions, serious arguments, and vacations. The events listed include both desirable and undesirable circumstances.

Sources of stress for patients have been well researched (Ballard, 1981; Bryla, 1996; Jalowiec, 1993). People typically experience distress related to alterations in their physical and emotional health status, changes in their level of daily functioning, and decreased social support or the loss of significant others. Fears of immobilization, isolation, loneliness, sensory changes, financial problems, and death or disability increase a person's anxiety level. Loss of one's role or perceived purpose in life can cause intense discomfort. Any of these identified variables plus a myriad of other conditions or overwhelming demands are likely to cause ineffective coping, and a lack of necessary coping skills is often a source of additional distress for an individual. When a person endures prolonged or unrelenting suffering, the outcome is frequently the development of a stress-related illness. Nurses possess the skills to assist people to alter their distressing circumstances and manage their responses to stress.

\section*{PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO STRESS}

After the recognition of a stressor, an individual consciously or unconsciously reacts to manage the situation. This is called the mediating process. A theory developed by Lazarus (1991a) emphasizes
cognitive appraisal and coping as important mediators of stress. Appraisal and coping are influenced by antecedent variables that include the internal and external resources of the person.

\section*{Appraisal of the Stressful Event}

Cognitive appraisal (Lazarus, 1991a; Lazarus \& Folkman, 1984) is a process by which an event is evaluated with respect to what is at stake (primary appraisal) and what might and can be done (secondary appraisal). What individuals see as being at stake is influenced by their personal goals, commitments, or motivations. Important factors include how important or relevant the event is to them, whether the event conflicts with what they want or desire, and whether the situation threatens their own sense of strength and ego identity.

As an outcome of primary appraisal, the situation is identified as either nonstressful or stressful. If nonstressful, the situation is irrelevant or benign (positive). A stressful situation may be one of three kinds: (1) one in which harm or loss has occurred; (2) one that is threatening, in that harm or loss is anticipated; and (3) one that is challenging, in that some opportunity or gain is anticipated.

Secondary appraisal is an evaluation of what might and can be done about this situation Actions include assigning blame to those responsible for a frustrating event, thinking about whether one can do something about the situation (coping potential), and determining future expectancy, or whether things are likely to change for better or worse (Lazarus, 1991a, 1991c). A comparison of what is at stake and what can be done about it (a type of risk-benefit analysis) determines the degree of stress.

Reappraisal, a change of opinion based on new information, also occurs. The appraisal process is not necessarily sequential; primary and secondary appraisal and reappraisal may occur simultaneously. Information learned from an adaptational encounter can be stored, so that when a similar situation is encountered again the whole process does not need to be repeated.

The appraisal process contributes to the development of an emotion. Negative emotions such as fear and anger accompany harm/loss appraisals, and positive emotions accompany challenge. In addition to the subjective component or feeling that accompanies a particular emotion, each emotion also includes a tendency to act in a certain way. For example, an unexpected quiz in the classroom might be judged as threatening by unprepared students. They might feel fear, anger, and resentment and might express these emotions outwardly with hostile behavior or comments.

Lazarus (1991a) expanded his former ideas about stress, appraisal, and coping into a more complex model relating emotion to adaptation. He called this model a "cognitive-motivationalrelational theory," with the term relational "standing for a focus on negotiation with a physical and social world" (p. 13). A theory of emotion was proposed as the bridge to connect psychology, physiology, and sociology: "More than any other arena of psychological thought, emotion is an integrative, organismic concept that subsumes psychological stress and coping within itself and unites motivation, cognition, and adaptation in a complex configuration" (p. 40).

\section*{Coping With the Stressful Event}

Coping, according to Lazarus, consists of the cognitive and behavioral efforts made to manage the specific external or internal demands that tax a person's resources and may be emotionfocused or problem-focused. Coping that is emotion focused seeks to make the person feel better by lessening the emotional distress
felt. Problem-focused coping aims to make direct changes in the environment so that the situation can be managed more effectively. Both types of coping usually occur in a stressful situation. Even if the situation is viewed as challenging or beneficial, coping efforts may be required to develop and sustain the chal-lenge-that is, to maintain the positive benefits of the challenge and to ward off any threats. In harmful or threatening situations, successful coping reduces or eliminates the source of stress and relieves the emotion it generated.

Appraisal and coping are affected by internal characteristics such as health, energy, personal belief systems, commitments or life goals, self-esteem, control, mastery, knowledge, problemsolving skills, and social skills. The characteristics that have been studied most often in nursing research are health-promoting lifestyles and hardiness. A health-promoting lifestyle buffers the effect of stressors. From a nursing practice standpoint, this out-come-buffering the effect of stressors-supports nursing's goal of promoting health. In many circumstances, promoting a healthy lifestyle is more achievable than altering the stressors.

Hardiness is the name given to a general quality that comes from having rich, varied, and rewarding experiences. It is a personality characteristic composed of control, commitment, and challenge. Hardy people perceive stressors as something they can change and therefore control. To them, potentially stressful situations are interesting and meaningful; change and new situations are viewed as challenging opportunities for growth. Some positive support has been found for hardiness as a significant variable that positively influences rehabilitation and overall improvement after an onset of an acute or chronic illness (Felton, 2000; Williams, 2000).

\section*{PHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSE TO STRESS}

The physiologic response to a stressor, whether it is a physical stressor or a psychological stressor, is a protective and adaptive mechanism to maintain the homeostatic balance of the body. The stress response is a "cascade of neural and hormonal events that have short- and long-lasting consequences for both brain and body . . .; a stressor is an event that challenges homeostasis, with a disease outcome being looked upon as a failure of the normal process of adaptation to the stress" (McEwen \& Mendelson, 1993, p. 101).

\section*{The General Adaptation Syndrome}

Hans Selye developed a theory of adaptation that profoundly influenced the scientific study of stress. In 1936, Selye, experimenting with animals, first described a syndrome consisting of enlargement of the adrenal cortex; shrinkage of the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic structures; and the appearance of deep, bleeding ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. He identified this as a nonspecific response to diverse, noxious stimuli. From this beginning, he developed a theory of adaptation to biologic stress that he named the general adaptation syndrome.

\section*{PHASES OF THE GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME}

The general adaptation syndrome has three phases: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. During the alarm phase, the sympathetic "fight-or-flight" response is activated with release of catecholamines and the onset of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-adrenal cortical response. The alarm reaction is defensive and anti-inflammatory but self-limited. Because living in a continuous state of alarm would result in death, the person moves
into the second stage, resistance. During this stage, adaptation to the noxious stressor occurs, and cortisol activity is still increased. If exposure to the stressor is prolonged, exhaustion sets in and endocrine activity increases. This produces deleterious effects on the body systems (especially the circulatory, digestive, and immune systems) that can lead to death. Stages one and two of this syndrome are repeated, in different degrees, throughout life as the person encounters stressors.

Selye compared the general adaptation syndrome with the life process. During childhood, there are too few encounters with stress to promote the development of adaptive functioning, and the child is vulnerable. During adulthood, the person encounters a number of life's stressful events and develops a resistance or adaptation. During the later years, the accumulation of life's stressors and the wear and tear on the organism again deplete the person's ability to adapt, resistance falls, and eventually death occurs.

\section*{LOCAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME}

According to Selye's theory, a local adaptation syndrome also occurs. This syndrome includes the inflammatory response and repair processes that occur at the local site of tissue injury. The local adaptation syndrome occurs in small, topical injuries, such as contact dermatitis. If the local injury is severe enough, the general adaptation syndrome is activated as well.

Selye emphasized that stress is the nonspecific response common to all stressors, regardless of whether they are physiologic, psychological, or social. The many conditioning factors in each person's environment account for why different demands are interpreted by different people as stressors. Conditioning factors also account for differences in the tolerance of different people for stress: some people may develop diseases of adaptation, such as hypertension and migraine headaches, while others are unaffected.

\section*{Interpretation of Stressful Stimuli by the Brain}

Physiologic responses to stress are mediated by the brain through a complex network of chemical and electrical messages. The neural and hormonal actions that maintain homeostatic balance are integrated by the hypothalamus, which is located in the center of the brain, surrounded by the limbic system and the cerebral hemispheres. The hypothalamus integrates autonomic nervous system mechanisms that maintain the chemical constancy of the internal environment of the body. Together with the limbic system, it also regulates emotions and many visceral behaviors necessary for survival (eg, eating, drinking, temperature control, reproduction, defense, aggression). The hypothalamus is made up of a number of nuclei; the limbic system contains the amygdala, hippocampus, and septal nuclei, along with other structures.

Literature supports the concept that each of these structures responds differently to stimuli, and each has its own characteristic response (Watkins, 1997). The cerebral hemispheres are concerned with cognitive functions: thought processes, learning, and memory. The limbic system has connections with both the cerebral hemispheres and the brain stem. In addition, the reticular activating system, which is a network of cells that forms a two-way communication system, extends from the brain stem into the midbrain and limbic system. This network controls the alert or waking state of the body.

In the stress response, afferent impulses are carried from sensory organs (eye, ear, nose, skin) and internal sensors (baroreceptors, chemoreceptors) to nerve centers in the brain. The response to the perception of stress is integrated in the hypothalamus,
which coordinates the adjustments necessary to return to homeostatic balance. The degree and duration of the response varies; major stress evokes both sympathetic and pituitary adrenal responses.

Neural and neuroendocrine pathways under the control of the hypothalamus are also activated in the stress response. First, there is a sympathetic nervous system discharge, followed by a sympathetic-adrenal-medullary discharge. If the stress persists, the hypothalamic-pituitary system is activated (Fig. 6-2).

\section*{SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM RESPONSE}

The sympathetic nervous system response is rapid and shortlived. Norepinephrine is released at nerve endings that are in direct contact with their respective end organs to cause an increase in function of the vital organs and a state of general body arousal. The heart rate is increased and peripheral vasoconstriction occurs, raising the blood pressure. Blood is also shunted away from abdominal organs. The purpose of these activities is to provide better perfusion of vital organs (brain, heart, skeletal muscles).

Blood glucose is increased, supplying more readily available energy. The pupils are dilated, and mental activity is increased; a greater sense of awareness exists. Constriction of the blood vessels of the skin limits bleeding in the event of trauma. The person is likely to experience cold feet, clammy skin and hands, chills, palpitations, and a knot in the stomach. Typically, the person appears tense, with the muscles of the neck, upper back, and shoulders tightened; respirations may be rapid and shallow, with the diaphragm tense.

\section*{SYMPATHETIC-ADRENAL-MEDULLARY RESPONSE}

In addition to its direct effect on major end organs, the sympathetic nervous system also stimulates the medulla of the adrenal gland to release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine into the bloodstream. The action of these hormones is similar to that of the sympathetic nervous system and have the effect of sustaining and prolonging its actions. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines that stimulate the nervous system and produce metabolic effects that increase the blood glucose level

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

and increase the metabolic rate. The effect of the sympathetic and adrenal-medullary responses is summarized in Table 6-1. This effect is called the "fight-or-flight" reaction.

\section*{HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY RESPONSE}

The longest-acting phase of the physiologic response, which is more likely to occur in persistent stress, involves the hypothalamicpituitary pathway. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropinreleasing factor, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce ACTH. ACTH in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids, primarily cortisol. Cortisol stimulates protein catabolism, releasing amino acids; stimulates liver uptake of amino acids and their conversion to glucose (gluconeogenesis); and inhibits glucose uptake (anti-insulin action) by many body cells but not those of the brain and heart. These cortisol-induced metabolic effects provide the body with a ready source of energy during a stressful situation. This effect has some important implications. For example, a person with diabetes who is under stress, such as that caused by an infection, needs more insulin than usual. Any patient who is under stress (caused, for example, by illness, surgery, trauma or prolonged psychological stress) catabolizes body protein and needs supplements. Children subjected to severe stress have retarded growth.

The actions of the catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and cortisol are the most important in the general response to stress. Other hormones released are antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary and aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. ADH and aldosterone promote sodium and water retention, which is an adaptive mechanism in the event of hemorrhage or loss of fluids through excessive perspiration. ADH has also been shown to influence learning and may thus facilitate coping in new and threatening situations. Secretion of growth hormone and glucagon stimulates the uptake of amino acids by
cells, helping to mobilize energy resources. Endorphins, which are endogenous opiates, increase during stress and enhance the threshold for tolerance of painful stimuli. They may also affect mood and have been implicated in the so-called "high" that longdistance runners experience. The secretion of other hormones is also affected, but their adaptive function is less clear.

\section*{IMMUNOLOGIC RESPONSE}

Research findings show that the immune system is connected to the neuroendocrine and autonomic systems. Lymphoid tissue is richly supplied by autonomic nerves capable of releasing a number of different neuropeptides that can have a direct effect on leukocyte regulation and the inflammatory response. Neuroendocrine hormones released by the central nervous system and endocrine tissues can inhibit or stimulate leukocyte function. The wide variety of stressors people experience may result in different alterations in autonomic activity and subtle variations in neurohormone and neuropeptide synthesis. All of these possible autonomic and neuroendocrine responses can interact to initiate, weaken, enhance, or terminate an immune response (Watkins, 1997).

The study of the relationships among the neuroendocrine system, the central and autonomic nervous systems, and the immune system and the effects of these relationships on overall health outcomes is called psychoneuroimmunology. Because one's perception of events and coping styles determine whether, and to what extent, an event activates the stress response system, and because the stress response affects immune activity, one's perceptions, ideas, and thoughts can have profound neurochemical and immunologic consequences. Multiple studies have demonstrated alteration of immune function in people who are under stress, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of leukocytes, impaired immune response to immunizations, and diminished cytotoxic-

Other studies have identified certain personality traits, such as optimism and active coping, as having positive effects on health or specific immune measures (Chalfont \& Bennett, 1999; Goodkin et al., 1996; Kennedy, 2000; Sergerstrom, Fahey, Kemeny, \& Taylor, 1998). As research continues, this new field of study will continue to uncover to what extent and by what mechanisms people can consciously influence their immunity.

\section*{MALADAPTIVE RESPONSES TO STRESS}

The stress response, which, as indicated earlier facilitates adaptation to threatening situations, has been retained from our evolutionary past. The "fight-or-flight" response, for example, is an anticipatory response that mobilized the bodily resources of our ancestors to deal with predators and other harsh factors in their environment. This same mobilization comes into play in response to emotional stimuli unrelated to danger. For example, a person may get an "adrenaline rush" when competing over a decisive point in a ball game, or when excited about attending a party.

When the responses to stress are ineffective, they are referred to as maladaptive. Maladaptive responses are chronic, recurrent responses or patterns of response over time that do not promote the goals of adaptation. The goals of adaptation are somatic or physical health (optimal wellness); psychological health or having a sense of well-being (happiness, satisfaction with life, morale); and enhanced social functioning, which includes work, social life, and family (positive relationships). Maladaptive responses that threaten these goals include faulty appraisals and inappropriate coping (Lazarus, 1991a).

The frequency, intensity, and duration of stressful situations contribute to the development of negative emotions and subsequent patterns of neurochemical discharge. By appraising situations more adequately and coping more appropriately, it is possible to anticipate and defuse some of these situations. For example, frequent potentially stressful encounters (eg, marital discord) might be avoided with better communication and problem solving, or a pattern of procrastination (eg, delaying work on tasks) could be corrected to reduce stress when deadlines approach.

Coping processes that include the use of alcohol or drugs to reduce stress increase the risk of illness. Other inappropriate coping patterns may increase the risk of illness less directly. For example, people who demonstrate "type A" personality behaviors such as impatience, competitiveness, and achievement orientation and have an underlying hostile approach to life are more prone than others to develop stress-related illnesses. Type A behaviors increase the output of catecholamines, the adrenalmedullary hormones, with their attendant effects on the body.

Other forms of inappropriate coping include denial, avoidance, and distancing. Denial may be illustrated by the woman who feels a lump in her breast but downplays its seriousness and delays seeking medical attention. The intent of denial is to control the threat, but it may also endanger life.

Models of illness frequently cite stress and maladaptation as precursors to disease. A general model of illness, based on Selye's theory, suggests that any stressor elicits a state of disturbed physiologic equilibrium. If this state is prolonged or the response is excessive, it will increase the susceptibility of the person to illness. This susceptibility, coupled with a predisposition in the person
(whether from genetic traits, health, or age), leads to illness. If the sympathetic adrenal-medullary response is prolonged or excessive, a state of chronic arousal develops that may lead to high blood pressure, arteriosclerotic changes, and cardiovascular disease. If the production of the ACTH is prolonged or excessive, behavior patterns of withdrawal and depression are seen. In addition, the immune response is decreased, and infections and tumors may develop.

Selye (1976) proposed a list of disorders that he called diseases of maladaptation: high blood pressure, diseases of the heart and blood vessels, diseases of the kidney, hypertension of pregnancy, rheumatic and rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory diseases of the skin and eyes, infections, allergic and hypersensitivity diseases, nervous and mental diseases, sexual derangements, digestive diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer.

\section*{INDICATORS OF STRESS}

Indicators of stress and the stress response include both subjective and objective measures. Chart 6-1 lists signs and symptoms that may be observed directly or reported by the person. They are psychological, physiologic, or behavioral and reflect social behaviors and thought processes. Some of these reactions may be coping behaviors. Over time, each person tends to develop a characteristic pattern of behavior during stress that is a warning that the system is out of balance.

Laboratory measurements of indicators of stress have helped in understanding this complex process. Among the measures, blood and urine analyses can be used to demonstrate changes in hormonal levels and hormonal breakdown products. Reliable measures of stress include blood levels of catecholamines, corticoids, ACTH, and eosinophils. The serum creatine/creatinine ratio and elevations of cholesterol and free fatty acids can also be measured. Immunoglobulin assays may be determined. With greater attention to neuroimmunology, improved laboratory measures are likely to follow. Increases in blood pressure and heart rate can also be measured.

In addition to using laboratory tests, researchers have developed questionnaires to identify and assess stressors, stress, and coping strategies. Many of these are discussed in the research monograph developed by Barnfather and Lyon (1993), which was based on a synthesis conference held by nurse scientists on the state of the science in stress and coping nursing research. Some examples of the research instruments that nurses commonly use to measure levels of client distress and client functioning can be found in a variety of research reports (Cronquist, Wredding, Norlander, Langius, \& Bjorvell, 2000; Starzonski \& Hilton, 2000). Miller and Smith (1993) provided a stress audit and a stress profile measurement tool that is available in the popular lay literature.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

It is important for the nurse to realize that the optimal point of intervention to promote health is during the stage when the individual's own compensatory processes are still functioning. Early identification of both physiologic and psychological stressors remains a major role of the nurse, and information on the interrelationships between physical and emotional health can be found in research journals. The nurse should be able to relate the presenting signs and symptoms of distress to the physiology they represent and identify the individual's position on the continuum of function, from health and compensation to pathophysiology and disease. For example, if an anxious middle-aged woman presented for a checkup and was found to be overweight, with a blood pressure of $130 / 85 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the nurse would counsel her with respect to diet, stress management, and activity. The nurse would also encourage weight loss and discuss the woman's intake of salt (which affects fluid balance) and caffeine (which provides a stimulant effect). The patient and the nurse would identify both individual and environmental stressors and discuss strategies to decrease the lifestyle stress, with the ultimate goal being to create a healthy lifestyle and prevent hypertension and its sequelae.

\section*{Stress at the Cellular Level}

Pathologic processes may occur at all levels of the biologic organism. If the cell is considered the smallest unit or subsystem (tissues being aggregates of cells, organs aggregates of tissues, and so forth), the processes of health and disease or adaptation and maladaptation can all occur at the cellular level. Indeed, pathologic processes are often described by scientists at the subcellular or molecular level.

The cell exists on a continuum of function and structure, ranging from the normal cell, to the adapted cell, to the injured or diseased cell, to the dead cell (Fig. 6-3). Changes from one state to another may occur rapidly and may not be readily de-

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}
tectable, because each state does not have discrete boundaries, and disease represents an extension and distortion of normal processes. The earliest changes occur at the molecular or subcellular level and are not perceptible until steady-state functions or structures are altered. With cell injury, some changes may be reversible; in other instances, the injuries are lethal. For example, tanning of the skin is an adaptive, morphologic response to exposure to the rays of the sun. If the exposure is continued, however, sunburn and injury occur, and some cells may die, as evidenced by desquamation ("peeling").

Different cells and tissues respond to stimuli with different patterns and rates of response; some cells are more vulnerable to one type of stimulus or stressor than others. The cell involved, its ability to adapt, and its physiologic state are determinants of the response. For example, cardiac muscle cells respond to hypoxia (inadequate oxygenation) more quickly than smooth muscle cells do.

Other determinants of cellular response are the type or nature of the stimulus, its duration, and its severity. For example, neurons that control respiration can develop a tolerance to regular, small amounts of a barbiturate, but one large dose may result in respiratory depression and death.

\section*{CONTROL OF THE STEADY STATE}

The concept of the cell as existing on a continuum of function and structure includes the relationship of the cell to compensatory mechanisms, which occur continuously in the body to maintain the steady state. Compensatory processes are regulated primarily by the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system, with control achieved through negative feedback.

\section*{Negative Feedback}

Negative feedback mechanisms throughout the body monitor the internal environment and restore homeostasis when conditions shift out of the normal range. These mechanisms work by sensing deviations from a predetermined set point or range of adaptability and triggering a response aimed at offsetting the deviation. Blood pressure, acid-base balance, blood glucose level, body temperature, and fluid and electrolyte balance are examples of functions regulated through such compensatory mechanisms.

Most of the human body's control systems are integrated by the brain and influenced by the nervous and endocrine systems. Control activities involve detecting deviations from the predetermined reference point and stimulating compensatory responses in the muscles and glands of the body. The major organs affected are the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. When stimulated, these organs alter their rate of activity or the amount of secretions they produce. Because of this, they have been called the "organs of homeostasis or adjustment."

In addition to the responses controlled by the nervous and endocrine systems, local responses consisting of small feedback loops in a group of cells or tissues are possible. The cells detect a change in their immediate environment and initiate an action to counteract its effect. For example, the accumulation of lactic acid in an exercised muscle stimulates dilation of blood vessels in the area to increase blood flow and improve the delivery of oxygen and removal of waste products.

The net result of the activities of feedback loops is homeostasis. A steady state is achieved by the continuous, variable action of the organs involved in making the adjustments and by the continuous small exchanges of chemical substances among cells, interstitial fluid, and blood. For example, an increase in the carbon dioxide concentration of the extracellular fluid leads to increased pulmonary ventilation, which decreases the carbon dioxide level. On a cellular level, increased carbon dioxide raises the hydrogen ion concentration of the blood. This is detected by chemosensitive receptors in the respiratory control center of the medulla of the brain. The chemoreceptors stimulate an increase in the rate of discharge of the neurons that innervate the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, which increases the rate of respiration. Excess carbon dioxide is exhaled, the hydrogen ion concentration returns to normal, and the chemically sensitive neurons are no longer stimulated.

\section*{Positive Feedback}

Another type of feedback, positive feedback, perpetuates the chain of events set in motion by the original disturbance instead of compensating for it. As the system becomes more unbalanced, disorder and disintegration occur. There are some exceptions to this; blood clotting in humans, for example, is an important positive feedback mechanism.

\section*{CELLULAR ADAPTATION}

Cells are complex units that dynamically respond to the changing demands and stresses of daily life. They possess a maintenance function and a specialized function. The maintenance function refers to the activities that the cell must perform with respect to itself; specialized functions are those that the cell performs in relation to the tissues and organs of which it is a part. Individual cells may cease to function without posing a threat to the organism. As the number of dead cells increases, however, the specialized functions of the tissues are altered and the individual's health is threatened.

Cells can adapt to environmental stress through structural and functional changes. Some of these adaptations are hypertrophy, atrophy, hyperplasia, dysplasia, and metaplasia (Table 6-2).

Hypertrophy and atrophy lead to changes in the size of cells and hence the size of the organs they form. Compensatory hypertrophy is the result of an enlarged muscle mass and commonly occurs in skeletal and cardiac muscle that experiences a prolonged, increased workload. One example is the bulging muscles of the athlete who engages in body building.

Atrophy can be the consequence of a disease or of decreased use, decreased blood supply, loss of nerve supply, or inadequate nutrition. Disuse of a body part is often associated with the aging

\hline
\end{tabular}
process. Cell size and organ size decrease; structures principally affected are the skeletal muscles, the secondary sex organs, the heart, and the brain.

Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of new cells in an organ or tissue. As cells multiply and are subjected to increased stimulation, the tissue mass enlarges. It is a mitotic response (a change occurring with mitosis), but it is reversible when the stimulus is removed. This distinguishes it from neoplasia or malignant growth, which continues after the stimulus is removed. Hyperplasia may be hormonally induced. An example is the increase in the size of the thyroid gland caused by thyroid-stimulating hormone (secreted from the pituitary gland) when a deficit in thyroid hormone is detected.

Dysplasia is the change in the appearance of cells after they have been subjected to chronic irritation. Dysplastic cells have a tendency to become malignant; dysplasia is seen commonly in epithelial cells in the bronchi of smokers.

Metaplasia is a cell transformation in which a highly specialized cell changes to a less specialized cell. This serves a protective function, because the less specialized cell is more resistant to the stress that stimulated the change. For example, the ciliated columnar epithelium lining the bronchi of smokers is replaced by squamous epithelium. The squamous cells can survive; loss of the cilia and protective mucus, however, can have damaging consequences.

These adaptations allow the survival of the organism. They also reflect changes in the normal cell in response to stress. If the stress is unrelenting, the function of the adapted cell may succumb, and cell injury will occur.

\section*{CELLULAR INJURY}

Injury is defined as a disorder in steady-state regulation. Any stressor that alters the ability of the cell or system to maintain optimal balance of its adjustment processes will lead to injury. Structural and functional damage then occurs, which may be reversible (permitting recovery) or irreversible (leading to disability or death). Homeostatic adjustments are concerned with the small changes within the body's systems. With adaptive changes, compensation occurs and a steady state is achieved, although it may be at new levels. With injury, steady-state regulation is lost, and changes in functioning ensue.

Causes of disorder and injury in the system (cell, tissue, organ, body) may arise from the external or internal environment (Fig. 6-4) and include hypoxia, nutritional imbalance, physical agents, chemical agents, infectious agents, immune mechanisms, genetic defects, and psychogenic factors. The most common causes are hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), chemical injury, and infectious agents. In addition, the presence of one injury makes the system more susceptible to another injury. For example, inadequate oxygenation and nutritional deficiencies make the system vulnerable to infection. These agents act at the cellular level by damaging or destroying
- The integrity of the cell membrane, necessary for ionic balance
- The ability of the cell to transform energy (aerobic respiration, production of adenosine triphosphate)
- The ability of the cell to synthesize enzymes and other necessary proteins
- The ability of the cell to grow and reproduce (genetic integrity)

\end{figure}

\section*{Hypoxia}

Inadequate cellular oxygenation (hypoxia) interferes with the cell's ability to transform energy. Hypoxia may be caused by:
- A decrease in blood supply to an area
- A decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (decreased hemoglobin)
- A ventilation/perfusion or respiratory problem that reduces the amount of oxygen available in the blood
- A problem in the cell's enzyme system that makes it unable to use the oxygen delivered to it
The usual cause is ischemia, or deficient blood supply. Ischemia is commonly seen in myocardial cell injury in which arterial blood flow is decreased because of atherosclerotic narrowing of blood vessels. Ischemia also results from intravascular clots (thrombi or emboli) that may form and interfere with blood supply. Thrombi and emboli are common causes of cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). The length of time different tissues can survive without oxygen varies. For example, brain cells may succumb in 3 to 6 minutes, depending on the situation. If the condition leading to hypoxia is slow and progressive, collateral circulation may develop, whereby blood is supplied by other blood vessels in the area. However, this mechanism is not highly reliable.

\section*{Nutritional Imbalance}

Nutritional imbalance refers to a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients. This may be manifested as undernutrition (inadequate consumption of food or calories) or overnutrition (caloric excess). Caloric excess to the point of obesity overloads cells in the body with lipids. By requiring more energy to maintain the extra tissue, obesity places a strain on the body and has been associated with the development of disease, especially pulmonary and cardiovascular disease.

Specific deficiencies arise when an essential nutrient is deficient or when there is an imbalance of nutrients. Protein deficiencies and avitaminosis (deficiency of vitamins) are typical examples. An energy deficit leading to cell injury can occur if there is insufficient glucose, or insufficient oxygen to transform the glucose into energy. A lack of insulin, or the inability to use insulin, may also prevent glucose from entering the cell from the
blood. This occurs in diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder that can lead to nutritional deficiency.

\section*{Physical Agents}

Physical agents, including temperature extremes, radiation, electrical shock, and mechanical trauma, can cause injury to the cells or to the entire body. The duration of exposure and the intensity of the stressor determine the severity of damage.

\section*{EXTREMES OF HIGH TEMPERATURE}

When a person's temperature is elevated, hypermetabolism occurs and the respiratory rate, heart rate, and basal metabolic rate all increase. With fever induced by infections, the hypothalamic thermostat may be reset at a higher temperature, then return to normal when the fever abates. The increase in body temperature is achieved through physiologic mechanisms. Body temperatures greater than $41^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(106^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ suggest hyperthermia, because the physiologic function of the thermoregulatory center breaks down and the temperature soars. This physiologic condition occurs in people with heat stroke. Eventually, the high temperature causes coagulation of cell proteins, and the cells die. The body must be cooled rapidly to prevent brain damage.

The local response to thermal or burn injury is similar. There is an increase in metabolic activity, and, as heat increases, protein is coagulated, enzyme systems are destroyed, and, in the extreme, charring or carbonization occurs. Burns of the epithelium are classified as partial-thickness burns if epithelializing elements remain to support healing. Full-thickness burns lack such elements and must be grafted for healing. The amount of body surface involved determines the prognosis for the patient. If the injury is severe, the entire body system becomes involved, and hypermetabolism develops as a pathophysiologic response.

\section*{EXTREMES OF LOW TEMPERATURE}

Extremes of low temperature, or cold, cause vasoconstriction. Blood flow becomes sluggish and clots form, leading to ischemic damage in the involved tissues. With still lower temperatures, ice crystals may form, and the cells may burst.

\section*{RADIATION AND ELECTRICAL SHOCK}

Radiation is used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Ionizing forms of radiation may cause injury by their destructive action. Radiation decreases the protective inflammatory response of the cell, creating a favorable environment for opportunistic infections. Electrical shock produces burns as a result of the heat generated when electrical current travels through the body. It may also abnormally stimulate nerves, leading, for example, to fibrillation of the heart.

\section*{MECHANICAL TRAUMA}

Mechanical trauma can result in wounds that disrupt the cells and tissues of the body. The severity of the wound, the amount of blood loss, and the extent of nerve damage are significant factors in the outcome.

\section*{Chemical Agents}

Chemical injuries are caused by poisons, such as lye, which has a corrosive action on epithelial tissue, or by heavy metals, such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, each with its own specific destructive action. Many other chemicals are toxic in specific amounts, in certain people, and in distinctive tissues. Excessive secretion of
hydrochloric acid can damage the stomach lining; large amounts of glucose can cause osmotic shifts, affecting the fluid and electrolyte balance; and too much insulin can cause subnormal levels of glucose in the blood (hypoglycemia) and can lead to coma.

Drugs, including prescribed medications, can also cause chemical poisoning. Some individuals are less tolerant of medications than others and manifest toxic reactions at the usual or customary dosages. Aging tends to decrease tolerance to medications. Polypharmacy (taking many medications at one time) also occurs frequently in the aging population and is a problem because of the unpredictable effects of the resulting medication interactions.

Alcohol (ethanol) is also a chemical irritant. In the body, alcohol is broken down into acetaldehyde, which has a direct toxic effect on liver cells that leads to a variety of liver abnormalities, including cirrhosis in susceptible individuals. Disordered liver cell function leads to complications in other organs of the body.

\section*{Infectious Agents}

Biologic agents known to cause disease in humans are viruses, bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes. The severity of the infectious disease depends on the number of microorganisms entering the body, their virulence, and the host's defenses (eg, health, age, immune defenses).

Some bacteria, such as those that cause tetanus and diphtheria, produce exotoxins that circulate and create cell damage. Others, such as the gram-negative bacteria, produce endotoxins when they are killed. The tubercle bacillus induces an immune reaction.

Viruses, the smallest living organisms, survive as parasites of the living cells they invade. Viruses infect specific cells. Through a complex mechanism, they replicate within the cells, then invade other cells and continue to replicate. An immune response is mounted by the body to eliminate the viruses, and the cells harboring the viruses can be injured in the process. Typically, an inflammatory response and immune reaction are the physiologic responses of the body to the presence of infection.

\section*{Disordered Immune Responses}

The immune system is an exceedingly complex system; its purpose is to defend the body from invasion by any foreign object or foreign cell type, such as cancerous cells. This is a steady-state mechanism, but like other adjustment processes it can become disordered, and cell injury will occur. The immune response detects foreign bodies by distinguishing non-self substances from self substances and destroying the non-self entities. The entrance of an antigen (foreign substance) into the body evokes the production of antibodies that attack and destroy the antigen (antigen-antibody reaction).

The immune system can be hypoactive or hyperactive. When it is hypoactive, immunodeficiency diseases occur; when it is hyperactive, hypersensitivity disorders arise. A disorder of the immune system itself can result in damage to the body's own tissues. Such disorders are labeled autoimmune diseases (see Unit 11).

\section*{Genetic Disorders}

Genetic defects as causes of disease and their effects on genetic structure are of intense research interest. Many of these defects produce mutations that have no recognizable effect, such as lack of a single enzyme; others contribute to more obvious congenital abnormalities, such as Down syndrome. As a result of the Human Genome Project, patients can be genetically assessed for
conditions such as sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia A and B , breast cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, phenylketonuria, and Alzheimer's disease. The availability of genetic information and technology enables health care providers to perform screening, testing, and counseling for patients with genetic concerns. Knowledge obtained from the Human Genome Project has also created opportunities for assessing a person's genetic profile and preventing or treating disease. Diagnostic genetics and gene therapy have the potential to identify and modify a gene before it begins to express traits that would lead to disease or disability.

\section*{CELLULAR RESPONSE TO INJURY: INFLAMMATION}

Cells or tissues of the body may be injured or killed by any of the agents (physical, chemical, infectious) described earlier. When this happens, an inflammatory response (or inflammation) naturally occurs in the healthy tissues adjacent to the site of injury. Inflammation is a defensive reaction intended to neutralize, control, or eliminate the offending agent and to prepare the site for repair. It is a nonspecific response (not dependent on a particular cause) that is meant to serve a protective function. For example, inflammation may be observed at the site of a bee sting, in a sore throat, in a surgical incision, and at a burn site. Inflammation also occurs in cell injury events, such as strokes and myocardial infarctions.

Inflammation is not the same as infection. An infectious agent is only one of several agents that may trigger an inflammatory response. An infection exists when the infectious agent is living, growing, and multiplying in the tissues and is able to overcome the body's normal defenses.

Regardless of the cause, a general sequence of events occurs in the local inflammatory response. This sequence involves changes in the microcirculation, including vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and leukocytic cellular infiltration (Fig. 6-5). As these changes take place, five cardinal signs of inflammation are produced: redness, heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function.

The transient vasoconstriction that occurs immediately after injury is followed by vasodilation and an increased rate of blood flow through the microcirculation. Local heat and redness result. Next, vascular permeability increases, and plasma fluids (including proteins and solutes) leak into the inflamed tissues, producing swelling. The pain produced is attributed to the pressure of fluids or swelling on nerve endings, and to the irritation of nerve endings by chemical mediators released at the site. Bradykinin is one of the chemical mediators suspected of causing pain. Loss of function is most likely related to the pain and swelling, but the exact mechanism is not completely known.

As blood flow increases and fluid leaks into the surrounding tissues, the formed elements (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) remain in the blood, causing it to become more viscous. Leukocytes (white blood cells) collect in the vessels, exit, and migrate to the site of injury to engulf offending organisms and to remove cellular debris in a process called phagocytosis. Fibrinogen in the leaked plasma fluid coagulates, forming fibrin for clot formation, which serves to wall off the injured area and prevent the spread of infection.

\section*{Chemical Mediators}

Injury initiates the inflammatory response, but chemical substances released at the site induce the vascular changes. Foremost among these chemicals are histamine and the kinins. Histamine

\end{figure}
is present in many tissues of the body but is concentrated in the mast cells. It is released when injury occurs and is responsible for the early changes in vasodilation and vascular permeability. Kinins increase vasodilation and vascular permeability; they also attract neutrophils to the area. Prostaglandins, another group of chemical substances, are also suspected of causing increased permeability.

\section*{Systemic Response to Inflammation}

The inflammatory response is often confined to the site, causing only local signs and symptoms. However, systemic responses can also occur. Fever is the most common sign of a systemic response to injury, and it is most likely caused by endogenous pyrogens (internal substances that cause fever) released from neutrophils and macrophages (specialized forms of leukocytes). These substances reset the hypothalamic thermostat, which controls body temperature, and produce fever. Leukocytosis, an increase in the synthesis and release of neutrophils from bone marrow, may occur to provide the body with greater ability to fight infection. During this process, general, nonspecific symptoms develop, including malaise, loss of appetite, aching, and weakness.

\section*{Types of Inflammation}

Inflammation is categorized primarily by its duration and the type of exudate produced. It may be acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute inflammation is characterized by the local vascular and exudative changes described earlier and usually lasts less than 2 weeks. An acute inflammatory response is immediate and serves a protective
function. After the injurious agent is removed, the inflammation subsides and healing takes place with the return of normal or nearnormal structure and function.

Chronic inflammation develops if the injurious agent persists and the acute response is perpetuated. Symptoms are present for many months or years. Chronic inflammation may also begin insidiously and never have an acute phase. The chronic response does not serve a beneficial and protective function; on the contrary, it is debilitating and can produce long-lasting effects. As the inflammation becomes chronic, changes occur at the site of injury and the nature of the exudate becomes proliferative. A cycle of cellular infiltration, necrosis, and fibrosis begins, with repair and breakdown occurring simultaneously. Considerable scarring may occur, resulting in permanent tissue damage.

Subacute inflammation falls between acute and chronic inflammation. It includes elements of the active exudative phase of the acute response as well as elements of repair, as in the chronic phase. The term subacute inflammation is not widely used.

\section*{CELLULAR HEALING}

The reparative process begins at approximately the same time as the injury and is interwoven with inflammation. Healing proceeds after the inflammatory debris has been removed. Healing may occur by regeneration, in which gradual repair of the defect occurs by proliferation of cells of the same type as those destroyed, or by replacement, in which cells of another type, usually connective tissue, fill in the tissue defect and result in scar formation.

\section*{Healing by Regeneration}

The ability of cells to regenerate depends on whether they are labile, permanent, or stable. Labile cells multiply constantly to replace cells worn out by normal physiologic processes; these include epithelial cells of the skin and those lining the gastrointestinal tract. Permanent cells include neurons-the nerve cell bodies, not their axons. Destruction of a neuron is a permanent loss, but axons may regenerate. If normal activity is to return, tissue regeneration must occur in a functional pattern, especially in the growth of several axons. Stable cells have a latent ability to regenerate. Under normal physiologic processes, they are not shed and do not need replacement, but if they are damaged or destroyed, they are able to regenerate. These include functional cells of the kidney, liver, and pancreas.

\section*{Healing by Replacement}

Depending on the extent of damage, tissue healing may occur by primary intention or by secondary intention. In primary intention healing, the wound is clean and dry and the edges are approximated, as in a surgical wound. Little scar formation occurs, and the wound is usually healed in a week. In secondary intention healing, the wound or defect is larger and gaping and has necrotic or dead material. The wound fills from the bottom upward with granulation tissue. The process of repair takes longer and results in more scar formation, with loss of specialized function. People who have recovered from myocardial infarction, for example, have abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) tracings because the electrical signal cannot be conducted through the connective tissue that has replaced the infarcted area.

The condition of the host, the environment, and the nature and severity of the injury affect the processes of inflammation and
repair. Any of the injuries previously discussed can lead to death of the cell. Essentially, the cell membrane becomes impaired, resulting in a nonrestricted flow of ions. Sodium and calcium enter the cell, followed by water, which leads to edema, and energy transformation ceases. Nerve impulses are no longer transmitted; muscles no longer contract. As the cells rupture, lysosomal enzymes that destroy tissues escape, and cell death and necrosis occur.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

In the assessment of the person who seeks health care, both objective signs and subjective symptoms are the primary indicators of the physiologic processes that are occurring. The following questions are addressed during the assessment:
- Are the heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature normal?
- What emotional distress may be contributing to the patient's health problems?
- Are there other indicators of steady-state deviation?
- What is the person's blood pressure, height, and weight?
- Are there any problems in movement or sensation?
- Does the person demonstrate any problems with affect, behavior, speech, cognitive ability, orientation, or memory?
- Are there obvious impairments, lesions, or deformities?

Further signs of change are indicated in diagnostic studies such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Objective evidence can also be obtained from laboratory data, including electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and urinalysis.

In making a nursing diagnosis, the nurse must relate the symptoms or complaints expressed by the patient to the physical signs that are present. Management of specific biologic disorders is discussed in subsequent chapters; however, the nurse can assist any patient to respond to stress-inducing biologic or psychological disorders with stress-management interventions.

\section*{Stress Management: Nursing Interventions}

Stress or the potential for stress is ubiquitous; that is, it is everywhere and anywhere at once. Anxiety, frustration, anger, and feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, or powerlessness are emotions often associated with stress. In the presence of these emotions, the customary activities of daily living may be disrupted; for example, a sleep disturbance may be present, eating and activity patterns may be altered, and family processes or role performance may be disrupted.

Many nursing diagnoses are possible for patients suffering from stress. One nursing diagnosis related to stress is Anxiety, which is defined as a vague, uneasy feeling, the source of which may be nonspecific or not known to the person. Stress may also be manifested as ineffective coping patterns, impaired thought processes, or disrupted relationships. These human responses are reflected in the nursing diagnoses of Impaired adjustment, Ineffective coping, Defensive coping, and Ineffective denial, all of which indicate poor adaptive responses. Other possible nursing diagnoses include Social isolation, Risk for impaired parenting, Spiritual distress, Readiness for family coping, Decisional conflict, Situational low self-esteem, and Powerlessness, among others. Because human responses to stress are varied, as are the sources of stress, arriving at an accurate diagnosis allows interventions and goals to be more specific and leads to improved outcomes.

Stress management is directed toward reducing and controlling stress and improving coping. Nurses might use these methods not only with their patients but also in their own lives. The need to prevent illness, improve the quality of life, and decrease the cost of health care makes efforts to promote health essential, and stress control is a significant health-promotion goal. Stressreduction methods and coping enhancements can derive from either internal or external sources. For example, adopting healthy eating habits and practicing relaxation techniques are internal resources that help to reduce stress; developing a broad social network is an external resource that helps reduce stress. Goods and services that can be purchased are also external resources for stress management, and it is much easier for individuals with adequate financial resources to cope with constraints in the environment, because their sense of vulnerability to threat is decreased.

\section*{PROMOTING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE}

An individual's personal resources that aid in coping include health and energy. A health-promoting lifestyle provides these resources and buffers or cushions the impact of stressors. Lifestyles or habits that contribute to the risk of illness can be identified through a health risk appraisal.

A health risk appraisal is an assessment method that is designed to promote health by examining an individual's personal habits and recommending changes when a health risk is identified. Health risk questionnaires estimate the likelihood that a person with a given set of characteristics will become ill. It is hoped that if people are provided with this information, they will alter their activities (eg, stop smoking, have periodic screening examinations) to improve their health. Questionnaires typically address the following information:
1. Demographic data: age, sex, race, ethnic background
2. Personal and family history of diseases and health problems
3. Lifestyle choices
a. Eating, sleeping, exercise, smoking, drinking, sexual activity, and driving habits
b. Stressors at home and on the job
c. Role relationships and associated stressors
4. Physical measurements
a. Blood pressure
b. Height, weight
c. Laboratory analyses of blood and urine
5. Participation in high-risk behaviors

The personal information is compared with average population risk data, and the risk factors are identified and weighted. From this analysis, the person's risks and major health hazards are identified. Further comparisons with population data can estimate how many years will be added to the person's life span if the suggested changes are made. However, research so far has not demonstrated that providing people with such information ensures that they will change their habits. The single most important factor for determining health status is social class, and within a social class the research suggests that the major factor influencing health is level of education (Mickler, 1997).

\section*{ENHANCING COPING STRATEGIES}

McCloskey and Bulechek (1999) identified "coping enhancement" as a nursing intervention and defined it as "assisting a patient to adapt to perceived stressors, changes, or threats that interfere with meeting life demands and roles" (Chart 6-2). The
nurse can build on the patient's existing coping strategies, as identified in the health appraisal, or teach new strategies for coping if necessary.

The five predominant ways of coping with illness identified in a review of 57 nursing research studies were as follows (Jalowiec, 1993):
- Trying to be optimistic about the outcome
- Using social support
- Using spiritual resources
- Trying to maintain control either over the situation or over feelings
- Trying to accept the situation

Other ways of coping included seeking information, reprioritizing needs and roles, lowering expectations, making compromises, comparing oneself to others, planning activities to conserve energy, taking things one step at a time, listening to one's body, and using self-talk for encouragement.

The nurse can implement the coping enhancement interventions and explore methods for improving the patient's coping abilities.

\section*{TEACHING RELAXATION TECHNIQUES}

Relaxation techniques are a major method used to relieve stress. Commonly used techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, the Benson Relaxation Response, and relaxation with guided imagery. The goal of relaxation training is to produce a response that counters the stress response. When this goal is achieved, the action of the hypothalamus adjusts and decreases the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sequence of physiologic effects and their signs and symptoms are interrupted, and psychological stress is reduced. This is a learned response and requires practice to achieve.

The different relaxation techniques share four similar elements: (1) a quiet environment, (2) a comfortable position, (3) a passive attitude, and (4) a mental device (something on which to focus the attention, such as a word, phrase, or sound).

\section*{Progressive Muscle Relaxation}

Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing the muscles of the body in sequence and sensing the difference in feeling. It is best if the person lies on a soft cushion on the floor, in a quiet room, breathing easily. Someone usually reads the instructions in a low tone and with a slow and relaxed manner, or a tape of the instructions may be played. The person tenses the muscles in the whole body (one muscle group at a time), holds, senses the tension, and then relaxes. As each muscle group is tensed, the person keeps the rest of the body relaxed. Each time the focus is on feeling the tension and relaxation. When the exercise is completed, the whole body should be relaxed (Benson, 1993; Benson \& Stark, 1996).

\section*{Benson's Relaxation Response}

Benson (1993) describes the following steps of the Benson Relaxation Response:
1. Pick a brief phrase or word that reflects your basic belief system.
2. Choose a comfortable position.
3. Close your eyes.
4. Relax your muscles.
5. Become aware of your breathing, and start using your selected focus word.
6. Maintain a passive attitude.
7. Continue for a set period of time.
8. Practice the technique twice daily.

This response combines meditation with relaxation. Along with the repeated word or phrase, a passive attitude is essential. If other thoughts or distractions (noises, the pain of an ailment) occur, Benson recommends not fighting the distraction but simply continuing to repeat the focus phrase. The time of day is not important, but the exercise works best on an empty stomach.

\section*{Relaxation With Guided Imagery}

Simple guided imagery is the "purposeful use of imagination to achieve relaxation or direct attention away from undesirable sensations" (McCloskey \& Bulechek, 1999, p. 506). The nurse helps the person select a pleasant scene or experience, such as watching the ocean or dabbling the feet in a cool stream. This image serves as the mental device in this technique. As the person sits comfortably and quietly, the nurse guides the individual to review the
scene, trying to feel and relive the imagery with all of the senses. A tape recording may be made of the description of the image, or commercial tape recordings for guided imagery and relaxation can be used.

Other relaxation techniques include meditation, breathing techniques, massage, Reiki, music therapy, biofeedback, and the use of humor.

\section*{EDUCATING}

Two commonly prescribed nursing educational interventionsproviding sensory information and providing procedural information (eg, preoperative teaching)-have the goal of reducing stress and improving the patient's coping ability. This preparatory education includes giving structured content, such as a lesson in childbirth preparation to expectant parents, a review of cardiovascular anatomy to the cardiac patient, or a description of sensations the patient will experience during cardiac catheterization. These techniques may alter the person-environment relationship such that something that might have been viewed as harmful or a threat will now be perceived more positively. Giving patients information also reduces the emotional response so
that they can concentrate and solve problems more effectively (Calvin \& Lane, 1999; Millo \& Sullivan, 2000).

\section*{ENHANCING SOCIAL SUPPORT}

The nature of social support and its influence on coping have been studied extensively; social support has been demonstrated to be an effective moderator of life stress. Social support has been found to provide the individual with several different types of emotional information (Heitzman \& Kaplan, 1988; Wineman, 1990). The first type of information leads people to believe that they are cared for and loved. This emotional support appears most often in a relationship between two people in which mutual trust and attachment are expressed by helping one another meet their emotional needs. The second type of information leads people to believe that they are esteemed and valued. This is most effective when there is recognition that demonstrates the individual's favorable position in the group. It elevates the person's sense of self-worth and is called esteem support. The third type of information leads people to believe that they belong to a network of communication and mutual obligation. Members of this network share information and make goods and services available to the members on demand.

Social support also facilitates an individual's coping behaviors; this depends, however, on the nature of the social support. People can have extensive relationships and interact frequently, but the necessary support comes only when there is a deep level of involvement and concern, not when people merely touch the surface of each other's lives. The critical qualities within a social network are the exchange of intimate communications and the presence of solidarity and trust.

Emotional support from family and significant others provides a person with love and a sense of sharing the burden. The emotions that accompany stress are unpleasant and often increase in a spiraling fashion if relief is not provided. Being able to talk with someone and express feelings openly may help the person to gain mastery of the situation. Nurses can provide this support; however, it is important to identify the person's social support system and encourage its use. People who are loners, who are isolated, or who withdraw in times of stress have a high risk of coping failure.

Because anxiety can also distort a person's ability to process information, it helps to seek information and advice from others who can assist with analyzing the threat and developing a strategy to manage it. Again, this use of others helps the person to maintain mastery of a situation and to retain self-esteem.

Thus, social networks assist with management of stress by providing the individual with
- A positive social identity
- Emotional support
- Material aid and tangible services
- Access to information
- Access to new social contacts and new social roles

\section*{RECOMMENDING SUPPORT AND THERAPY GROUPS}

Support groups exist especially for people in similar stressful situations. Groups have been formed by parents of children with leukemia, people with ostomies, mastectomy patients, and those with other kinds of cancer or other serious diseases, chronic illnesses, and disabilities. There are groups for single parents, sub-
stance abusers and their family members, and victims of child abuse. Professional, civic, and religious support groups are active in many communities. There are also encounter groups, assertiveness training programs, and consciousness-raising groups to help people modify their usual behaviors in their transactions with their environment. Being a member of a group with similar problems or goals has a releasing effect on a person that promotes freedom of expression and exchange of ideas.

As previously noted, a person's psychological and biologic health, internal and external sources of stress management, and relationships with the environment are predictors of health outcomes. These factors are directly related to the health patterns of the individual. The nurse has a significant role and responsibility in identifying the health patterns of the person receiving care. If those patterns are not achieving physiologic, psychological, and social balance, the nurse is obligated, with the assistance and agreement of the patient, to seek ways to promote balance.

Although this chapter has presented some physiologic mechanisms and perspectives on health and disease, the way that one copes with stress, the way one relates to others, and the values and goals held are also interwoven into those physiologic patterns. To evaluate a patient's health patterns and to intervene if a problem exists requires a total assessment of the person. Specific problems and their nursing management are addressed in greater depth in other chapters.

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Think about a patient who has survived a major motor vehicle crash and is hospitalized for severe burns, a fractured hip, and multiple lacerations and abrasions. Identify the actual and potential physical, physiological, and psychosocial stressors evident from this person's trauma. Determine nursing strategies to reduce or alleviate these stressors.
2. A 50-year-old woman is diagnosed with osteoporosis after sustaining a rib fracture. The nurse is evaluating the coping style of the woman. What indications would the nurse note in her interactions and follow-up care for this patient that demonstrate that the woman uses problemfocused coping and emotion-focused coping?
3. Select a patient to whom you are assigned who has an acute illness or injury. Describe the manner in which homeostasis has been maintained or disrupted and the compensatory mechanisms that are evident. How does the patient's medical treatment support the compensatory mechanisms? How do you determine the nursing interventions that are appropriate for promoting the healing process?
4. A family composed of two parents, two adolescent male sons, and the maternal grandfather explore with the nurse their health promotion needs. The family's health history reveals that the mother has adult-onset diabetes; the father has coronary artery disease; the sons are somewhat overweight; and the grandfather has mild congestive heart failure. The family has ample resources for making changes in their lifestyle. What interventions would the nurse initiate to promote a healthier lifestyle for this family?

\section*{Individual and Family Considerations Related to Illness}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the holistic approach to sustaining health and well-being.
2. Discuss the concepts of emotional well-being and emotional distress.
3. Identify variables that influence the ability to cope with stress and that are antecedents to emotional disorders.
4. Explain the concepts of anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, loss, and grief.
5. Describe a framework for understanding death and dying.
6. Assess the impact of illness on the patient's family and on family functioning.
7. Determine the role of the nurse in identifying substance abuse problems and in assisting the family to cope.
8. Explore the concept of spirituality and address the spiritual needs of patients.
9. Identify nursing actions that promote effective coping for both the patient and the family.
hen people experience threats to their health, they seek out various care providers for the purpose of maintaining or restoring health. In recent years, both the patient and the family have become more involved participants in health care and health promotion activities. At the same time, greater numbers of consumers and practitioners have recognized the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit in sustaining well-being and overcoming or coping with illness. This holistic approach to health and wellness and the increased consumer involvement reflect a renewed emphasis on the concepts of choice, healing, and patientpractitioner partnerships. The holistic perspective focuses not only on promoting well-being but also on understanding how one's emotional state contributes to health and illness. By using this knowledge, people are better able to prevent the reoccurrence or exacerbation of problems and to develop strategies to improve their future health status.

\section*{Holistic Approach to Health and Health Care}

Since the 1980s, holistic therapies have more frequently accompanied traditional health care. A survey on the use of holistic health practices reported that about $34 \%$ of the 1539 respondents in a national random sample of adults older than 18 years of age ( 732 women and 807 men) had consulted with at least one holistic health care practitioner within the past year. The study further noted that although many of the people were also seeing a traditional health care provider, $72 \%$ did not inform the physician that they were obtaining holistic treatment (Eisenberg, et al., 1993). Several additional research studies (Sparber, et al., 2000; Wynia, Eisenberg, \& Wilson, 1999) support the original work of Eisenberg's group indicating that adult clients, even clients participating in clinical research trials, frequently use complementary therapies to assist them in coping with their illnesses and treatments. The need to discuss the use of these adjunct therapies with clients in all settings is imperative. During their clinical assessments, nurses must obtain information about the client's use of complementary therapies. Some of the most commonly used complementary therapies are listed in Chart 7-1.

For some people, the holistic approach is viewed as a way to capitalize on personal strengths and recultivate the values and beliefs about health that were common before the age of technological innovations and the sophistication of biomedical science. A lack of focus on the individual patient, the family, and the environment by some health care providers has created feelings of disillusionment

and depersonalization in many patients. The cost of illness, especially chronic illness care, continues to escalate and accounts for an increasing percentage of health care dollars. At the same time, patient satisfaction with the health care received has decreased.

Active participation of the patient and family in promoting health supports the self-care model historically embraced by the nursing profession. This model is congruent with the philosophy that seeks to balance and integrate the use of crisis medicine and advanced technology with the influence of the mind and spirit on healing. A holistic approach to health reconnects the traditionally separate approaches to mind and body. Factors such as the physical environment, economic conditions, sociocultural issues, emotional state, interpersonal relationships, and support systems can work together or alone to influence health. The connections among physical health, emotional health, and spiritual well-being must be understood and considered when providing health care. It is the nurse's conceptual integration of the physiologic health condition with the emotional and social context, along with the tasks and developments of the patient's life stage, that allows for the development of a holistic plan of nursing care.

\section*{The Brain and Physical and Emotional Health}

Research on brain structure and function, neurochemical messenger systems (neurotransmitters), and brain-body connections suggests fundamental, delicate, two-way relationships between
anxiety: an emotional state characterized by feelings of apprehension, discomfort, restlessness, or worry
bereavement: feelings, thoughts, and responses that occur after a loss
complementary therapies: used as an adjunct to traditional health modalities; they typically influence the effects of stress, anxiety, depression, and other physical and emotional states
depression: state in which a person feels sad, distressed, and hopeless, with little to no energy for normal activities
faith: belief and trust in a God or higher power
family: a group whose members are related by reciprocal caring, mutual responsibilities, and loyalties
grief: a universal response to any loss
holistic health: promotion of the total health of mind, body, and spirit
homeopathic medicine: a system of medicine that promotes healing of the whole person by stimulating the natural healing processes within the person
mental disorder: a state in which a person has deficits in functioning, has a distorted sense of self or the world, is unable to sustain relationships, or cannot handle stress or conflict effectively
mental health: a state in which a person can meet basic needs, assume responsibilities, sustain relationships, resolve conflicts, and grow throughout life
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): the development of severe anxiety-type symptoms after the experience of a traumatic life event
substance abuse: a maladaptive pattern of drug use that causes physical and emotional harm with the potential for disruption of daily life
the brain's environment and mood, behavior, and resistance to disease (Cohen \& Herbert, 1996). One focus of brain research has been to identify and integrate traditional medical and psychiatric knowledge with new psychobiologic and psychoneuroimmunologic data. Researchers in the field of psychobiology study the biologic basis of mental disturbances and have established some relationships between mental disorders and changes in the structure and function of the brain. Researchers in the field of psychoneuroimmunology study the connections between the emotions, the central nervous system, the neuroendocrine system, and the immune system and have established compelling evidence that psychosocial variables can affect the functioning of the immune system.

As this neuroscientific research continues, data about neurotransmitters and the functioning of the brain will augment existing understanding of emotions, intelligence, memory, and many aspects of general body functioning. In the future, an accepted definition of mental illness may well include biologic information. By enhancing the biologic knowledge base about the brain and nervous system, scientists establish the foundation for breakthroughs in the treatment of both symptoms and illnesses.

These findings suggest that the health care community ought to place as much emphasis on emotional health as it places on physiologic health and ought to recognize how biologic, emotional, and societal problems combine to affect individual patients, families, and communities. Some problems that nurses and other health care providers must address include substance abuse, homelessness, family violence, eating disorders, trauma, and chronic mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. To focus attention on these and other mental health problems, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiated a mental health agenda for the nation in the document entitled Healthy People 2010 (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000). The objectives identified are summarized in Chart 7-2. Nurses in all settings encounter patients with mental health problems and have an integral role in helping to achieve the national goals by recognizing and treating emotional distress and promoting emotional health.

\section*{Emotional Health and Emotional Distress}

The concept of emotional health encompasses a person's ability to function as comfortably and productively as possible. Typically, people who are mentally healthy are satisfied with themselves and their life situations. In the usual course of living, emotionally healthy people focus on activities geared to meet their needs and attempt to accomplish personal goals while concurrently managing everyday challenges and problems. Often, people must work hard to balance their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors to alleviate emotional distress, and much energy is used to change, adapt, or manage the obstacles inherent in daily living. A mentally healthy person accepts reality and has a positive sense of self. Emotional health is also manifested by having moral and humanistic values and beliefs, having satisfying interpersonal relationships, doing productive work, and maintaining a realistic sense of hope (Chart 7-3).

When people have unmet emotional needs or distress, they experience an overall feeling of unhappiness. As tension escalates, security and survival are threatened. How different people respond to these troublesome situations reflects their level of coping and maturity. Emotionally healthy people endeavor to meet the demands of distressing situations while still facing the typical issues that emerge in their lives. The ways in which people respond to uncomfortable stimuli reflect their exposure to various biologic, emotional, and sociocultural experiences.

When stress interferes with a person's ability to function comfortably and inhibits the effective management of personal needs, that person is at risk for emotional problems. The use of ineffective and unhealthy methods of coping is manifested by dysfunctional behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. These behaviors are aimed at relieving the overwhelming stress, even though they may cause further problems.

Coping ability is strongly influenced by biologic or genetic factors, physical and emotional growth and development, family and childhood experiences, and learning. Typically, a person reverts to the strategies observed early in life that were used by family

members, caregivers, and others to solve conflict. If these strategies were not adaptive, the person exhibits a range of painful and nonproductive behaviors. Dysfunctional behavior in one person not only seriously affects that person's emotional health but can also put others at risk for injury or death. As these destructive behaviors are repeated, a cyclic pattern becomes evident: impaired thinking, negative feelings, and more dysfunctional actions that prevent the person from meeting the demands of daily living (Chart 7-4).

No universally accepted definition of what constitutes an emotional disorder exists. But many views and theories share in common the idea that a number of variables can interfere with emotional growth and development and impede successful adaptation to the environment. Most clinicians have adopted the statement from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR), which defines the term mental disorder as a group of behavioral or psychological symptoms or a pattern that manifests itself in significant distress, impaired functioning, or accentuated risk of enduring severe suffering or possible death (American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. xxi). Risk factors for mental health problems are listed in Chart 7-5.

Patients seen in medical-surgical settings often struggle with psychosocial issues of anxiety, depression, loss, and grief. Abuse, addiction, chemical dependency, body image disturbances, and eating disorders are a few examples of health situations that require extensive physical and emotional care to restore optimal functioning. The dual challenge for the health team is to understand how the patient's emotions influence current physiologic conditions and to identify the best care for the patient experiencing underlying emotional and spiritual distress.

\section*{Family Health and Distress}

The family plays a central role in the life of the patient and is a major part of the context of the patient's life. It is within families that people grow, are nurtured, attain a sense of self, cultivate beliefs and values about life, and progress through life's developmental stages (Chart 7-6). The family is also the first source for socialization and teaching about health and illness. The family prepares the person with strategies for balancing closeness with separateness and togetherness with individuality. A major role of the family is to provide physical and emotional resources to maintain health and a system of support in times of crises, such as in periods of illness. Educating families has been shown to add to their resiliency, adaptation, and adjustment to life stressors (Friedman, 1998).

When a family member becomes ill, all members of the family are affected. Depending on the nature of the health problem, family members may need to make several adaptations to their existing lifestyles or even restructure their lifestyles.

Health problems often have an impact on the family's ability to function. Five family functions described by Wright and Leahey (2000) are viewed as essential to the individual's and family's growth. The first function, management, involves the use of power, decision making about resources, establishment of rules, provision of finances, and future planning-responsibilities assumed by the adults of the family. The second function, boundary setting, makes clear distinctions between the generations and the roles of adults and children within the family structure. Communication is the third function that is important to individual and family growth; healthy families have a full range of clear, di-

rect, and meaningful communication among their members. The fourth function is education and support. Education involves modeling skills for living a physically, emotionally, and socially healthy life; support is manifested by actions that tell family members they are cared about and loved. Family support promotes health and is seen as a critical factor in coping with crises and illness situations. The final function is socialization. Families transmit culture and the acceptable behaviors needed to perform adequately in the home and in the world.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

There are many degrees of family functioning. The nurse assesses family functioning to determine how the family will cope with the impact of the health condition. If the family is chaotic or disorganized, promoting coping skills becomes a priority in the plan of care. The family with preexisting problems may require additional assistance before participating fully in the current health situation. In performing a family assessment, the nurse must evaluate the present family structure and function. Areas of appraisal include demographic data, developmental information (keeping in mind that family members can be in several different developmental stages simultaneously), family structure, family functioning, and coping abilities. The role that the environment plays in family health is also assessed.

Interventions with family members are based on strengthening coping skills through direct care, communication skills, and education. Healthy family communication has a strong influence on the quality of family life and can help the family to make appropriate choices, consider alternative strategies, or persevere through complex circumstances. Within a family system, for example, the identified patient may be undergoing extensive surgery for cancer while the partner has cardiac disease, the adolescent has type 1 diabetes, and the child has a fractured arm. In this situation, there are multiple health concerns along with competing developmental tasks and needs. Despite the obvious concerns of the family members, both individually and collectively, a crisis may or may not be present. This family may be coping effectively; alternatively, the family may be in crisis or may manifest a chronic inability to
handle the situation. The health team conducts a careful and comprehensive family assessment, develops interventions tailored to handle the stressors, implements the specified treatment protocols, and facilitates the construction of social support systems.

The use of existing family strengths, resources, and education is augmented by therapeutic family interventions. The nurse's primary goals are to maintain and improve the patient's present level of health and to prevent physical and emotional deterioration. Next, the nurse intervenes in the cycle that the illness creates: patient illness, stress for other family members, generation of potential for illness in other family members, and additional stress for the patient.

Helping the family members handle the myriad stressors that bombard them daily involves working with family members to develop coping skills. In a 1994 study, Burr and associates identified seven traits that enhance coping of family members under stress. Communication skills and spirituality were the most useful traits. Cognitive abilities, emotional strengths, relationship capabilities, willingness to use community resources, and individual strengths and talents were also associated with effective coping. As nurses work with families, they must not underestimate the impact that their therapeutic interactions, educational information, positive role modeling, provision of direct care, and corrective teaching have on promoting health.

Without the active support of the family members and the health team, the potential for using maladaptive coping mechanisms increases. Often, denial and blaming of individuals occur. Sometimes, physiologic illness, emotional withdrawal, and physical distancing are the results of severe family conflict, violent behaviors, or addiction to drugs and alcohol. Substance abuse is sometimes the outcome for family members who view their ability to cope or solve problems as impossible. Often, people engage in these dysfunctional behaviors when faced with difficult or problematic situations.

\section*{Anxiety}

All people experience some degree of anxiety (a tense emotional state) as they face new, challenging, or threatening life situations. In clinical settings, fear of the unknown, unexpected news about one's health, and any impairment of bodily functions engenders anxiety. Although a mild level of anxiety can mobilize people to take a position, act on the task that needs to be done, or learn to alter lifestyle habits, a more severe level can be almost paralyzing. Anxiety that escalates to a near panic state can be incapacitating. When patients receive unwelcome news about results of diagnostic studies, they are sure to experience anxiety. Different patients manifest the physiologic, emotional, and behavioral signs and symptoms of anxiety in various ways (Nursing Research Profile 7-1).

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

Early clinical observations of guilt or anxiety are an essential component of nursing care (Chart 7-7). A high level of anxiety in a patient will probably exacerbate physiologic distress. For example, a postoperative patient who is in pain may discover that anxiety intensifies the sensation of pain. A patient newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus may be worried and fearful and therefore unable to focus on or complete essential self-care activities. The possibility of developing somatic symptoms is high in any patient who is experiencing moderate to severe anxiety.

The DSM-IV TR (2000) lists general medical conditions that cause anxiety. They include endocrine diseases, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and hyperadrenocor-

Anxiety and Coping Behaviors
Dropkin, M. J. (2001). Anxiety, coping strategies, and coping behaviors in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery. Cancer Nursing, 24(2), 143-148.

\section*{Purpose}

This research study described the relationships between preoperative anxiety and the use of coping strategies, and between postoperative self-care and resocialization behaviors, in patients who have facial disfigurement or dysfunction as a result of head and neck cancer surgery.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The sample for this descriptive correlational study consisted of 75 participants ( 53 men and 22 women) who were about to sustain facial disfigurement and dysfunction as an outcome of head and neck surgery. Subjects were requested to complete the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Ways of Coping Questionnaire before their surgery and the Coping Behaviors Score and the Disfigurement/Dysfunction Scale afterward.

\section*{Findings}

The results of the study revealed no significant correlations between preoperative anxiety and the percentage of problem-focused coping strategies used to handle disfiguring surgery. A high level of anxiety was present, which was equivalent to the anxiety of people admitted to a psychiatric treatment center for an acute anxiety reaction. Although there was low use of problem-focused coping strategies before the surgery, postoperative coping behaviors occurred early in the recovery period. Scores indicated that severe functional impairment was present immediately after surgery. The anxiety scores for these patients decreased over time, but there was no significant correlation between disfigurement/dysfunction and anxiety. The level of anxiety was negatively correlated with self-care after surgery on the fourth and fifth postoperative days. These findings indicate that anxiety is decreased by the performance of selfcare behaviors in the early postoperative period.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

For the nurse caring for a postoperative patient who is undergoing head and neck surgery, it is important to recognize that early participation in self-care behaviors is associated with reduced anxiety in these patients. This relationship between anxiety and self-care increases over time. Therefore, nurses need to facilitate self-care activities in this population, because this intervention can help to promote positive postoperative outcomes.
ticism; cardiovascular conditions, such as cardiac dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary emboli; respiratory problems, such as pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and neurologic conditions, such as encephalitis and neoplasms.

Every nurse must be vigilant about the patient who worries excessively and demonstrates deterioration in emotional, social, or occupational functioning. If participation in the therapeutic regimen (eg, administration of insulin) becomes a problem because of extreme anxiety, nursing interventions must be immediately initiated. Caring strategies emphasize ways for the patient to verbalize feelings and fears and to identify sources of anxiety. The need to teach and promote effective coping abilities and the use of relaxation techniques are the priorities of care. In some cases, antianxiety medication may be prescribed. Chart $7-8$ provides a list of basic nursing principles that are useful for assisting patients to manage severe anxiety. Chapter 6 presents additional information about stress and the relaxation response.

\section*{Posttraumatic Stress Disorder}

In medical-surgical settings, especially in emergency departments, burn units, and rehabilitation centers, nurses care for extremely anxious patients who have experienced devastating events that are typically considered to be outside the realm of normal human experience. Many of these patients suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD has been described as a

\section*{Chart 7-8}

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Managing Anxiety}
- Listen actively and focus on having the patient discuss personal feelings.
- Use positive remarks and focus on the positive aspects of life in the "here and now."
- Use appropriate touch (with patient permission) to demonstrate support.
- Discuss the importance of safety and the patient's overall sense of well-being.
- Explain all procedures, policies, diagnostic studies, medications, treatments, or protocols for care.
- Explore coping strategies and work with the patient to practice and use them effectively (eg, breathing, progressive relaxation, visualization, imagery).
- Use distraction as indicated to relax and prevent self from being overwhelmed.
condition that generates waves of anxiety, anger, aggression, depression, and suspicion that threaten the person's sense of self and interfere with daily functioning. Specific examples of events that place a person at risk for PTSD are rape, family violence, torture, terrorism, fire, earthquake, and military combat. Patients who have suffered a traumatic event are often frequent users of the health care system by virtue of their extensive injuries, the various treatment modalities that they require, and the overall emotional and physical difficulties experienced.

The physiologic responses noted in people who have been severely traumatized include increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, increased plasma catecholamine levels, and increased urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. It has been postulated (Gelles, 1997; Gelles \& Loseke, 1993) that people with PTSD lose the ability to control their response to stimuli. The resulting excessive arousal can increase overall body metabolism and trigger emotional reactivity. In this situation, the nurse would observe that the patient has difficulty sleeping, has an exaggerated startle response, and is excessively vigilant.

Older people are more susceptible to the physical effects of trauma and the effects of PTSD because of the increased neural inactivation associated with aging. It has also been speculated that when people have a preexisting tendency to become extremely anxious, their vulnerability to PTSD increases (Nursing Research Profile 7-2).

Symptoms of PTSD can occur hours to years after the trauma is experienced. Acute PTSD is defined as the experience of symptoms for less than a 3-month period. Chronic PTSD is defined as the experience of symptoms lasting longer than 3 months. In the case of delayed PTSD, up to 6 months may elapse between the trauma and the manifestation of symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). For more information see Chart 7-9.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

It is often thought that the incidence of PTSD is very low in the overall population; when high-risk groups are studied, however, the results indicate that more than $50 \%$ of study participants have PTSD (McCann \& Pearlman, 1990). Therefore, it is important that nurses consider which of their patients are at risk for PTSD and be knowledgeable about the common symptoms associated with it.

The sensitivity and caring of the nurse creates the interpersonal relationship necessary to work with patients who have PTSD. These patients are physically compromised and are struggling emotionally with situations that are outside the realm of normal human experience-situations that violate the commonly held perceptions of human social justice. Treatment of patients with PTSD includes several essential components: establishing a trusting relationship, addressing and working through the trauma experience, and providing education about the coping skills needed for recovery and self-care. The patient's progress can be influenced by the ability to cope with the various aspects of both the physical and the emotional distress.

\section*{Depression}

Depression is a common response to health problems and is an often underdiagnosed problem in the patient population. People may become depressed as a result of injury or illness; may be suffering from an earlier loss that is compounded by a new health problem; or they may seek health care for somatic complaints that are bodily manifestations of depression.

\section*{Posttraumatic Stress Disorder}

Hampton, M. R., \& Frombach, I. (2000). Women's experience of traumatic stress in cancer treatment. Health Care of Women International, 21(1), 67-76.

\section*{Purpose}

A review of literature revealed that few articles in health care journals acknowledge that women's and men's experiences in the health care setting may often be different. The purpose of this study was to examine gender differences in the prevalence and predictors of cancer-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a group of cancer patients.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A total of 225 consecutive patients going to a local cancer clinic were invited to complete a questionnaire packet. The final sample size included 87 patients ( 59 women and 28 men). Subjects completed the Impact of Events Scale (to measure PTSD), the Appraisal of Life Threat and Treatment Intensity Scale (to differentiate between trauma related to cancer treatment and cancer diagnosis), Ways of Coping-Cancer Version (to measure coping strategies commonly used by cancer patients), and the Meaning of Illness Scale (to assess the meaning the patients constructed out of their experience and three measures of social support).

\section*{Findings}

The symptoms of PTSD were significantly higher for women than for men ( $p>.05$ ). Major predictors of PTSD for women were perceived intensity of the cancer treatment, problems with health care professionals, and a cognitive avoidance in their coping style. The only predictor of increased PTSD in men was behavioral avoidance. The women reported significantly higher ( $p>.05$ ) levels of treatment intensity, many more types of treatments and number of treatments, and more difficulties with health care professionals. It was further reported by the women that the interpersonal and relational facets of their illnesses were more stressful and were the most difficult aspects of having cancer. Men indicated that their stress was associated with the work role and loss of finances.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Some women find the experience of cancer treatment to be very difficult. The intensity of the treatment may place women at risk for development of PTSD. Overall, women need support from health care professionals, additional control over their treatment, opportunity to tell their stories and concerns, support groups, and access to complementary therapies. Having psychosocial resources available could assist in the prevention of, assessment for, and interventions with patients encountering cancer-related PTSD.

Clinical depression is distinguished from everyday feelings of sadness by its duration and severity. Most people occasionally feel down or depressed, but these feelings are short-lived and do not result in impaired functioning. Clinically depressed people usually have had signs of a depressed mood or a decreased interest in pleasurable activities for at least a 2 -week period. An obvious impairment in social, occupational, and overall daily functioning occurs in some people. Others function appropriately in their interactions with the outside world by exerting great effort and forcing themselves to mask their distress. Sometimes they are successful at camouflaging their depression for months or years and astonish family members and others when they finally succumb to the problem.

Many people experience depression but seek treatment for somatic complaints. The leading somatic complaints of patients struggling with depression are headache, backache, abdominal

pain, fatigue, malaise, anxiety, and decreased desire or problems with sexual functioning (Stuart \& Laraia, 2000). These sensations are frequently manifestations of depression. The depression is undiagnosed about half of the time and masquerades as physical health problems (Carson, 1999). People with depression also exhibit poor functioning and high rates of absenteeism from work and school.

Specific symptoms of clinical depression include feelings of sadness, worthlessness, fatigue, and guilt and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. Changes in appetite, weight gain or loss, sleep disturbances, and psychomotor retardation or agitation are also common. Often, patients have recurrent thoughts
about death or suicide or have made suicide attempts (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). A diagnosis of clinical depression is made when a person presents with at least five of nine diagnostic criteria for depression. Chart $7-10$ lists these criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Unfortunately, only one of three depressed people is properly diagnosed and appropriately treated.

In the United States, about 15\% of severely depressed people commit suicide, and two-thirds of patients who have committed suicide had been seen by health care practitioners during the month before their death (National Institute of Mental Health, 1999). When patients make statements that are self-deprecating, express feelings of failure, or are convinced that things are hopeless and will not improve, they may be at risk for suicide. Risk factors for suicide include the following:
- Age younger than 20 or older than 45 years, especially older than 65 years
- Gender-women make more attempts, men are more successful
- Dysfunctional family-members have experienced cumulative multiple losses and possess limited coping skills
- Family history of suicide
- Severe depression
- Severe, intractable pain
- Chronic, debilitating medical problems
- Substance abuse
- Severe anxiety
- Overwhelming problems
- Severe alteration in self-esteem or body image
- Lethal suicide plan

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

Because any loss in function, change in role, or alteration in body image is a possible antecedent to depression, nurses in all settings encounter patients who are depressed or who have thought about suicide. Depression is suspected if changes in the patient's thoughts or feelings and a loss of self-esteem are noted. See Chart 7-11 for a list of risk factors for depression. Depression can occur at any age, and it is diagnosed more frequently in women than in men. For elderly patients, the nurse should be aware that decreased mental alertness and withdrawal-type responses may be indicative of de-

pression. Consultation with the psychiatric liaison nurse to assess and differentiate between dementia-like symptoms and depression is often helpful.

For all patients, talking about their fears, frustration, anger, and despair can help alleviate a sense of helplessness and facilitate the process of obtaining the necessary treatment. Helping patients learn to cope effectively with conflict, interpersonal problems, and grief, and encouraging patients to discuss actual and potential losses may hasten their recovery from depression. Patients can also be helped to identify and decrease negative self-talk and unrealistic expectations and shown how negative thinking contributes to depression. Because physical health and self-care activities are adversely affected by depression, nurses should monitor patients for the onset of new problems. All patients with depression should be evaluated to determine whether they would benefit from antidepressant therapy.

In addition to the measures cited previously for helping patients manage depression, research studies indicate a reduction in distress when anxiety and depression are treated with psychoeducational programs, the establishment of support systems, and counseling (Devine \& Westlake, 1995). Referrals to psychoeducational programs can be instrumental in helping patients and their families understand depression, treatment options, and coping strategies. (In crisis situations, it is better to refer the patient to a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse specialist, or crisis center.) Explaining to patients that depression is a medical illness and not a sign of personal weakness, and that effective treatment will allow them to feel better and stay emotionally healthy, is an important aspect of care (Stuart \& Laraia, 2000).

\section*{Substance Abuse}

Some people use mood-altering substances in an attempt to cope with life's challenges. A person who abuses substances has an inability to make healthy decisions and to solve problems effectively. Typically, people who abuse substances are unable to identify and implement adaptive behaviors and use illegally obtained drugs, prescribed or over-the-counter medications, and alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs in an ineffective attempt to cope with the pressures, strains, and burdens of life. Over time, physiologic, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems develop as a result of continuous substance use. These problems cause distress for the individual, the family, and the community. Some people may respond to personal illness or the illness of a loved one by using substances to decrease emotional pain.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

Substance abuse is encountered in all clinical settings. Intoxication and withdrawal are two common substance abuse problems. Often, the nurse sees patients who have experienced trauma as a result of inebriation. Other patients who are active substance abusers enter the primary care setting with a diagnosis other than that of substance abuse. Many do not disclose the extent of their substance use. The patient's use of denial or lack of knowledge about the devastating effects of psychoactive substances can be detected by the nurse who performs a substance use assessment (Chart 7-12). In addition, the nurse can incorporate tools into the assessment that enable drug use to be detected. Examples of such instruments are the CAGE Questionnaire (Ewing, 1984), the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (Selzer, 1971), and the Addiction Severity Index (McLellan, Kushner, Metzger, \& Peters, 1992). The CAGE Questions Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGEAID) is presented in Chapter 5, Chart 5-2.

Health professionals are in pivotal positions for identifying a substance abuse problem, instituting treatment protocols, and making follow-up referrals. Because substance abuse severely affects the family, the nurse helps the family members confront the situation, decrease their enabling behaviors, and motivate the person to obtain treatment.

Caring for codependent family members is another nursing priority. A codependent person tends to manifest unhealthy patterns in relationships with others. Codependents struggle with a need to be needed, an urge to control others, and a willingness to remain involved and suffer with a person who has a drug problem.

The family may approach the health care team to help set limits on the dysfunctional behavior of a person who abuses substances. At these times, a therapeutic intervention is organized for the purpose of confronting the patient about substance use and the need to obtain drug or alcohol treatment. The nurse or other knowledgeable addiction counselor helps the family present the addicted person with a realistic perspective about the problem, their concerns about and caring for the person, and a specific plan for treatment. This therapeutic intervention works on the premise that honest and caring confrontation can break through the person's denial of the addiction. If the person refuses to participate in the designed plan, the family members define the consequences and state their commitment to follow through with them. This intervention is empowering to the family and usually provides the structure needed to secure treatment.

Even with treatment, however, patients may experience relapse. Nurses work with patients and their families to prevent relapse and to be prepared if relapse occurs. Relapse is considered a

\section*{Chart 7-12 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Assessing Substance Abuse}
- Past and recurrent use of the substance
- Patient's view of substance use as a problem

- Preferred method of use of substance
- Amount of substance used
- How substance is procured
- Effect of or reaction to substance

part of the illness process and therefore must be viewed and addressed in the same way that chronic illness is treated.

The nurse who is working with a patient and family struggling with an addiction must dispel the myth that addiction is a defect in character or a moral fault. Views on substance abuse vary within our society. A person's background may help determine whether he or she uses drugs, what drugs are used, and when they are used (Copel, 2000). The combination of variables, such as values and beliefs, family and personal norms, spiritual convictions, and conditions of the current social environment, predisposes a person to the possibility of drug use, motivation for treatment, and continual recovery (Copel, 2000). It has also been said that a person's attitude, especially toward alcohol, reflects the overall beliefs and attitudes of that individual's culture (Giger \& Davidhizer, 1999).

\section*{Loss and Grief}

Loss is a part of the life cycle. All people experience loss in the form of change, growth, and transition. The experience of loss is painful, frightening, and lonely, and it triggers an array of emotional responses (Chart 7-13). People may vacillate between denial, shock, disbelief, anger, inertia, intense yearning, loneliness, sadness, loss of control, depression, and spiritual despair (Brewster, 1999).

In addition to normal losses associated with life cycle stages there are the potential losses of health, a body part, self-image, self-esteem, and even one's life. When loss is not acknowledged or there are multiple losses, anxiety, depression, and health problems may occur. Likewise, people with physical health problems, such as diabetes mellitus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS), cardiac conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, disabilities, and neurologic impairments, tend to respond to these illnesses with feelings of grief.

People grieve in different ways, and there is no time line for completing the grief process. The time of grieving often depends on the significance of the loss, the length of time the person was known and loved, the anticipation of or preparation for the loss, the person's emotional stability and maturity, and the person's coping ability (Arnold \& Boggs, 1999).

Regardless of the duration of the grieving process, there are two basic goals: (1) healing the self, and (2) recovering from the loss. Other factors that influence grieving are the type of loss, life experiences with various changes and transitions, religious beliefs, cultural background, and personality type (Kemp, 2000). Some patients may resort to abuse of prescription medications, illegal drugs, or alcohol if they find it difficult to cope with the loss; the grief process is then complicated by the use of addictive substances.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

Nurses identify patients and family members who are grieving and work with them to accomplish the four major tasks of the grief process: (1) acceptance of the loss, (2) acknowledgment of the intensity of the pain, (3) adaptation to life after the loss, and (4) cultivation of new relationships and activities (Worden, 1982). Chart 7-14 outlines nursing care activities useful for those who are bereaved.

Another responsibility of the nurse is to assess and differentiate between grief and depression by knowing the common thoughts, feelings, physical or bodily reactions, and behaviors associated with grief compared with depression (see Chart 7-14). The physical response to grief includes the sensation of somatic distress, a tightness in the throat followed by a choking sensation or shortness of breath, the need to sigh, an empty feeling inside the abdomen, lack of muscle power, and intense disabling distress. Grief can further debilitate an already compromised patient and can have a strong impact on family functioning.

\section*{Cheldt \\ 7-14}

\section*{Caring for the Bereaved}
- Have contact physically (with the patient's permission) and emotionally with the person.
- Assess where the person is in the grieving process.
- Demonstrate genuine compassion and caring.
- Give permission to grieve and normalize the grieving process.
- Mention the loss or the deceased person's name.
- Encourage the person to talk about the relationship he or she had with the deceased person.
- Understand that people need to talk about the events and feelings around the death and will repeat themselves.
- Tell the person to expect mood swings, pain, and various life changes.
- Focus on clarifying and using coping skills.
- Allow the person to take a break from grieving and focus on self-care.
- Encourage sources of comfort such as religion or nature.
- Identify secondary losses and unfinished business.
- Acknowledge that there will be eventual recovery.
- Discuss the anniversary phenomenon.
- Encourage medical or psychiatric care as needed.

\section*{Death and Dying}

Coping with death, one's own or a loved one's, is considered the ultimate challenge. The idea of death is threatening and anxietyprovoking to many people. Kubler-Ross (1975, p. 1) stated, "The key to the question of death unlocks the door of life. . . . For those who seek to understand it, death is a highly creative force." Common fears of dying people are fear of the unknown, pain, suffering, loneliness, loss of the body, and loss of personal control.

In recent years, the process of dying has changed as advances have been made in the care of chronically and terminally ill patients. Technological innovations and modern therapeutic treatments have prolonged the life span, and many deaths are now the result of chronic illnesses that result in physiologic deterioration and subsequent multisystem failure.

Preparation for an impending death can precipitate the experience of anticipatory grieving. Although anticipatory grief can have positive effects on later grief, this does not hold true for all people. For some family members, anticipatory grief is seen as a risk factor for poor early bereavement adjustment (Levy, 1991). The nurse must be aware of the uniqueness and individuality inherent in the grieving process and work to meet the needs of those involved in the best way possible.

\section*{DEATH AND DYING FRAMEWORKS}

Various frameworks for understanding the concept of grief and the stages of death and dying may be useful to the nurse. The stages of bereavement described by Bowlby (1961) are protest, disorganization, and reorganization. Kubler-Ross (1975) conceptualized five stages of grieving: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Often, the dying person and the survivors do not experience these responses in an orderly or linear fashion; rather, there is random movement between all the stages for differing periods of time. Another model for successful grieving, proposed by Engel (1964), is shock and disbelief, development of awareness, and restitution. The themes common to almost all models of grieving are periods of avoidance, confrontation, and acceptance (Cooley, 1992).

Another framework for understanding the individuality of the dying process is provided by the "patterns of living while dying" described by Martocchio (1982). There are four identified patterns of living based on the clinical trajectories of dying people. The first is referred to as peaks and valleys or periods of hope and periods of depression. Despite the hopeful times, there is still an overall movement toward decline and death. The second pattern is one described as distinct but descending plateaus. This course also reflects a downward trend with progressive debilitation and eventual death. The third pattern is a clear downward slope with many physiologic parameters indicating that death is imminent. This pattern is often observed in the critical care unit when people and families have no time to prepare for the death. The last pattern is a downward slant that reveals a crisis event, such as a severe cerebral hemorrhage with almost no hope of recovery. Often, a patient in this pattern is being maintained on life support systems. The nurse should recognize that a person may experience one or more of these living-dying patterns.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

Nursing care involves providing comfort, maintaining safety, addressing physical and emotional needs, and teaching coping strategies to terminally ill patients and their families. More than ever, the nurse must explain what is happening to the patient and
the family and be a confidante who listens to them talk about dying. Hospice care, attention to family and individual psychosocial issues, and symptom and pain management are all part of the nurse's responsibilities. The nurse must also be concerned with ethical considerations and quality-of-life issues that affect dying people. Of utmost importance to the patient is assistance with the transition from living to dying, maintaining and sustaining relationships, finishing well with the family, and accomplishing what needs to be said and done.

The nurse is the consistent link in promoting understanding of the patient's disease and the dying process and in making the event more manageable for the patient and family, who will require assistance to resolve problems and proceed through the grief work. Retaining as much control as possible during the process of dying allows the patient and family to make as much sense as possible out of an overwhelming situation. In the hospital, in long-term care facilities, and in home settings, the nurse explores choices and end-of-life decisions with the patient and family. Referrals to home care and hospice services, as well as specific referrals appropriate for the management of the situation, are initiated. The nurse is also an advocate for the dying person and works to uphold that person's rights. The use of living wills and advance directives allows the patient to exercise the right to have a "good" death or to die with dignity. Additional information about end-of-life care is presented in Chapter 17.

\section*{Spirituality and Spiritual Distress}

Spirituality is defined as connectedness with self, others, a life force, or God that allows people to experience self-transcendence and find meaning in life. Spirituality helps people discover a purpose in life, understand the vicissitudes of life, and develop their relationship with God or a Higher Power. Within the framework of spirituality, a person discovers truths about the self, about the world, and about concepts such as love, compassion, wisdom, honesty, commitment, imagination, reverence, and morality. Often, spiritual behavior is expressed through sacrifice, self-discipline, and spending time in activities that focus on the inner self or the soul. Religion and nature are two vehicles that people use to connect themselves with God or a Higher Power; however, bonds to religious institutions, beliefs, or dogma are not required to experience the spiritual sense of self. Faith, considered the foundation of spirituality, is a belief in something that a person cannot see (Carson, 1999). The spiritual part of a person views life as a mystery that unfolds over the lifetime, encompassing questions about meaning, hope, relatedness to God, acceptance or forgiveness, and transcendence (Byrd, 1999; Sheldon, 2000; Sussman, Nezami, \& Mishra, 1997).

A strong sense of spirituality or religious faith can have a positive impact on health (Dunn \& Horgas, 2000; Kendrick \& Robinson, 2000; Matthews \& Larson, 1995). Spirituality is also a component of hope, and, especially during chronic, serious, or terminal illness, patients and their families often find comfort and emotional strength in their religious traditions or spiritual beliefs. At other times, illness and loss can cause a loss of faith or meaning in life and a spiritual crisis. The nursing diagnosis of spiritual distress is applicable to those who have a disturbance in the belief or value system that provides strength, hope, and meaning in life.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

Spiritually distressed patients (or family members) may show despair, discouragement, ambivalence, detachment, anger, resentment, or fear. They may question the meaning of suffering, life,
and death, and express a sense of emptiness. The nurse assesses spiritual strength by inquiring about the person's sense of spiritual well-being, hope, and peacefulness. Have spiritual beliefs and values changed in response to illness or loss? The nurse assesses current and past participation in religious or spiritual practices and notes the patient's response to questions about spiritual needsgrief, anger, guilt, depression, doubt, anxiety, or calmness-to help determine the patient's need for spiritual care. Another simple assessment technique is to inquire about the patient's and family's desire for spiritual support.

For nurses to provide spiritual care, they must be open to being present and supportive when patients experience doubt, fearfulness, suffering, despair, or other difficult psychological states of being. Interventions that foster spiritual growth or reconciliation include being fully present; listening actively; conveying a sense of caring, respect, and acceptance; using therapeutic communication techniques to encourage expression; suggesting the use of prayer, meditation, or imagery; and facilitating contact with spiritual leaders or performance of spiritual rituals (Sumner, 1998; Sussman, 2000).

Patients with serious, chronic, or terminal illnesses face physical and emotional losses that threaten their spiritual integrity. During acute and chronic illness, rehabilitation, or the dying process, spiritual support can stimulate patients to regain or strengthen their connections with their inner selves, their loved ones, and their God or Higher Power to transcend suffering and find meaning. Nurses can alleviate distress and suffering and enhance wellness by meeting their patients' spiritual needs.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 55-year old man tells the nurse that he is not going to be a part of a clinical drug investigation. He states, "I may not get the drug. I may end up with a placebo. I'm going to try some alternative methods. I feel like traditional medicine is letting me down." How does the nurse handle this situation? What assessment data need to be collected and discussed with other members of the health care team?
2. The nurse is working with a family to develop therapeutic interventions for a family member who has a cocaine and alcohol addiction problem. One family member tells the nurse she will never be able to support the plan decided on by the rest of the family. How would you approach this person? What strategies would be useful for this person and for the entire family?
3. The family of a man who is dying from lung cancer tells the hospice nurse that they are overwhelmed by the hopelessness of their father's situation. What can the nurse do to provide guidance and find hope within terminal illness? How does the nurse assist this family to meet their emotional, social, and spiritual needs?

\section*{Perspectives in Transcultural Nursing}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Apply transcultural nursing principles, concepts, and theories when providing nursing care to patients (individuals, families, groups, and communities).
2. Develop strategies for planning, providing, and evaluating culturally competent nursing care for patients from diverse backgrounds.
3. Critically analyze the influence of culture on nursing care decisions and actions for patients.
4. Identify key components of cultural assessment for self and patients.
n the health care delivery system, as in society, the nurse interacts with people of similar and diverse cultural backgrounds. People may have similar or different frames of reference and varied preferences regarding their health and health care needs. Acknowledging and adapting to the cultural needs of the patient and significant others is an important component of nursing care. To plan and deliver culturally competent care, the nurse must understand the definitions of culture and cultural competence and the various aspects of culture that should be explored for each patient.

\section*{Definitions of Culture}

The concept of culture and its relationship to the health care beliefs and practices of patients and their families and friends provide the foundation for transcultural nursing. This awareness of culture in the delivery of nursing care has been described in different ways, including respect for cultural diversity, culturally sensitive or comprehensive care, and culturally competent or appropriate nursing care (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 1996; Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999; Spector, 2000), or culturally congruent nursing care (Leininger, 2001). Two commonly discussed concepts are cultural diversity and culturally competent care.

The term culture was initially defined by the British anthropologist Sir Edward Tylor in 1871 as the knowledge, belief, art, morals, laws, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by humans as members of society. During the past century, and especially during recent decades, hundreds of definitions of culture have been offered that integrate the themes stated by Tylor and the themes of ethnic variations of a population based on race, nationality, religion, language, physical characteristics, and geography (Spector, 2000). To fully appreciate the impact of culture, aspects such as disabilities, gender, social class, physical appearance (eg, weight, height), ideologies (political views), or sexual orientation must be integrated into the definition of culture as well (Gooden, Porter, Gonzalez, \& Mims, 2001).

Madeleine Leininger, founder of the specialty called transcultural nursing, indicates that culture involves learned and transmitted knowledge about values, beliefs, rules of behavior, and lifestyle practices that guide designated groups in their thinking and actions in patterned ways (2001). Giger and Davidhizar (1999) state that transcultural nursing is a practice based on the differences and similarities between cultures in relation to health, health care, and illness, with consideration of patient values, beliefs, and practices. Further, culture develops over time as a result of "imprinting the mind through social and religious structures and intellectual and artistic manifestations" (p. 3).

The concept of ethnic culture has four basic characteristics:
- It is learned from birth through language and socialization.
- It is shared by members of the same cultural group, and it includes an internal sense and external perception of distinctiveness.
- It is influenced by specific conditions related to environmental and technical factors and to the availability of resources.
- It is dynamic and ever-changing.

With the exception of the first characteristic, culture related to age, physical appearance, lifestyle, and other less frequently acknowledged aspects also adhere to the above characteristics.

Cultural diversity has also been defined in a number of ways. Often, skin color, religion, and geographic area are the only elements used to identify diversity, with ethnic minorities being considered the primary sources of cultural diversity. As stated ear-
lier, however, there are several other possible sources of cultural diversity. In addition, to truly acknowledge the cultural differences that may influence health care delivery, the nurse must recognize the influence of his or her own culture and cultural heritage (Krumberger, 2000).

Culturally competent nursing care has been defined as effective, individualized care that considers cultural values, is culturally aware and sensitive, and incorporates cultural skills (Hunt, 2000; Krumberger, 2000; Wilkinson, 2001). Culturally competent care is a dynamic process that requires comprehensive knowledge of culture-specific information and an awareness of, and sensitivity to, the effect that culture has on the care situation. It requires the nurse to integrate cultural knowledge, awareness of his or her own cultural perspective, and the patient's cultural perspectives into the plan of care (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999). Exploring one's own cultural beliefs and how they might conflict with the beliefs of the patients being cared for is a first step toward becoming culturally competent (Krumberger, 2000). Understanding the diversity within cultures, such as subcultures, is also important.

\section*{SUBCULTURES AND MINORITIES}

Although culture is a universal phenomenon, it takes on specific and distinctive features for a particular group, since it encompasses all of the knowledge, beliefs, customs, and skills acquired by the members of that group. When such groups function within a larger cultural group, they are referred to as subcultures.

The term subculture is used for relatively large groups of people who share characteristics that enable them to be identified as a distinct entity. Examples of American subcultures based on ethnicity (ie, subcultures with common traits such as physical characteristics, language, or ancestry) include African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and Native Americans. Each of these subcultures may be further divided; for example, Native Americans consist of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who represent more than 500 federally and state-recognized tribes in addition to an unknown number of tribes that receive no official recognition.

Subcultures may also be based on religion (more than 1200 exist in the United States), occupation (eg, nurses, physicians, other members of the health care team), or shared disability or illness (eg, the Deaf community). In addition, subcultures may be based on age (eg, infants, children, adolescents, adults, older adults), gender (eg, male, female); sexual orientation (eg, homosexual or bisexual men and women), or geographic location (eg, Texans, Southerners, Appalachians).

The nurse should also be sensitive to the intraracial applications of cultural competence. Tensions between subcultures within a designated group could add to the complexity of planning culturally competent care. Some members of one ethnic subculture may be offended or angered if mistaken for members of a different subculture. Similarly, if the attributes of one subculture are mistakenly generalized to a patient belonging to a different subculture, extreme offense could result, as well as inappropriate care planning and implementation (Fields, 2000). It is crucial that nurses refrain from culturally stereotyping a patient in an attempt to be culturally competent. Instead, the patient or significant others should be consulted regarding personal values, beliefs, preferences and cultural identification. This strategy is also applicable for members of nonethnic subcultures.

The term minority refers to a group of people whose physical or cultural characteristics differ from the majority of people in a society. At times, minorities may be singled out or isolated from others in society or treated in different or unequal ways. Although
there are four federally identified minority groups-Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans (Andrews \& Boyle, 1999)-the concept of "minority" varies widely and must be understood in a cultural context. For example, men may be considered a minority within the nursing profession, but they constitute a majority within the field of medicine. In addition, Caucasians may be in the minority in some communities in the United States, but they are currently the majority group in the country (although it has been projected that by the middle to late 21 st century, Caucasians will be in the minority in the United States). Because at times the term minority connotes inferiority, members of many racial and ethnic groups object to being identified as minorities.

\section*{Transcultural Nursing}

Transcultural nursing, a term sometimes used interchangeably with cross-cultural, intercultural, or multicultural nursing, refers to a formal area of study and practice that focuses on the cultural care (caring) values, beliefs, and practices of individuals and groups from a particular culture (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999). The underlying focus of transcultural nursing is to provide cul-ture-specific and culture-universal care that promotes the wellbeing or health of individuals, families, groups, communities, and institutions (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999; Leininger, 2001). When culturally appropriate care is provided, all individuals, and the community or institution at large, benefit. When the care is delivered beyond the nurse's national boundaries, the term international or transnational nursing is often used.

Although many nurses, anthropologists, and others have written about the cultural aspects of nursing and health care, Leininger (2001) developed a comprehensive research-based theory called Culture Care Diversity and Universality. The goal of the theory is to provide culturally congruent nursing care to improve care for people of different or similar cultures. This means promoting recovery from illness, preventing conditions that would limit the patient's health or well-being, or facilitating a peaceful death in ways that are culturally meaningful and appropriate. Nursing care needs to be tailored to fit the patient's cultural values, beliefs, and lifestyle.

Leininger's theory includes providing culturally congruent nursing care (meaningful, beneficial, and satisfying health care tailored to fit the patient's cultural values) through culture care accommodation and culture care restructuring (Fig. 8-1). Culture care accommodation refers to those professional actions and decisions that a nurse makes in his or her care to help people of a designated culture achieve a beneficial or satisfying health outcome. Culture care restructuring or repatterning refers to those professional actions and decisions that help patients reorder, change, or modify their lifestyles toward new, different, or more beneficial health care patterns. At the same time, the patient's cultural values and beliefs are respected, and a better or healthier lifestyle is provided. Other terms and definitions that provide further insight into culture and health care include the following:
- Acculturation is the process by which members of a cultural group adapt to or learn how to take on the behaviors of another group.
- Cultural blindness is the inability of a person to recognize his or her own values, beliefs, and practices and those of others because of strong ethnocentric tendencies (the tendency to view one's own culture as superior to others).
- Cultural imposition is the tendency to impose one's cultural beliefs, values, and patterns of behavior on a person or persons from a different culture.
- Cultural taboos are those activities governed by rules of behavior that are avoided, forbidden, or prohibited by a particular cultural group.

\section*{Culturally Competent Nursing Care}

Culturally competent or congruent nursing care refers to the complex integration of attitudes, knowledge, and skills (including assessment, decision making, judgments, critical thinking, and evaluation) that enables the nurse to provide care in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner. Agency and institutional policies are important to achieve culturally competent care.

Policies that promote culturally competent care establish flexible regulations pertaining to visitors (number, frequency, and length of visits), provide translation services for non-Englishspeaking patients, and train staff to provide care for patients with different cultural values (Suro, 2000). Culturally competent policies also recognize the special dietary needs of patients from selected cultural groups and create an environment in which the traditional healing, spiritual, and religious practices of patients are respected and encouraged.

Giger and Davidhizar (1999) created an assessment model to guide the nurse in exploring cultural phenomena that might affect nursing care. They identified communication, space, time orientation, social organization, environmental control, and biologic variations as relevant phenomena (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999). This model has been used in various patient care settings to provide data essential to the provision of culturally competent care.

\section*{CROSS-CULTURAL COMMUNICATION}

Establishing an environment of culturally congruent care and respect begins with effective communication, which occurs not only through words, but also through body language and other cues, such as voice, tone, and loudness. Nurse-patient interactions, as well as communications among members of a multicultural health care team, are dependent on the ability to understand and be understood.

Approximately 150 different languages are spoken in the United States, with Spanish accounting for the largest percentage after English. Obviously, nurses cannot become fluent in all languages, but certain strategies for fostering effective cross-cultural communication are necessary when providing care for patients who are not fluent in English. Cultural needs should be considered when choosing an interpreter; fluency in varied dialects, for instance, is beneficial (Suro, 2000). The interpreter's voice quality, pronunciation, use of silence, use of touch, and use of nonverbal communication should also be assessed (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999).

During illness, patients of all ages tend to regress, and the regression often involves language skills. Chart 8-1 summarizes suggested strategies for overcoming language barriers. The nurse should also assess how well the patient and family have understood what has been said. The following cues may signal lack of effective communication:
- Efforts to change the subject. This could indicate that the patient does not understand what you are saying and is attempting to talk about something more familiar.

EIGURE 8-1 Leininger's Sunrise Model depicts theory of cultural care diversity and universality. From Leininger, M. M. (Ed.). (2001). Culture care diversity and university: A theory of nursing. New York: New York: National League for Nursing Press.
- Absence of questions. Paradoxically, this often means that the listener is not grasping the message and therefore has difficulty formulating questions to ask.
- Inappropriate laughter. A self-conscious giggle may signal poor comprehension and may be an attempt to disguise embarrassment.
- Nonverbal cues. Although a blank expression may signal poor understanding, among some Asian Americans it may reflect a desire to avoid overt expression of emotion. Similarly, avoidance of eye contact may be a cultural expression of respect for the speaker; some Native Americans and Asian Americans use this gesture.

\section*{Culturally Mediated Characteristics}

Nurses should be aware that patients act and behave in a variety of ways, in part because of the influence of culture on behaviors and attitudes. However, although certain attributes and attitudes are frequently associated with particular cultural groups, as described in the following pages, it is important to remember that
not all people from the same cultural background share the same behaviors and views. Although the nurse who fails to consider a patient's cultural preferences and beliefs is considered insensitive and possibly indifferent, the nurse who assumes that all members of any one culture act and behave in the same way runs the risk of stereotyping people. The best way to avoid stereotyping is to view each patient as an individual and to find out the patient's cultural preferences. A thorough culture assessment using a culture assessment tool or questionnaire (see later discussion) is very beneficial.

\section*{SPACE AND DISTANCE}

People tend to regard the space in their immediate vicinity as an extension of themselves. The amount of space they need between themselves and others to feel comfortable is a culturally determined phenomenon.

Because nurses and patients usually are not consciously aware of their personal space requirements, they frequently have difficulty understanding different behaviors in this regard. For exam-

\section*{Overcoming Language Barriers}
- Greet the patient using the last or complete name. Avoid being too casual or familiar. Point to yourself and say your name. Smile.
- Proceed in an unhurried manner. Pay attention to any effort by the patient or family to communicate.
- Speak in a low, moderate voice. Avoid talking loudly. Remember that there is a tendency to raise the volume and pitch of your voice when the listener appears not to understand. The listener may perceive that you are shouting and/or angry.
- Organize your thoughts. Repeat and summarize frequently. Use audiovisual aids when feasible.
- Use short, simple sentence structure and speak in the active voice.
- Use simple words, such as "pain" rather than "discomfort." Avoid medical jargon, idioms, and slang. Avoid using contractions, such as don't, can't, won't.
- Use nouns repeatedly instead of pronouns. Example: Do not say: "He has been taking his medicine, hasn't he?" Do say: "Does Juan take medicine?"
- Pantomime words (use gestures) and simple actions while verbalizing them.
- Give instructions in the proper sequence. Example: Do not say: "Before you rinse the bottle, sterilize it." Do say: "First, wash the bottle. Second, rinse the bottle."
- Discuss one topic at a time, and avoid giving too much information in a single conversation. Avoid using conjunctions. Example: Do not say: "Are you cold and in pain?" Do say (while pantomiming/gesturing): "Are you cold?" "Are you in pain?"
- Validate whether the person understands by having him or her repeat instructions, demonstrate the procedure, or act out the meaning.
- Use any words you know in the person's language. This indicates that you are aware of and respect the patient's primary means of communicating.
- Try a third language. Many Indo-Chinese speak French. Europeans often know three or four languages. Try Latin words or phrases, if you are familiar with the language.
- Ask who among the patient's family and friends could serve as an interpreter. Be aware of culturally based gender and age differences and diverse socioeconomic, educational, and tribal/regional differences when choosing an interpreter.
- Obtain phrase books from a library or bookstore, make or purchase flash cards, contact hospitals for a list of interpreters, and use both formal and informal networking to locate a suitable interpreter. Although they are costly, some telecommunication companies provide translation services.
ple, one patient may perceive the nurse sitting close to him or her as an expression of warmth and care; another patient may perceive the nurse's act as a threatening invasion of personal space. Research reveals that people from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain require the most personal space between themselves and others, whereas those from Latin America, Japan, and the Middle East need the least amount of space and feel comfortable standing close to others.

If patients appear to position themselves too close or too far away, the nurse should consider cultural preferences for space and distance. Ideally, patients should be permitted to assume a position that is comfortable to them in terms of personal space and distance. Because a significant amount of communication during nursing care requires close physical contact, the nurse should be aware of these important cultural differences and consider them when delivering care (Davidhizar, Dowd, \& Newman-Giger, 1999).

\section*{EYE CONTACT}

Eye contact is also a culturally determined behavior. Although most nurses have been taught to maintain eye contact when speaking with patients, some people from certain cultural backgrounds may interpret this behavior differently. Some Asians, Native Americans, Indo-Chinese, Arabs, and Appalachians, for example, may consider direct eye contact impolite or aggressive, and they may avert their own eyes when talking with nurses and others whom they perceive to be in positions of authority. Some Native Americans stare at the floor during conversations, a cultural behavior conveying respect and indicating that the listener is paying close attention to the speaker. Some Hispanic patients maintain downcast eyes as a sign of appropriate deferential behavior toward others on the basis of age, gender, social position, economic status, and position of authority. Being aware that whether a person makes eye contact may be a result of the culture from which they come will help the nurse understand a patient's behavior and provide an atmosphere in which the patient can feel comfortable.

\section*{TIME}

Attitudes about time vary widely among cultures and can be a barrier to effective communication between nurses and patients. Views about punctuality and the use of time are culturally determined, as is the concept of waiting. Symbols of time, such as watches, sunrises, and sunsets, represent methods for measuring the duration and passage of time (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999; Spector, 2000).

For most health care providers, time and promptness are extremely important. For example, nurses frequently expect patients to arrive at an exact time for an appointment, despite the fact that the patient is often kept waiting by health care providers who are running late. Health care providers are likely to function according to an appointment system in which there are short intervals of perhaps only a few minutes. For patients from some cultures, however, time is a relative phenomenon, with little attention paid to the exact hour or minute. Some Hispanic people, for example, consider time in a wider frame of reference and make the primary distinction between day and night. Time may also be determined according to traditional times for meals, sleep, and other activities or events. For people from some cultures, the present is of the greatest importance, and time is viewed in broad ranges rather than in terms of a fixed hour. Being flexible in regard to schedules is the best way to accommodate these differences.

Value differences also may influence a person's sense of priority when it comes to time. For example, responding to a family matter may be more important to a patient than meeting a scheduled health care appointment. Allowing for these different views is essential in maintaining an effective nurse-patient relationship. Scolding or acting annoyed at a patient for being late undermines the patient's confidence in the health care system and might result in further missed appointments or indifference to health care suggestions.

\section*{TOUCH}

The meaning people associate with touching is culturally determined to a great degree. In some cultures (eg, Hispanic, Arab), male health care providers may be prohibited from touching or examining certain parts of the female body. Similarly, it may be inappropriate for females to care for males. Among many Asian Americans, it is impolite to touch a person's head because the
spirit is believed to reside there. Therefore, assessment of the head or evaluation of a head injury requires alternative approaches. The patient's culturally defined sense of modesty must also be considered when providing nursing care. For example, some Jewish and Islamic women believe that modesty requires covering their head, arms, and legs with clothing.

\section*{COMMUNICATION}

Many aspects of care may be influenced by the diverse cultural perspectives held by the health care providers, patient, family, or significant others. One example is the issue of informed consent and full disclosure. In general, a nurse may argue that patients have the right to full disclosure about their disease and prognosis and may feel that advocacy means working to provide that disclosure. Family members of some cultural backgrounds may believe it is their responsibility to protect and spare the patient, their loved one, the knowledge of a terminal illness. Similarly, patients may, in fact, not want to know about their condition and may expect their family members to "take the burden" of that knowledge and related decision-making (Kudzma, 1999). The nurse should not decide that the family or patient is simply wrong or that the patient must know all details of his or her illness. Similar concerns may be noted when patients refuse pain medication or treatment because of cultural beliefs regarding pain or belief in divine intervention or faith healing. Determining the most appropriate and ethical approach to patient care requires an exploration of the cultural aspects of these situations. Self-examination by the nurse and recognition of one's own cultural bias and world view, as discussed earlier, will play a major part in helping the nurse to resolve cultural and ethical conflicts. The nurse must promote open dialogue and work with the patient, family, physician, and other health care providers to reach the culturally appropriate solution for the patient.

\section*{OBSERVANCE OF HOLIDAYS}

People from all cultures celebrate civil and religious holidays. Nurses should familiarize themselves with major holidays for members of the cultural groups they serve. Information about these important celebrations is available from various sources, including religious organizations, hospital chaplains, and patients themselves. Routine health appointments, diagnostic tests, surgery, and other major procedures should be scheduled to avoid those holidays a patient identifies as significant. Efforts should also be made to accommodate patients and family or significant others, when not contraindicated, as they perform holiday rituals in the health care setting.

\section*{DIET}

The cultural meanings associated with food vary widely but usually include one or more of the following: relief of hunger; promotion of health and healing; prevention of disease or illness; expression of caring for another; promotion of interpersonal closeness among individuals, families, groups, communities, or nations; and promotion of kinship and family alliances. Food may also be associated with solidification of social ties; celebration of life events (eg, birthdays, marriages, funerals); expression of gratitude or appreciation; recognition of achievement or accomplishment; validation of social, cultural, or religious ceremonial functions; facilitation of business negotiations; and expression of affluence, wealth, or social status.

Culture determines which foods are served and when they are served, the number and frequency of meals, who eats with whom, and who is given the choicest portions. Culture also determines how foods are prepared and served; how they are eaten (with chopsticks, hands, or fork, knife, and spoon); and where people shop for their favorite food items (eg, ethnic grocery stores, specialty food markets).

Religious practices may include fasting (eg, Mormons, Catholics, Buddhists, Jews, Muslims), abstaining from selected foods at particular times (eg, Catholics abstain from meat on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays during Lent), and considerations for medications (eg, Muslims may prefer to use non-pork-derived insulin). Practices may also include the ritualistic use of food and beverages (eg, Passover dinner, consumption of bread and wine during religious ceremonies). Chart 8-2 summarizes some dietary practices of selected religious groups.

Many groups tend to feast, often in the company of family and friends, on selected holidays. For example, many Christians eat large dinners on Christmas and Easter and consume other traditional high-calorie, high-fat foods, such as seasonal cookies, pastries, and candies. These culturally-based dietary practices are especially significant in the care of patients with diabetes, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, and other conditions in which diet plays a key role in the treatment and health maintenance regimen.

\section*{BIOLOGIC VARIATIONS}

Along with psychosocial adaptations, nurses must also consider the physiologic impact of culture on patient response to treatment, particularly medications. Data have been collected for many years regarding differences in the effect some medications have on persons of diverse ethnic or cultural origins. Genetic predispositions to different rates of metabolism cause some patients to be prone to overdose reactions to the "normal dose" of a medication, while other patients are likely to experience a greatly reduced benefit from the standard dose of the medication. An antihypertensive agent, for example, may work well for a white male client within a 4 -week time span but may take much longer to work or not work at all for an African-American male patient with hypertension. General polymorphism-variation in response to medications resulting from patient age, gender, size, and body composition-has long been acknowledged by the health care community (Kudzma, 1999). Culturally competent medication administration requires that consideration of ethnicity and related factors such as values and beliefs regarding the use of herbal supplements, dietary intake, and genetic factors can affect the effectiveness of treatment and compliance with the treatment regimen (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999; Kudzma, 1999).

\section*{COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES}

Interventions for alterations in health and wellness vary among cultures. Interventions most commonly used in the United States have been labeled as conventional medicine by the National Institutes of Health (n.d.). Other names for conventional medicine were allopathy, Western medicine, regular medicine, mainstream medicine, and biomedicine. Interest in interventions that are not an integral part of conventional medicine prompted the National Institutes of Health to create the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) in 1992, and then to establish the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in 1999.

The NCCAM grouped complementary and alternative medicine interventions into five main categories: alternative medical systems, mind-body interventions, biologically based therapies, manipulative and body-based methods, and energy therapies (National Institutes for Health, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, accessed 9/8/01).
- Alternative medical systems are defined as complete systems of theory and practice that are different from conventional medicine. Some examples are traditional Eastern medicine (including acupuncture, herbal medicine, oriental massage, and Qi gong); India's traditional medicine, Ayurveda (including diet, exercise, meditation, herbal medicine, massage, exposure to sunlight, and controlled breathing to restore harmony of an individual's body, mind, and spirit); homeopathic medicine (including herbal medicine and minerals); and naturopathic medicine (including diet, acupuncture, herbal medicine, hydrotherapy, spinal and soft-tissue manipulation, electrical currents, ultrasound and light therapy, therapeutic counseling, and pharmacology).
- Mind-body interventions are defined as techniques to facilitate the mind's ability to affect symptoms and bodily functions. Some examples are meditation, dance, music, art therapy, prayer, and mental healing.
- Biologically based therapies are defined as natural and biologically based practices, interventions, and products. Some examples are herbal therapies (an herb is a plant or plant
part that produces and contains chemical substances that act upon the body), special diet therapies (such as those of Drs. Atkins, Ornish, and Pritikin), orthomolecular therapies (magnesium, melatonin, megadoses of vitamins), and biologic therapies (shark cartilage, bee pollen).
- Manipulative and body-based methods are defined as interventions based on body movement. Some examples are chiropracty (primarily manipulation of the spine), osteopathic manipulation, massage therapy (soft tissue manipulation), and reflexology.
- Energy therapies are defined as interventions that focus on energy fields within the body (biofields) or externally (electromagnetic fields). Some examples are Qi gong, Reiki, therapeutic touch, pulsed electromagnetic fields, magnetic fields, alternating electrical current, and direct electrical current.

A patient may choose to seek an alternative to conventional medical or surgical therapies. Many of these alternative therapies are becoming widely accepted as feasible treatment options. Therapies such as acupuncture and herbal treatments may be recommended by a patient's physician to address aspects of a condition that are unresponsive to conventional medical treatment or to minimize side effects associated with conventional medical therapy. Alternative therapy used to supplement conventional medicine may be referred to as complementary therapy.

Physicians and advanced practice nurses may work in collaboration with an herbalist or with a spiritualist or shaman to provide a comprehensive treatment plan for the patient. Out of respect for the way of life and beliefs of patients from different cultures, it is often necessary that the healers and health care providers respect the strengths of each approach (Palmer, 2001). Complementary therapy is becoming more common as health care consumers become more aware of what is available through information in printed media and on the Internet.

As patients become more informed, they are more likely to participate in a variety of therapies in conjunction with their conventional medical treatments. The nurse needs to assess each patient for use of complementary therapies, remain alert to the danger of conflicting treatments, and be prepared to provide information to the patient regarding treatment that may be harmful. The nurse must, however, be accepting of the patient's beliefs and right to control his or her own care. As a patient advocate, the nurse facilitates the integration of conventional medical, complementary, and alternative medical therapies.

\section*{Causes of Illness}

Three major views, or paradigms, attempt to explain the causes of disease and illness: the biomedical or scientific view, the naturalistic or holistic perspective, and the magico-religious view.

\section*{BIOMEDICAL OR SCIENTIFIC}

The biomedical or scientific world view prevails in most health care settings and is embraced by most nurses and other health care providers. The basic assumptions underlying the biomedical perspective are that all events in life have a cause and effect, that the human body functions much like a machine, and that all of reality can be observed and measured (eg, blood pressures, $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ levels, intelligence tests). One example of the biomedical or scientific view is the bacterial or viral explanation of communicable diseases.

\section*{NATURALISTIC OR HOLISTIC}

The second way that some cultures explain the cause of illness is through the naturalistic or holistic perspective, a viewpoint that is found among many Native Americans, Asians, and others. According to this view, the forces of nature must be kept in natural balance or harmony.

One example of a naturalistic belief, held by many Asian groups, is the yin/yang theory, in which health is believed to exist when all aspects of a person are in perfect balance or harmony. Rooted in the ancient Chinese philosophy of Taoism (which translates as "The Way"), the yin/yang theory proposes that all organisms and objects in the universe consist of yin and yang energy. The seat of the energy forces is within the autonomic nervous system, where balance between the opposing forces is maintained during health. Yin energy represents the female and negative forces, such as emptiness, darkness, and cold, whereas the yang forces are male and positive, emitting warmth and fullness. Foods are classified as cold (yin) or hot (yang) in this theory and are transformed into yin and yang energy when metabolized by the body. Cold foods are eaten when the person has a hot illness (eg, fever, rash, sore throat, ulcer, infection), and hot foods are eaten with a cold illness (eg, cancer, headache, stomach cramps, colds). The yin/yang theory is the basis for Eastern or Chinese medicine and is embraced by some Asian Americans.

Many Hispanic, African American, and Arab groups also embrace the hot/cold theory of health and illness. The four humors of the body-blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile-regulate basic bodily functions and are described in terms of temperature and moisture. The treatment of disease consists of adding or subtracting cold, heat, dryness, or wetness to restore the balance of these humors. Beverages, foods, herbs, medicines, and diseases are classified as hot or cold according to their perceived effects on the body, not their physical characteristics. According to the hot/cold theory, the individual as a whole, not just a particular ailment, is significant. Those who embrace the hot/cold theory maintain that health consists of a positive state of total well-being, including physical, psychological, spiritual, and social aspects of the person.

According to the naturalistic world view, breaking the laws of nature creates imbalances, chaos, and disease. People who embrace the naturalistic paradigm use metaphors such as "the healing power of Nature." From the perspective of the Chinese, for example, illness is seen, not as an intruding agent, but as a part of life's rhythmic course and an outward sign of disharmony within.

\section*{MAGICO-RELIGIOUS}

The third major way in which people view the world and explain the causes of illness is the magico-religious world view. This view's basic premise is that the world is an arena in which supernatural forces dominate and that the fate of the world and those in it depends on the action of supernatural forces for good or evil. Examples of magical causes of illness include belief in voodoo or witchcraft among some African Americans and others from Caribbean countries. Faith healing is based on religious beliefs and is most prevalent among selected Christian religions, including Christian Science, while various healing rituals may be found in many other religions, such as Roman Catholicism and Mormonism (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints).

Of course, it is possible to hold a combination of world views, and many patients offer more than one explanation for the cause of their illness. As a profession, nursing largely embraces the scientific
or biomedical world view, but some aspects of holism have begun to gain popularity, including a wide variety of techniques for managing chronic pain, such as hypnosis, therapeutic touch, and biofeedback. Belief in spiritual power is also held by many nurses who credit supernatural forces with various unexplained phenomena related to patients' health and illness states.

Regardless of the view held and whether the nurse agrees with the patient's beliefs in this regard, it is important to be aware of how people view their illness and their health and to work within this framework to promote patients' care and well-being.

\section*{Folk Healers}

Several cultures believe in folk or indigenous healers. The nurse may find some Hispanic patients, for instance, turning to a curandero or curandera, espiritualista (spiritualist), yerbo (herbalist), or sabador (healer who manipulates bones and muscles). Some African American patients may seek assistance from a hougan (voodoo priest or priestess), spiritualist, root doctor (usually a woman who uses magic rituals to treat diseases), or "old lady" (an older woman who has successfully raised a family and who specializes in child care and folk remedies). Native American patients may seek assistance from a shaman or medicine man or woman. Patients of Asian descent may mention that they have visited herbalists, acupuncturists, or bone setters. Several cultures have their own healers, most of whom speak the native tongue of the patient, make house calls, and cost significantly less than healers practicing in the conventional medical health care system.

People seeking complementary and alternative therapies have expanded the practices of folk healers beyond their traditional populations, so the nurse needs to ask patients about participation with folk healers regardless of their cultural background. It is best not to disregard a patient's belief in a folk healer or try to undermine trust in the healer. To do so may alienate and drive the patient away from receiving the care prescribed. A nurse should make an effort to accommodate the patient's beliefs while also advocating the treatment proposed by health science.

\section*{Cultural Assessment}

Cultural nursing assessment refers to a systematic appraisal or examination of individuals, families, groups, and communities in terms of their cultural beliefs, values, and practices. The purpose of such an assessment is to provide culturally competent care (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999). In an effort to establish a database for determining a patient's cultural background, nurses have developed cultural assessment tools or modified existing assessment tools (Spector, 2000; Leininger, 2001) to ensure that transcultural considerations are included in the plan of care. Giger and Davidhizar's (1999) model has been used to design nursing care from health promotion to nursing skills activities (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999; Smith-Temple \& Johnson, 2002). The information presented in this chapter and the following general guidelines can be used to direct the nurse's assessment of culture and its influence on a patient's health beliefs and practices.
- What is the patient's country of origin? How long has the patient lived in this country? What is the primary language and literacy level?
- What is the patient's ethnic background? Does he or she identify strongly with others from the same cultural background?
- What is the patient's religion, and how important is it to his or her daily life?
- Does the patient participate in cultural activities such as dressing in traditional clothing and observing traditional holidays and festivals?
- Are there any food preferences or restrictions?
- What are the patient's communication styles? Is eye contact avoided? How much physical distance is maintained? Is the patient open and verbal about symptoms?
- Who is the head of the family, and is he or she involved in decision making about the patient?
- What does the patient do to maintain his or her health?
- What does the patient think caused the current problem?
- Has the advice of traditional healers been sought?
- Have complementary therapies been utilized?
- What kind of treatment does the patient think will help? What are the most important results he or she hopes to get from this treatment?
- Are there religious rituals related to health, sickness, or death that the patient observes?

\section*{Additional Cultural Considerations: Know Thyself}

Because the nurse-patient interaction is the focal point of nursing, nurses should consider their own cultural orientation when conducting assessment of the patient and the patient's family and friends.
- Know your own cultural attitudes, values, beliefs, and practices.
- Regardless of "good intention," everyone has cultural "baggage" that ultimately results in ethnocentrism.
- In general, it is easier to understand those whose cultural heritage is similar to our own, while viewing those who are unlike us as strange and different.
- Maintain a broad, open attitude. Expect the unexpected. Enjoy surprises.
- Avoid seeing all people as alike; that is, avoid cultural stereotypes, such as "all Chinese like rice" or "all Italians eat spaghetti."
- Try to understand the reasons for any behavior by discussing commonalities and differences.
- If a patient has said or done something that you do not understand, ask for clarification. Be a good listener. Most patients will respond positively to questions that arise from a genuine concern for and interest in them.
- If at all possible, speak the patient's language (even simple greetings and social courtesies will be appreciated). Avoid feigning an accent or using words that are ordinarily not part of your vocabulary.
- Be yourself. There are no right or wrong ways to learn about cultural diversity.

\section*{The Future of Transcultural Nursing Care}

By the middle of the 21st century, the average American patient will trace his or her ancestry to Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, or the Hispanic or Arab worlds, rather than to Europe (Giger \& Davidhizar, 1999). As indicated previously, the concept of culturally competent care applies to health care institutions, which must develop culturally sensitive policies and provide an atmosphere that fosters the provision of culturally competent care by
nurses. Those nurses, who reflect the multicultural complexion of our society, must learn to acknowledge and adapt to diversity among their colleagues in the workplace (Davidhizar, Dowd, \& Newman-Giger, 1999). In addition, educational institutions must prepare nurses to deliver culturally competent care. Nursing programs, therefore, are exploring creative ways to promote cultural competence in nursing students, including offering multicultural health studies in their curricula (Spector, 2000).

An additional issue related to the provision of culturally competent care is the diversity of the health care delivery workforce. Today more than $80 \%$ of all nurses are white women. As the population becomes more culturally diverse, efforts to increase the number of ethnic minority nurses must continue and accelerate. Progress in increasing the percentage of culturally diverse nurses has been significantly slower than the increasing percentage of ethnic minority persons in the United States (Buerhaus \& Auerbach, 1999). Efforts must be made to facilitate the recruitment and successful program completion of ethnic minority nursing students.

With increasing frequency, nurses will be expected to provide culturally competent care for patients. Nurses must work effectively with patients, one another, and other health care team members whose ancestry reflects the multicultural complexion of contemporary society in increasing numbers. Cultural diversity remains one of the foremost issues in health care today.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are assigned to care for a hospitalized young male adult whose cultural background is very different from yours. Describe how you would assess his cultural beliefs and practices in developing a plan of nursing care. Explain why it is important to examine your own feelings about his cultural beliefs and practices.
2. An elderly Hispanic female patient who does not speak English is hospitalized after elective surgery. Even though she is progressing well and her discharge has been planned, her family insists on staying with her for as many hours as possible, refusing to leave when visiting hours are over. How can you help the nursing staff to explore the meaning of the family's behavior and to understand their own feelings about this behavior? Devise a strategy that you think will help resolve this situation.
3. You are preparing to discharge an elderly patient who is of foreign origin. The record indicates that she does not speak English and lives alone in a neighborhood where most of the residents are from the same ethnic background as herself. Describe how you would plan discharge teaching to ensure that you can communicate with the patient and family to promote the necessary follow-up care. Explore other aspects of the patient's and family's background that you would want to assess to determine the need for referral to a home health care agency.

\section*{Genetics Perspectives in Nursing}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the role of the nurse in integrating genetics in nursing care.
2. Conduct a genetics-based assessment.
3. Identify the common patterns of inheritance of genetic disorders.
4. Identify ethical issues in nursing related to genetics.
uman genome discoveries have ushered in a new era of medicine, genomic medicine, which recognizes that multiple genes work in concert with environmental influences to cause disease. Genomic medicine aims to improve predictions about individuals' susceptibility to diseases, the time of onset for those diseases, their extent and eventual severity, and which treatments or medications are likely to be most effective or harmful (Billings, 2000). Already, new gene-based strategies for disease detection, management, and treatment have been created, allowing health professionals to tailor care to an individual's particular genetic make-up.

To meet the challenges of genomic medicine, nurses need to understand the new technologies and treatments of gene-based health care. Nurses also must recognize that they are a vital link between patients and health care services; patients often turn to nurses first with questions about family history of risk factors, genetics information, and genetic tests and interpretations. Incorporating genetics into nursing means bringing a genetics framework to health assessments, planning, and interventions that supports identification of and response to individuals' changing genetics-related health needs (Lea, Williams, Jenkins, et al., 2000).

Nurses must learn to recognize patterns of inheritance when obtaining family and medical histories and understand when it is appropriate to consider new gene-based testing and treatment options. This chapter offers a foundation for the clinical applications of genetics principles in medical and surgical nursing, outlines the nurse's role in genetic counseling and evaluation, addresses important ethical issues, and provides genetics resources for nurses and patients.

\section*{A Framework for Integrating Genetics Into Nursing Practice}

Nursing's unique contribution to genomic medicine is its philosophy of holism. Nurses are ideally positioned to incorporate genetics into their assessments, planning, and interventions for patients at different ages and stages across the lifespan and in all settings. The holistic view that characterizes nursing takes into account each person's intellectual, physical, spiritual, social, cultural, biopsychologic, ethical, and esthetic experiences while ad-

\section*{Glossary}
allele: any one of two or more alternate forms of a gene at the same location. An allele for each gene is inherited from each parent.
autosome: a single chromosome from any of the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in sex determination (XX or XY)
carrier: person who is heterozygous; possessing two different alleles of a gene pair
chromosome: microscopic structures in the cell nucleus that contain genetic information and are constant in number in a species (eg, humans have 46 chromosomes)
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): the primary genetic material in humans consisting of nitrogenous bases, a sugar group, and phosphate combined into a double helix
diploid: the number of chromosomes normally present in somatic cells. For humans, that number is 46.
dominant: a genetic trait that is normally expressed when a person has a gene mutation on one of a pair of chromosomes and the "normal" form of the gene is on the other chromosome
genetics: the scientific study of heredity; how specific traits or predispositions are transmitted from parents to offspring
genome: the total genetic complement of an individual genotype
genomics: the study of the human genome, including gene sequencing, mapping, and function
genotype: the genes and the variations therein that a person inherits from his or her parents
haploid: the number of chromosomes present in egg or sperm (gametes); in humans, this is 23
Human Genome Project: an international research effort aimed at identifying and
characterizing the order of every base in the human genome
meiosis: the reduction division of diploid egg or sperm (germ cells) resulting in haploid gametes (having 23 chromosomes each)
mitosis: cell division occurring in somatic cells that normally results in daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes46 (diploid)
monosomy: missing one of a chromosome pair in normally diploid cells (for example, $45, \mathrm{X}$ females have only one X chromosome)
mutation: a heritable alteration in the genetic material
nondisjunction: the failure of a chromosome pair to separate appropriately during meiosis, resulting in abnormal chromosome numbers in reproductive cells (gametes) or cells
nucleotide: a nucleic acid "building block" composed of a nitrogenous base, a fivecarbon sugar, and a phosphate group
pedigree: a diagrammatic representation of a family history
penetrance: the percentage of individuals known to carry the gene for a trait who actually manifest the condition. For example, a trait with $90 \%$ penetrance will not be manifested by $10 \%$ of persons possessing the gene.
phenotype: a person's entire physical, biochemical, and physiological makeup, as determined by the individual's genotype and environmental factors
polymorphism: a genetic variation with two or more alleles that is maintained in a population
population screening: the application of a test or inquiry to a group to determine if
individuals in the group have an increased likelihood of a genetic condition or a mutation in a specific gene (eg, cholesterol screening for hypercholesterolemia)
predisposition testing: testing that is used to determine the likelihood that a healthy person with or without a family history of a condition will develop the disorder. Having the gene mutation would indicate that the person has an increased susceptibility to the disorder, but this is not a diagnosis. One example is DNA mutation testing for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer.
prenatal screening: testing that is used to identify if a fetus is at risk for a birth defect such as Down syndrome or spina bifida (eg, multiple marker maternal serum screening in pregnancy)
presymptomatic testing: genetic testing that is used to determine whether persons with a family history of a disorder, but no current symptoms, have the gene mutation. An example of this would be Huntington disease.
recessive: a genetic trait that is expressed only when a person has two copies of a mutant autosomal gene or a single copy of a mutant X-linked gene in the absence of another X chromosome
transcription: the process of transforming information from DNA into new strands of messenger RNA
trisomy: the presence of one extra chromosome in an otherwise diploid chromosome complement-for example, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)
variable expression: variation in the degree to which a trait is manifested; clinical severity
X-linked: located on the X chromosome
dressing genetics information, gene-based testing, diagnosis, and treatments. Thus, knowledge about genetics is basic to nursing practice (Lea, Anderson \& Monsen, 1998).

A framework for integrating genetics into nursing practice includes a philosophy of care that recognizes when genetics factors are playing a role or could play a role in an individual's health. This means using family history and the results of genetics tests effectively, informing patients about genetics concepts, understanding the personal and societal impact of genetics information, and valuing the privacy and confidentiality of genetics information.

A person's response to genetics information, genetic testing, or conditions may be either disabling or empowering. Genetics information may stigmatize individuals if it affects how they view themselves or how others view them. Nurses can help individuals and families understand the genetic aspect of themselves and learn how genetic traits and conditions are passed on within families and how genetic and environmental factors influence health and disease (Lea, Anderson \& Monsen, 1998; Peters et al., 1999).

Nurses facilitate communication among family members, the health care system, and community resources; they offer valuable support by virtue of their continuity of care with patients and families. All nurses should be able to recognize when a client is asking a question related to genetics information and should know how to obtain genetics information by gathering family and health histories and conducting physical and developmental
assessments. Being able to recognize a genetics concern allows the nurse to provide appropriate genetics resources and support to individuals and families (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

Key to nurses' genetics framework is the awareness of one's attitudes, experience, and assumptions about genetics concepts and how these are manifested in one's own practice. Chart 9-1 offers insights on how nurses can conduct periodic self-assessments.

\section*{Genetics Concepts}

Scientists and philosophers have long speculated about heredity and developed theories to explain how traits are transmitted to offspring. Developments in technology and research have accelerated progress in our understanding of genetics, allowing scientists to better understand relatively rare diseases such as phenylketonuria (PKU) or hemophilia that are related to mutations of a single gene inherited in families. New technologies and tools allow scientists to characterize inherited metabolic variations that interact over time and lead to common diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and dementia. This transition from genetics to genomics highlights how our understanding of single genes and their individual functions has evolved to understanding how multiple genes act and control biologic processes. Most health conditions are now believed to be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences and interactions (Billings, 2000).

\section*{Examining Our Own Attitudes, Experiences, and Assumptions}

Self-knowledge is one of the cornerstones to providing quality nursing care, and as practitioners, our attitudes and experiences have an impact on clinical practice. These attitudes emerge from social, cultural, and religious experiences in one's personal life. Awareness of our own values, beliefs, and cultural perceptions not only is important to the nurse-patient relationship, but it is also the first step in developing a genetics framework.

Periodic self-assessment can help maintain an effective framework as nurses update genetics knowledge and practice. Nurses can develop an awareness of their own attitudes, experiences, and assumptions about genetics concepts by considering the following:
- One's family's beliefs or values about health. What are your family, religious, or cultural beliefs about the cause of illness? How have your values or biases influenced your understanding of genetic conditions?
- One's philosophical, theologic, cultural, and ethical perspectives related to health. How would these attitudes influence your own use of genetics information or services? What experiences have you had with people from different social, cultural, religious, or ethnic groups? How would you deliver genetics information to individuals from different social, cultural, or ethnic groups? Can you recognize when personal values or biases may affect or interfere with the delivery of genetics information?
- One's level of genetics expertise. Can you recognize the limitations of your own genetics experience and know when to refer patients for further genetics work-up?
- One's experience with birth defects, chronic illnesses, and genetic conditions. Do you have a family member or friend who has a genetic condition or disorder? Has your experience been that
genetic disorders are disabling or empowering? Do you view a parent "at fault" for having a baby born with a birth defect or genetic condition? Do you advocate for fair access and other rights for individuals who have birth defects, genetic conditions, or other disabilities?
- One's view of DNA (the most basic concept of who we are, since our genetic makeup is unlike that of any other person except an identical twin). What are your assumptions about DNA? For example, do you assume that the genetic component of "the self" is a defective self? As another example, healthy carriers of genetic alterations that predispose them to develop certain diseases in the future now belong to a new class of "at risk" individuals. A person who is "at risk" is not ill at present, but may not remain well as long as the "average" person. Is it good to know that you are "at risk" or is this information that should not be identified or revealed because of the risk of potential discrimination?
- One's beliefs about reproductive options. What are your beliefs regarding reproductive options such as prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination? How might these influence your care of a patient who holds different beliefs?
- One's view of genetic testing and engineering. Do you see genetic testing and engineering-the ability to eliminate or enhance certain traits-as a way to create an "ideal genetic self"?
- One's approach to patients with disabilities. How are your attitudes made apparent in your practice and practice settings? For example, do you have access to TTY machines and/or interpreters for those who have hearing impairment? Are your intake procedures adapted to meet the needs of an individual with disabilities?

\section*{GENES AND THEIR ROLE IN HUMAN VARIATION}

Genes are central components of human health and disease. Work on the Human Genome Project (an international research effort to map and sequence the human genome in its entirety) has shown how basic human genetics is to human development, health, and disease. Knowledge that specific genes are associated with specific genetic conditions makes diagnosis possible, even in the unborn. Research continues to demonstrate how many common conditions have genetic causes. Many more associations between genetics, health, and disease will likely be identified as scientists complete and refine human genome mapping and sequencing.

\section*{Genes and Chromosomes}

A person's unique genetic constitution, called a genotype, is made up of some 30,000 to 40,000 genes. A person's phenotype, the observable characteristics of his or her genotype, includes physical appearance and other biologic, physiologic, and molecular traits. Environmental influences modify every individual's phenotype, even those with a major genetic component.

Human growth, development, and disease occur as a result of both genetic and environmental influences and interactions. The contribution of genetic factors may be large or small. For example, in a person with cystic fibrosis or PKU, the genetic contribution is significant. In contrast, the genetic contribution underlying a person's response to infection may be less so.

An individual gene is conceptualized as a unit of heredity. A gene is composed of a segment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contains a specific set of instructions for making the protein or proteins needed by body cells for proper functioning. Genes regulate both the types of proteins made and the rate at which proteins are produced. The structure of the DNA molecule is referred to as the double helix. The essential components of the DNA molecule are sugar-phosphate molecules and pairs of nitrogenous bases. Each nucleotide contains a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA is composed of two-paired strands, each made up of a number of nucleotides. The strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases (Fig. 9-1).

Genes are packaged and arranged in a linear order within chromosomes, which are located in the cell nucleus. In humans, 46 chromosomes occur in pairs in all body cells except oocytes (eggs) and sperm, which each contain only 23 chromosomes. Twenty-two pairs of chromosomes, called autosomes, are the same in females and males. The 23rd pair is referred to as the sex chromosomes. A female has two X chromosomes, while a male has one X and one Y chromosome. At conception, each parent normally gives one chromosome of each pair to his or her children. As a result, children receive half of their chromosomes from their fathers and half from their mothers (Fig. 9-2).

Careful examination of DNA sequences from many individuals shows that these sequences have multiple versions in a population. These different versions, or sequence variations, are called alleles. Sequences found in many forms are said to be polymorphic, meaning that there are at least two common forms of a particular gene.

\section*{Cell Division}

The human body grows and develops through a process of cell division. Mitosis and meiosis, two distinctly different types of cell division, contribute to these processes.

Mitosis is the process of cell division involved in cell growth, differentiation, and repair. During mitosis, the chromosomes of each cell duplicate. The result is two cells, called daughter cells, each containing the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The daughter cells are said to be diploid because they contain 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Mitosis occurs in all cells of the body except oocytes (eggs) and sperm.

Meiosis, in contrast, occurs only in reproductive cells and is the process by which oocytes and sperm are formed. During meiosis a reduction in the number of chromosomes takes place, resulting in oocytes or sperm that contain half the usual number or 23 chromosomes. Oocytes and sperm are referred to as haploid because they contain a single copy of each chromosome, compared to the usual two chromosomes in all other body cells.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-151.jpg?height=749&width=784&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=237}

\end{figure}

During the initial phase of meiosis, paired chromosomes come together in preparation for cell division, portions cross over, and an exchange of genetic material occurs. This event, called recombination, creates greater diversity in the makeup of oocytes and sperm.

During meiosis, a pair of chromosomes may fail to separate completely, creating a sperm or oocyte that contains either two copies or no copy of a particular chromosome. This sporadic event, called nondisjunction, can lead to either a trisomy or a monosomy. Down syndrome is an example of trisomy. An
individual with Down syndrome has three number 21 chromosomes. Turner syndrome is an example of monosomy. Girls who have Turner syndrome usually have a single X chromosome, causing them to have short stature and infertility (Lashley, 1998).

\section*{Gene Mutations}

Within each cell, many intricate and complex interactions regulate and express human genes. Gene structure and function, transcription and translation, and protein synthesis are all involved. Alterations in gene structure and function and the process of protein synthesis may influence a person's health. Changes in gene structure, called mutations, permanently change the sequence of DNA, which in turn can alter the nature and type of proteins made (Fig. 9-3).

Some gene mutations have no significant effect on the protein product made, while others cause partial or complete changes. How a protein is altered and its importance to proper body functioning determine the mutation's impact. Gene mutations may occur in hormones or enzymes or important protein products, thereby having significant implications for health and disease.

Sickle cell anemia is an example of a genetic condition caused by a small gene mutation that affects protein structure, producing hemoglobin S. A person who inherits two copies of the hemoglobin $S$ gene mutation has the condition sickle cell anemia and experiences the symptoms of severe anemia and thrombotic organ damage resulting from hypoxia (Lashley, 1998; Lea, 2000).

Other gene mutations may be larger, such as a deletion (loss), insertion (addition), duplication (multiplication), or rearrangement (translocation) of a longer DNA segment. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inherited form of muscular dystrophy, is an example of a genetic disorder caused by structural gene mutations such as deletions or duplications in the dystrophin gene. Another type of gene mutation, called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat, involves the expansion of more than the usual number of a triplet

\end{figure}
repeat sequence within a gene. Myotonic dystrophy, Huntington disease, and fragile $X$ syndrome are examples of conditions caused by this type of gene mutation.

Gene mutations may be inherited or acquired. Inherited or germ-line gene mutations are present in the DNA of all body cells and are passed on in reproductive cells from parent to child. Germ-line mutations are passed on to all daughter cells when body cells replicate (Fig. 9-4). The gene that causes Huntington disease is one example of a germ-line mutation.

Spontaneous gene mutations take place in individual oocytes or sperm at the time of conception. These mutations are not inherited in other family members. A person who carries the new "spontaneous" mutation, however, may pass on the gene mutation to his or her children. Achondroplasia, Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 are examples of genetic conditions that may occur in a single family member as a result of spontaneous mutation.

Acquired mutations take place in somatic cells and involve changes in DNA that occur after conception, during a person's lifetime. Acquired mutations develop as a result of cumulative changes in body cells other than reproductive cells (Fig. 9-5). Somatic gene mutations are passed on to the daughter cells derived from that particular cell line.

Gene mutations occur in the human body all the time. Cells have built-in mechanisms by which they can recognize mutations in DNA, and in most situations they correct the change before it is passed on by cell division. However, over time, body cells may lose their ability to repair damage from gene mutations, causing an accumulation of genetic changes that may ultimately result in diseases such as cancer and possibly other conditions of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease (Lashley, 1998).

\section*{Genetic Variation}

Sorting out the genetic components of complex conditions (eg, heart disease, diabetes, common cancers, psychiatric disorders) that result from the interaction of environment, lifestyle, and the small effects of many genes is ongoing. New studies of genetic
variation in humans are underway to develop a map of common DNA variants. Genetic variations occur among individuals of all populations. Polymorphisms and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced "snips") are the terms used for common genetic variations that occur most frequently throughout the human genome. Some SNPs may contribute directly to a trait or disease expression by altering function. SNPs are becoming increasingly important for the discovery of DNA sequence variations that affect biologic function. Such knowledge will allow clinicians to subclassify diseases and adapt therapies to the individual patient (Collins, 1999; Collins \& McKusick, 2001). For example, a polymorphism or SNP can alter a protein or enzyme activity and can thus affect drug efficacy and safety when it occurs in proteins that are targets of medication regimens or that are involved in drug transport or drug metabolism (McCarthy \& Hilfiker, 2000; Schafer \& Hawkins, 1998).

\section*{INHERITANCE PATTERNS IN FAMILIES}

Nursing assessment of patients' health includes obtaining and recording family history information. Family history evaluation in the form of a pedigree is a first step in establishing the pattern of inheritance. Nurses must become familiar with mendelian patterns of inheritance and pedigree construction and analysis to be able to help identify individuals and families who may benefit from further genetic counseling, testing and therapeutics (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998; Lea, 2000).

Mendelian conditions are genetic conditions that are inherited in families in fixed proportions among generations. Named after Gregor Mendel, mendelian conditions result from gene mutations present on one or both chromosomes of a pair. An individual gene inherited from one or both parents can cause a mendelian inherited condition. Mendelian conditions are classified according to their pattern of inheritance in families: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked. The terms dominant and recessive refer to the trait, genetic condition, or phenotype, but not to the genes or alleles that cause the observable characteristics (Thompson et al., 2001).

\end{figure}

\section*{Autosomal Dominant Inheritance}

Autosomal dominant inherited conditions affect female and male family members equally and follow a vertical pattern of inheritance in families (Fig. 9-6). An individual who has an autosomal dominant inherited condition carries a gene mutation for that condition on one chromosome of a pair. Each of that individual's offspring has a $50 \%$ chance of inheriting the gene mutation for the condition and a $50 \%$ chance of inheriting the normal version of the gene. Offspring who do not inherit the gene mutation for the dominant condition will not develop the condition and do not have an increased chance for having chil-

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 9-6 Three-generation pedigree illustrating autosomal dominant inheritance.}
\end{figure}
dren with the same condition (Fig. 9-7). Table 9-1 presents characteristics and examples of different patterns of inherited conditions.

Autosomal dominant inherited conditions often present with varying degrees of severity among affected family members and persons. Some individuals with the condition may have significant symptoms, while others may have only mild ones. This characteristic is referred to as variable expression; it results from the influences of genetic and environmental factors on clinical presentation.

Another phenomenon observed in autosomal dominant inheritance is penetrance, the percentage of persons known to have a particular gene mutation who actually show the trait. Penetrance is observed in conditions such as achondroplasia, in which nearly $100 \%$ of persons with the gene mutation typically display traits of the disease. In some conditions, the presence of a gene mutation does not invariably mean that a person will have or develop an autosomal inherited condition. For example, a woman who has the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene mutation has a lifetime risk for breast cancer up to $80 \%$, not $100 \%$. This quality, known as incomplete penetrance, indicates the probability that a given gene will produce disease. In other words, a person may inherit the gene mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition but may not have any of the observable physical or developmental features of that condition. However, these individuals carry the gene mutation and still have a $50 \%$ chance of passing the gene for the condition to each of their children. One of the effects of incomplete penetrance is that the gene appears to "skip" a generation, thus leading to errors in interpreting family history and in genetic counseling. Examples of other genetic conditions with incomplete pene-

\section*{Autosomal Recessive Inheritance}

The pattern of inheritance in autosomal recessive inherited conditions differs from that of autosomal dominant inherited conditions in that it is more horizontal than vertical, with relatives of a single generation tending to have the condition (Fig. 9-8). Genetic conditions inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern are frequently seen among particular ethnic groups and tend to occur more often in children of parents who are related by blood, such as first cousins (see Table 9-1).

In autosomal recessive inheritance, each parent carries a gene mutation on one chromosome of the pair and the normal working copy of the gene on the other chromosome. The parents are said to be carriers of the particular gene mutation. Unlike an individual with an autosomal dominant inherited condition, a carrier of a gene mutation for a recessive inherited condition does not have symptoms of the genetic condition. When two carrier parents have children together, they have (with each of their pregnancies) a $25 \%$ chance of having a child who inherits the gene mutation from each parent and who will have the condition (Fig. 9-9).

\section*{X-Linked Inheritance}

X-linked conditions may be inherited in families in recessive or dominant patterns (see Table 9-1). In both, the gene mutation is located on the X chromosome. All males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father
for a normal sex constitution of $46, \mathrm{XY}$. Since males have only one X chromosome, they do not have a counterpart for its genes as do females. This means that a gene mutation on their X chromosome is expressed when present in one copy. A female, on the other hand, inherits one $X$ chromosome from each parent for a normal sex constitution of 46,XX. A female may be a carrier of

a gene mutation or affected if the condition results from a gene mutation causing a dominant X-linked condition. Either the X chromosome that a female receives from her mother or the X chromosome she receives from her father may be passed on to her sons, and this is a random occurrence.

The most common pattern of X-linked inheritance is that in which a female is a carrier for a gene mutation on one of her X chromosomes. This is referred to as X -linked recessive inheritance. In X-linked recessive inherited conditions, a female carrier has a $50 \%$ chance to pass on the gene mutation to a son, who would be affected, or to a daughter, who would be a carrier like her mother (Fig. 9-10).

\section*{Nontraditional Inheritance Patterns}

Although mendelian inherited conditions present with a specific pattern of inheritance in some families, many diseases and traits do not follow these simple patterns. A variety of factors influence how a gene performs and is expressed. Different mutations in the same gene can produce variable symptoms in different individuals, as is the case with cystic fibrosis. Different mutations in several genes can lead to the identical outcome, as observed with Alzheimer's disease. Some traits involve the simultaneous mutation in two or more genes. A recently observed phenomenon, imprinting, can determine which pair of genes (the mother's or the father's) will be silenced or activated. This form of inheritance has been observed in Angelman syn-

drome, a severe form of mental retardation and ataxia (Thompson et al., 2001).

\section*{Multifactorial and Complex Genetic Conditions}

Many birth defects and common health conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, osteoarthritis, and diabetes occur as a result of interactions of multiple gene mutations and environmental influences, and thus are called multifactorial or complex conditions (see Table 9-1). Multifactorial conditions may cluster in families but do not present with the characteristic pattern of inheritance seen in families having mendelian inherited conditions (Fig. 9-11). Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, are examples of multifactorial genetic conditions (Chart 9-2).

\caption{EIGURE 9-11 Three-generation pedigree illustrating multifactorial conditions.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Neural Tube Defects and Folic Acid}

Most neural tube defects are caused by both genetic and environmental influences that combine during early embryonic development, leading to incomplete closure of the neural tube. More rarely, chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 18 or prenatal exposure to certain medications such as valproic acid are the underlying cause of neural tube defects.

Research has shown that folic acid taken in the prescribed amount of 4.0 mg daily prior to conception and during the first 3 months of pregnancy reduces the recurrence of neural tube defects by $70 \%$ in women who have had a previously affected pregnancy. It is now recommended that all women in childbearing years take folic acid ( 0.4 mg ) daily as part of a multivitamin to decrease the risk for neural tube defects (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1992; Hall \& Solehdin, 1998). Folic acid is recognized as an important environmental element that plays a critical role in fetal development and influences the outcome of genetic susceptibility to neural tube defects.

\section*{CHROMOSOMAL DIFFERENCES AND GENETIC CONDITIONS}

Differences in the number or structure of chromosomes are a major cause of birth defects, mental retardation, and malignancies. Chromosomal differences are present in approximately 1 in every 160 live-born infants and are the cause of greater than 50\% of all spontaneous first-trimester pregnancy losses (Lashley, 1998; Thompson et al., 2001). Chromosomal differences most commonly involve an extra or missing chromosome. This is called aneuploidy. Whenever there is an extra or missing chromosome, there is always associated mental or physical disability to some degree.

Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is a common chromosomal condition that occurs with greater frequency in pregnancies of women who are 35 years or older. A person who has trisomy 21 Down syndrome has a complete extra number 21 chromosome, which causes a particular facial appearance and increased risk for congenital heart defects, thyroid and vision problems, and mental retardation. Other examples of chromosomal differences include trisomy 13 and 18, both more severe than Down syndrome, and conditions involving extra or missing sex chromosomes (eg, Turner syndrome, in which females have only one X chromosome instead of the usual two) (Lashley, 1998).

Chromosomal differences may also involve a structural rearrangement within or between chromosomes. These are less common than chromosomal conditions in which there is an extra or missing chromosome, but occur in 1 in every 500 newborns (Thompson et al., 2001). People who carry "balanced" chromosome rearrangements have all of their chromosomal material, but it is rearranged. A person who carries a balanced chromosomal rearrangement has an increased risk for spontaneous pregnancy loss and for having children with an unbalanced chromosomal arrangement that may result in physical or mental disabilities. Known carriers are therefore offered prenatal counseling and testing.

Chromosome studies may be needed at any age, depending upon the indication. Two common indications are for confirmation of a suspected diagnosis such as Down syndrome, and for a history of two or more unexplained pregnancy losses. Chromosome studies are accomplished by obtaining a tissue sample (eg, blood, skin, amniotic fluid), preparing and staining the chromosomes, and analyzing them under a microscope. The microscopic study
of chromosomes is called cytogenetics and is an area that is rapidly evolving. Today, cytogenetics is used with new molecular techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), which permits more detailed examination of chromosomes. FISH is useful to detect small abnormalities, including characterizing chromosomal rearrangements (Thompson et al., 2001).

\section*{Clinical Applications of Genetics}

One of the most immediate applications of new genetics discoveries is the development of genetic tests that can be used to detect a trait, diagnose a genetic condition, and identify people who have a genetic predisposition to a disease such as cancer or heart disease. Another emerging application is pharmacogenetics. Pharmacogenetics involves the use of genetic testing to identify genetic variations that relate to the safety and efficacy of medications and gene-based treatments, so that individualized treatment and management plans can be developed. Future applications may include the use of gene chips to map a person's individual genome for genetic variations that may lead to disease. Nurses will be involved in caring for patients who are undergoing genetic testing and gene-based treatments. Knowledge of the clinical applications of modern genetics technologies will prepare nurses to inform and support patients, and to provide high-quality genetics-related health care.

\section*{GENETIC TESTING}

Genetic tests provide information leading to the diagnosis of inherited conditions or other conditions with a known genetic contribution. Genetic testing involves the use of specific laboratory analyses of chromosomes, genes, or gene products (eg, enzymes, proteins) to learn whether a genetic alteration related to a specific disease or condition is present in an individual. Genetic testing can be DNA-based, chromosomal or biochemical.

There are several important uses for genetic testing, as identified by the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing (SACGT, 2000). Prenatal testing includes all three types of genetic testing (DNA-based, chromosomal and biochemical) and is widely used for prenatal screening and diagnosis of such conditions as Down syndrome. Carrier testing is used to determine carrier status, helping couples or individuals learn whether they carry a recessive allele for an inherited condition (eg, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, or Tay-Sachs disease) and thus risk passing it on to their children. Genetic testing is also used widely in newborn screening, and in the United States is made available for an increasing number of genetic conditions. Two examples are PKU and galactosemia. Diagnostic testing is used to detect the presence or absence of a particular genetic alteration or allele to identify or confirm a diagnosis of a disease or condition in an affected individual-for example, myotonic dystrophy and fragile X syndrome. In the near future, genetic tests will be increasingly used to identify a person's predisposition to disease and to design specific and individualized treatment and management plans. Examples of current uses of genetic tests are shown in Table 9-2.

Nurses will increasingly participate in genetic testing, especially in the areas of patient education, ensuring informed health choices and consent, advocating for privacy and confidentiality with regard to genetic test results, and assisting patients to understand the complex issues involved in genetic testing (Lea \& Williams, 2002).

\section*{GENETIC SCREENING}

Genetic screening, in contrast to genetic testing, is a broader concept and applies to testing of populations or groups independent of a positive family history or symptom manifestation. Genetic screening, as defined in 1975 by the Committee for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism of the National Academy of Sciences (SACGT, 2000), has several major aims. One is management; that is, identifying people with treatable genetic conditions that could prove dangerous to their health if left untreated. An example of this is screening of newborns. A second aim is to provide reproductive options to people with a high probability of having children with severe, untreatable diseases and for whom genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and other reproductive options could be helpful and of interest. This is illustrated by the screening of individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent for conditions such Tay-Sachs disease and Canavan disease. A third aim is screening pregnant women to detect birth defects such as neural tube defects and Down syndrome using multiple marker screening. Genetic screening may also be used for public health purposes to determine the incidence and prevalence of a birth defect, or to investigate the feasibility and value of new genetic testing methods.

Most commonly genetic screening occurs in prenatal and newborn programs that involve nurses in various roles and settings. However, it is anticipated that genetic screening will expand in the future to include adult-onset conditions such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and hemochromatosis. Table 9-3 gives examples of genetic screening applications.

In the future, population-based (widespread) genetic screening will be applied to help identify people who are predisposed to de-
velop conditions such as breast and colon cancer and heart disease. Nurses will be expected to participate in explaining genetics concepts such as risk and genetic predisposition, supporting informed health decisions and opportunities for prevention and early intervention, and protecting patients' privacy (Lea \& Williams, 2002).

\section*{TESTING AND SCREENING FOR ADULT-ONSET CONDITIONS}

Adult-onset conditions are disorders with a genetic component that are manifested in later life. Often symptoms or clinical manifestations occur only in late adolescence or adulthood, and disease is clearly observed to run in families. Some of these conditions are attributed to specific genetic mutations following either autosomal dominant inheritance or autosomal recessive inheritance. However, the majority of adult-onset conditions are considered to be multifactorial (polygenetic) in nature (eg, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis). Nursing assessment for adult-onset conditions is based on the family history and the identification of diseases or clinical manifestations associated with adult- onset conditions. Knowledge of adult-onset conditions and their genetic basis (ie, mendelian versus multifactorial conditions) influences the nursing considerations for genetic testing. Table 9-4 describes adult-onset conditions, their age of onset, pattern of inheritance, genes involved, and testing availability.

If a single gene accounts for an adult-onset condition in a symptomatic individual, diagnostic testing is used to confirm a diagnosis to assist in the plan of care and management. Diagnostic testing for adult-onset conditions is most frequently used with autosomal dominant conditions, such as Huntington disease or

Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, and autosomal recessive conditions, such as hemochromatosis. In families with known adultonset conditions or with a confirmed genetic mutation in an affected family member, presymptomatic testing provides asymptomatic individuals with information about having a genetic mutation and about the likelihood of developing the disease. Huntington disease has served as the model for presymptomatic testing because the presence of the genetic mutation predicts disease onset and progression. Although preventive measures are not yet available for Huntington disease, the genetics information enables health care providers to develop a clinical, supportive, and psychological plan of care. Presymptomatic testing is considered for families with a known adult-onset condition in which either a positive or negative result will affect medical management or in which earlier treatment of a condition is more beneficial than treatment at a later stage. Presymptomatic testing is therefore offered for several adult-onset conditions, such as cancer, thrombophilia, and antitrypsin deficiency.

In the absence of a single disease-causing gene, it is thought that multiple genes are related to the onset of most adult diseases. These susceptibility genes modify or influence the development and severity of disease. Most susceptibility testing is conducted in the research setting to identify candidate genes for disease, such as Alzheimer's, psychiatric conditions, heart disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. For some diseases, the interaction of several genes and other environmental or metabolic events affect disease onset and progression. Susceptibility testing can help to distinguish variations within the same disease or response to treatment. For example, no single gene is associated with osteoporosis. Several polymorphisms on candidate genes related to the vitamin D receptor, estrogen and androgen receptors, cytokine production and its associated stimulation of osteoclasts, and collagen type 1 -alpha 1 are under study to predict bone mineral density and fracture risk. Some susceptibility genes may predict treatment response. For example, individuals can present with similar clinical signs and symptoms of asthma but have different responses to treatment. Susceptibility testing can help classify the asthma as sensitive or resistant to treatment with corticosteroids.

Population screening, the use of genetic testing for large groups or whole populations, to identify late-onset conditions is under development. Currently population screening is offered in some ethnic groups to identify cancer-predisposing genes. For example, Ashkenazi Jewish individuals (Jews of Eastern European origin) have a greater chance of having inherited a specific genetic mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Individuals with one of these BRCA mutations have approximately a $56 \%$ risk for breast cancer, $16 \%$ risk for ovarian cancer, and $16 \%$ risk for prostate cancer by age 70 (Struewing et al., 1997). Therefore, identifying one of these mutations allows the patient the options of cancer screening as well as other medical management such as chemoprevention or prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy in carriers. Population screening is being explored for other adultonset conditions such as type 2 diabetes and hereditary hemochromatosis (iron overload disorder). For a test to be considered for population screening, there must be: (1) sufficient information about gene distribution within populations, (2) accurate prediction about the development and progression of disease, and (3) appropriate medical management for asymptomatic individuals with a mutation (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 1996).

\section*{Nursing Considerations for Adult-Onset Conditions}

Nurses must be alert for family histories that indicate multiple generations (autosomal dominant inheritance) or multiple siblings (autosomal recessive inheritance) affected with the same condition, or onset of disease earlier than expected in the general population (eg, multiple generations with early-onset hyperlipidemia). Possible adult-onset conditions are discussed with other members of the health care team for appropriate resources and referral.

Information about diagnostic testing is often introduced as part of a diagnostic work-up. The nurse supports the patient in making decisions related to genetic testing and provides referrals for appropriate education and counseling about the adult-onset condition prior to genetic testing. The nurse addresses the patient's questions or concerns about the benefits and limitations of

genetic testing for the individual and the impact on the family. When testing is completed, the nurse provides support for individuals newly diagnosed with an adult-onset condition and provides teaching about the meaning and implications of the test results.

Once a mutation for an adult-onset condition is identified in a family, at-risk family members can be referred for predisposition testing. If the patient is found to be the mutation carrier, the nurse provides the patient with information about the risk to other family members. As part of that discussion, the nurse assures the patient that his or her test results are private and confidential and will be shared with others, including family members, only with the patient's permission. If the patient is an unaffected family
member, the nurse discusses inheritance and the risk of developing the disease, provides support for the decision-making process, and offers referral for genetics services.

\section*{Nursing Care and Interventions in Genetic Counseling and Evaluation}

The genetic counseling and evaluation process often involves additional genetic testing and procedures and subsequent decisions for patients and families with regard to reproduction, fertility, testing of children, and management options such as prophylactic surgery. Genetic counseling and evaluation services are traditionally offered at various stages: prenatal or perinatal, newborn or
neonatal, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Nurses have responsibilities in each of these areas for assessment and providing psychosocial interventions and accurate information as the family members consider their genetic testing and treatment options. In all of these areas, the nurse considers the patient in the context of the family.

When individuals or family members are considering genetic testing, whether it is for prenatal, newborn, childhood or adultonset conditions, the nurse provides accurate information as they consider their options. For prenatal testing, this would include information and support for subsequent decisions regarding the pregnancy in the event of a prenatal diagnosis of a genetic condition in the fetus. When a genetic diagnosis such as Down syndrome or hereditary breast or ovarian cancer is made, families need information about the range and severity of potential problems, the proportion of individuals with milder aspects of the condition, management options, support organizations, and current understanding of the long-term prognosis (Williams \& Lea, 2003).

Decision-making support is an important nursing intervention in many genetic counseling situations. Examples include when a woman or couple considers the options regarding termination of a pregnancy or when individuals are considering presymptomatic testing for conditions such as Huntington disease or predisposition testing for hereditary cancers. The nurse helps the individual and family to acquire information about options, identifies the pros and cons of each option, helps the individual and family to explore their values and beliefs, respects each person's right to receive or not to receive information, and helps the individual to explain the decision to others (McCloskey \& Bulechek, 2000).

Other essential components of nursing care and genetic counseling include teaching and an intervention called "coping enhancement." Teaching is needed, for example, when a new genetic diagnosis is made. The family will need information about the range of possible health outcomes in this condition, treatment options, and (in the case of prenatal diagnosis of a genetic condition) management options regarding continuing or ending the pregnancy. "Coping enhancement" involves "assisting a person to adapt to perceived stressors, changes or threats that interfere with meeting life demands and roles" (McCloskey \& Bulechek, 2000, p. 234). Coping enhancement is essential throughout the entire genetic counseling, evaluation, and testing process. Indicators of patient knowledge, decision-making, and coping outcomes have been developed (Johnson, Maas, \& Moorhead, 2000), and the nurse can use these indicators when documenting nursing care provided to families.

\section*{INDIVIDUALIZING GENETIC PROFILES}

Information about genes and their variations is helping researchers to identify genetic differences that predispose some individuals or groups to disease and that affect their responses to treatment. The use of individualized genetics information to predict predisposition to common diseases will take considerable time to develop. However, genetic tests for non-disease genes (ie, polymorphisms in detoxifying enzymes, cell or drug receptor variations, or other inherited polymorphisms related to metabolism) are underway. These genetic tests for individual variations or inherited polymorphisms are called genetic profiles. One major effort of genetic profiling is focused on enzyme metabolism. Several polymorphisms related to enzyme metabolism have been identified in the cytochrome P450 family, long known to affect drug metabolism. There are three subcategories of genetic profiles that describe population differences in enzyme metabolism genotypes. These
are based on an individual's genetic make-up for the metabolism of medications or other exogenous compounds into inactive or active metabolites (Norton, 2001b).

The field of pharmacogenetics (the study of gene variations in drug response) is rapidly advancing the way nurses will administer and manage drug treatments. Drug metabolism involves enzyme activity, controlled by genes, for absorption, distribution, and excretion. A single base change, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), in genes activated for enzyme activity can cause either decreased or increased drug metabolism. Genetic testing for these SNPs will provide a genetic profile, classifying patients according to their drug metabolism type. The SNP classifications of drug metabolism are effective metabolizers (having the expected metabolism), poor metabolizers (lacking the ability to metabolize effectively), and ultra-rapid or rapid metabolizers (having extremely rapid metabolism of drug compounds). Poor metabolizers are most likely to have adverse events due to the prolonged bioavailability of the drug, while ultra-rapid metabolizers have insufficient drug response. Efficient metabolizers can receive the standard expected drug dosage, whereas poor metabolizers need lower doses and ultra-rapid metabolizers need higher doses to obtain a therapeutic effect (Roses, 2000). For example, poor metabolizers of antipsychotic agents are more likely to have oversedation and require dose modification to achieve an expected therapeutic response (Scordo \& Spina, 2002).

DNA tests to identify patient-specific genetic profiles will be a treatment priority to assist in planning and evaluating treatment outcomes, to prevent adverse effects, and to improve therapies. Nurses therefore will need to know how polymorphisms affect a patient's susceptibility to disease and treatment response. Understanding the effect of polymorphisms on protein and enzyme function and their distribution in specific populations will be needed for health promotion. Since nurses will provide information about genetic profiles, they will need to know about the impact of genetics on treatment.

\section*{Applications of Genetics in Nursing Practice}

Nursing practice in genetics-related health care blends the principles of human genetics with nursing care in collaboration with other professionals, including genetics specialists, to foster health improvement, maintenance, and restoration. In any practice setting, nurses will carry out five main activities in genetics-related nursing practice: help collect and interpret relevant family and medical histories; identify patients and families who need further genetic evaluation and counseling and refer them to appropriate genetics services; offer genetics information and resources to patients and families; collaborate with genetics specialists; and participate in the management and coordination of care of patients with genetic conditions. Genetics-related nursing practice includes the care of patients who have genetics conditions, persons who may be predisposed to develop or pass on genetic conditions, and persons who are seeking genetics information and referral for additional genetics services (Lea, Williams, Jenkins, et al., 2000).

Nurses support patients and families with genetics-related health concerns by ensuring that their health choices are informed ones and by advocating for the privacy and confidentiality of genetics information and for equal access to genetic testing and treatments. The Scope and Standards of Genetics Clinical Nursing Practice, developed by the International Society of Nurses in Genetics (ISONG, 1998) and published by the American Nurses Association, delineates roles and responsibilities for nurses in providing genetics health care.

\section*{GENETICS AND HEALTH ASSESSMENT}

Assessment of a person's genetics-related health status is an ongoing process. The nurse collects information that can help identify individuals and families who have actual or potential genetics-related health concerns or who may benefit from further genetics information, counseling, testing, and treatment. This process can begin before conception and continue throughout the lifespan. Nurses evaluate family and past medical histories, including prenatal history, childhood illnesses, developmental history, adult-onset conditions (if adult), past surgeries, treatments, and medications; this information may relate to the genetic condition at hand or being considered. (See Chap. 5 for more information on assessing past medical history.) The nurse also identifies the patient's ethnic background and conducts a physical assessment to gather pertinent genetics information. The assessment also includes the patient's culture, spiritual beliefs, and ancestry. Genetics-related health assessment always includes determining a patient's or family's understanding of actual or potential health concerns related to genetics and understanding how these issues are communicated within a family (ISONG, 1998; Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

\section*{Family History Assessment}

Nurses in any practice setting continuously assess genetic family history to identify the presence of a genetic trait, inherited condition, or predisposition. A questionnaire (Chart 9-3) is often used to identify genetic conditions for which further information, education, testing, or treatment can be offered. In consultation and collaboration with other health care providers and specialists, the nurse can then determine whether further genetic testing and evaluation should be offered for the trait or condition in question. A detailed and accurate family history provides the most complete genetics health information. The family history should include at least three generations, as well as information about the current and past health status of all family members, including the age of onset of any illnesses and cause of death and age at death. The nurse also inquires about medical conditions known to have a heritable component and for which genetic testing may be offered. The nurse obtains information about the presence of birth defects, mental retardation, familial traits, or similarly affected family members (Lashley, 1998; Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

The nurse also considers the presence of genetic relatedness (consanguinity) among family members when assessing the risk for genetic conditions in couples or families. For example, when obtaining a preconception or prenatal family history, the nurse asks whether the prospective parents have common ancestors (ie, they are first cousins). This is important to know because individuals who share ancestors have more genes in common than those who are unrelated, thus increasing their chance for having children with an autosomal recessive inherited condition such as cystic fibrosis. The number of shared genes depends upon the degree of relationship. A parent and child, for example, share half of their genes, while first cousins share one in eight of their genes. Ascertaining genetic relatedness gives the nurse the opportunity to offer additional genetic counseling and evaluation. It may also serve as an explanation for families who have a child or individual with a rare autosomal recessive inherited condition (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

When the assessment of family history reveals that the patient has been adopted, genetics-based health assessment becomes more challenging. The nurse and health care team should make
all efforts to help the patient obtain as much information as possible about his or her biological parents, including their ethnic backgrounds.

Questions regarding reproductive history (eg, history of miscarriage or stillbirth) are included in genetic family history health assessments to identify possible chromosomal conditions. The nurse also inquires about any history of family members with inherited conditions or birth defects; maternal health conditions such as type 1 diabetes, seizure disorder, or maternal PKU, which may increase the risk for birth defects in children; and exposure to alcohol or other drugs during pregnancy. Maternal age is also noted: women who are 35 years or older who are considering pregnancy and childbearing or who are already pregnant should be offered prenatal diagnosis (eg, testing through amniocentesis) because of the association between advancing maternal age and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

\section*{Ancestry and Ethnicity Assessment}

Assessing ancestry and ethnicity helps identify individuals and groups who could benefit from genetic testing for carrier identification, prenatal diagnosis, and susceptibility testing. For example, carrier testing for sickle cell anemia is routinely offered to individuals of African-American heritage, while carrier testing for Tay-Sachs disease and Canavan disease is offered to individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Professional organizations such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG, 2001) recommend that relevant racial and ethnic populations be offered carrier testing. Recently, ACOG and the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommended that all couples, particularly those of Northern European and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, be offered carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (ACOG, 2001). Ideally, carrier testing is offered before conception to allow persons who are carriers to make reproductive decisions. Prenatal diagnosis is offered and discussed when both partners of a couple are found to be carriers.

Inquiring about a patient's ethnic background is also important when assessing for susceptibilities to adult-onset conditions such as hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. For example, a specific BRCA1 cancer-predisposing gene mutation seems to occur more frequently in women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Therefore, asking about ethnicity can help identify persons with an increased risk for certain cancer gene mutations (American Medical Association, 2001).

The nurse assesses ancestry and ethnic background to identify individuals who may have an underlying genetic condition that may affect the safety and efficacy of certain medications or treatments. For example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) is a common enzyme abnormality that affects millions of people throughout the world, especially those of Mediterranean, Southeast Asian, African, Middle Eastern, and Near Eastern origin. G6PD is transmitted as a gene mutation on the X chromosome. Individuals with a severe deficiency have chronic hemolytic anemia, while others with a milder deficiency develop hemolytic anemia upon exposure to peroxide-producing drugs, infection, exposure to naphthalene in mothballs, or ingestion of the fava (broad) bean (Lashley, 1998).

Assessment of ancestry and ethnic background is also important when considering drug metabolism. The ability to metabolize and eliminate certain medications depends upon acetylation in the liver by the enzyme N -acetyltransferase. Many different versions (polymorphisms) of the gene that codes for N -acetyltransferase

exist, and these polymorphisms vary among ethnic groups. This is an important consideration, for example, when isoniazid (INH) is prescribed for the treatment of tuberculosis. Patients who are rapid or ultra-rapid metabolizers have a significantly higher risk for developing isoniazid-induced hepatitis; this is especially true for persons of Chinese and Japanese descent (Lashley, 1998).

\section*{Physical Assessment}

Physical assessment may provide clues that a particular genetic condition is present in an individual and family. Family history assessment may offer initial guidance regarding the particular
area for physical assessment. For example, a family history of familial hypercholesterolemia would alert the nurse to assess family members for symptoms of hyperlipidemias (xanthomas, corneal arcus, abdominal pain of unexplained origin). As another example, a family history of neurofibromatosis type I, an inherited condition involving tumors of the central nervous system, would prompt the nurse to carry out a detailed assessment of closely related family members. Skin findings such as café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, or tumors of the skin (neurofibromas) would warrant referral for further evaluation, including genetic evaluation and counseling (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

When a genetic condition is suspected as a result of a family history or physical assessment, the nurse, in collaboration with the health care team, may initiate further discussion and evaluation. Providing genetics information, offering and discussing genetic tests, and suggesting a referral to a geneticist may be performed (Chart 9-4).

\section*{Cultural, Social, and Spiritual Assessment}

When collecting and discussing genetics information, the nurse needs to assess the patient's and family's cultural, social, and spiritual orientations. The nurse also needs to consider the patient's views about the significance of a genetic condition and its effect on self-concept, as well as the patient's perception of the role of genetics in health and illness, reproduction, and disability. Patients' social and cultural backgrounds determine their interpretations and values about information obtained from genetic testing and evaluation and thus influence their perceptions of health, illness, and risk. Family structure and decision-making and educational background contribute in the same way (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

Assessing a patient's beliefs, values, and expectations regarding genetic testing and information helps the nurse to provide ap-

propriate information about the specific genetics topic. In some cultures, for example, individuals believe that health means the absence of symptoms and that the cause of illness is supernatural. Patients with these beliefs may initially reject suggestions for presymptomatic or carrier testing. However, by including resources such as family, cultural, and religious community leaders when providing genetics-related health care, the nurse can help ensure that patients receive information in a way that transcends social, cultural, and economic barriers (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

\section*{Psychosocial Assessment}

Psychosocial assessment is an essential nursing component of the genetics health assessment (Chart 9-5). After conducting an initial psychosocial assessment, the nurse will be aware of the potential impact of new genetic information on the patient and family and how they may cope with this information.

\section*{GENETIC COUNSELING AND EVALUATION SERVICES}

As the contribution of genetics to the health-illness continuum is recognized, the process of genetic counseling is expected to become a responsibility of all health care professionals in clinical practice. Nurses are obvious and natural providers of genetics services because they are aware of a patient's personal and family history. They assess patients' health and make referrals for specialized diagnosis and treatment. They offer anticipatory guidance by explaining the purpose and goals of a referral. They collaborate with primary care providers and specialists in giving supportive and follow-up counseling. They coordinate follow-up and case management.

\section*{Genetics Services}

Genetics services provide genetics information, education, and support to patients and families with genetics-related health concerns. Genetics professionals, including medical geneticists,

\section*{Chart 9-5 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Psychosocial Genetic Health Assessment}

The nurse assesses:
- Educational level and understanding of the genetic condition or concern in the family.
- Desired goals and health outcomes in relation to genetic condition or concern.
- Family rules regarding disclosure of medical information (eg, some families may not reveal a history of diseases such as cancer or mental illness during the family history assessment).
- Family rules, boundaries, and cultural practices as well as personal preferences about knowing medical information.
- Past coping mechanisms and social support.
- Ability to make an informed decision (eg, is the patient under stress from family situations, acute or chronic illness, or medications that may impair the ability to make an informed decision).
genetics counselors, and advanced practice nurses in genetics, provide specific genetics services to patients and families who are referred by their primary health care providers. A team approach is often used by genetics specialists to obtain and interpret complex family history information, evaluate and diagnose genetic conditions, interpret and discuss complicated genetic test results, support patients throughout the evaluation process, and offer resources for additional professional and family support. Patients participate as team members and decision-makers throughout the process. Genetics services encompass an evaluation and communication process by which individuals and their families come to learn and understand relevant aspects of genetics, to make informed health decisions, and to receive support as they integrate personal and family genetics information into daily living (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

Genetic counseling may take place over an extended period and may entail more than one counseling session, which may include other family members. This allows patients and families to learn and understand genetics information, to receive support and guidance in decision-making, and to obtain comprehensive and coordinated care if they have specific genetic conditions or concerns. The components of genetic counseling are outlined in Chart 9-6. Genetic counseling may be offered at any point during the lifespan, although genetic counseling issues are often relevant to the life stage in which counseling is sought. Some examples are presented in Chart 9-7 (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

\section*{Nursing Role in Genetic Counseling}

Patients seek genetic counseling for a variety of reasons and at different stages of life. Some are seeking preconception or prenatal information; others are referred following the birth of a child with a birth defect or suspected genetic condition; still others are seeking information for themselves or their families because of the presence or family history of a genetic condition. Regardless of the timing or setting, genetic counseling is offered to all patients who have questions about genetics and their health. In collaboration with the health care team, the nurse considers referring for genetic counseling any patient in whose family a heritable condi-
tion exists and who asks questions such as, "What are my chances for having this condition? Is there a genetic test that will tell me? Is there a genetic treatment or cure? What are my options?" (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

Nurses refer clients, collaborate with genetics specialists, and participate in genetic counseling when they carry out the following activities:
- Provide appropriate genetic information before, during, and in follow-up to genetic counseling
- Help gather relevant family and medical history information
- Offer support to patients and families throughout the genetic counseling process
- Coordinate genetics-related health care with relevant community and national support resources

These activities, carried out in collaboration with patients and families, help ensure that they receive the most benefit from genetic counseling (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998; Lea, Williams, Jenkins, et al., 2000).

\section*{RESPECTING PATIENTS' RIGHTS}

Respecting the patient's right to self-determination-that is, supporting decisions that reflect the patient's personal beliefs, values, and interests-is a central principle of how nurses provide genetics information and counseling. Genetics specialists and nurses participating in genetic counseling make every attempt to respect the patient's ability to make autonomous decisions. A first step in providing such nondirective counseling is recognizing one's own values (see Chart 9-1) and how communication of genetics information may be influenced by those values.

Confidentiality of genetics information and respect for privacy are other essential principles underlying genetic counseling. The patient has the right to have testing without having the results divulged to anyone, including insurers or physicians. Some patients pay for testing themselves so that insurers will not learn of the test; others use a different name for testing to protect their privacy. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 prohibits the use of genetics information to establish insurance eligibility. However, it does not prohibit group plans from increasing premiums, excluding coverage for a specific
condition, or imposing a lifetime cap on benefits. The National Human Genome Research Institute, Policy and Public Affairs and Legislative Activities Branch has a summary of each state's legislation on employment and insurance discrimination (see the resources list at the end of this chapter).

All genetics specialists, including nurses who participate in the genetic counseling process and those with access to individuals' genetic information, must honor the patient's desire for confidentiality. Genetics information should be kept from family members, insurance companies, employers, and schools if the patient desires, even if keeping the information confidential is difficult. The nurse may want to disclose genetics information to family members who could experience significant harm if they do not know such information. However, the patient may have other views and may wish to keep this information from the family, resulting in an ethical dilemma for both patient and nurse. The nurse must honor the patient's wishes while explaining to the patient the potential benefit this information may have to other family members (ISONG, 2002).

\section*{PROVIDING PRECOUNSELING INFORMATION}

Preparing the patient and family, promoting informed decisionmaking, and obtaining informed consent are essential in genetic counseling. The nurse assesses the patient's capacity and ability to give voluntary consent. This includes assessment of factors that may interfere with informed consent such as hearing and language deficits, impaired intelligence, and the effects of medica-
tion. The nurse makes sure that the individual's decision to undergo testing is not affected by coercion, persuasion, or manipulation. Because information may need to be repeated over time, the nurse offers follow-up discussion as needed (Bove et al., 1997).

The genetics service to which the nurse refers a patient or family for genetic counseling will ask the nurse to provide background information for evaluation. Genetics specialists need to know the reason for referral, the patient's or family's reason for seeking genetic counseling, and potential genetics-related health concerns. The nurse may refer a family with a new diagnosis of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer, for example, to obtain more information or counseling or to discuss the likelihood of developing the disease and the implications for other family members. The family may have concerns about confidentiality and privacy. Using the nursing assessment, the genetics specialists tailor the genetic counseling to respond to these concerns.

With the patient's permission, the nurse may also provide to the genetics specialists the relevant test results and medical evaluations. The nurse needs to obtain permission from the patient and, if applicable, from other family members to retrieve, review, and transfer medical records that document the genetic condition of concern. In some situations, evaluation of more than one family member may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of a genetic disorder. The nurse can prepare the family for this assessment by explaining that the medical information and evaluation are necessary to ensure that appropriate information and counseling (including risk interpretation) are provided.

The nurse will be asked to provide information about the emotional and social status of the patient and family. Genetics specialists will want to know the coping skills of a family that has recently learned of the diagnosis of a genetic disorder. They will want to be aware of the types of genetics information being sought. The nurse helps to identify cultural and other issues that may influence how information is provided and by whom. For patients with hearing loss, for example, an interpreter's services may have to be arranged. The genetics professional, after determining these issues with the nurse, prepares for the genetic counseling and evaluation with these relevant issues in mind (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

\section*{PREPARING THE PATIENT FOR GENETIC EVALUATION}

Before the genetic counseling appointment, the nurse discusses with the patient and family the type and nature of family history information that will be collected during the consultation. Family history collection and analysis are comprehensive and focus on information that may be relevant to the specific genetic concern in question. Although targeted to each genetic counseling situation, such analysis always includes assessment for any other potentially inherited conditions for which testing and preventive and treatment measures may be offered.

A physical examination performed by the medical geneticist may be needed to identify specific clinical features that are diagnostic of a genetic condition. The examination also helps to identify whether additional laboratory tests are needed to clarify the diagnosis of a genetic disorder. The detailed physical examination generally involves assessment of all body systems, with a focus on specific physical characteristics considered for diagnosis. The nurse describes the diagnostic evaluations that are part of a genetics consultation and explains their purposes (Lashley, 1998; Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

\section*{COMMUNICATING GENETICS INFORMATION TO THE PATIENT}

After the family history and physical examination are completed, the genetics team reviews the information gathered before beginning genetic counseling with the patient and family. The genetics specialists meet with the patient and family to discuss their findings. When information from family and medical histories and examination confirms the presence of a genetic condition in a family, the genetics specialist discusses with the patient the natural history of the condition, the pattern of inheritance, and the implications of the genetic condition for reproductive and general health. When appropriate, the genetic specialists discuss and describe relevant testing and management options. The nurse assesses the patient's understanding of the genetic consultation and clarifies information given by the specialists.

\section*{PROVIDING SUPPORT}

The genetics team provides support throughout the counseling session and makes every effort to elicit individual and family concerns. The genetics specialist uses principles of active listening to interpret patient concerns and emotions, seek and provide feedback, and demonstrate understanding of those concerns. When needed, the genetics specialist suggests referral for additional social and emotional support. The genetics specialist discusses pertinent patient and family concerns and needs with the nurse and primary health care team so that they can provide additional support and guidance (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998). The nurse assesses the patient's understanding of the information given during the counseling session, clarifies information, answers questions, assesses the patient's reactions, and identifies supports.

\section*{Providing Follow-Up After Genetic Evaluation}

In follow-up to genetic evaluation and counseling, the genetics specialists prepare a written summary of the evaluation and counseling session and, with the patient's permission, send this summary to the primary health care provider as well as all other providers and participants in the patient's care, as identified by the family. The consultation summary outlines the results of family history and physical and laboratory assessments, provides a discussion of the specific diagnosis (when made), reviews the inheritance and associated risk of recurrence for the patient and family, presents reproductive and general health options, and makes recommendations for further testing and management. The summary is also sent to the patient and a copy is retained in the patient's medical records. The nurse has an important role in reviewing the summary with the patient and family and identifying information, education, and counseling for which follow-up genetic counseling may be useful (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998; Lea \& Williams, 2002; Lea \& Smith, 2002).

Follow-up genetic counseling is always offered to patients and families, as some may need more time to understand and discuss the specifics of a genetic test or diagnosis or wish to review reproductive options again later when pregnancy is being considered. Follow-up genetic counseling is also offered to clients when further evaluation and counseling of extended family members is recommended (Lea, Jenkins \& Francomano, 1998).

As part of follow-up, nurses can educate patients about where to find information about genetics issues. Some resources that
provide the most up-to-date and reliable genetics information are available on the Internet. Several of these are listed at the end of the chapter.

\section*{Ethical Issues}

With recent advances in genetics, nurses must consider their responsibilities in handling genetics information and potential ethical implications such as informed decision-making, privacy and confidentiality of genetics information, and access to and justice in health care. The ethical principles of autonomy, fidelity, and veracity are also important (American Nurses Association, 2001).

Ethical questions relating to genetics occur in various settings and at all levels of nursing practice. At the level of direct patient care, nurses participate in providing genetics information, testing, and gene-based therapeutics. They provide patient care based on the values of self-determination and personal autonomy. The American Nurses Association (2001) states that patients should be as fully involved as possible in the planning and implementation of their own health care; to do so, patients need appropriate, accurate, and complete information given at such a level and in such a form that they and their families can make well-informed personal, medical, and reproductive health decisions. Nurses, as the most accessible health care professionals, are invaluable in the informed consent process. Nurses can help patients clarify values and goals, assess understanding of information, protect the patient's rights, and support their decisions. Nurses can advocate for patient autonomy in health decisions. ISONG's Position Statement "Informed Decision-Making and Consent" (2000) provides support and guidance for nurses who are helping patients who are considering genetic testing.

Nurses need to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of genetics information derived from such sources as the family history, genetic tests, and other genetics-based interventions. Many Americans are increasingly concerned about threats to their personal privacy. Nurses must be aware of the potential ethical issues related to the privacy and confidentiality of genetics information, including conflicts between an individual's privacy versus the family's need for genetics information. ISONG's Position Statement "Privacy and Confidentiality of Genetic Information" (2002) is a useful resource.

An ethical foundation provides nurses with a holistic framework for handling ethical issues with integrity. It also supplies the basis for communicating genetics information to a patient, to a family, to other care providers, to community agencies and organizations, and to society as a whole. In addition, it provides support for nurses facing clinical situations that involve ethical dilemmas. Principle-based ethics offers moral guidelines that nurses can use to justify their nursing practice. The emphasis is on ethical principles of beneficence (to do good) and non-maleficence (to do no harm), as well as autonomy, justice, fidelity, veracity, to help solve ethical dilemmas that may arise in clinical care. Respect for persons is the ethical principle underlying all nursing care. With an ethical foundation that is based on these principles and that incorporates the values of caring, nurses can promote the kind of thoughtful discussions that are useful when patients and families are facing genetics-related health and reproductive decisions and consequences (Scanlon \& Fibison, 1995; ISONG, 2000).

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your patient, age 53, is recovering from a right mastectomy. She underwent a left mastectomy for breast cancer at age 45 . Her daughter, age 31, expresses concern about her own breast cancer risk, telling you that her sister and maternal grandmother have also had breast cancer. What pattern of inheritance is suggested in this family? What genetics information would you provide to this woman?
2. A 48-year-old man is admitted to your medical unit with a new diagnosis of liver cancer. He says he is worried about his children, an 18-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl: "I don't want them to get this, too." Your nursing assessment reveals a past history of arthritis and diabetes and a family history of "iron overload" in the patient's 40-year-old brother. What adult-onset condition does this history suggest? What nursing action would you take?
3. Your patient has three daughters, ages 25,30 , and 32 , and one son, age 22. He also has four sisters, two of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer in their early 40 s and chose to have BRCA gene mutation testing. Both were found to carry a BRCA1 gene mutation. The patient's daughters learn of these results and want to be tested to learn of their status. The patient does not want to be tested and tells the nurse at a routine check-up, "I don't want to have testing. I have a right not to be tested, and I don't want to know if I carry that cancer gene. I care about my daughters, but I am afraid to find out for them." How might you respond to the patient? What would you say if one of the patient's daughters calls you and asks for your help? What are the counseling issues for this daughter that are unique to this situation?

\section*{Chronic Illness}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Define "chronic conditions."
2. Identify factors related to the increasing incidence of chronic conditions.
3. Describe characteristics of chronic conditions and implications for people with chronic conditions and for their families.
4. Describe the phases of chronic conditions.
5. Apply the nursing process to the care of the patient with chronic conditions.

Chronic health problems affect people of all ages-they occur in the very young, the middle-aged, and the very old. Chronic conditions do, however, increase in frequency with age, and elderly people often have multiple chronic disorders (Van den Akker, Buntinx, Metsemakers, Roos \& Knottnerus, 1998). Chronic illnesses are found in all socioeconomic, ethnic, cultural, and racial groups; certain diseases, however, occur more frequently in some groups than in others (Kington \& Smith, 1997). Native Americans between the ages of 45 to 64, for example, have a higher mortality rate from diabetes and cirrhosis than Caucasians in the same age range (Reeves, Remington, Nashold \& Pete, 1997). Being poor and lacking adequate health care coverage decreases the likelihood of receiving preventive screening measures such as mammography, cholesterol testing, and routine check-ups (Hagdrup, Simoes \& Brownson, 1997). Although some chronic conditions have little effect on quality of life, others have a considerable effect because of related disability (Kempen, Ormel, Brilman \& Relyveld, 1997). Certain conditions require advanced technology for survival, as in the late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or end-stage renal disease. Some people with chronic health conditions and disability function independently with only minor inconvenience to their everyday lives; others require frequent and close monitoring or placement in long-term care facilities.

\section*{The Phenomenon of Chronicity}

Although each chronic condition has its own specific physiologic characteristics, chronic conditions do share common qualities. Many chronic conditions, for example, have pain and fatigue as associated symptoms. Some degree of disability is usually present in severe or advanced chronic illness, limiting the patient's participation in activities (Collins, 1997). Many chronic conditions require therapeutic regimens to keep them under control. Unlike the term "acute," which implies a curable and relatively short disease course, chronic describes a long disease course and conditions that may be incurable. It is this characteristic of duration that often makes managing chronic conditions so difficult for those who must live with them.

Psychological and emotional reactions of patients to acute and chronic conditions and changes in their health status are described in detail in Chapter 7. People who develop chronic conditions may react with shock, disbelief, depression, anger, resentment, or a number of other emotions. How people react and cope with chronic conditions is usually similar to how they react to other events in their lives, depending, in part, on their understanding of the condition and their perceptions of its potential impact on their own and their family's lives. Adjustment to chronic illness is affected by various factors:
- Personality before the illness
- Unresolved anger or grief from the past
- Suddenness, extent, and duration of lifestyle changes necessitated by the illness
- Family and individual resources for dealing with stress
- Stages of individual/family life cycle
- Previous experience with illness and crises
- Codependency in family systems (Lewis, 1998)

Psychological, emotional, and cognitive reactions to chronic conditions are likely to occur at the initial onset, but they may also recur if symptoms worsen or recur after a period of remission. Symptoms associated with chronic illnesses are often unpredictable, and some are perceived as crisis events by patients and their families, who must contend with both the uncertainty of chronic illness and the changes it brings to their lives. This chapter describes some of the problems of living with chronic conditions and offers a guide to nursing assessment and intervention when providing care to people with chronic illness.

\section*{DEFINITION OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS}
"Chronic conditions" are defined as medical conditions or health problems with associated symptoms or disabilities that require long-term (3 months or longer) management (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 1996). The condition may be due to illness, genetic factors, or injury. Management of such conditions includes learning to live with symptoms and/or disabilities and coming to terms with identity changes brought about by having a chronic condition. It also consists of carrying out the lifestyle changes and regimens that are designed to keep symptoms under control and to prevent complications. Although some people take on what might be called a "sick role" identity, most people with chronic conditions do not consider themselves to be sick or ill and try to live as normal a life as is possible. Only when complications develop or when symptoms become severe enough to interfere with performance of daily life activities do most people who are chronically ill think of themselves as being sick or disabled (Nijhof, 1998).

\section*{PREVALENCE AND CAUSES OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS}

Chronic conditions occur in people of every age group, socioeconomic level, and culture. In 1995, an estimated 99 million people in the United States had chronic conditions, and it has been projected that by the year 2030 about 150 million people will be affected (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 1996). Table 10-1 shows the projected increase in rates of people with chronic conditions by year, along with an estimate of the costs to be incurred in managing those conditions.

Not every chronic condition is disabling; some cause only minor inconveniences. Many, however, are severe enough to cause major activity limitations. Figures $10-1$ and $10-2$ present overviews of the projected number of people in millions with ac-

FIGURE 10-1 Projected number of persons by degree of activity limitation due to chronic condition, selected years, 1995-2050. The number of people who will be unable to go to school, to work, or to live independently because of a chronic condition is projected to reach 20 million by 2050.

tivity limitations and the five most disabling chronic conditions. Activity limitations are not limited to adults: an estimated $6.5 \%$ of all U.S. children experience some degree of disability. The most common disabling conditions in children are respiratory diseases and mental impairment (Newacheck \& Halfon, 1998). People with activity limitations need assistance with their activities of daily living. Figure 10-3 indicates what happens to people with activity limitations whose needs for health care and personal services are not met for various reasons. They may be unable to carry out their therapeutic regimens as prescribed or have their prescriptions filled on time; they may miss physicians' appointments and office visits; and they may be unable to carry out the activities of daily living (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
1996). These figures provide an overview of the scope of the problem and are useful in planning health promotion and education programs as well as in allocating resources and services.

Chronic conditions have become the major cause of healthrelated problems in developed countries, and even developing countries are experiencing an increase in chronic conditions, giving these countries the dual burden of trying to eradicate infectious diseases while learning to manage chronic conditions (Kickbusch, 1997). Some of the reasons that so many people are afflicted with chronic conditions include the following:
- A decrease in mortality from infectious diseases, such as smallpox, diphtheria, and other serious conditions

FIGURE 10-3 The consequences of unmet needs for help, by age group. With permission from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. (1996). Chronic care in America: A 21st century challenge. Princeton, NJ: Author.
- Longer life spans because of advances in technology and pharmacology, improved nutrition, safer working conditions, and greater access (for some people) to health care
- Improved screening and diagnostic procedures, enabling early detection and treatment of diseases
- Prompt and aggressive management of acute conditions, such as myocardial infarction and AIDS-related infections
- The tendency to develop single or multiple chronic illnesses with advancing age
- Modern lifestyle factors, such as smoking, chronic stress, and obesity, that increase the risk for chronic illnesses, such as pulmonary disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease

A major problem of chronic conditions is that physiologic changes in the body commonly occur before symptomatic manifestations of disease, as in the case of hypertension (Sadowski \& Redeker, 1996). Greater emphasis has recently been placed on the adoption of healthy lifestyles, beginning in childhood. Despite the media attention on the benefits of maintaining healthy lifestyles, many Americans are overweight, smoke, and lead sedentary lives. Consequences of unhealthy lifestyles include an alarming increase in the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiac and chronic respiratory disorders (Juarbe, 1998; Wing, Goldstein, Acton et al., 2001).

\section*{The Characteristics of Chronic Conditions}

Sometimes it is difficult for those who are disease-free to understand how lives are changed, often forever, because of chronic conditions. It is also easy for health professionals to focus on treating the illness while overlooking the person who has the disease (Hellstrom, Lindqvist \& Mattsson, 1998). In all illnesses, but even more so with chronic conditions, the illness cannot be separated from the person (Soderberg, Lundman \& Norberg, 1999). Chronic illness is something that people must contend with on a daily basis. Nurses are unable to relate to what people are facing or plan effective interventions unless they fully understand what it means to have a chronic illness (Carroll, 1998;

Koch, Kralik \& Taylor, 2000; Lubkin, 1997). Characteristic effects of chronic illness follow:
1. Managing chronic illness involves more than managing medical problems. Associated psychological and social problems must also be addressed since living for long periods of time with illness symptoms and disability can threaten identity, bring about role changes, alter body image, and disrupt lifestyles (Dean, 1999). This means that continuous adaptation and accommodation are called for, depending upon age and situation in life (Price, 1996; Sidell, 1997). Each major change or decrease in functional ability requires further physical, emotional, and social adaptation for patients and their families (Carroll, 1998; Lewis, 1998; Miller, 1999; Tappan, Williams, Fishman \& Theris, 1999).
2. Chronic conditions usually involve many different phases over the course of a person's lifetime. There can be acute periods, stable and unstable periods, flare-ups, and remissions. Each phase brings its own set of physical, psychological, and social problems, and each requires different regimens and types of management (Corbin \& Strauss, 1991).
3. Keeping chronic conditions under control requires persistent adherence to therapeutic regimens. Failing to adhere to a treatment plan or to follow a regimen in a consistent manner increases the risks of developing complications and accelerating the disease process. However, the realities of daily life, including the impact of culture, values, and socioeconomic factors, affect the degree to which people adhere to a treatment regimen. Managing a chronic illness takes time, requires knowledge and planning (Baker, 1998), and can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. It is not unusual for patients to discontinue taking medications or to alter dosages because of side effects that are more disturbing or disruptive than illness symptoms. People also frequently cut back on regimens they consider overly time-consuming, fatiguing, or costly (Davis \& Magilvy, 2000; Wichowski \& Kubsch, 1997).
4. One chronic disease can lead to the development of other chronic conditions. Diabetes, for example, can eventually lead to neurological and vascular changes that may result in vision, cardiac, and kidney disease and erectile dysfunction (Warren-Boulton, Greenberg, Lising \& Gallivan, 1999).
5. Chronic illness affects the whole family. Family life can be dramatically altered as a result of role reversals (SaikiCraighill, 1997), unfilled roles, loss of income, time spent managing illness, decreases in family socialization activities, and the costs of treatment (Dokken \& Sydnor-Greenberg, 1998). Stress and caretaker fatigue are common with severe chronic conditions, and the whole family rather than just the individual needs care (Canam \& Acorn, 1999; Fisher \& Weiks, 2000).
6. The major responsibility for the day-to-day management of illness falls upon the shoulders of chronically ill people and their families. In today's health care system, especially with chronic conditions, day-to-day management, or self-care, has increasingly become a major part of the role of the patient or family. The home, rather than the hospital, is the center of care in chronic conditions since this is where day-to-day management occurs. Hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices, nursing homes, nursing centers, and community agencies (visiting nurse services, social services, and disease-specific associations and societies) are adjuncts or back-up services to that daily home management.
7. The management of chronic conditions is a process of discovery. People can be taught how to manage their conditions. Teaching about symptoms, however, is not the same as experiencing them. Each person must discover how his or her own body reacts under varying conditions-for example, what it is like to be hypoglycemic, what activities are likely to bring on angina, and how these or other conditions can best be prevented and managed.
8. Managing chronic conditions is a collaborative process. The medical, social, and psychological problems associated with chronic problems tend to be complex, especially in severe conditions. The management of chronic conditions should therefore be thought of as a collaborative process that involves many different health care professionals working together with patients and their families to provide the full range of services that are often needed to manage at home (Corbin \& Cherry, 1997).
9. The management of chronic conditions is expensive. As indicated in Table 10-1, billions of dollars are spent every year on health care for people with chronic conditions. The money pays for hospitalizations and the purchase of equipment, medications, and supportive services. For example, hospital lengths of stay and charges are higher for acute pediatric conditions if a child also has a chronic condition (Hodgson \& Cohen, 1999; Silber, Gleeson \& Zhao, 1999). Overall health care costs are not likely to decrease until there is a substantial downward trend in the incidence of chronic conditions and the costs of chronic health care.
10. Chronic conditions raise difficult ethical issues for the patient, health care professionals, and society. No easy solutions exist to problems such as how to establish cost controls, how to allocate scarce resources (eg, kidneys and hearts for transplantation), how to determine what con-
stitutes quality of life, and when to terminate life support. Patients, families, and society respond to ethical issues according to their own moral standards and definitions of quality of life.
11. Living with chronic illness means living with uncertainty (Mishel, 1999; Price, 1996). Although health care professionals have some notion about the usual progression of a chronic disease such as Parkinson's disease, so many specific variables enter into each case that no one can predict with certainty an individual's illness course (that is, how the person will respond to treatment and how quickly or even whether a disease will progress). Even when a patient is "in remission" or "disease-free," he or she experiences a lingering doubt and dread that the illness will reactivate (Smeltzer, 1992; Wiener \& Dodd, 1993).

\section*{THE PROBLEMS OF MANAGING CHRONIC CONDITIONS}

Chronic conditions have implications for everyday living and management problems for individuals and their families as well as for society at large. Most importantly, individual efforts should be directed at preventing chronic conditions since many chronic conditions can be traced, at least in part, to unhealthy lifestyles or behaviors such as smoking and overeating. Thus, changes in lifestyle can result in the prevention of some chronic conditions, or at least a delay in their onset until a later age. Because of the tendency of some people to resist change, however, bringing about alterations in people's lifestyles is one the major challenges facing nurses today.

Once a chronic condition has occurred, the focus shifts from disease prevention to managing symptoms and staying well by avoiding complications (eg, eye problems in the diabetic) and the development of other acute illnesses (eg, pneumonia in a person with chronic obstructive lung disease). Quality of life, often overlooked by health professionals in their approach to care of people with chronic conditions, is also important. Health-promoting behaviors, such as exercise, are essential to quality of life even in people who have chronic illnesses and disabilities because they help to maintain functional status (Stuifbergen \& Rogers, 1997). See Nursing Research Profile 10-1 for more information.

Although coworkers, extended family, and health care professionals are affected by the problems of people with chronic illnesses, the problems of living with chronic conditions are most acutely experienced by patients and their immediate families. It is they who feel the greatest impact with lifestyle changes that directly affect quality of life. Nurses provide direct care, especially during acute episodes, but they also provide the teaching and secure the resources and other supports that enable people to integrate their illness into their lives and have some quality of life despite their illness (Michael, 1996). To understand what nursing care is needed, it is important to comprehend the issues that people with chronic illness and their families contend with and manage, often on a daily basis. The challenges of living with chronic conditions can be summarized as follows:
- Alleviating and managing symptoms
- Psychologically adjusting to and physically accommodating disabilities
- Preventing and managing crises and complications
- Carrying out regimens as prescribed
- Validating individual self-worth and family functioning

Martin, J. C., Engle, V. F., \& Graney, M. J. (1999). Determinants of health-related hardiness among urban older African-American women with chronic illness. Holistic Nursing Practice, 13(3), 62-70.

\section*{Purpose}

Although statistics demonstrated that older African American women experience earlier, more frequent, and more severe limitations from chronic illnesses than any other older adult group, African American women who live beyond the age of 85 usually live longer than their Anglo-American counterparts. Health-related hardiness (HRH), defined as a set of personality characteristics that buffer negative stressful effects associated with living with chronic illness, has been suggested as one factor that contributes to these statistics. The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify the relationship between HRH and function, self-assessed health, morbidity, and health behaviors in urban, older African American women with chronic illness.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A correlational design was used to obtain data about demographic characteristics and the variables of interest among chronically ill older African American women. Questionnaires and structured interviews were used to obtain the data from women during routine appointments at the outpatient clinic of a large urban hospital. Instruments included the Health-Related Hardiness Scale (HRHS), Self-Assess Health (SAH) instrument, Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), and Health Habits Scale. Demographic data obtained included age, education, and marital status of the women.

\section*{Findings}

The mean age of the sample of 100 women was $68.8 \pm 8.6$ years. They had a mean of four medical diagnoses and five prescribed daily medications. Hypertension and osteoarthritis were the most common chronic illnesses reported; they occurred in $90 \%$ and $74 \%$ of the women, respectively. Analysis of data revealed that the women had high levels of HRH, little functional impairment, moderate ratings of the state of their own health, multiple chronic illnesses and use of multiple daily medications, and frequent participation in health behaviors. Significant correlations were found between HRH and years of education and HRH and SIP, which measures the impact of illness on function and performance of activities of daily living. Upon analysis by stepwise multiple linear regression, HRH was best predicted by years of education and function as measured by the SIP.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings of this study (ie, high levels of HRH, little impairment in function, average levels of self-assessed health, and frequent practice of health behaviors) support the existence of hardiness in older African American women. These findings increase understanding of hardiness as an important variable related to health. Further research is needed to identify factors that will facilitate health promotion and health protection among this group of women.
- Managing threats to identity
- Normalizing individual and family life as much as possible
- Living with altered time, social isolation, and loneliness
- Establishing the networks of support and resources that can enhance quality of life
- Returning to a satisfactory way of life after an acute debilitating episode (another myocardial infarction or stroke) or reactivation of a chronic condition
- Dying with dignity and comfort

\section*{IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING}

Working with people with chronic illness or disability requires not just dealing with the medical aspects of their disorder, but also working with the whole person, physically, emotionally, and socially (Dean, 1999). This holistic approach to care requires nurses to draw upon their entire repertoire of knowledge and skills, including knowledge from the social sciences, psychology in particular. People often respond to illness, health teaching, and regimens in ways that are different from the expectations of health care providers. Although quality of life is usually affected by chronic illness, especially if the illness is severe (Schlenk, Erlen, Dunbar-Jacob et al., 1998), patients' perceptions of what constitutes quality of life often drive their management behaviors. Nurses and other health care professionals need to recognize this, even though it may be difficult to see patients make unwise choices and decisions about lifestyles and disease management. Individuals have the right to receive care without fearing ridicule or refusal of treatment, even if they caused their medical conditions through their own indiscretions, such as smoking or failure to follow therapeutic regimens.

As stated previously, chronic conditions have a course, although that course might be too uncertain to predict with any degree of accuracy. An illness course can be thought of as a trajectorya course-that can be managed or shaped over time to some extent through proper illness management strategies (Robinson, Bevil, Arcangelo et al., 2001; Strauss \& Corbin, 1988; Woog, 1992). The trajectory of an illness can also be divided into phases that enable more precise thinking about a person's condition. This enables the nurse to put the present situation into the context of what might have happened to the patient in the past-that is, the life factors and understandings that might have contributed to the present state of the illness. In this way, nurses can more readily address the underlying issues and problems.

Each phase of chronic illness brings with it different problems, both medical and psychosocial. The needs of a stroke patient who is a good candidate for rehabilitation, for example, are very different from those of a patient with terminal cancer. By thinking in terms of phases, and individual patients within a phase, nurses can target their care more specifically to each person. Not every chronic condition is necessarily life-threatening, and not every patient passes through each possible phase of a chronic condition.

\section*{PHASES OF CHRONIC ILLNESS}

Over the years, chronic conditions can pass through several different phases (Corbin \& Cherry, 1997; Strauss \& Corbin, 1988). Nine phases have been identified (Chart 10-1):
1. The pretrajectory phase describes the stage at which the person is at risk for developing a chronic condition because of genetic factors or lifestyle behaviors that increase susceptibility to chronic illness.
2. The trajectory phase is characterized by the onset of symptoms or disability associated with a chronic condition. Since symptoms are being evaluated and diagnostic tests are performed, this phase is often accompanied by uncertainty as the person awaits a diagnosis. Nursing care often involves preparing patients for diagnostic tests and offering emotional support.
3. The stable phase of the trajectory indicates that symptoms and disability are being managed adequately. Although the patient is doing well, nursing care is still important at this time to reinforce positive behaviors and to offer ongoing monitoring.
4. The unstable phase is characterized by an exacerbation of illness symptoms, development of complications, or reactivation of an illness in remission. During this phase, a person's everyday activities may be temporarily disrupted because symptoms are not well controlled. There may also be more diagnostic tests and a trial of new regimens until some degree of control over symptoms is achieved. During this time of uncertainty, patients look to nurses for guidance and support.
5. The acute phase is characterized by sudden onset of severe or unrelieved symptoms or complications that require hospitalization for their management. This phase may require major modification of the person's usual activities for a period of time. Nurses are intensely involved in the care of the chronically ill patient during this period, providing direct care and emotional support to the patient and family members.
6. The crisis phase is characterized by a critical or life-threatening situation that requires emergency treatment or care. During this phase patients and their families depend upon the skill, knowledge, and support of nurses and other professionals to stabilize their conditions.
7. The comeback phase is the period in the trajectory marked by recovery after an acute period. It includes learning to live with or to overcome disabilities and a return to
an acceptable way of life within the limitations imposed by the chronic condition. Although aspects of care may shift to other health care providers during the rehabilitative phase, the role of nurses as organizers of care and collaborators in the recovery of patients is essential.
8. The downward phase marks the worsening of a condition. Symptoms and disability continue to progress despite attempts to gain some control through treatment and management regimens. A downward turn does not necessarily mean imminent death; the downward trend can be arrested and an illness restabilized. Since patients are not yet acute or dying but usually are living at home during this time, their contact with nurses is often limited. The supportive presence of nurses is needed, however, because of adjustment issues. Nurses working in clinics and physicians' offices can play an important role in helping patients understand and come to terms with what is happening to them.
9. The dying phase is characterized by the gradual or rapid decline in the trajectory despite efforts to halt the disorder or slow the decline through illness management; it is characterized by failure of life-maintaining body functions. During this phase nurses provide direct and supportive care to patients and their families through hospice programs.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of patients with chronic conditions is varied and occurs in an assortment of settings. It can include provision of direct care or supportive care. Such care is often provided in the clinic or physician's office, the hospital, or the patient's home, depending on the status of the illness.

Examples of direct care may include assessing the patient's physical status, providing wound care, managing and overseeing medication regimens, and performing other technical tasks. The availability of this type of nursing care is one of the main reasons patients can remain at home and return to a somewhat normal life after an acute episode of illness.

Because much of the day-to-day responsibility for managing chronic conditions rests with the patient and family, nurses often provide supportive care unless the patient is hospitalized. Supportive care may include ongoing monitoring, teaching, counseling, serving as an advocate for the patient, making referrals, and case-managing. Providing supportive care is just as important as the performance of technical care. For example, through ongoing monitoring that might take place either in the home or a nursing clinic, such as a heart failure clinic, a nurse might detect impending complications, such as signs of heart failure. The nurse might detect these signs before they are noticeable to the patient and could make a referral (call the physician or consult the medical protocol in a clinic) for medical evaluation, thereby preventing a lengthy and costly hospitalization.

\section*{CARE BY PHASE: APPLYING THE NURSING PROCESS}

The focus of care for patients with chronic conditions is determined largely by illness phase and directed by the nursing process, which includes assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation.

\section*{Step 1: Identifying the Trajectory Phase}

The first step is assessment of the patient to determine the specific phase (see Chart 10-1). Assessment enables the nurse to identify the specific medical, social, and psychological problems likely to be encountered in a phase. For instance, the problems of a patient having an acute myocardial infarction are very different from those likely to be encountered with the same patient, 10 years later, dying at home of heart failure. The kinds of direct care, referrals, teaching, and emotional support needed in each situation are different as well.

\section*{Step 2: Establishing Goals}

Once the phase of illness has been identified for a specific patient, along with the specific medical problems and related social and psychological issues, the next step involves establishing the goals of care. The establishment of goals should be a collaborative effort with the patient, family, and nurse working together, for the attainment of a goal is unlikely if it is primarily the nurse's and not the patient's. The following are two examples of goals to be determined collaboratively, then written in the language of the nursing process.

An elderly man with severe progressive COPD reports increasing difficulty breathing, even with the oxygen level set at 2 liters $/ \mathrm{min}$. This interferes with his ability to carry out activities of daily living and has decreased his quality of life. He asks the nurse for help. The nursing diagnosis for this problem might be "Activity intolerance related to less than adequate intake of oxygen secondary to lung disease," and the mutually agreed upon goal of care might be to increase the patient's ability to care for himself. Nursing interventions related to this goal might include teaching the client how to pace his activities and helping him to obtain a home health aide to assist with the most demanding activities of daily living.

In another example, a 45-year-old woman with moderately advanced multiple sclerosis (MS) is hospitalized with a severe bladder infection. She reports that she has problems with selfcatheterization because of her disability and that she has difficulty obtaining and consuming adequate fluids during the day. The nursing diagnosis for this problem might be "Toileting self-care deficit (in bladder care) related to decreased functional ability secondary to MS," and the mutual outcomes of care might be to develop strategies to facilitate the self-catheterization process and increase daily fluid intake.

\section*{Step 3: Establishing a Plan to Achieve Desired Outcomes}

Once goals have been established, the next step consists of establishing a realistic and mutually agreed upon plan for achieving them and identifying specific criteria that can be used to assess the patient's progress. A plan of care for the man with COPD who complains of a decreased ability to care for himself, for example, might include assisting him to prioritize his activities of daily living so he can carry out those that are most important to him before he becomes too short of breath and tired. It might also include exploring how he feels about having someone assist him at home on a regular basis and, if he agrees to having help, checking on the availability and costs of such services. In many cases, people with chronic illness perceive someone helping them as a
threat to their independence and self-esteem, the first step to a nursing home or rehabilitation center. Therefore, they are resistant to someone coming into their home to help them. Criteria to measure progress toward goal attainment and strategies to accomplish the goals might include the following:
- At the end of the first nurse-patient session, the patient with COPD will be able to prioritize activities of daily living and agree to look over an information sheet and list of home care agencies provided by the nurse.
- By the second nurse-patient session, the patient will report that he is pacing his activities and is therefore better able to carry out important self-care activities. He will also report that he has read the information provided by the nurse about home care agencies.
- By the third nurse-patient session, the patient will have compiled a list of the self-care activities that are difficult for him to carry out and for which assistance would be beneficial. The patient will also have reviewed his finances and determined how much he can afford to pay for services.
- By the fourth nurse-patient session, the patient will have called a home care agency and made arrangements to have home health services for 2 hours each morning. If the patient cannot make the arrangements, then the nurse would suggest that the family or someone else make them. The goal is to enable the patient to meet basic self-care needs and improve quality of life, thereby having enough time and energy available for other activities. Home health services can help with this. Having the patient make the arrangements for home care promotes a sense of control. People with chronic illness-related disabilities often feel that they have lost a great deal of control over what happens to them; any activities that they can do for themselves, therefore, enhance psychological well being.
- By the fifth home visit the patient will report that all selfcare needs are met either by self-pacing of activities or through the assistance of a home health aide.

A plan of care for the woman with MS might be to develop techniques for carrying out self-catheterization within the limitations imposed by her disability and to increase her daily fluid intake to six to eight $8-\mathrm{oz}$ glasses of fluid per day. Indicators that the desired goal has been achieved may include the following:
- By the end of the first nurse-patient session, the patient and nurse will identify with which steps in the self-catheterization procedure the patient is having the most difficulty. The patient will also be able to list three strategies for improving her intake of fluids.
- By the end of the second nurse-patient session, the patient will report that she is performing self-catheterization using the strategies suggested by the nurse for improving her technique. She will also report that she has increased her fluid intake by three glasses.
- By the end of the third nurse-patient session, the patient will report that she can perform self-catheterization three out of four times without difficulty and that her fluid intake is now up to six to eight $8-\mathrm{oz}$ glasses a day.
- By the end of the fourth nurse-patient session, the patient will be ready for discharge with the confidence that she is competent in performing self-catheterization and obtaining adequate fluid intake despite the physical limitations imposed by her illness.

\section*{Step 4: Identifying Factors That Facilitate or Hinder Attainment of Goals}

The next step involves identifying environmental, social, and psychological factors that might interfere with or facilitate achieving the goal. In the case of the patient with COPD, for example, not having sufficient resources could prevent him from hiring a home health aide. For this reason, the nurse might want to explore carefully the issue of resources with the patient and, if there are financial constraints, enlist the services of a social worker, with the patient's consent, to explore possible community resources. Since the patient is having trouble breathing, the nurse should determine whether the patient is also having difficulty cooking and eating, and whether he is losing weight because of insufficient caloric intake to meet his nutritional needs. If cooking is a problem, then the nurse might look into community resources such as Meals on Wheels. If the patient is losing weight, then the nurse should advise him to eat frequent small meals to lessen the fatigue associated with eating and to supplement meals with high-protein drinks.

In the case of the patient with MS, the nurse might want to explore the extent of the patient's physical limitations, how rapidly the MS seems to be progressing, when during the day she has the most difficulty doing the catheterization, and whether that difficulty might be related to fatigue. If fatigue is a factor, the nurse might explore whether the patient would consider having a home health aide to help her with some of her self-care activities. This would enable the patient to conserve her energy for social activities and personal care, such as self-catheterization. The nurse would also discuss with the patient why she is not taking in an adequate amount of fluids. If the patient is too busy or tired to make frequent trips to the sink or refrigerator to get fluids, the nurse might help the patient develop strategies for saving time and energy. For example, the patient could attach a bottle of water to her wheelchair or walker and carry it around with her, or strategically place bottles of water or other liquids around the house to increase their accessibility. The nurse might also explore with the patient the types of caffeine-free fluids that she enjoys drinking.

\section*{Step 5: Implementing Interventions}

The fifth step is the intervention phase. Possible interventions include providing direct care, serving as an advocate for the patient, teaching, counseling, making referrals, and case-managing (arranging for resources). For example, if the patient with COPD reports after prioritizing his activities of daily living that showering each morning is the most important self-care activity for him, then having a home health aide come early in the morning to help with the shower would be the best arrangement. The home health aide could also help with breakfast, make the bed, and straighten up the house. In this way, the man would use less energy doing these mundane tasks. After showering and dressing the patient might also want to plan a daily rest period, such as sitting down with a crossword puzzle or reading, that might help him overcome some of his sense of breathlessness and feel more rested.

If spasms or tremors are interfering with the ability of the woman with MS to catheterize herself, then the nurse would want to review the medications she is taking; if, for instance, she is taking antispasmodics, the self-catheterizations could be timed to coincide with the peak medication levels. In an effort to encourage an increased fluid intake, the nurse might want to help the woman build into her daily routine a set time in the morning and
afternoon, allowing for flexibility, to take an herbal tea or juice break that would increase the amount of fluids ingested and also provide a rest period. While it is important for a patient with MS to maintain a sense of independence and accomplishment, it is equally important for the patient to learn to recognize his or her limits, through such signs as fatigue, and to manage them through proper planning.

Physicians prescribe therapies, such as medications and diet, and give directions for how much, when, and how they are to be used. Nurses, however, by virtue of their broad knowledge base, can best help patients develop the strategies needed to live with both the symptoms and therapies associated with chronic conditions. Because each patient is an individual, it is important to work individually with each patient and family to identify the best ways to integrate their treatment regimens into their daily living activities. Two tasks are important in managing chronic illness: following regimens to control symptoms and keep the illness stable, and dealing with the psychosocial issues that can hinder illness management and affect quality of life.

Diagnosing and prescribing by physicians are important aspects of chronic illness care, but they represent only half of the battle against disease. The other half includes the teaching, counseling, arranging, and case-managing that enable people to live with their disease and gain independence (Hughes, Hodgson, Muller et al., 2000). Saving the life of a patient with an acute myocardial infarction in the ICU, for example, is a positive outcome, but the patient will have a relapse if he or she is not supported in making the lifestyle changes necessary to reduce the probability of another heart attack. Helping patients and their families to understand and implement regimens and to carry out activities of daily living within the limits of their disabilities is one of the most important aspects of health care delivery-and nursing care-for patients with chronic illnesses and their families.

\section*{Step 6: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Interventions}

The final step is evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions. In chronic illness, maintaining the stability of the condition while at the same time preserving the patient's control over his or her life and a sense of identity and accomplishment is the primary goal. Success may be defined, however, as merely making progress toward a goal when a patient finds it difficult to implement rapid and drastic changes in the way that he or she does things. Nurses cannot expect that the sedentary person with high blood pressure, for example, is going to develop a sudden passion for exercise. Nor can they expect that working people can easily rearrange their day to accommodate time-consuming regimens such as special diets or complex medication schedules. Bringing about change takes time, patience, creativity, and encouragement from the nurse. Validation by the nurse for each small increment toward goal accomplishment is important for enhancing selfesteem and reinforcing behaviors. If no progress is made or if progress toward goals seems too slow, it may be necessary to redefine the goals or the time frame. The patient may not be ready to progress toward the goals or may be ambivalent about the illness, its treatments, or both (Chin, Polonsky, Thomas \& Nerney, 2000). Other conditions such as depression may also interfere with the patient's ability to carry out regimens and make lifestyle changes.

Nurses must also realize that some people will not change. Some people, for example, are unwilling to give up smoking despite advanced COPD. Nor is it unusual to find people with the
diagnosis of diabetes failing to adhere completely to their diabetic diets. When patients are having difficulty carrying out regimens or are reluctant to change their lifestyles, nurses should not feel that this is a failure on their part. Patients share responsibility for management of their conditions, and outcomes are as much related to their ability to accommodate the illness and carry out regimens as they are to nursing intervention.

\section*{Promoting Home and Community-Based Care}

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

Since chronic conditions are so costly to individuals, families, and society, one of the major goals of nursing in the 21st century should be the prevention of chronic conditions and the care of people with them. This requires promoting healthy lifestyles and encouraging the use of safety and disease-prevention measures, such as wearing seat belts and obtaining immunizations. Prevention should also begin early in life and continue throughout the life span.

Patient and family teaching is one of the most significant aspects of nursing care and may make the difference in the ability of patients and their families to adapt to chronic health conditions. Well-informed, educated patients are more likely than uninformed patients to be concerned about their health and do what is necessary to maintain it (De Ridder, Depla, Severens \& Malsch, 1997). They are also more likely to manage symptoms, recognize the onset of complications, and seek health care early: knowledge is the key to making informed choices and decisions during all phases of the chronic illness trajectory.

Despite the importance of teaching the patient and family, the nurse must recognize that patients recently diagnosed with serious chronic conditions and their families may need time to grasp the significance of their condition and its effect on their life. Teaching should be planned carefully so that it provides information that is important to the patient's well-being at the time without being overwhelming.

The nurse who cares for patients with chronic conditions in the hospital, clinic, or home should assess each patient's knowledge about the illness and its management; the nurse cannot assume that a patient with a long-standing chronic condition has the knowledge necessary to manage the condition. A patient's learning needs change as the trajectory phase and his or her personal situation changes. The nurse must also recognize that patients may know how their body responds under certain conditions and how best to manage their symptoms (Gallo \& Knafl, 1998). Contact with patients in the hospital, clinic, or home offers nurses the ideal opportunity to reassess patients' learning needs and to provide additional information about an illness and its management.

\section*{CONTINUING CARE}

Chronic illness management is a collaborative process between patient, family, nurse, and other health care professionals. Collaboration is not limited to hospital settings; rather, it is important in all settings and throughout the illness trajectory (Corbin \& Cherry, 2001). Keeping an illness stable over time requires careful and continued monitoring of symptoms and attention to management regimens. Detecting problems early and assisting patients to develop appropriate management strategies can make a significant difference in outcomes.

Most chronic conditions are managed in the home. Therefore, care and teaching during hospitalization should focus on what the
patient needs to know about the condition in order to manage once discharged to home. Nurses in all settings should be aware of the resources and services available in a community and should make the arrangements (before hospital discharge if the patient is hospitalized) necessary to secure those resources and services. When appropriate, home care services are contacted directly. The home care nurse will reassess how the patient and family are adapting to the chronic condition and its treatment and will continue or revise the plan of care accordingly.

Because chronic conditions occur worldwide and the world is increasingly interconnected, nurses should think beyond the individual level to the community and global levels. In terms of illness prevention and health promotion, this entails wide-ranging efforts to assess people for risk factors for chronic illness (eg, blood pressure and diabetes screening, stroke risk assessments) and group teaching related to illness prevention and management.

The nurse should also remind the patient with a chronic illness, and the patient's family, about the need for ongoing health promotion and the screening recommended for all people, as the chronic illness and disability often become the priority to the exclusion of other health-related issues.

\section*{NURSING CARE FOR SPECIAL POPULATIONS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS}

When providing care and teaching, the nurse must consider a variety of factors (eg, age, gender, culture, and ethnicity) that influence susceptibility to chronic illness and the ways patients respond to chronic disorders. Certain populations, for example, tend to be more susceptible to certain chronic conditions. Populations at high risk for specific conditions can be targeted for special teaching and monitoring programs. People of different cultures and genders tend to respond to illness differently; being aware of these differences is extremely important (Bates, RankinHill \& Sanchez-Ayendez, 1997; Becker, Beyene, Newsom \& Rodgers, 1998; Thorne, McCormick \& Carty, 1997). For cultures in which patients rely heavily on the support of their families, families must be involved and made part of the nursing care plan. As the United States becomes more multicultural and ethnically diverse, and as the general population ages, nurses need to be aware of how an individual's culture and age facilitate or hinder chronic illness management, and nurses should be prepared to adapt the care they give accordingly (Becker, Beyene, Newsom \& Rogers, 1998; Jennings, 1999; Rehm, 1999).

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 25-year-old graduate student is diagnosed with fibromyalgia after several years of visiting physicians and being told that her symptoms were "all in your mind." Due to chronic fatigue and pain, she often missed days from school and eventually withdrew from school. Her husband is not very supportive because he too thinks the disease is "in her head." How would you help this woman learn to cope with her condition and the damages to her self-esteem? How would you involve her husband in the process?
2. A 19-year-old has been recently diagnosed with diabetes. He is very active in sports and involved with his peers. He says that he is not interested in learning about his condition,
refuses to learn to give insulin injections to himself, and eats whatever he wants. How would you approach goal setting and establishing a plan of care with this young adult? What developmental issues will you consider in your teaching?
3. An 85 -year-old woman is about to be discharged from the hospital after an acute episode of heart failure. How would the teaching and planning for discharge be different from that of a 45-year-old going home after an acute myocardial infarction?
4. A 43-year-old Native American woman tells you that she is always thirsty and has frequent yeast infections. She also tells you that she has not had a Pap smear or any kind of physical examination since her last child was born 8 years ago because she does not have health insurance and lacks the money to pay for office visits. What would you tell this woman? How would you advise her to find the resources to obtain health care?
5. A 45-year-old African American woman with multiple sclerosis in remission has been advised by her doctor to start a regular exercise program. She asks why she should do exercise since eventually her disease is only going to get worse anyway. She works and has three teenage children at home. How would you explain to her the relationship between health-promotion activities and quality of life? How might you go about establishing with her an exercise plan? How might her family become involved in helping her?

Rehabilitation is a dynamic, health-oriented process that assists an ill person or a person with disability (restriction in performance or function in everyday activities) to achieve the greatest possible level of physical, mental, spiritual, social, and economic functioning. The rehabilitation process helps the patient achieve an acceptable quality of life with dignity, self-respect, and independence and is designed for people with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. During rehabilitation-sometimes called habilitation-the patient adjusts to the disability by learning how to use resources and to focus on existing abilities. In habilitation, abilities, not disabilities, are emphasized.

Rehabilitation is an integral part of nursing because every major illness or injury carries the threat of disability or impairment, which involves a loss of function or an abnormality. The principles of rehabilitation are basic to the care of all patients, and rehabilitation efforts should begin during the initial contact with a patient. The goal of rehabilitation is to restore the patient's ability to function independently or at a preillness or preinjury level of functioning as quickly as possible. If this is not possible, the aims of rehabilitation are maximal independence and a quality of life acceptable to the patient. Realistic goals based on individual patient assessment are established with the patient to guide the rehabilitation program.

Rehabilitation services are required by more people than ever before because of advances in technology that save or prolong the lives of seriously ill, injured, and disabled patients. Increasing numbers of patients who are recovering from serious illnesses or injuries are returning to their homes and communities with ongoing needs. Every patient, regardless of age, gender, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, or diagnosis, has a right to rehabilitation services (Chart 11-1).

Approximately 1 in 5 Americans has some form of disability, and 1 in 10 has a severe disability (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997). A person is considered to have a disability, such as a restriction in performance or function in everyday activities, if he or she has difficulty talking, hearing, seeing, walking, climbing stairs, lifting or carrying objects, performing activities of daily living, doing school work, or working at a job. A severe disability is present if a person is unable to perform one or more activities, uses an assistive device for mobility, or needs help from another person to accomplish basic activities. Individuals are also considered severely disabled if they receive federal benefits based on an inability to work.

Approximately 54 million Americans are affected by some form of disability, and this number is expected to increase in the coming decades due to the aging of the population. More than half of

\section*{Are All Persons Entitled to Rehabilitation?}

\section*{Situation}

You work in an area where many illegal aliens and uninsured residents live. Community violence often creates life-threatening and disabling conditions in members of the population. After a victim of violence has been saved and stabilized, the health care team identifies rehabilitation needs. You are concerned about your patient's inability to perform self-care and to demonstrate safe mobility skills.

\section*{Dilemma}

As a health care provider, you are concerned about the community as a whole; costs to the community, and the values of the community. You are also aware of client fiduciary responsibility; you recognize costs to your patient when treatment is provided or not provided.

\section*{Discussion}

Who determines the length of stay and level of care? Who will take care of patients who need rehabilitation but who are unable to pay? Is rehabilitation a basic health care need?
persons with disability are women, and females with disability outnumber males in all age groups except for those 15 to 24 years old (Jans \& Stoddard, 1999). One-third of women 75 years of age and older need personal assistance. Currently, more than 10 million people need personal assistance with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), which include bathing, dressing, feeding, and toileting, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which include grocery shopping, meal preparation, housekeeping, transportation, and managing finances. About 5 million persons use a cane, more than 2 million use a wheelchair, and at least 1 million use crutches or a walker. Use of these devices and other types of assistive technology has increased dramatically due to the aging of the population, technological advances, public policy initiatives, and changes in the delivery and financing of health care (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997).

\section*{Americans With Disabilities Act}

Among all people age 21 to 64 (the prime employable years), approximately $33 \%$ of individuals with a severe disability and $77 \%$ of those with a nonsevere disability are employed, compared with
activities of daily living (ADLs): Self-care activities including bathing, grooming, dressing, eating, toileting, and bowel and bladder care.
assistive technology: Any item, piece of equipment, or product system-whether acquired commercially, off the shelf, modified, or customized - that is used to improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.
disability: Restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in a normal manner; the consequences of impairment in terms of an
individual's functional performance and activity. Disabilities represent disturbances at the level of the person (eg, bathing, dressing, communication, walking, grooming).
habilitation: Making able; learning new skills and abilities to meet maximum potential.
impairment: Loss or abnormality of psychological, physiologic, or anatomic structure or function at the organ level (eg, dysphagia, hemiparesis); an abnormality of body structure, appearance, and organ or system function resulting from any cause.
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs): Complex aspects of independence including meal preparation, grocery shopping, household management, finances, and transportation.
pressure ulcers: Breakdown of the skin due to prolonged pressure and insufficient blood supply, usually at boney prominences.
rehabilitation: Making able again; relearning skills or abilities or adjusting existing functions.
$82 \%$ of nondisabled people. The employed person with disability, however, earns less money than the nondisabled person (U.S. Census, 1997). In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) (PL 101-336), which constitutes civil rights legislation designed to permit those with disabilities access to job opportunities and to the community. As a result of this act, employers must evaluate an applicant's ability to perform the job and not discriminate on the basis of a disability. Employers must also make "reasonable accommodations," such as equipment or access ramps, to facilitate employment of a person with a disability. The ADA stipulates that communities must provide public transportation that is accessible to people with disabilities. Public facilities (eg, stores, restaurants, hotels) must be accessible and accommodate those with disabilities. Telecommunication providers must offer communication devices for the deaf. A higher quality of life for those with disabilities is an objective of the ADA.

Although the regulations took effect in July 1992, compliance has been slow because the reasonable accommodation "without undue hardship" provisions in the law permit businesses to continue with inaccessible conditions. All new construction and modifications of public facilities, however, must address access by people with disabilities.

\section*{Right to Access to Health Care and Health Promotion}

For years, people with disabilities have been discriminated against in employment, public accommodations, and public and private services including health care. The needs of the disabled in health care settings produce many challenges to health care providers: how to communicate effectively if there are communication deficits, the additional physical demands for mobility, and time required to provide assistance with self-care routines during hospitalization. Physicians and nurses may not know the specific needs of individuals with disability and may fail to provide services for them. For example, an obstetrician may advise a woman with a spinal cord injury not to become pregnant because the physician lacks experience and knowledge in this area of care. The physician and nurses caring for an expectant woman with disability may not know specific transfer techniques to help her onto an examining table or how to advise her on bowel, bladder, and skin care issues during pregnancy. Before labor and delivery, the medical team needs to be educated about the special needs of a woman with a cervical spinal cord injury in regard to management of autonomic hyperreflexia. Often, the person with disability must educate the health care professionals.

Because of unfavorable interactions with health care providers, including negative attitudes, insensitivity, and lack of knowledge, people with disability may avoid seeking medical intervention or health promotion programs and activities. For this reason, and because the number of individuals with disability is increasing, nurses must acquire knowledge and skills and be accessible to assist these individuals in maintaining a high level of wellness.

Nurses are in key positions to influence the architectural design of health care settings and the selection of equipment that promotes ease of access and health. Padded examination tables that can be raised or lowered make transfers easier for the disabled. Birthing chairs benefit women with disability during yearly pelvic examinations and Pap smears and for urologic evaluations. Ramps, grab bars, and raised and padded toilet seats benefit many persons who have orthopedic disabilities and need routine phys-
ical examination and monitoring (eg, bone density measurements). Just as people without disability should have regular screening tests, such as mammography or testicular and prostate examinations, so should people with disability. The health care professionals who provide these screening and monitoring procedures are in a position to influence decisions about how equipment and procedures can be adapted to meet the special needs of their patients, whether these needs are cognitive, motor, or communicative.

Nurses can provide expert health promotion education classes that are targeted to the disabled. Classes on nutrition and weight management are extremely important to individuals who are wheelchair dependent and need assistance with transfers. Safe sex classes are needed by adolescents and young adults who have spinal cord or traumatic brain injury, because the threats of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and unplanned pregnancy exist for these populations just as they do for the population in general. Other healthy behaviors about which neurologically disabled persons need education include avoiding alcohol and nonprescription medications while taking antispasmodic and antiseizure medications. Nurses should teach all stroke survivors and patients with diabetes how to monitor their own blood pressure or glucose levels. The warning signs and symptoms of stroke, heart attack, and cancer, as well as how to access help, should also be taught to all disabled persons.

As active members of society, people with disabilities are no longer an invisible minority. An increased awareness of the needs of people with disabilities will bring about changes to improve their access and accommodate their needs. Modification of the physical environment permits access to public and private facilities and services, including health care, and nurses can serve as advocates for the disabled to eliminate discriminatory practices.

\section*{Focus of Rehabilitation}

Disability can occur at any age and may result from an acute incident, such as stroke or trauma, or from the progression of a chronic condition, such as arthritis or multiple sclerosis. A person with disability experiences many losses, including loss of function, independence, social role, status, and income. A patient and his or her family members experience a range of emotional reactions to these losses. The reactions may progress from disorganization and confusion to denial of the disability, grief over the lost function or body part, depression, anger, and, finally, acceptance of the disability. The reactions may subside over time and may recur at a later time, especially if chronic illness is progressive and results in increasing losses. Not all patients experience all of the stages, although most do exhibit grief. Patients who exhibit grief should not be blithely encouraged to "cheer up." The nurse should show a willingness to listen to the patient talk about the disability and should understand that grief, anger, regret, and resentment are all part of the healing process. See the accompanying Gerontologic Considerations box for concerns unique to older adults.

The patient's preexisting coping abilities play an important role in the adaptation process: one patient may be particularly independent and determined, while another may be dependent and seem to lack personal power. One goal of rehabilitation is to help the patient gain a positive self-image through effective coping. The nurse must recognize different coping abilities and identify when the patient is not coping well or not adjusting to the disability (Nursing Research Profile 11-1). The patient and family may benefit from participating in a support group or talking

\section*{The RehabilitationTeam}

Rehabilitation is a creative, dynamic process that requires a team of professionals working together with the patient and the family. The team members represent a variety of disciplines, with each health professional making a unique contribution. Each health professional assesses the patient and identifies patient needs within the discipline's domain. Rehabilitative goals are set. Each health professional assesses the patient, identifies patient needs within the discipline's domain, and sets rehabilitative goals. Team members hold group sessions at frequent intervals to collaborate, evaluate progress, and modify goals as needed to facilitate rehabilitation and to promote independence, self-respect, and an acceptable quality of life for the patient.

The patient is the key member of the rehabilitation team. He or she is the focus of the team effort and the one who determines the final outcomes of the process. The patient participates in goal setting, in learning to function using remaining abilities, and in adjusting to living with disabilities.

The patient's family is also incorporated into the team. The family is a dynamic system, so disability of one member affects the other family members. Only by incorporating the family into the rehabilitation process can the family system adapt to the change in one of its members. The family provides ongoing support, participates in problem solving, and learns to provide necessary ongoing care (Nursing Research Profile 11-2).

The rehabilitation nurse develops a therapeutic and supportive relationship with the patient and the family. The nurse always emphasizes the patient's assets and strengths, positively reinforcing his or her efforts to improve self-concept and self-care abilities. During nurse-patient interactions, the nurse actively listens, encourages, and shares the patient's successes.

Using the nursing process, the nurse develops a plan of care designed to facilitate rehabilitation, restore and maintain optimum health, and prevent complications. The nurse helps the patient identify strengths and past successes and develop new goals. Coping with the disability, self-care, mobility, skin care, and bowel and bladder management are frequently areas for nursing intervention. The nurse assumes the roles of caregiver, teacher, counselor, patient advocate, and consultant. The nurse is often the case manager responsible for coordinating the total rehabili-

\section*{Older Adults and Disability}

Cataldo, J. (2001). The relationship of hardiness and depression to disability in institutionalized older adults. Rehabilitation Nursing 26(1), 28-33.

\section*{Purpose}

Depression has been linked with disability in several studies of older adults. Hardiness is a personality characteristic that is a buffer in the stress and depression dynamic and increases a person's capability of having a positive psychological reaction to a stressor. Hardiness only partially explains the variance of depression since the hardiest of individuals may become depressed. This study tested two hypotheses: (1) After accounting for the effects of physiologic factors (physical status and length of stay [LOS]), hardiness will significantly contribute to the explanation of disability in a sample of institutionalized elderly people; (2) after accounting for the effects of physical health status, LOS, and hardiness, depression will significantly contribute to the explanation of disability in a sample of institutionalized older people.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A culturally diverse group of 33 women and 25 men ranging in age from 60 to 93 years participated in a 45 -minute interview. Hardiness was measured with the Health-Related Hardiness Scale (HRHS) which had 34 items on a 6-point Likert-type scale. The instrument had two dimensions: commitment/challenge and control. High scores indicated higher hardiness. Depression was measured with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), a 22 -item screening inventory. High scores indicated a high level of depressive symptomatology. Physical health status was measured with the Clinical Response Scale (CRS), a 56 -item generic health index. The items were scored using data from the participants' medical records in a 1 -month period. Higher scores indicated worsened health status. LOS data were collected from the facility's computerized system with day of admission being day 1 . Disability was measured by the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index, which had 10 variables related to self-care and mobility. A high score indicated independence, and a low score indicated disability.

\section*{Findings}

Both hypotheses were supported. The psychological variables of hardiness and depression contributed more than did health status and LOS to explain disability in a sample of elderly nursing home residents. LOS and physical health status accounted for $14.7 \%$ of the variance in disability. Hardiness explained $10.5 \%$ of the variance, and depression accounted for an additional $7.4 \%$ of the variance in disability.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses need to guide older persons with disability to develop hardiness. Nurses can encourage them to view the disability as a challenge and to make a commitment to life. The nurse can assist older individuals with disability to take control of their life circumstances (ie, become actively involved in pain management and all daily decision making). Because the level of disability is not exclusively the result of physiologic factors, the nurse should suggest treatment of depression in the older adult with disability.

Secrest, J. (2000). Transformation of the relationship: The experience of primary support persons of stroke survivors. Rehabilitation Nursing 25(3), 93-99.

\section*{Purpose}

Most stroke survivors live at home. Effective rehabilitation must include the primary support person (PSP). Nurses teach and counsel the PSP during acute hospitalization, during the rehabilitation phase, and in the home. Understanding the experience of stroke from the PSP's perspective can help nurses design effective interventions for the PSP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the quality, or nature, of life experienced by PSPs of stroke survivors.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

The study sample consisted of 8 women and 2 men between the ages of 40 to 72 years. Criteria for inclusion in the study were that (1) the participant was the PSP of a stroke survivor whose stroke occurred at least 6 months previously, and who had completed inpatient rehabilitation and was living at home and (2) the participant was willing and able to articulate the experience. The study design sought to attain a first-person description of the PSP experience. The single interview item was, "Please describe specific experiences you've had since your [significant other's] stroke that stands out for you." The researchers "bracketed" or identified potential biases about the phenomenon being studied so that they would not unduly influence the course of the study. The interview was transcribed verbatim and analyzed by members of the research group.

\section*{Findings}

Participants rarely spoke of themselves as individuals. Experiences described were in relation to others. They expressed concern about being able to sustain their role over time. Time permeated the interviews: the length of time the couples had been married; changes in the stroke survivor's perception of time; and memory as it is of past time. Memory loss in the stroke survivor was perceived as a loss of an important aspect of the relationship. Other themes emerged. Life was perceived by the PSPs as being fragile. They experienced vigilance as they watched over the stroke victim. The PSP's vigilance did not diminish over time because they were aware of life's fragility and had an increased responsibility in the relationship. A weighty responsibility and a sense of loss were recurrent throughout the transcripts. All participants described the experience of a transformed relationship. The quality was different, but all of the relationships remained intact.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses need to assess the pre-stroke relationship of the patient and PSP in order to prepare the PSP for the future. This will enable the nurse to negotiate goals, teach, and counsel the PSP more effectively. Attendance at support groups specifically for the PSP should be encouraged. Nurses are key individuals to organize and maintain support groups. PSPs need permission to focus on themselves, grieve their losses, and find support for their added responsibilities.

\section*{Areas of Specialty Practice}

Although rehabilitation is a component of every patient's care, there are specialty rehabilitation programs established in general hospitals, free-standing rehabilitation hospitals, and outpatient facilities. The Commission for the Accreditation of Rehabilita-
tion Facilities (CARF) sets standards for these programs and monitors compliance with them.

Specialty rehabilitation programs often meet the needs of patients with neurologic disabilities. Stroke recovery programs and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation emphasize cognitive remediation: assisting patients to compensate for memory, perceptual, judgment, and safety deficits as well as teaching self-care and mobility skills. Other goals include assisting patients to swallow food safely and to communicate effectively. In addition to stroke and brain injury, other neurologic disorders treated include multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and nervous system tumors.

The number of spinal cord injury rehabilitation programs has increased since World War II. Integral components of the programs include understanding the effects and complications of spinal cord injury; neurogenic bowel and bladder management; sexuality and male fertility enhancement; self-care, including prevention of skin breakdown; bed mobility and transfers; and driving with adaptive equipment. The programs also focus on vocational assessment, training, and reentry into employment and the community.

Orthopedic rehabilitation programs provide comprehensive services to traumatic or nontraumatic amputee patients, patients undergoing joint replacements, and patients with arthritis. Learning to be independent with a prosthesis or a new joint is a major goal of the program. Pain management, energy conservation, and joint protection are other goals.

For patients who have had myocardial infarction, cardiac rehabilitation begins during the acute hospitalization and continues on an outpatient basis. Emphasis is placed on monitored, progressive exercise; nutritional counseling; stress management; and sexuality.

Patients with restrictive or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or ventilator dependency may be admitted to pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Respiratory therapists help the patient achieve more effective breathing patterns. The programs also teach energy conservation techniques, self-medication, and home ventilatory management.

Comprehensive pain management programs are available for sufferers of chronic pain, especially low back pain. These programs focus on alternative pain treatment modalities, exercise, supportive counseling, and vocational evaluation.

A comprehensive burn rehabilitation program may serve as a step-down unit from an intensive care burn unit. Although rehabilitation strategies are implemented immediately in acute care, a program focused on progressive joint mobility, self-care, and ongoing counseling is imperative for the burn patient.

Children are not exempt from the need for specialized rehabilitation. Pediatric rehabilitation programs meet the needs of children with developmental and acquired disabilities, including cerebral palsy, spina bifida, traumatic brain injuries, and spinal cord injuries.

As in all areas of nursing practice, nurses practicing in the area of rehabilitation must be skilled and knowledgeable about care of patients with substance abuse. For all individuals with disability, including adolescents, the nurse must assess actual or potential substance abuse. Almost 15 million Americans use illicit drugs; approximately 58 million engage in binge or heavy drinking of alcohol; and about $30 \%$ of the population uses nicotine products. Parental alcoholism is one of the strongest predictors of substance abuse. Alcohol abuse rates for people with disability may be twice as high as the general population. Forty to eighty percent of spinal cord injuries are related to substance abuse, and $40 \%$ to $80 \%$ of all traumatic brain injured patients are intoxicated at the time of injury (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000).

Substance abuse is a critical issue in rehabilitation, especially for disabled individuals who are attempting to gain employment via vocational rehabilitation. Treatment for alcoholism and drug dependencies includes a thorough physical and psychosocial evaluation; detoxification; counseling; medical treatment; psychological assistance for the patient and family; treatment of any coexisting psychiatric illness; and referral to community resources for social, legal, spiritual, or vocational assistance. Length of treatment and the rehabilitation process depends on the individual's needs. Self-help groups are also encouraged, although attendance in such groups (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous) poses various challenges for the person who has neurologic deficits, is confined to a wheelchair, or must adapt to encounters with able-bodied attendees who may not understand disability. All specialty areas of rehabilitation require implementation of the nursing process as described in this chapter.

\section*{Assessment of Functional Abilities}

Comprehensive assessment of functional capacity is the basis for developing a rehabilitation program. Functional capacity measures a person's ability to perform activities of ADLs and IADLs. ADLs include activities performed to meet basic needs, such as personal hygiene, dressing, toileting, eating, and moving. IADLs include activities that are necessary for independent living, such as the ability to shop for and prepare meals, use the telephone, clean, manage finances, and travel.

The nurse observes the patient performing specific activities (eg, eating, dressing) and notes the degree of independence; the time taken; the patient's mobility, coordination, and endurance; and the amount of assistance required. Good joint motion, muscle strength, cardiovascular reserve, and an intact neurologic system are also carefully assessed, because functional ability depends on these factors as well. Observations are recorded on a functional assessment tool. These tools provide a way to standardize assessment parameters and supply a scale or score against which improvements may be measured. They also clearly communicate the patient's level of functioning to all members of the rehabilitation team. Rehabilitation staff use these tools to provide an initial assessment of the patient's abilities and to monitor the patient's progress in independence.

One of the most frequently used tools to assess the patient's level of independence is the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The FIM is a minimum data set, measuring 18 items. The self-care items measured are eating, bathing, grooming, dressing upper body, dressing lower body, toileting, bladder management, and bowel management. The FIM addresses transfers and the ability to ambulate and climb stairs and also includes communication and social cognition items. A WeeFIM instrument is used for children. For both children and adults, scoring is based on a seven-point scale with items used to assess the patient's level of independence.

The PULSES profile is used to assess physical condition (eg, health/illness status), upper extremity functions (eg, eating, bathing), lower extremity functions (eg, transfer, ambulation), sensory function (eg, vision, hearing, speech), excretory function (ie, control of bowel or bladder), and situational factors (eg, social and financial support). Each of these areas is rated on a scale from one (independent) to four (greatest dependency).

The Barthel Index is used to measure the patient's level of independence in ADLs (feeding, bathing, dressing, grooming), continence, toileting, transfers, and ambulation (or wheelchair
mobility). This scale does not address communicative or cognitive abilities.

The Patient Evaluation Conference System (PECS) contains 15 categories. This comprehensive assessment scale includes such areas as medications, pain, nutrition, use of assistive devices, psychological status, vocation, and recreation. There are many other assessment tools designed to evaluate function in persons with specific disabling conditions.

In addition to the detailed functional assessment, the nurse assesses the patient's physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, social, and economic status. Secondary problems related to the disability, such as muscle atrophy and deconditioning, are assessed, as are residual strengths unaffected by disease or disability. Other areas that require nursing assessment include potential for altered skin integrity, altered bowel and bladder control, and sexual dysfunction.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH SELF-CARE DEFICITS IN ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING}

ADLs are those self-care activities that the patient must accomplish each day to meet personal needs. ADLs include personal hygiene/bathing, dressing/grooming, feeding, and toileting. Many patients are unable to perform such activities easily. An ADL program is started as soon as the rehabilitation process begins, because the ability to perform ADLs is frequently the key to independence, return to the home, and reentry into the community.

\section*{Assessment}

The nurse must observe and assess the patient's ability to perform ADLs to determine the level of independence in self-care and the need for nursing intervention. The activity of bathing requires obtaining bath water and utensils, washing, and drying the body after bathing. Dressing requires getting clothes from the closet, putting on and taking off clothing, and fastening the clothing. Self-feeding requires using utensils to bring food to the mouth, and chewing and swallowing the food. The activity of toileting includes removing clothing to use the toilet, cleansing oneself, and readjusting clothing. Grooming activities include combing hair, brushing teeth, shaving or applying makeup, and washing the hands. Patients who can sit up and raise their hands to their head can begin self-care activities.

In addition, the nurse needs to be aware of the patient's medical conditions, the effect that they have on the ability to perform ADLs, and the family's involvement in the patient's ADLs. This information is valuable in setting goals and developing the plan of care to maximize self-care.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include the following:
- Self-care deficit: bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, feeding, toileting

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals of the patient include bathing/hygiene independently or with assistance, using adaptive devices as appropriate; dressing/grooming independently or with assistance, using adap-
tive devices as appropriate; feeding independently or with assistance, using adaptive devices as appropriate; and toileting independently or with assistance, using adaptive devices as appropriate. Another goal is that the patient with a self-care deficit expresses satisfaction with the extent of independence in self-care activities.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{FOSTERING SELF-CARE ABILITIES}

To learn methods of self-care effectively, the patient must be motivated. An "I'd rather do it myself" attitude is encouraged. The nurse must also help the patient identify the safe limits of independent activity; knowing when to ask for assistance is particularly important.

The nurse teaches, guides, and supports the patient who is learning or relearning how to perform self-care activities. Consistency in instructions and assistance given by health care providers facilitates the learning process. Recording the patient's performance provides data for evaluating progress and may be used as a source for motivation and morale building (Chart 11-2).

Often, a simple maneuver requires concentration and the exertion of considerable effort on the part of the patient with a disability; therefore, self-care techniques need to be adapted to accommodate the individual patient's lifestyle. There is usually more than one way to accomplish a self-care activity, so common sense and a little ingenuity may promote increased independence. For example, a person who cannot quite reach his or her head may be able to do so by leaning forward. Encouraging the patient to participate in a support group may also help the patient to discover inventive or creative solutions to self-care problems.

\section*{RECOMMENDING ASSISTIVE DEVICES}

\section*{Chart 11-2 - PATIENT EDUCATION Teaching About Activities of Daily Living}
1. Define the goal of the activity with the patient. Be realistic. Set short-term goals that can be accomplished in the near future.
2. Identify several approaches to accomplish the task (eg, there are several ways to put on a given garment).
3. Select the approach most likely to succeed.
4. Specify the approach on the patient's care plan and the patient's level of accomplishment on the progress notes.
5. Identify the motions necessary to accomplish the activity (eg, to pick up a glass, extend arm with hand open; place open hand next to glass; flex fingers around glass; move arm and hand holding glass vertically; flex arm toward body).
6. Focus on gross functional movements initially, and gradually include activities that use finer motions (eg, buttoning clothes, eating with a fork).
7. Encourage the patient to perform the activity up to maximal capacity within the limitations of the disability.
8. Monitor the patient's tolerance.
9. Minimize frustration and fatigue.
10. Support the patient by giving appropriate praise for effort put forth and for acts accomplished.
11. Assist the patient to perform and practice the activity in real-life situations.
ety of assistive devices are available commercially or can be fabricated by the nurse, the occupational therapist, the patient, or the family. The nurse should be alert to "gadgets" coming on the market and evaluate their potential for usefulness. Of course, the nurse must exercise professional judgment and caution in recommending devices, because unscrupulous vendors have marketed unnecessary, overly expensive, or useless items to patients in the past.

A wide selection of computerized assistive devices is available, or devices can be designed to help individual patients with severe disabilities to function more independently. The ABLEDATA project (see Resources list) offers a computerized listing of commercially available aids and equipment for patients with disabilities.

\section*{HELPING THE PATIENT ACCEPT LIMITATIONS}

If the patient has a severe disability, independent self-care may be an unrealistic goal; in this situation, the rehabilitation nurse teaches the patient how to direct his or her own care. The patient may require a personal attendant to perform ADLs. Family members may not be appropriate for providing bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, feeding, and toileting assistance, and a spouse may have difficulty providing bowel and bladder care for the patient and maintaining the role of sexual partner. If a personal caregiver is needed, the disabled person or family members must learn how to manage an employee effectively. The nurse assists the patient in accepting self-care dependency. Independence in other areas, such as social interaction, should be emphasized to promote positive self-concept.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH IMPAIRED PHYSICAL MOBILITY}

Patients who are ill or injured are frequently placed on bed rest or have their activities limited. Problems commonly associated with immobility include weakened muscles, joint contracture, and deformity. Each joint of the body has a normal range of motion; if the range is limited, the functions of the joint and of the muscles that move the joint are impaired, and painful deformities may develop. Nurses must identify patients at risk for such complications.

Another problem frequently seen in rehabilitation nursing is an altered ambulatory/mobility pattern. The patient with a disability may be either temporarily or permanently unable to walk independently and unaided. The nurse assesses the mobility of the patient and designs care that promotes independent mobility within the prescribed therapeutic limits.

If a person is not able to exercise and move the joints through their full range of motion, contractures may develop. A contracture is a shortening of the muscle and tendon that leads to deformity and limits joint mobility. When the contracted joint is moved, the patient experiences pain; in addition, more energy is required to move when joints are contracted and deformed.

\section*{Assessment}

At times, a patient's mobility is restricted because of pain, paralysis, loss of muscle strength, systemic disease, an immobilizing device (eg, cast, brace), or prescribed limits to promote healing. Assessment of the patient's mobility includes positioning, ability to move, muscle strength and tone, joint function, and the prescribed mobility limits. The nurse may need to collaborate with the physical therapist or other team members to assess mobility.

During position change, transfer, and ambulation activities, the nurse assesses the patient's abilities, the extent of disability, and residual capacity for physiologic adaptation. The nurse observes for orthostatic hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, tachycardia, and fatigue.

If a patient is not able to ambulate without assistance, the nurse assesses ability to balance, transfer, and use assistive devices (eg, crutches, walker). Crutch walking requires a high energy expenditure and produces considerable cardiovascular stress, so older people with reduced exercise capacity, decreased arm strength, and problems with balance because of old age and multiple diseases may be unable to use them. A walker is more stable and may be a better choice for such patients. The nurse assesses the patient's ability to use various devices that promote mobility. If a patient uses an orthosis, an external appliance that provides support, prevents or corrects deformities, and improves function, the nurse monitors the patient for effective use and potential problems associated with its use.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include the following:
- Impaired physical mobility
- Activity intolerance
- Risk for injury
- Risk for disuse syndrome
- Impaired walking
- Impaired wheelchair mobility
- Impaired bed mobility

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals of the patient may include absence of contracture and deformity, maintenance of muscle strength and joint mobility, independent mobility, and increased activity tolerance.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{POSITIONING TO PREVENT MUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS}

Deformities and contractures can often be prevented by proper positioning. Maintaining correct body alignment when the patient is in bed is essential regardless of the position selected. During each contact with the patient, the nurse evaluates the patient's position and assists the patient to achieve proper positioning and alignment. The most common positions that a patient assumes in bed are supine (dorsal), side-lying (lateral), and prone. The nurse helps the patient assume these positions and supports the body in correct alignment with pillows (Chart 11-3). At times, a splint (eg, wrist or hand splint) may be fabricated by the occupational therapist to support a joint and prevent deformity. The nurse must ensure proper use of the splint and provide skin care.

\section*{Preventing External Rotation of the Hip}

Patients who are in bed for any period of time may develop external rotation deformity of the hip because the ball-and-socket joint of the hip has a tendency to rotate outward when the patient lies on his or her back. A trochanter roll extending from the crest of the ilium to the midthigh prevents this deformity; with correct placement, it serves as a mechanical wedge under the projection of the greater trochanter.

\section*{Preventing Footdrop}

Footdrop is a deformity in which the foot is plantar flexed (the ankle bends in the direction of the sole of the foot). If the condition continues without correction, the patient will not be able to hold the foot in a normal position and will be able to walk only on his or her toes, without touching the ground with the heel of the foot. The deformity is caused by contracture of both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Damage to the peroneal nerve or loss of flexibility of the Achilles tendon may result in footdrop.

\section*{NURSING ALERT Prolonged bed rest, lack of exercise, incorrect positioning in bed, and the weight of bedding that forces the toes into plantar flexion are factors that contribute to footdrop.}

To prevent this disabling deformity, the patient is positioned to sit at 90 degrees in a wheelchair with feet on the footrests or flat on the floor. When the patient is supine in bed, padded splints or protective boots are used to keep the feet at right angles to the legs. Frequent skin inspection of the feet must also be performed to determine whether positioning devices have created any unwanted pressure areas.

The patient is encouraged to perform the following ankle exercises several times each hour: dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the feet, flexion and extension (curl and stretch) of the toes, and eversion and inversion of the feet at the ankles. The nurse provides frequent passive range-of-motion exercises if the patient is unable to perform active exercises.

\section*{MAINTAINING MUSCLE STRENGTH AND JOINT MOBILITY}

Optimal function depends on the strength of the muscles and joint motion, and active participation in ADLs promotes main-

Supine (Dorsal) Position
1. Align the head with the spine, both laterally and anteroposteriorly.
2. Position the trunk to minimize hip flexion.
3. Flex the arms at the elbow and rest the hands against the lateral abdomen.
4. Extend the legs with a small, firm support under the popliteal area.
5. Support the heels off the mattress with a small pillow or towel roll at the ankles.
6. Point the toes straight up using protective boots to prevent footdrop.
7. Place trochanter rolls under the greater trochanters to prevent external rotation of the hip.

\section*{Side-Lying (Lateral Position)}
1. Align the head with the spine, and support it with a pillow.
2. Properly align the body; avoid twisting at the shoulders, waist, or hips.
3. Flex shoulders and elbows and support the upper arm with a pillow.
4. Position the uppermost hip joint slightly forward and support the leg in a position of slight abduction by a pillow.
5. Place and support the feet in neutral dorsiflexion.
6. Support the back with a pillow.

\section*{Prone (on Abdomen) Position}
1. Turn the head laterally and align it with the rest of the body.
2. Abduct and externally rotate the arms at the shoulder joint; flex the elbows.
3. Place a small, flat support under the pelvis, extending from the level of the umbilicus to the upper third of the thigh.
4. Maintain the lower extremities in a neutral position.
5. Suspend the toes over the edge of the mattress.

Note: Side rails of bed are down for photographic purposes; they should remain raised if the patient is at risk for falling.

tenance of muscle strength and joint mobility. Range-of-motion exercises and specific therapeutic exercises may be included in the nursing plan of care.

\section*{Performing Range-of-Motion Exercises}

Range of motion is movement of a joint through its full range in all appropriate planes (Chart 11-4). To maintain or increase the motion of a joint, range-of-motion exercises are initiated as soon as the patient's condition permits. The exercises are planned for
the individual to accommodate the wide variation in the degrees of motion that people of varying body builds and age groups can attain (Chart 11-5).

Range-of-motion exercises may be active (performed by the patient under supervision of the nurse), assisted (with the nurse helping if the patient is unable to do the exercise independently), or passive (performed by the nurse). Unless prescribed otherwise, a joint should be moved through its range of motion three times, at least twice a day. The joint to be exercised is supported, the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-191.jpg?height=886&width=864&top_left_y=186&top_left_x=202)
bones above the joint are stabilized, and the body part distal to the joint is moved through the range of motion of the joint. For example, the humerus must be stabilized while the radius and ulna are moved through their range of motion at the elbow joint.

The joint should not be moved beyond its free range of motion; the joint is moved to the point of resistance and stopped at the point of pain. If muscle spasms are present, the joint is moved slowly to the point of resistance. Gentle, steady pressure is then applied until the muscle relaxes, and the motion is continued to the joint's final point of resistance.

To perform assisted or passive range-of-motion exercises, the patient must be in a comfortable supine position with arms at the sides and knees extended. Good body posture is maintained during the exercises. The nurse also uses good body mechanics during the exercise session.

\section*{Performing Therapeutic Exercises}

Therapeutic exercises are prescribed by the physician and performed with the assistance and guidance of a physical therapist or nurse. Research is also underway to develop computerized robots with gentle, compliant behavior that could be used in the home setting for upper-extremity exercises (Krebs, 2000).

The patient should have a clear understanding of the goal of the prescribed exercise. Written instructions about the frequency, duration, and number of repetitions, as well as simple line drawings of the exercise, help to ensure adherence to the exercise program.

Exercise, when performed correctly, assists in maintaining and building muscle strength, maintaining joint function, preventing deformity, stimulating circulation, developing endurance, and promoting relaxation. Exercise is also valuable in helping to restore motivation and the well-being of the patient. Weight-bearing exercises may slow the bone loss that occurs with disability. There are five types of exercise: passive, active-assistive, active, resistive, and isometric. The description, purpose, and action of each of these exercises are summarized in Table 11-1.

\section*{PROMOTING INDEPENDENT MOBILITY}

When the patient's condition stabilizes and the physical condition permits, the patient is assisted to sit up on the side of the bed and then to stand. The patient's tolerance of this activity is assessed. Orthostatic (postural) hypotension may develop when the patient assumes a vertical position. Because of inadequate vasomotor reflexes, blood pools in the splanchnic (visceral) area and in the legs, resulting in inadequate cerebral circulation. If indicators of orthostatic hypotension (eg, drop in blood pressure, pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, tachycardia, dizziness) are present, the activity is stopped, and the patient is assisted to a supine position in bed.

Some disabilities, such as spinal cord injury, acute brain injury, and other conditions that require extended periods in the recumbent position, prevent patients from assuming an upright position at the bedside. Several strategies can be used to assist a patient to assume a 90 -degree sitting position. First, a reclining wheelchair with elevating leg rests allows a slow and controlled progression from a supine position to a 90 -degree sitting position. A tilt table, a board that can be tilted in 5 - to 10 -degree increments from a horizontal to a vertical position, may also be used. The tilt table promotes vasomotor adjustment to positional changes and helps the patient with limited standing balance and limited weightbearing activities to avoid the decalcification of bones and low bone mass associated with disuse syndrome and lack of weightbearing exercise.

Elastic compression stockings are used to prevent venous stasis. For some patients, a compression garment (leotard) or snugfitting abdominal binder and elastic compression bandaging of the legs are needed to prevent venous stasis and ensuing orthostatic hypotension. When the patient is standing, the feet are protected with a pair of properly fitted shoes. Extended periods of standing are avoided because of venous pooling and pressure on the soles of the feet. The nurse monitors the patient's blood pressure and pulse and observes for signs of orthostatic hypotension and cerebral insufficiency (eg, the patient reports feeling faint and weak), which suggest intolerance of the upright position. If the patient does not tolerate the upright position, the nurse should recline the patient and elevate the patient's legs.

\section*{Assisting the Patient With Transfer}

A transfer is movement of the patient from one place to another (eg, bed to chair, chair to commode, wheelchair to tub). As soon as the patient is permitted out of bed, transfer activities are started. The nurse assesses the patient's ability to participate actively in the transfer and determines in conjunction with an occupational therapist or physical therapist the required adaptive equipment to promote independence and safety. A lightweight wheelchair with brake extensions, removable and detachable arm rests, and leg rests minimizes structural obstacles during the transfer. Tub seats or benches make transfers in and out of tubs easier and safer. Raised, padded commode seats may also be warranted for patients who must avoid flexing the hips greater than 90 degrees when transferring to a toilet.

It is important that the patient maintain muscle strength and, if possible, perform push-up exercises to strengthen the arm and shoulder extensor muscles. The push-up exercise requires the patient to sit upright in bed; a book is placed under each of the patient's hands to provide a hard surface, and the patient is instructed to push down on the book raising, the body. The nurse should encourage the patient to raise and move the body in different directions by means of these push-up exercises.

The nurse or physical therapist teaches the patient how to transfer. There are several methods of transferring from the bed to the

wheelchair when the patient is unable to stand, and the technique chosen should be appropriate for the patient, considering his or her abilities and disabilities. It is helpful for the nurse to demonstrate the technique. If the physical therapist is involved in teaching the patient to transfer, the nurse and the physical therapist must collaborate so that consistent instructions are given to the patient. During transfer, the nurse assists and coaches the patient. Figure 11-1 shows weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing transfer.

If the patient's muscles are not strong enough to overcome the resistance of body weight, a polished lightweight board (transfer board, sliding board) may be used to bridge the gap between the bed and the chair. The patient slides across on the board with or without assistance from a caregiver. This board may also be used
to transfer the patient from the chair to the toilet or bathtub bench. The nurse should make sure that the patient's fingers do not curl around the edge of the board during the transfer, because the weight of the patient's body can crush them as the patient moves across the board. Safety is a primary concern during a transfer:
- Wheelchairs and beds must be locked before the patient transfers.
- Detachable arm and foot rests are removed to make getting in and out of the chair easier.
- One end of the transfer board is placed under the patient's buttocks and the other end on the surface to which the transfer is being made (eg, the chair).

- The patient is instructed to lean forward, push up with his or her hands, and then slide across the board to the other surface.

The nurse frequently assists weak and incapacitated patients out of bed. The nurse supports and gently assists the patient during position changes, protecting the patient from injury. The nurse avoids pulling on the weak or paralyzed upper extremity, to prevent dislocation of the shoulder. The patient is assisted to move toward the stronger side (Chart 11-6).

In the home setting, getting in and out of bed and performing chair, toilet, and tub transfers are difficult for patients with weak musculature and loss of hip, knee, and ankle motion. A rope attached to the headboard of the bed enables the patient to pull toward the center of the bed, and the use of a rope attached to the footboard facilitates getting in and out of bed. The height of a chair can be raised with cushions on the seat or with hollowed-out blocks placed under the chair legs. Grab bars can be attached to the wall near the toilet and tub to provide leverage and stability.

\section*{Preparing for Ambulation}

Regaining the ability to walk is a prime morale builder. However, to be prepared for ambulation - whether with brace, walker, cane, or crutches-the patient must strengthen the muscles required. Exercise, therefore, is the foundation of preparation. The nurse and physical therapist instruct and supervise the patient in these exercises.

For ambulation, the quadriceps muscles, which stabilize the knee joint, and the gluteal muscles are strengthened. To perform quadriceps-setting exercises, the patient contracts the quadriceps muscle by attempting to push the popliteal area against the mattress and at the same time raising the heel. The patient maintains the muscle contraction until a count of five and relaxes for a count of five. The exercise is repeated 10 to 15 times hourly. Ex-
ercising the quadriceps muscles prevents flexion contractures of the knee.

In gluteal setting, the patient contracts or "pinches" the buttocks together to the count of five, relaxes for the count of five, and repeats 10 to 15 times hourly. If ambulatory aids (ie, walker, cane, crutches) are to be used, the muscles of the upper extremities are exercised and strengthened. Push-up exercises are useful. While in a sitting position, the patient raises the body by pushing the hands against the chair seat or mattress. The patient should be encouraged to do push-up exercises while in a prone position also. Pull-up exercises done on a trapeze while lifting the body are also effective for conditioning. The patient is taught to raise the arms above the head and then lower them in a slow, rhythmic manner while holding weights. Gradually, the weight is increased. The hands are strengthened by squeezing a rubber ball.

Typically, the physical therapist designs exercises to help the patient develop the sitting and standing balance, stability, and coordination needed for ambulation. After sitting and standing balance are achieved, the patient uses parallel bars. Under the supervision of the physical therapist, the patient practices shifting weight from side to side, lifting one leg while supporting weight on the other, and then walking between the parallel bars.

A patient who is ready to begin ambulation must be fitted with the appropriate ambulatory aid, instructed about the prescribed weight-bearing limits (eg, non-weight-bearing, partial weightbearing ambulation), and taught how to use the aid safely. The nurse continually assesses the patient for stability and adherence to weight-bearing precautions and protects the patient from falling. The nurse provides contact guarding by holding on to a gait belt that the patient wears around the waist. The patient should wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes and be advised of the dangers of wet or highly polished floors and throw rugs. The patient should also learn how to ambulate on inclines, uneven surfaces, and stairs.

\end{figure}

\section*{Ambulating With Crutches}

Patients who are prescribed partial weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing ambulation may use crutches. The nurse or physical therapist should determine whether crutches are appropriate for the patient, because good balance, adequate cardiovascular reserve, strong upper extremities, and erect posture are essential for crutch walking. Ambulating a functional distance (at least the length of a
room or house) or maneuvering stairs on crutches requires significant arm strength, because the arms must bear the patient's weight. Muscle groups important for crutch walking include the following:
- Shoulder depressors-to stabilize the upper extremity and prevent shoulder hiking
- Shoulder adductors-to hold the crutch top against the chest wall

Technique for Moving the Patient to the Edge of the Bed
1. Move head and shoulders of patient toward the edge of the bed.
2. Move feet and legs to the edge of the bed. (The patient is now in a crescent position, which gives good range of motion to the lateral trunk muscles.)
3. Place both arms well under the patient's hips. Next, tighten (set) the muscles of your back and abdomen.
4. Straighten your back while moving the patient toward you.

Technique for Sitting Patient on the Edge of the Bed
1. Place arm and hand under the patient's shoulders.
2. Instruct the patient to push into the bed with the elbow while you lift the patient's shoulders with one arm and swing the legs over the edge of the bed with the other. (Gravity pulls the legs downward, which aids in raising the patient's trunk.)

\section*{Technique for Assisting Patient to Stand}
1. Position the patient's feet so that they will be well grounded.
2. Face the patient while firmly grasping each side of the patient's rib cage with your hands.
3. Push your knee against one knee of the patient.
4. Rock the patient forward to a standing position. (Your knee is pushed against the patient's knee as he or she comes to the standing position.)
5. Ensure that the patient's knees are "locked" (in full extension) while standing. (Locking the patient's knees is a safety measure for those who are weak or have been in bed for some time.)
6. Give the patient enough time to establish balance.
7. Pivot the patient into a sitting position in the chair.
- Arm flexors, extensors, and abductors (at the shoulder)-to move crutches forward, backward, and sideways
- Forearm extensors-to prevent flexion or buckling; important in raising the body for swinging gait
- Wrist extensors-to enable weight bearing on hand pieces
- Finger and thumb flexors-to grasp the hand piece

\section*{Preparing the Patient to Walk With Crutches}

Preparatory exercises are prescribed to strengthen the shoulder girdle and upper extremity muscles. Meanwhile, crutches need to be adjusted to the patient before the patient begins ambulating. To determine the approximate crutch length, the patient may be measured standing or lying down. A standing patient is positioned against the wall with the feet slightly apart and away from the wall. Then a distance of 5 cm (2 inches) is marked on the floor, out to the side from the tip of the toe; 15 cm ( 6 inches) is measured straight ahead from the first mark, and this point is marked on the floor. Next, 5 cm ( 2 inches) is measured below the axilla to the second mark for the approximate crutch length.

If the patient has to be measured while lying down, he or she is measured from the anterior fold of the axilla to the sole of the foot, and then 5 cm (2 inches) is added. If the patient's height is used, 40 cm ( 16 inches) is subtracted to obtain the approximate crutch length. The hand piece should be adjusted to allow 20 to 30 degrees of flexion at the elbow. The wrist should be extended and the hand dorsiflexed. A foam rubber pad on the underarm piece is used to relieve pressure of the crutch on the upper arm and thoracic cage. For safety, crutches should have large rubber tips, and the patient should wear firm-soled shoes that fit well.

\section*{Teaching Crutch Walking}

The nurse or physical therapist explains and demonstrates to the patient how to use the crutches. The patient learns standing balance by standing on the unaffected leg by a chair. To help the patient maintain balance, the nurse holds the patient near the waist or uses a transfer belt.

The patient is taught to support his or her weight on the hand pieces. (For patients who are unable to support their weight through the wrist and hand because of arthritis or fracture, platform crutches that support the forearm and allow the weight to be borne through the elbow are available.) If weight is borne on the axilla, the pressure of the crutch can damage the brachial plexus nerves, producing "crutch paralysis."

For maximum stability, the patient first assumes the tripod position by placing the crutches about 20 to 25 cm ( 8 to 10 inches) in front and to the side of his or her toes (Fig. 11-2). (This base of support is adjusted according to the height of the patient; a tall person requires a broader base of support than does a short person). In this position, the patient learns how to shift weight and maintain balance.

Before teaching crutch walking, the nurse or therapist determines which gait will be best for the patient. The selection of the crutch gait depends on the type and severity of the disability and on the patient's physical condition, arm and trunk strength, and body balance. The patient should be taught two gaits so that he or she can change from one to another. Shifting crutch gaits relieves fatigue, because each gait requires the use of a different combination of muscles (if a muscle is forced to contract steadily without relaxing, the circulation of the blood to that part is decreased). A faster gait can be used when walking an uninterrupted distance, and a slower gait can be used for short distances or in crowded places. The more common gaits are the four-point, the three-point, the two-point, and the swinging-to and swinging-

\begin{figure}

\caption{FIGURE 11-2 Crutch walking. The tripod position for basic crutch stance.}
\end{figure}
through gaits. The sequence of movements for each of these gaits is depicted in Chart 11-7.

The nurse walks with the patient who is just learning how to ambulate with crutches, holding him or her at the waist as needed for balance. During this time, the nurse protects the patient from falls and continually assesses the patient's stability and stamina, since prolonged periods of bed rest and inactivity affect a patient's strength and endurance. Sweating and shortness of breath are indications that crutch-walking practice should be stopped and the patient permitted to rest.

\section*{Teaching Maneuvering Techniques}

Before a patient is considered to be independent in crutch walking, he or she needs to learn to sit in a chair, stand from sitting, and go up and down stairs.

\section*{To sit down:}
1. Grasp the crutches at the hand pieces for control.
2. Bend forward slightly while assuming a sitting position.
3. Place the affected leg forward to prevent weight-bearing and flexion.

\section*{To stand up:}
1. Move forward to the edge of the chair with the strong leg slightly under the seat.
2. Place both crutches in the hand on the side of the affected extremity.
3. Push down on the hand piece while raising the body to a standing position.
To go down stairs:
1. Walk forward as far as possible on the step.
2. Advance crutches to the lower step. The weaker leg is advanced first and then the stronger one. In this way, the stronger extremity shares with the arms the work of raising and lowering the body weight.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-197.jpg?height=2242&width=1780&top_left_y=186&top_left_x=202)

\section*{To go up stairs:}
1. Advance the stronger leg first up to the next step.
2. Advance the crutches and the weaker extremity. Note that the strong leg goes up first and comes down last. A memory device for the patients is, "Up with the good, down with the bad."

\section*{AMBULATING WITH A WALKER}

A walker provides more support and stability than a cane or crutches. There are two types of walkers: pick-up walkers and rolling walkers. A pick-up walker (one that has to be picked up and moved with each step forward) does not permit a natural walking pattern and is useful for patients who have poor balance or limited cardiovascular reserve or who cannot use crutches. A rolling walker allows automatic walking and is used by patients who cannot lift or who inappropriately carry a pick-up walker. The height of the walker is adjusted to the patient. The patient's arms resting on the walker hand grips should exhibit 20 to 30 degrees of flexion at the elbows. The patient should wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes. The nurse walks with the patient, holds him or her at the waist as needed for balance, continually assesses the patient's stability, and protects the patient from falls.

The patient is instructed to ambulate with a pick-up walker as follows:
1. Push off a chair or bed to come to a standing position. Never pull yourself up using the walker.
2. Hold the walker on the hand grips for stability.
3. Lift the walker, placing it in front of you while leaning your body slightly forward.
4. Walk into the walker, supporting your body weight on your hands when advancing your weaker leg, permitting partial weight bearing or non-weight bearing as prescribed.
5. Balance yourself on your feet.
6. Lift the walker, and place it in front of you again. Continue this pattern of walking.
7. Remember to look up as you walk.

\section*{USING A CANE}

A cane helps the patient walk with greater balance and support and relieves the pressure on weight-bearing joints by redistributing weight. Quad canes (four-footed canes) provide more stability than straight canes. To fit the patient for a cane, the patient is instructed to flex the elbow at a 30 -degree angle, hold the handle of the cane about level with the greater trochanter, and place the tip of the cane 15 cm ( 6 inches) lateral to the base of the fifth toe. Adjustable canes make individualization easy. The cane should be fitted with a gently flaring tip that has flexible, concentric rings; the tip with its concentric rings provides optimal stability, functions as a shock absorber, and enables the patient to walk with greater speed and less fatigue.

The cane is held in the hand opposite the affected extremity. In normal walking, the opposite leg and arm move together (reciprocal motion); this motion is to be carried through in walking with a cane. The patient is taught to ambulate with a cane as follows:

\section*{Cane-foot sequence:}
1. Hold the cane in the hand opposite the affected extremity to widen the base of support and to reduce the stress on the involved extremity. If the patient for some reason is unable to use the cane in the opposite hand, the cane may be used on the same side.
2. Advance the cane at the same time the affected leg is moved forward.
3. Keep the cane fairly close to the body to prevent leaning.
4. Bear down on the cane when the unaffected extremity begins the swing phase.

\section*{To go up and down stairs using the cane:}
1. Step up on the unaffected extremity.
2. Place the cane and affected extremity up on the step.
3. Reverse this procedure for descending steps ("up with the good, down with the bad").

As for all patients beginning ambulation with an ambulatory aid, the nurse continually assesses the patient's stability and protects the patient from falls. The nurse accompanies the patient, holding him or her at the waist as needed for balance. The patient is assessed for tolerance of walking, and rest periods are provided as needed.

\section*{ASSISTING THE PATIENT WHO USES AN ORTHOSIS OR PROSTHESIS}

Orthoses and prostheses are designed to facilitate mobilization and to maximize the patient's quality of life. An orthosis is an external appliance that provides support, prevents or corrects deformities, and improves function. Orthoses include braces, splints, collars, corsets, or supports that are designed and fitted by an orthotist or prosthetist. Static orthoses (no moving parts) are used to stabilize joints and prevent contractures. Dynamic orthoses are flexible and are used to improve function by assisting weak muscles. A prosthesis is an artificial body part; it may be internal, such as an artificial knee or hip joint, or external, such as an artificial leg or arm.

In addition to learning how to apply and remove the orthosis and maneuver the affected body part correctly, rehabilitation patients must learn how to properly care for the skin that comes in contact with the appliance. Skin problems or pressure ulcers may develop if the device is applied too tightly or too loosely, or if it is adjusted improperly. The nurse instructs the patient to clean and inspect the skin daily, to make sure the brace fits snugly without being too tight, to check that the padding distributes pressure evenly, and to wear a cotton garment without seams between the orthosis and the skin.

If the patient has had an amputation, the nurse promotes tissue healing, uses compression dressings to promote residual limb shaping, and minimizes contracture formation. A permanent prosthetic limb cannot be fitted until the tissue has healed completely and the residual limb shape is stable and free of edema. The nurse also helps the patient cope with the emotional issues surrounding loss of a limb and encourages acceptance of the prosthesis. The prosthetist, the nurse, and the physician collaborate to provide instructions related to skin care and care of the prosthesis.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY}

An estimated 1.5 to 3 million patients develop pressure ulcers annually (Mayo Clinic Rochester, 2001). Both prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers are costly in terms of health care dollars and quality of life for patients at risk. Because the cost in terms of pain and suffering for a person with a pressure ulcer cannot be quantified, all possible efforts should be made to prevent skin breakdown.

Patients confined to bed for long periods, patients with motor or sensory dysfunction, and patients who experience muscular atrophy and reduction of padding between the overlying skin and the underlying bone are prone to pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers are localized areas of infarcted soft tissue that occur when pressure applied to the skin over time is greater than normal capillary closure pressure, which is about 32 mm Hg . Critically ill patients have a lower capillary closure pressure and are at greater risk for pressure ulcers. The initial sign of pressure is erythema (redness of the skin) caused by reactive hyperemia, which normally resolves in less than 1 hour. Unrelieved pressure results in tissue ischemia or anoxia. The cutaneous tissues become broken or destroyed, leading to progressive destruction and necrosis of underlying soft tissue, and the resulting pressure ulcer is painful and slow to heal.

\section*{Assessment}

Immobility, impaired sensory perception or cognition, decreased tissue perfusion, decreased nutritional status, friction and shear forces, increased moisture, and age-related skin changes all contribute to the development of pressure ulcers.

\section*{IMMOBILITY}

When a person is immobile and inactive, pressure is exerted on the skin and subcutaneous tissue by objects on which the person rests, such as a mattress, chair seat, or cast. The development of pressure ulcers is directly related to the duration of immobility: if pressure continues long enough, small vessel thrombosis and tissue necrosis occur, and a pressure ulcer results. Weight-bearing bony prominences are most susceptible to pressure ulcer development because they are covered only by skin and small amounts of subcutaneous tissue. Susceptible areas include the sacrum and coccygeal areas, ischial tuberosities (especially in people who sit for prolonged periods), greater trochanter, heel, knee, malleolus, medial condyle of the tibia, fibular head, scapula, and elbow (Fig. 11-3).

\section*{IMPAIRED SENSORY PERCEPTION OR COGNITION}

Patients with sensory loss, impaired level of consciousness, or paralysis may not be aware of the discomfort associated with prolonged pressure on the skin and, therefore, may not change their position themselves to relieve the pressure. This prolonged pressure impedes blood flow, reducing nourishment of the skin and underlying tissues. A pressure ulcer may develop in a short period.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-199.jpg?height=1078&width=541&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=1284}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 11-3 Areas susceptible to pressure ulcers.}
\end{figure}

\section*{DECREASED TISSUE PERFUSION}

Any condition that reduces the circulation and nourishment of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (altered peripheral tissue perfusion) increases the risk of pressure ulcer development. Patients with diabetes mellitus experience an alteration in microcirculation. Similarly, patients with edema have impaired circulation and poor nourishment of the skin tissue. Obese patients have large amounts of poorly vascularized adipose tissue, which is susceptible to breakdown.

\section*{DECREASED NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

Nutritional deficiencies, anemias, and metabolic disorders also contribute to pressure ulcer development. Anemia, regardless of its cause, decreases the blood's oxygen-carrying ability and predisposes a patient to pressure ulcer formation. Patients who have low protein levels or who are in a negative nitrogen balance experience tissue wasting and inhibited tissue repair. Serum albumin is a sensitive indicator of protein deficiency; serum albumin levels of less than $3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ are associated with hypoalbuminemic tissue edema and increased risk of pressure ulcers. Specific nutrients, such as vitamin C and trace minerals, are needed for tissue maintenance and repair.

\section*{FRICTION AND SHEAR}

Mechanical forces also contribute to the development of pressure ulcers. Friction is the resistance to movement that occurs when two surfaces are moved across each other. Shear is created by the interplay of gravitational forces (forces that push the body down) and friction. When shear occurs, tissue layers slide over one another, blood vessels stretch and twist, and the microcirculation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue is disrupted. Evidence of deep tissue damage may be slow to develop and may
present through the development of a draining tract. The sacrum and heels are most susceptible to the effects of shear. Pressure ulcers from friction and shear occur when the patient slides down in bed (Fig. 11-4) or when the patient is moved or positioned improperly (eg, dragged up in bed). Spastic muscles and paralysis increase the patient's vulnerability to pressure ulcers related to friction and shear.

\section*{INCREASED MOISTURE}

Prolonged contact with moisture from perspiration, urine, feces, or drainage produces maceration (softening) of the skin. The skin reacts to the caustic substances in the excreta or drainage and becomes irritated. Moist, irritated skin is more vulnerable to pressure breakdown. Once the skin breaks, the area is invaded by microorganisms (eg, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), and infection occurs. Foul-smelling infectious drainage is present. The lesion may enlarge and allow a continuous loss of serum, which may further deplete the body of essential protein needed for tissue repair and maintenance. The lesion may continue to enlarge and extend deep into the fascia, muscle, and bone, with multiple sinus tracts radiating from the pressure ulcer. With extensive pressure ulcers, systemic infections may develop, frequently from gram-negative organisms.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

In older adults, the skin has diminished epidermal thickness, dermal collagen, and tissue elasticity. The skin is drier as a result of diminished sebaceous and sweat gland activity. Cardiovascular changes result in decreased tissue perfusion. Muscles atrophy, and bone structures become prominent. Diminished sensory perception and reduced ability to reposition oneself contribute to prolonged pressure on the skin. Therefore, the older adult is more susceptible to pressure ulcers, which cause pain and suffering and reduce quality of life (Agency for Health Care Policy and Research [AHCPR], 1994).

\section*{ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS}

In assessing the patient for potential risk for pressure ulcer development, the nurse assesses the patient's mobility, sensory perception, cognitive abilities, tissue perfusion, nutritional status,

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-200.jpg?height=567&width=853&top_left_y=1885&top_left_x=112}

\end{figure}
friction and shear forces, sources of moisture on the skin, and age. The nurse
- Assesses total skin condition at least twice a day
- Inspects each pressure site for erythema
- Assesses areas of erythema for blanching response
- Palpates the skin for increased warmth
- Inspects for dry skin, moist skin, breaks in skin
- Notes drainage and odor
- Evaluates level of mobility
- Notes restrictive devices (eg, restraints, splints)
- Evaluates circulatory status (eg, peripheral pulses, edema)
- Assesses neurovascular status
- Determines presence of incontinence
- Evaluates nutritional and hydration status
- Reviews the patient's record for laboratory studies, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, electrolytes, albumin, transferrin, and creatinine
- Notes present health problems
- Reviews current medications

Scales such as the Braden or Norton scale may be used to facilitate systematic assessment and quantification of a patient's risk for pressure ulcer, although the nurse needs to recognize that the reliability of these scales is not well established. They tend to overestimate those at risk and may promote unwarranted use of costly preventive equipment. See Chart 11-8 for a list of risk factors for development of pressure ulcers.

If a pressure area is noted, the nurse notes its size and location and may use a grading system to describe its severity (see Chart 11-9). Generally, a stage I pressure ulcer is an area of nonblanchable erythema, tissue swelling, and congestion, and the patient complains of discomfort. The skin temperature is elevated because of the increased vasodilation. The redness progresses to a dusky, cyanotic blue-gray appearance, which is the result of skin capillary occlusion and subcutaneous weakening.

A stage II pressure ulcer exhibits a break in the skin through the epidermis or the dermis. An abrasion, blister, or shallow crater may be seen. Necrosis occurs along with venous sludging and thrombosis and edema with cellular extravasation and infiltration.

A stage III pressure ulcer extends into the subcutaneous tissues. Clinically, a deep crater with or without undermining of adjacent tissues is noted.

A stage IV pressure ulcer extends into the underlying structures, including the muscle and, possibly, the bone. The skin lesion may appear insignificant when in reality, beneath the small surface ulcer is a large undermined area of necrotic tissue.

\section*{Risk Factors for Developing Pressure Ulcers}

From Weber, J. W., \& Kelley, J. (2002). Health assessment in nursing (2nd ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.

The appearance of purulent drainage or foul odor suggests an infection. With an extensive pressure ulcer, deep pockets of infection are often present. Drying and crusting of exudate may be present. Infection of a pressure ulcer may advance to osteomyelitis, pyarthrosis (pus formation within a joint cavity), sepsis, and septic shock.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on the assessment data, the nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Risk for impaired skin integrity
- Impaired skin integrity (related to immobility, decreased sensory perception, decreased tissue perfusion, decreased nutritional status, friction and shear forces, increased moisture, or advanced age)

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include relief of pressure, improved mobility, improved sensory perception, improved tissue perfusion, improved nutritional status, minimized friction and shear forces, dry surfaces in contact with skin, and healing of pressure ulcer, if present.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{RELIEVING PRESSURE}

Frequent changes of position are needed to relieve and redistribute the pressure on the patient's skin and to prevent prolonged reduced blood flow to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This can be accomplished by teaching the patient to change position or by turning and repositioning the patient. The patient's family members should be taught how to position and turn the patient at home to prevent pressure ulcers. Shifting weight allows the blood to flow into the ischemic areas and helps the tissues recover from the effects of pressure. Thus, the patient should be cared for as follows:
- Turned and repositioned at 1-hour to 2-hour intervals
- Encouraged to shift weight actively every 15 minutes

\section*{POSITIONING THE PATIENT}

The patient should be positioned laterally, prone, and dorsally in sequence unless a position is not tolerated or is contraindicated. The recumbent position is preferred to the semi-Fowler's position because of increased supporting body surface area in this position. In addition to regular turning, there should be small shifts of body weight, such as repositioning of an ankle, elbow, or shoulder. The skin is inspected at each position change and assessed for temperature elevation. If redness or heat is noted or if the patient complains of discomfort, pressure on the area must be relieved.

Another way to relieve pressure over bony prominences is the bridging technique, accomplished through the correct positioning of pillows. Just as a bridge is supported on pillars to allow traffic to move underneath, so can the body be supported by pillows to allow for space between bony prominences and the mattress. A pillow or commercial heel protector may be used to support the heels off the bed when the patient is supine. Placing pillows superior and inferior to the sacrum relieves sacral pressure. Supporting the patient in a 30 -degree side-lying position avoids pressure on the trochanter. In the aging patient, frequent small shifts of body weight may be effective. Placing a small rolled towel or sheepskin under a shoulder or hip will allow a return of blood flow to the skin in the area on which the patient is sitting or lying. The towel or sheepskin is moved around the patient's pressure points in a clockwise fashion.

\section*{USING PRESSURE-RELIEVING DEVICES}

At times, special equipment and beds may be needed to help relieve the pressure on the skin. These are designed to provide support for specific body areas or to distribute pressure evenly.

Patients sitting in wheelchairs for prolonged periods should have wheelchair cushions fitted and adjusted on an individualized basis, using pressure measurement techniques as a guide to selection and fitting. The aim is to redistribute pressure away from areas at risk for ulcers, but no cushion is able to eliminate excessive pressure completely. The patient should be reminded to shift weight frequently and to rise for a few seconds every 15 minutes while sitting in a chair (Fig. 11-5).

Static support devices (such as high-density foam, air, or liquid mattress overlays) distribute pressure evenly by bringing more of the patient's body surface into contact with the supporting surface. Gel-type flotation pads and air-fluidized beds reduce pressure. The weight of a body floating on a fluid system is evenly distributed over the entire supporting surface (according to Pascal's law). Therefore, as the patient's body sinks into the fluid, additional surface becomes available for weight bearing, body

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
weight per unit area is decreased, and there is less pressure on the body parts.

Soft, moisture-absorbing padding is also useful because the softness and resilience of padding provides for more even distribution of pressure and the dissipation and absorption of moisture, along with freedom from wrinkles and friction. Bony prominences may be protected by gel pads, sheepskin padding, or soft foam rubber beneath the sacrum, the trochanters, heels, elbows, scapulae, and back of the head when there is pressure on the sites.

Specialized beds have been designed to prevent pressure on the skin. Air-fluidized beds float the patient. Dynamic support surfaces, such as low air-loss pockets, alternately inflate and deflate sections to change support pressure for very high-risk patients who are critically ill and debilitated and cannot be repositioned to relieve pressure. Oscillating or kinetic beds change pressure by means of rocking movements of the bed that redistribute the patient's weight and stimulate circulation. These beds are frequently used with patients who have injuries due to multiple trauma.

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

The patient is encouraged to remain active and is ambulated whenever possible. When sitting, the patient is reminded to change positions frequently to redistribute weight. Active and passive exercises increase muscular, skin, and vascular tone. Activity stimulates circulation, which relieves tissue ischemia, the forerunner of pressure ulcers. For the patient at risk for pressure ulcers, turning and exercise schedules are essential: repositioning must occur around the clock.

\section*{IMPROVING SENSORY PERCEPTION}

The nurse helps the patient recognize and compensate for altered sensory perception. Depending on the origin of the alteration (eg, decreased level of consciousness, spinal cord lesion), specific interventions are selected. Strategies to improve cognition and
sensory perception may include stimulating the patient to increase awareness of self in the environment, encouraging the patient to participate in self-care, or supporting the patient's efforts toward active compensation for loss of sensation (eg, a paraplegic patient lifting up from the sitting position every 15 minutes). When decreased sensory perception exists, the patient and caregiver are taught to inspect potential pressure areas visually every morning and evening, using a mirror if necessary, for evidence of pressure ulcer development.

\section*{IMPROVING TISSUE PERFUSION}

Exercise and repositioning improve tissue perfusion. Massage of erythematous areas is avoided because damage to the capillaries and deep tissue may occur.

NURSING ALERT Avoid massaging reddened areas, because this may increase the damage to already traumatized skin and tissue.

In patients who have evidence of compromised peripheral circulation (eg, edema), positioning and elevation of the edematous body part to promote venous return and diminish congestion improve tissue perfusion. In addition, the nurse or family must be alert to environmental factors (eg, wrinkles in sheets, pressure of tubes) that may contribute to pressure on the skin and diminished circulation and remove the source of pressure.

\section*{IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL STATUS}

The patient's nutritional status must be adequate, and a positive nitrogen balance must be maintained, because pressure ulcers develop more quickly and are more resistant to treatment in patients with nutritional disorders. A high-protein diet with protein supplements may be helpful. Iron preparations may be necessary to raise the hemoglobin concentration so that tissue oxygen levels can be maintained within acceptable limits. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is necessary for tissue healing. Other nutrients associated with healthy skin include vitamin A, B vitamins, zinc, and sulfur. With balanced nutrition and hydration, the skin is able to remain healthy, and damaged tissues can be repaired (Table 11-2).

To assess nutritional status response to therapeutic strategies, the nurse monitors the patient's hemoglobin, albumin, and body weight weekly. Nutritional assessment is described in further detail in Chapter 5.

\section*{REDUCING FRICTION AND SHEAR}

Shear occurs when the patient is pulled, is allowed to slump, or moves by digging heels or elbows into the mattress. Raising the head of the bed by even a few centimeters increases the shearing force over the sacral area; therefore, the semireclining position is avoided in patients at risk. Proper positioning with adequate support is also important when a patient is sitting in a chair. Polyester sheepskin pads are thought to reduce shear and friction and may be used with at-risk patients.

NURSING ALERT To avoid shearing forces when repositioning the patient, the nurse lifts and avoids dragging the patient across a surface.

\section*{MINIMIZING IRRITATING MOISTURE}

Continuous moisture on the skin must be prevented by meticulous hygienic measures. Perspiration, urine, stool, and drainage must be removed from the skin promptly. The soiled skin should be washed immediately with mild soap and water and blotted dry with a soft towel. The skin may be lubricated with a bland lotion to keep it soft and pliable. Drying agents and powders are avoided. Topical barrier ointments (eg, petroleum jelly) may be helpful in protecting the skin of patients who are incontinent.

Absorbent pads that wick moisture away from the body should be used to absorb drainage. Patients who are incontinent need to be checked regularly and have their wet incontinence pads and linens changed promptly. Their skin needs to be cleansed and dried promptly.

\section*{PROMOTING PRESSURE ULCER HEALING}

Regardless of the stage of the pressure ulcer, the pressure on the area must be eliminated, because the ulcer will not heal until all pressure is removed. The patient must not lie or sit on the pres-

sure ulcer, even for a few minutes. Individualized positioning and turning schedules must be written in the plan of nursing care and followed meticulously.

In addition, inadequate nutritional status and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities must be corrected to promote healing. Wounds that drain body fluids and protein place the patient in a catabolic state and predispose to hypoproteinemia and serious secondary infections. Protein deficiency must be corrected to heal the pressure ulcer. Carbohydrates are necessary to "spare" the protein and to provide an energy source. Vitamin C and trace elements, especially zinc, are necessary for collagen formation and wound healing.

\section*{Stage I Pressure Ulcers}

To permit healing of stage I pressure ulcers, the pressure is removed to allow increased tissue perfusion, nutritional and fluid and electrolyte balance are maintained, friction and shear are reduced, and moisture to the skin is avoided.

\section*{Stage II Pressure Ulcers}

Stage II pressure ulcers have broken skin. In addition to measures listed for stage I pressure ulcers, a moist environment, in which migration of epidermal cells over the ulcer surface occurs more rapidly, should be provided to aid wound healing. The ulcer is gently cleansed with sterile saline solution. Use of a heat lamp to dry the open wound is avoided, as is use of antiseptic solutions that damage healthy tissues and delay wound healing. Semipermeable occlusive dressing, hydrocolloid wafers, or wet saline dressings are helpful in providing a moist environment for healing and in minimizing the loss of fluids and proteins from the body.

\section*{Stage III and IV Pressure Ulcers}

Stage III and IV pressure ulcers are characterized by extensive tissue damage. In addition to measures listed for stage I, these advanced draining, necrotic pressure ulcers must be cleaned (débrided) to create an area that will heal. Necrotic, devitalized tissue favors bacterial growth, delays granulation, and inhibits healing. Wound cleaning and dressing are uncomfortable; therefore, the nurse must prepare the patient for the procedure by explaining what will occur and administering prescribed analgesia.

Débridement may be accomplished by wet-to-damp dressing changes, mechanical flushing of necrotic and infective exudate, application of prescribed enzyme preparations that dissolve necrotic tissue, or surgical dissection. If an eschar covers the ulcer, it is removed surgically to ensure a clean, vitalized wound. Exudate may be absorbed by dressings or special hydrophilic powders, beads, or gels. Cultures of infected pressure ulcers are obtained to guide selection of antibiotic therapy.

After the pressure ulcer is clean, a topical treatment is prescribed to promote granulation. New granulation tissue must be protected from reinfection, drying, and damage, and care should be taken to prevent pressure and further trauma to the area. Dressings, solutions, and ointments applied to the ulcer should not disrupt the healing process. Multiple agents and protocols are used to treat pressure ulcers, but consistency is an important key to success. Objective evaluation of the pressure ulcer (eg, measurement of the pressure ulcer, inspection for granulation tissue) for response to the treatment protocol must be made every 4 to 6 days. Taking photographs at weekly intervals is a reliable strategy for monitoring the healing process, which may take weeks to months to complete.

Surgical intervention is necessary when the ulcer is extensive, when potential complications (eg, fistula) exist, and when the
ulcer does not respond to treatment. Surgical procedures include débridement, incision and drainage, bone resection, and skin grafting.

\section*{PREVENTING RECURRENCE}

Recurrence of pressure ulcers should be anticipated; therefore, active, preventive intervention and frequent continuing assessments are essential. The patient's tolerance for sitting or lying on the healed pressure area is increased gradually by increasing the time that pressure is allowed on the area in 5 - to 15 -minute increments. The patient is taught to increase mobility and to follow a regimen of turning, weight shifting, and repositioning. The patient teaching plan includes instruction on strategies to reduce the risk for development of pressure ulcers and methods to detect, inspect, and minimize pressure areas. Early recognition and intervention are keys to long-term management of potential impaired skin integrity.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH ALTERED ELIMINATION PATTERNS}

Urinary and bowel incontinence or constipation and impaction are problems that often occur in disabled patients. Incontinence curtails a person's independence, causing embarrassment and isolation. It occurs in up to $15 \%$ of the community-based elderly population, and almost half of nursing home residents are bowel or bladder incontinent or both. In addition, constipation may be a problem for patients with disabilities. Complete and predictable evacuation of the bowel is the goal. If a bowel routine is not established, the person may experience abdominal distention; small, frequent oozing of stool; or impaction.

\section*{Assessment}

Urinary incontinence can be classified as urge, reflex, stress, functional, or total incontinence (AHCPR, 1996). Urge incontinence is involuntary elimination of urine associated with a strong perceived need to void. Reflex (neurogenic) incontinence is associated with a spinal cord lesion that interrupts cerebral control, resulting in no sensory awareness of the need to void. Stress incontinence is associated with weakened perineal muscles that permit leakage of urine when intra-abdominal pressure is increased (eg, with coughing or sneezing). Functional incontinence refers to incontinence in patients with intact urinary physiology who experience mobility impairment, environmental barriers, or cognitive problems and are unable to reach and use the toilet before soiling themselves. Total incontinence occurs in patients who are unable to control excreta because of physiologic or psychological impairment; management of the excreta is the focus of nursing care. Urinary incontinence may result from multiple causes, including urinary tract infection, detrusor instability, bladder outlet obstruction or incompetence, neurologic impairment, bladder spasm or contracture, and inability to reach the toilet in time.

The health history is used to explore bladder and bowel function, symptoms associated with dysfunction, physiologic risk factors for elimination problems, perception of micturition and defecation cues, and functional toileting abilities. Previous and current fluid intake and voiding patterns may be helpful in designing the plan of nursing care. A record of times of voiding and amounts voided is kept for at least 48 hours. In addition, episodes of incontinence and associated activity (eg, coughing, sneezing, lifting), fluid intake time and amount, and medications are recorded. This record is analyzed and used to determine patterns and relationships of incontinence to other activities and factors.

The ability to get to the bathroom, manipulate clothing, and use the toilet are important functional factors that may be related to incontinence. Related cognitive functioning (perception of need to void, verbalization of need to void, and ability to learn to control urination) must also be assessed. In addition, the nurse reviews the results of the diagnostic studies (eg, urinalysis, urodynamic tests, postvoiding residual volumes). See the accompanying Gerontologic Considerations box for factors that affect the older adult.

Bowel incontinence and constipation may result from multiple causes, such as diminished or absent sphincter control, cognitive or perceptual impairment, neurogenic factors, diet, and immobility. The origin of the bowel problem must be determined.

The nurse assesses the patient's normal bowel patterns, nutritional patterns, use of laxatives, gastrointestinal problems (eg, colitis), bowel sounds, anal reflex and tone, and functional abilities.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Factors That Alter Elimination Patterns in the Older Adult
Decreased bladder capacity
Decreased muscle tone
Increased residual volumes
Delayed perception of elimination cues
Use of medications that alter elimination patterns, such as diuretics (increase volume of urine produced), sedatives (alter bladder sensitivity to cues), and adrenergics or anticholinergics (cause urinary retention)
Functional immobility
Sedentary lifestyle

The character and frequency of bowel movements are recorded and analyzed.

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses for the patient may include the following:
- Impaired bowel elimination
- Impaired urinary elimination

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals of the patient may include control of urinary incontinence or urinary retention, control of bowel incontinence, and regular elimination patterns.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING URINARY CONTINENCE}

After the nature of the urinary incontinence has been identified, a nursing plan of care is developed based on analysis of the assessment data. Various approaches to promotion of urinary continence have been designed. Most approaches attempt to condition the body to control urination or to minimize the occurrence of unscheduled urination. Selection of the approach depends on the cause and type of the patient's incontinence. For the program to be successful, the patient's participation and desire to avoid incontinence episodes are crucial, and an optimistic attitude with positive feedback for even slight gains is essential for success. Accurate recording of intake and output and of the response to selected strategies is essential for evaluation.

At no time should the fluid intake be restricted to decrease the frequency of urination. Sufficient fluid intake (2000 to $3000 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day according to patient needs) must be ensured. To optimize the likelihood of voiding as scheduled, measured amounts of fluids may be administered about 30 minutes before voiding attempts. In addition, most of the fluids should be consumed before evening to minimize the need to void frequently during the night.

The goal of bladder training is to restore the bladder to normal function. Bladder training can be used with cognitively intact patients experiencing urge incontinence. A voiding and toileting schedule is formulated based on analysis of the assessment data. The schedule specifies times for the patient to try to empty the bladder using a bedpan, toilet, or commode. Privacy should be provided during voiding efforts. The interval between voiding times in the early phase of the bladder training period is
short (90 to 120 minutes). The patient is encouraged not to void until the specified voiding time. Voiding success and episodes of incontinence are recorded. As the patient's bladder capacity and control increase, the interval is lengthened. Usually, there is a temporal relationship between drinking, eating, exercising, and voiding. The alert patient can participate in recording intake, activity, and voiding and can plan the schedule to achieve maximum continence. Barrier-free access to the toilet and modification of clothing can help the patient with functional incontinence to achieve self-care in toileting and continence.

Habit training is used to try to keep the patient dry by strict adherence to a toileting schedule and may be successful with stress, urge, or functional incontinence. In the case of a confused person, the caregiver takes the person to the toilet according to the schedule before involuntary voiding occurs. Simple cuing and consistency promote success. Periods of continence and successful voidings are positively reinforced.

Biofeedback is a system through which the patient learns consciously to contract excretory sphincters and control voiding cues. Cognitively intact patients who have stress or urge incontinence may gain bladder control through biofeedback.

Pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) strengthen the pubococcygeus muscle. The patient is instructed to tighten pelvic floor muscles for 4 seconds ten times, and this is repeated four to six times a day. Stopping and starting the stream during urination is recommended to increase control. Daily practice is essential. These exercises are helpful for cognitively intact women who experience stress incontinence.

Suprapubic tapping or stroking of the inner thigh may produce voiding by stimulating the voiding reflex arc in patients with reflex incontinence. This method is not always effective, however, because of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergy. As the bladder reflexively contracts to expel urine, the bladder sphincter reflexively closes, producing a high residual urine volume and an increased incidence of urinary tract infection.

Intermittent self-catheterization is an appropriate alternative for managing reflex incontinence, urinary retention, and overflow incontinence due to an overdistended bladder. The emphasis of patient teaching is on regular emptying of the bladder rather than sterility. Disabled patients reuse and clean catheters with bleach or hydrogen peroxide solutions or soap and water and may use a microwave oven to sterilize catheters. Aseptic intermittent catheterization technique is required in health care institutions because of the potential for bladder infection from resistant organisms. Intermittent self-catheterization may be difficult for patients with limited mobility, dexterity, or vision; however, family members can be taught the procedure.

Indwelling catheters are avoided if at all possible because of the high incidence of urinary tract infections with their use. Shortterm use may be needed during treatment of severe skin breakdown due to continued incontinence. Patients with disability who are unable to perform intermittent self-catheterization may elect to use a suprapubic catheter for long-term bladder management. Suprapubic catheters are easier to maintain than indwelling catheters. A fluid intake of $3000 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day must be encouraged.

External catheters (condom catheters) and leg bags to collect spontaneous voidings are useful for male patients with reflex or total incontinence. The appropriate design and size must be chosen for maximal success, and the patient or caregiver must be taught how to apply the condom catheter and how to provide daily hygiene, including skin inspection. Instruction on emptying the leg bag must also be provided, and modifications can be made for patients with limited hand dexterity. External collection
devices for women do exist, but difficulties with fit have precluded widespread use.

Incontinence pads (briefs) are used only as a last resort, because they only manage rather than solve the incontinence problem. Also, they have a negative psychological effect on the patient because many people think of them as diapers. Every effort should be made to reduce the incidence of incontinence episodes through the other methods that have been described. Incontinence pads may be useful at times for patients with stress or total incontinence to protect clothing, but they should be avoided whenever possible. When incontinence pads are used, they should wick moisture away from the body to minimize contact of moisture and excreta with the skin. Wet incontinence pads must be changed promptly, the skin cleansed, and a moisture barrier applied to protect the skin.

\section*{PROMOTING BOWEL CONTINENCE}

The goals of a bowel training program are to develop regular bowel habits and to prevent uninhibited bowel elimination. Regular, complete emptying of the lower bowel results in bowel continence. A bowel-training program takes advantage of the patient's natural reflexes. Regularity, timing, nutrition and fluids, exercise, and correct positioning promote predictable defection.

The nurse records defecation time, character of stool, nutritional intake, cognitive abilities, and functional self-care toileting abilities for 5 to 7 days. Analysis of this record is helpful when designing a bowel program for the patient with fecal incontinence.

Consistency in implementing the plan is essential. A regular time for defecation is established, and attempts at evacuation should be made within 15 minutes of the designated time daily. Natural gastrocolic and duodenocolic reflexes occur about 30 minutes after a meal; therefore, after breakfast is one of the best times to plan for bowel evacuation. If the patient had a previously established habit pattern at a different time of day, however, it should be followed.

The anorectal reflex may be stimulated by rectal suppository (eg, glycerin) or by mechanical stimulation (eg, digital stimulation with a lubricated gloved finger or anal dilator). Mechanical stimulation should be used only in patients with disability who have no voluntary motor function and no sensation as a result of injuries above the sacral segments of the spinal cord, such as quadriplegic, high paraplegic, or severely brain-injured patients. The technique is not effective in patients who do not have an intact sacral reflex arc (eg, those with flaccid paralysis). Mechanical stimulation, suppository insertion, or both should be initiated about 30 minutes before the scheduled bowel elimination time, and the interval between stimulation and defecation is noted for subsequent modification of the bowel program. Once the bowel routine is well established, stimulation with a suppository may not be necessary.

The patient should assume the normal squatting position (knees higher than the hips) and be in a private bathroom for defecation if at all possible, although a padded commode chair or bedside toilet is an acceptable alternative. Seating time is limited in patients who are at risk for skin breakdown. Bedpans should be avoided. A patient with disability who is unable to sit on a toilet should be positioned on the left side with legs flexed and the head of the bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees to increase intra-abdominal pressure. Protective padding is placed behind the buttocks. When possible, the patient is instructed to bear down and to contract the abdominal muscles. Massaging the abdomen from right to left facilitates movement of feces in the lower tract.

\section*{PREVENTING CONSTIPATION}

The record of bowel elimination, character of stool, food and fluid intake, level of activity, bowel sounds, medications, and other assessment data are reviewed to develop the plan of care. Multiple approaches may be used to prevent constipation. The diet should be well balanced and should include adequate intake of high-fiber foods (vegetables, fruits, bran) to prevent hard stools and to stimulate peristalsis. Fluid intake should be between 2 and $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day unless contraindicated. Prune juice or fig juice ( 120 mL ) taken 30 minutes before a meal once daily is helpful to some cases when constipation is a problem. Physical activity and exercise are encouraged, as is self-care in toileting. The patient is encouraged to respond to the natural urge to defecate. Privacy during toileting is provided. Stool softeners, bulk-forming agents, mild stimulants, and suppositories may be prescribed to stimulate defection and to prevent constipation.

\section*{Disability and Sexuality Issues}

An important issue confronting the patient with a disability, and a vital component of self-concept, is sexuality. Sexuality involves not only biologic sexual activity but also one's concept of masculinity or femininity. It affects the way a person reacts to others and is perceived by them, and it is expressed not only by physical intimacy but also by caring and emotional intimacy.

Sexuality problems faced by patients with disabilities include limited access to information about sexuality, lack of opportunity to form friendships and loving relationships, impaired selfimage, and low self-esteem. The person with a disability may have physical and emotional difficulties that interfere with sexual activities. For example, diabetes and spinal cord injury may affect the ability to have an erection. The patient who has suffered a heart attack or stroke may fear having a life-threatening event (eg, another heart attack or stroke) during sexual activity. He or she may fear loss of bowel or bladder control during intimate moments. Changes in desire for sex and in the quality of sexual activities can occur for the patient and the partner, who
may be too involved as the caregiver to have desire and energy for sexual activities.

Unfortunately, society and some health care providers contribute to these problems by ignoring patients' sexuality and by viewing disabled persons as asexual. Health care providers' own discomfort and lack of knowledge related to sexuality issues prevent them from providing the patient with disability and his or her partner interventions that promote healthy intimacy. Nurses caring for persons with disability must recognize and address sexual issues in order to promote feelings of self-worth, which are essential to total rehabilitation. The nurse should give the patient "permission" to discuss sexuality concerns and show a willingness to listen and help the patient overcome these concerns. The nurse also has a key role to provide appropriate patient education about how specific disabilities affect sexual function. For example, arthritis produces fatigue and morning stiffness, making planned afternoon sex a better alternative; spinal cord injury impairs erections and ejaculations; and traumatic brain injury may produce an increased or decreased interest in sexual behavior. Classes, books, movies, and support groups are useful tools to help patients learn about sexuality and disability. When open discussion and education about disability and sexuality do not result in a patient's achieving his or her sexuality goals, the nurse should refer the patient for ongoing counseling with a sex counselor or therapist. The patient may need training in communication and in social and assertiveness skills to develop desired relationships.

\section*{Fatigue}

People with disabilities frequently experience fatigue. Physical and emotional weariness may be caused by discomfort and pain associated with a chronic health problem, deconditioning associated with prolonged periods of bed rest and immobility, impaired motor function requiring excessive expenditure of energy to ambulate, and the frustrations of performing ADLs. Ineffective coping with the disability, unresolved grief, and depression can also contribute to fatigue. The patient can use coping strategies to manage the psychological impact of the disability and pain management techniques to control the associated discomforts (see Chapter 13 for a discussion of pain management). In addition, the nurse can teach the patient to manage fatigue through priority setting and energy-conserving techniques. Special teaching strategies for patients with disabilities are included in Chart 11-10.

\section*{Home and Community-Based Care}

An important goal of rehabilitation is to assist the person to return to the home environment after learning to manage the disability. A referral system maintains continuity of care when the patient is transferred to the home or to an extended care facility. The plan for discharge is formulated when the patient is first admitted to the hospital, and discharge plans are made with the patient's functional potential in mind.

The patient's support system (family, friends) is assessed. The attitudes of family and friends toward the patient, the disability, and the return home are important in making a successful transition to home. Not all families are able to carry on the arduous programs of exercise, physical training, and personal care that a patient may need. They may not have the resources or stability to care for a severely disabled family member. Even a stable family may be overwhelmed by the physical, emotional, economic, and energy strains of a disabling condition in their family member.

\section*{Chart 11-10 - PATIENT EDUCATION Learning to Cope With Disabilities}

The following points may be useful in teaching patients how to reduce their energy output and conserve their strength to achieve a meaningful lifestyle.
Take Control of Your Life
- Face the reality of your disability.
- Emphasize areas of strength.
- Remain outward looking.
- Seek inventive ways to tackle problems.
- Share concerns and frustrations.
- Maintain and improve general health.
- Plan for recreation.

\section*{Have Well-Defined Goals and Priorities}
- Keep priorities in order; eliminate nonessential activities.
- Plan and pace your activities.

\section*{Organize Your Life}
- Plan each day.
- Organize work.
- Perform tasks in steps.
- Distribute heavy work throughout the day or week.

\section*{Conserve Energy}
- Rest before undertaking difficult tasks.
- Stop the activity before fatigue occurs.
- Continue with an exercise conditioning program to strengthen muscles.

\section*{Control Your Environment}
- Try to be well organized.
- Keep possessions in the same place, so that they can be found with a minimum of effort.
- Store equipment (personal care, crafts, work) in a box or basket.
- Use energy-conservation and work-simplification techniques.
- Keep work within easy reach and in front of you.
- Use adaptive equipment, self-help aids, and labor-saving devices.
- Recruit assistance from others; delegate when necessary.
- Take safety precautions.

Members of the rehabilitation team must not judge the family but rather should provide supportive interventions that help them attain their highest level of function.

The family needs to know as much as possible about the patient's condition and care so that they do not fear the patient's return home. The nurse develops methods for coping with problems that may arise with the patient and family. A skill checklist individualized for the patient and family can be developed to make certain that the family is proficient in assisting the patient with certain tasks. See Chart 11-11 for an example of a home care checklist.

\section*{ComplementaryTherapies}

Individuals with disabilities may seek a variety of different therapies. For some, therapeutic horseback riding influences the whole body and has a profound effect on all body systems. Instructors are certified through the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association. Pet therapy and canine companion programs have reduced stress and promoted coping for many disabled persons. Some animals including simian monkeys can pick up the phone, retrieve small assistive devices, assist with drinking beverages, or assist with activating emergency calls. The "working" animals pro-
vide companionship as well as physical assistance for elderly persons and persons with disability who may live alone.

Nurses can also encourage persons with disability to take advantage of community programs. T'ai chi classes improve muscle strength, balance, and coordination and can help to prevent falls in the elderly. Disabled persons, including wheelchair users, can participate in T'ai chi classes for improved balance, coordination, muscle strength and control, and a sense of well-being.

Daily journal writing has helped depressed individuals and their families overcome many emotionally draining reactions to adverse circumstances. Nurses are instrumental in teaching patients and family members this cost-effective technique. Relaxation exercises can also be taught by the nurse and encouraged in all settings, including the hospital, rehabilitation setting, outpatient areas, and the home.

\section*{Continuing Care}

The home care nurse may visit the patient in the hospital, interview the patient and family, and review the ADL sheet to learn which activities the patient can perform. This helps ensure continuity of care and that the patient does not regress but instead maintains the independence gained while in the hospital or rehabilitation setting. The family may need to purchase, borrow, or improvise needed equipment, such as safety rails, a raised toilet seat or commode, or a tub bench. Ramps may need to be built or doorways widened to achieve full access.

Family members are taught how to use equipment and are given a copy of the equipment manufacturer's instruction booklet, the names of resource people, lists of equipment-related supplies, and locations where they may be obtained. A written summary of the care plan is included in family teaching.

A network of support services and communication systems may be required to enhance opportunities for independent living. The nurse uses collaborative, administrative skills to coordinate these activities and to pull together the network of care. The nurse also provides skilled care, initiates additional referrals when indicated, and serves as the patient's advocate and counselor when obstacles are encountered. The nurse continues to reinforce prior teaching and helps the patient to set and achieve attainable goals. The degree to which the patient adapts to the home and community environment depends on the confidence and self-esteem developed during the rehabilitation process and on the acceptance, support, and reactions of the family, employer, and community members.

There is a growing trend toward independent living by people with severe disabilities, either alone or in groups that share resources. Preparation for independent living should include training in managing a household and working with personal care attendants as well as training in mobility. The goal is integration into the commu-nity-living and working in the community with accessible housing, employment, public buildings, transportation, and recreation.

State rehabilitation administration agencies provide services to assist people with disability in obtaining the help they need to engage in gainful employment. These services include diagnostic, medical, and mental health services. Counseling, training, placement, and follow-up services are available to help people with disabilities select and attain jobs.

If the patient is transferred to an extended care facility, the transition is planned to promote continued progress. Independence gained continues to be supported, and progress is fostered. Adjustment to the extended care facility is facilitated through communication. The family is encouraged to visit, to be involved, and to take the patient home on weekends and holidays if possible.

1. The patient who has just been admitted to your unit in the rehabilitation hospital is a 58 -year-old woman who is recovering from a stroke. She has paralysis on one side, but speech is intact. In discussing the patient's level of functioning with the physical rehabilitation team, describe the kinds of self-care activities that you would assess in developing a rehabilitation plan for the patient.
2. An elderly man who has lost his leg as a result of diabetes is to be discharged to his home, where he will be cared for by his family. The family members are particularly concerned about how to prevent pressure ulcers, because the patient is a diabetic and will be confined primarily to a wheelchair. Describe the instructions you would give them. How might your teaching strategies differ if family members converse primarily in their native tongue, which is not English?
3. You are caring for a young man who has sustained a traumatic brain injury and multiple fractures in a motor vehicle crash. He is ready to return home to continue rehabilitation as an outpatient. You accompany the physical and occupational therapist to assess the patient's home environment in anticipation of his discharge. Compare the types of safety factors that might be considered if the patient lives in a single-story house, in a two-story house, in a two-room apartment in a high-rise building, or on a farm.

\section*{Health Care of the Older Adult}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the aging American population based on demographic trends and statistical data.
2. Discuss the potential economic effect of the large aging population in America on health care.
3. Identify major legal issues relevant to the care of older people.
4. Compare and contrast the physiologic aspects of aging with those of middle-age adults.
5. Describe the significance of preventive health care and health promotion for the elderly.
6. Identify the important physical and mental health problems of aging and their effects on the functioning of older people and their families.
7. Identify the major geriatric syndromes and their effects on the individual patient.
8. Specify nursing implications related to medication therapy in older people.
9. Examine the concerns of older people and their families in the home and community, in the acute care setting, and in long-term care facilities.
10. Identify the resources available to allow older adults to receive medical and nursing services in their own homes.

Aging, the normal process of time-related change, begins with birth and continues throughout life. The older segment of the American population is growing more rapidly than the rest of the population: the U.S. Census Bureau projects that by the year 2030, there will be more people older than 65 years of age ( $22 \%$ ) than people younger than 18 years of age ( $21 \%$ ). As the older population increases, the number of people who live to be very old will also increase. Health professionals will be challenged to design strategies that address the higher prevalence of illness within this aging population. Many chronic conditions commonly found among older people can be managed, limited, and even prevented. Older people are more likely to maintain good health and functional independence if appropriate community-based support services are available.

\section*{Overview of Aging}

\section*{DEMOGRAPHICS OF AGING}

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, life expectancy, the average number of years that a person can be expected to live, has risen dramatically over the past century. In 1900, the average life expectancy was 47.3 years, but by 1998 that figure had increased to 76.7 years. According to data from the National Vital Statistics System, in 1998 a 75 -year old man could be expected to live until the age of 85, and a 75-year old woman could be expected to live until the age of 87 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2000).

By 2030, people older than 65 years of age will account for $22 \%$ of the population, compared with $13 \%$ in 2001 (Fig. 12-1).

More than 70\% of elders receive most of their care from informal caregivers. Because many of the baby boomers (those born between 1940 and 1960) tended to have children later in life, these children will face the competing demands of caring for their aging parents while caring for their own dependent children (Spillman, 2001).

\end{figure}

Although most older adults enjoy good health, in national surveys as many as $40 \%$ of adults age 65 and older report disability. Chronic disease is the major cause of disability, and heart disease, cancer, and stroke continued to be the three most significant causes of death in persons 65 years of age and older in the United States between 1980 and 1998 (Table 12-1). Alzheimer's disease accounted for almost 44,000 deaths in 1999 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2000).

\section*{HEALTH CARE COSTS OF AGING}

There are serious concerns about whether there will be sufficient health services available as more and more persons in the United States become eligible for publicly funded health programs. The two major health programs in the United States are Medicare and Medicaid, both of which are overseen by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), formerly the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). Medicare is funded by the Federal gov-

ernment, whereas Medicaid is funded jointly by the Federal and state governments to provide health care for the poor. Medicaid is the dominant public payer of nursing home costs. Eligibility and costs for these services vary from state to state.

Medicare funding covered $32 \%$ of the costs of hospital services and $22 \%$ of the costs of physician services in the United States in 1998. Nursing home care, in contrast, was financed primarily by Medicaid (46\%) and out-of-pocket payments (33\%) (National Center for Health Statistics, 2000).

\section*{ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE OLDER ADULT}

Loss of rights, victimization, and other grave problems face the person who has made no plans for personal and property management in the event of disability or death. The advice and services of a competent attorney regarding financial and personal issues can preserve future autonomy and self-determination. The nurse as an advocate can encourage the older person to prepare advance directives for future decision making in the event of incapacitation (Plotkin \& Roche, 2000).

A power of attorney is a legal agreement that authorizes a designated person to act in specific, outlined circumstances on behalf of the signer. This is a form of voluntary guardianship, permission for which is freely granted when the older person is competent. Unless stated otherwise, a power of attorney is invalidated on the incapacity of the signer. A durable power of attorney is a similar agreement that continues even if the older person is disabled or incapacitated. This power can include the authorization to make financial or personal decisions, depending on the desires of the signer (Chart 12-1).

A trust is another option that the competent older person can consider. In a trust, the person designates someone to manage his
or her property, stipulates how and under what circumstances the property will be managed, and designates a beneficiary. If incompetency or disability occurs, management of the property is undertaken according to the person's wishes.

If no advance arrangement has been made, and the older person appears unable to make decisions, anyone can petition the court for a competency hearing. If the court rules that the person is incompetent, the judge will appoint a guardian-a third party who is given powers by the court to assume responsibility for making financial or personal decisions for that person. There are two kinds of guardians: guardian of the person and guardian of the estate. Because such a court action strips the civil liberties and constitutional rights from the older person, a potential for great harm exists. Safeguards include the following: (1) the older person must be given notice, (2) he or she must be given an
opportunity to be legally represented, and (3) medical testimony can be cross-examined. A less restrictive form of guardianship, called limited guardianship, transfers to the appointed guardian only those powers or duties that the older person cannot exercise. Although this alternative is not widely used, it remains an option.

An advance directive is a formal, legally endorsed document that provides instructions for care (living will) or names a proxy decision maker (durable power of attorney) and is to be implemented in the event of the signer's future decision-making incapacity. This written document must be signed by the person and by two witnesses; a copy should be given to the physician and incorporated into the medical record. The person must understand that this document is not meant to be used only when certain (or all) types of medical treatment are withheld; rather, it allows for a detailed description of all health care preferences, including full use of all available medical interventions. The health care proxy has the authority to interpret the patient's wishes on the basis of the medical circumstances of the situation and is not restricted to deciding only whether life-sustaining treatment can be withdrawn or withheld.

In 1990, the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA), a federally mandated law, was enacted to require patient education about advance directives at the time of hospital admission, along with documentation of this education. The PSDA is also mandated in nursing homes to enhance resident autonomy by increasing involvement in health care decision making. A growing body of research indicates that nursing homes implement the PSDA more vigorously than hospitals do. In both settings, however, the documentation and placement of advance directives in the medical record varies considerably from facility to facility, as does the education of patients about advance directives. Processes for fulfilling the requirements of the law are continuously being revised in many facilities to promote compliance. The PSDA provides no guidelines regarding how often the advance directives of nursing home residents should be reviewed. Continuing quality improvement programs that establish guidelines for review are more likely to exist in nursing homes in which ethics committees are present. The nurse can play a vital role in advocating for the patient when the patient or a family member is unable to do so.

\section*{NURSING CARE OF OLDER ADULTS}

Geriatrics, the study of old age, includes the physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and management of the diseases of older adults. The broader field of gerontology, or the study of the aging process, draws from the biologic, psychological, and sociologic sciences. Because hospitalized patients are being discharged to home "quicker and sicker" than ever before, nurses in all settings, including hospital, home care, rehabilitation, and outpatient settings, need to be knowledgeable about geriatric nursing principles and skilled in meeting the needs of elderly patients.

Gerontologic or geriatric nursing is the field of nursing that specializes in the care of the elderly. The Standards and Scope of Gerontological Nursing Practice were originally developed in 1969 by the American Nurses Association; they were revised in 1976 and again in 1987. The nurse gerontologist can be either a specialist or a generalist offering comprehensive nursing care to older persons by combining the basic nursing process of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation with a specialized knowledge of aging. Currently, nurses from all nursing programs, including vocational programs (LPN/LVN), traditional hospital programs, and college degree programs (ADN/BSN), as well as master's prepared advanced practice nurses (clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, and nurse anesthetists), care for older adults.

Gerontologic nursing is provided in acute care, skilled and assisted living, community, and home settings. Its goals include promoting and maintaining functional status and helping older adults to identify and use their strengths to achieve optimal independence. The nurse helps the older person to maintain dignity and maximum autonomy despite physical, social, and psychological losses. The nurse who becomes certified in gerontologic nursing has specialized knowledge in the acute and chronic changes specific to older people. The use of advanced practice nurses (APNs) in long-term care has proved to be very effective: when APNs using current scientific knowledge about clinical problems interface with nursing home staff, significantly less deterioration in affect and overall health issues has been demonstrated (Ryden et al., 2000).

Because old age is a normal occurrence that encompasses all experiences of life, care and concern for the elderly cannot be limited to one discipline, but is best provided through a cooperative effort. An interdisciplinary team, through comprehensive geriatric assessment, can combine expertise and resources to provide insight into all aspects of the aging process. Nurses collaborate with the interdisciplinary team to obtain non-nursing services and provide a holistic approach to care.

\section*{Normal Age-Related Changes and Health Promotion Activities}

Intrinsic aging (from within the person) refers to those changes caused by the normal aging process that are genetically programmed and essentially universal within a species. Universality is the major criterion used to distinguish normal from abnormal aging. Extrinsic aging results from influences outside the person. Illness and disease, air pollution, and sunlight are examples of extrinsic factors that may hasten the aging process and that can be eliminated or reduced through effective health care interventions.

Cellular and extracellular changes of old age cause a change in physical appearance and a decline in function. Measurable changes in shape and body makeup occur. The body's ability to maintain homeostasis becomes increasingly diminished with cellular aging, and organ systems cannot function at full efficiency because of cellular and tissue deficits. Cells become less able to replace themselves, and they accumulate a pigment known as lipofuscin. A degradation of elastin and collagen causes connective tissue to become stiffer and less elastic.

The well-being of an aged person depends on physical, mental, social, and environmental factors. A total assessment includes an evaluation of all major body systems, social and mental status, and the ability of the person to function independently despite a chronic illness. Table 12-2 summarizes the signs and symptoms of age-related changes in the functioning of body systems and suggested nursing interventions.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF AGING}

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the aged. The heart valves become thicker and stiffer, and the heart muscle and arteries lose their elasticity. Calcium and fat deposits accumulate within arterial walls, and veins become increasingly tortuous. Although function is maintained under normal circumstances, the cardiovascular system has less reserve and responds less efficiently to stress. The maximum cardiac output decreases by

about $25 \%$ from age 20 to age 80 . Under conditions of stress, both the maximum cardiac output and the maximum HR diminish gradually. The relationship between maximum HR and age is as follows:
$$\text { Normal maximum HR for age }=220 \text { - age in years }$$

Hypertension has been shown to be a serious risk factor at all ages for cardiovascular disease and stroke. A diagnosis of hypertension is made only after it has been confirmed by at least two subsequent readings. In older people, hypertension is classified as follows:

Isolated systolic hypertension: the systolic reading exceeds 140 mm Hg , and the diastolic measurement is normal or near normal (less than 90 mm Hg )
Primary hypertension: the diastolic pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg regardless of the systolic pressure
Secondary hypertension: hypertension that can be attributed to an underlying cause
Cardiovascular dysfunction may manifest as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, intermittent claudication (leg pain caused by walking), peripheral vascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, dysrhythmias, cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), or myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Heart failure (HF) is the number one cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly population in the United States. Older patients often present with different symptoms than those seen in younger patients. Typically, younger persons present for care with the symptoms of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and peripheral edema, whereas older patients typically report fatigue, nausea, and abdominal discomfort. In the younger population, men are more prone to HF , but in the elderly population far greater numbers of women develop it. Depending on its cause, HF can require various forms of therapy. The current standard of therapy for HF includes diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and, digoxin. Several large studies have also indicated that carefully monitored, low-dose beta-blockers and spironolactone can decrease mortality (Rittenhouse, 2001).

Cardiovascular health can be promoted by regular exercise, proper diet, weight control, regular blood pressure measurements, stress management, and smoking cessation. To avoid lightheadedness, fainting, and possible falls caused by orthostatic hypotension, the older person should be counseled to rise slowly (from a lying, to a sitting, to a standing position); to avoid straining when having a bowel movement; and to consider having five or six small meals each day, rather than three, to minimize the hypotension that can occur after a large meal. Extremes in temperature should be avoided, including hot showers and whirlpool baths. Yard work should be limited to no more than 20 minutes on hot summer days. Exposure to wind or cold weather also should be avoided because of the risk of dizziness or falling associated with slower adjustments of blood pressure. If an individual experiences dependent edema as the day progresses, the use of elastic compression stockings helps to minimize venous pooling.

\section*{Respiratory System}

Age-related changes in the respiratory system affect lung capacity and function and include increased anteroposterior chest diameter, osteoporotic collapse of vertebrae resulting in kyphosis (increased convex curvature of the spine), calcification of the costal cartilages and reduced mobility of the ribs, diminished efficiency of the respiratory muscles, increased lung rigidity, and decreased alveolar surface area. Increased rigidity or loss of elastic recoil in the lung results in increased residual lung volume and decreased vital capacity. Gas exchange and diffusing capacity are also diminished. Decreased cough efficiency, reduced ciliary activity, and increased respiratory dead space make the older person more vulnerable to respiratory infections.

Health promotion activities that help elderly persons maintain adequate respiratory function include regular exercise, appropriate fluid intake, pneumococcal vaccination, yearly influenza immunizations, and avoidance of people who are ill. As with people of all ages, smoking cessation and frequent hand hygiene are prudent health practices. Hospitalized older adults should be frequently reminded to cough and take deep breaths, particularly postoperatively, because their decreased lung capacity and decreased cough efficiency predispose them to respiratory infections and atelectasis.

\section*{Integumentary System}

The functions of the skin include protection, temperature regulation, sensation, and excretion. With aging, changes occur that affect the function and appearance of the skin. The epidermis and dermis become thinner. Elastic fibers are reduced in number, and collagen becomes stiffer. Subcutaneous fat diminishes, particularly in the extremities. Decreased numbers of capillaries in the skin result in diminished blood supply. These changes cause a loss of resiliency and wrinkling and sagging of the skin. Hair pigmentation decreases, resulting in gradual graying. The skin becomes drier and susceptible to irritations because of decreased activity of the sebaceous and sweat glands. These changes in the integument reduce tolerance to extremes of temperature and to exposure to the sun.

Strategies to promote healthy skin function include avoiding exposure to the sun, using a lubricating skin cream, avoiding long soaks in the tub, and maintaining adequate intake of water ( 8 to 10 eight-ounce glasses per day).

\section*{Reproductive System}

Ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone ceases with menopause. Changes occurring in the female reproductive system include thinning of the vaginal wall, along with a narrowing in size and a loss of elasticity; decreased vaginal secretions, resulting in vaginal dryness, itching, and decreased acidity; involution (atrophy) of the uterus and ovaries; and decreased pubococcygeal muscle tone, resulting in a relaxed vagina and perineum. These changes contribute to vaginal bleeding and painful intercourse.

In older men, the penis and testes decrease in size, and levels of androgens diminish. Erectile dysfunction may develop with concomitant cardiovascular disease, neurologic disorders, diabetes, or even respiratory disease, which limits exercise tolerance.

Sexual desire and activity decline but do not disappear. The use of water-based lubricants can help prevent painful intercourse. Local estrogen replacement intravaginally enhances vaginal tissue without the risks and side effects of oral estrogen. Several modalities are available for treatment of erectile dysfunction, which is linked to cardiovascular, neurologic, endocrine, or occasionally psychological dysfunction. The use of vacuum penile pumps, local injection or placement of vasostimulating medication into the urethral opening, and use of an oral medication, sildenafil citrate (Viagra), have all proved effective for some patients. Sildenafil citrate is contraindicated in patients who are taking oral nitrates.

If significant sexual dysfunction is present, referral to a gynecologist or urologist is warranted. For both men and women, maintenance of a daily physical exercise routine promotes enhanced sexual performance.

\section*{Genitourinary System}

The genitourinary system continues to function adequately in older people, although there is a decrease in kidney mass, primarily because of a loss of nephrons. Changes in kidney function include a decreased filtration rate, diminished tubular function with less efficiency in resorbing and concentrating the urine, and a slower restoration of acid-base balance in response to stress. Older women often suffer from stress or urge incontinence, or both. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate gland), which is a common finding in older men, causes a gradual increase in urine retention and overflow incontinence. Prostate cancer, a slow-growing cancer, is most often seen in men older than

70 years of age. Kidney and bladder cancers are most frequently seen after the age of 50 years. Smoking is known to be a primary causative agent of these carcinomas.

Adequate consumption of fluids is important to reduce the risk of bladder infections and urinary incontinence. Other healthy habits include having ready access to toilet facilities and voiding every 2 to 3 hours while awake. Avoidance of bladderirritating substances-such as caffeinated, carbonated, and acidic beverages, Nutra-sweet, and alcohol-will greatly reduce urinary urgency and frequency. Water intake should be increased to avoid concentrated urine, which causes urinary urgency.

Pelvic floor exercises, first described by Kegel (1948), can also be extremely useful in reducing the symptoms of stress and urge incontinence. Teaching the patient how to do the exercises begins with identifying the pubococcygeus muscle, which is the same muscle used to hold back flatus or to voluntarily stop the flow of urine without contracting the abdomen, buttocks, or inner thigh muscles. The pelvic muscles are first tightened and then relaxed, maintaining a 5 -second contraction with 10 -second rest intervals. This exercise should be routinely practiced for 30 to 80 repetitions each day; additional repetitions are discouraged because of the risk of fatigue of the muscle. Because achieving better muscle control takes at least several months to accomplish, the elderly person is encouraged to consistently perform the exercises. To maintain pubococcygeus muscle control, these daily exercises must continue indefinitely. The use of biofeedback to confirm the correct execution of these exercises increases their effectiveness significantly.

As menopause approaches, a woman's circulating estrogen decreases, and, as a result, the pelvic floor is deprived of its needed blood supply and nutrients. This causes increasing stress and urge incontinence. Through the use of biofeedback-assisted pelvic muscle exercise, an individual can successfully regain bladder function. These exercises are also recommended for men with dribbling incontinence related to prostatectomy. The nurse instructs the patient to tighten the rectal sphincter until the penis and testes slightly lift. Frequent repetition produces the desired muscle tone.

Constipation can be a major factor contributing to urinary incontinence. The patient is encouraged to eat a high-fiber diet, drink adequate fluids, and increase mobility to promote regular bowel function.

Urinary tract infections are prevalent in older women. The reasons include the effects of decreased estrogen, which shortens the urethral length, allowing easier passage of bacteria into the bladder; less overall fluid consumption, which causes a concentrated urine in which bacteria can proliferate; and the introduction of bacteria from the rectum as a result of poor bathroom hygiene secondary to impaired mobility and joint changes. Limited range of motion of the arm and limited hand dexterity often result in a woman's cleansing the perineal area in a back-to-front motion, causing bacteria such as Escherichia coli to be introduced to the urethral meatus and thus into the bladder (Degler, 2000b).

\section*{Gastrointestinal System}

The older adult is at increased risk for impaired nutrition. Periodontal disease leading to tooth decay and loss of teeth is common. Salivary flow diminishes, and the older person may experience a dry mouth. A preference for sweet and salty foods results from a decrease of taste receptors. Major complaints often center on feelings of fullness, heartburn, and indigestion. Gastric motility may decrease, resulting in delayed emptying of stomach contents.

Diminished secretion of acid and pepsin reduces the absorption of iron, calcium, and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Absorption of nutrients in the small intestine also appears to diminish with age. The function of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas is generally maintained, although absorption and tolerance to fat may decrease. The incidence of gallstones and common bile duct stones increases progressively with advancing years.

Difficulty in swallowing, or dysphagia, affects 1 in 17 people, including 6.2 million Americans over the age of 60 years, with 300,000 to 600,000 new cases diagnosed each year. It is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. It results from interruption or dysfunction of neural pathways, such as can occur with stroke. It may also develop from dysfunction of the striated and smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract in up to $50 \%$ of patients with Parkinson's disease and in those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, poliomyelitis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). Aspiration of food or fluid is the most serious complication and can occur in the absence of coughing or choking (Galvan, 2001).

Constipation is common in aged people. When mild, the symptoms involve abdominal discomfort and flatulence, but more serious consequences include fecal impaction that contributes to diarrhea around the impaction, fecal incontinence, and obstruction. Predisposing factors for constipation include lack of dietary bulk, prolonged use of laxatives, the use of some medications, inactivity, insufficient fluid intake, and excessive dietary fat. Another factor may be ignoring the urge to defectate.

Gastrointestinal health promotion practices include receiving regular dental care; eating small, frequent meals; avoiding heavy activity after eating; eating a high-fiber, low-fat diet; ingesting an adequate amount of fluids; establishing regular bowel habits; and avoiding the use of laxatives and antacids. Understanding that there is a direct correlation between loss of smell and taste perception and food intake helps caregivers to intervene to maintain elderly patients' health.

\section*{Nutritional Health}

The social, psychological, and physiologic functions of eating influence the dietary habits of the aged person. Decreased physical activity and a slower metabolic rate reduce the number of calories needed by the older adult to maintain an ideal weight. Apathy, immobility, depression, loneliness, poverty, inadequate knowledge, lack of oral health, and lack of taste discrimination also contribute to suboptimal nutrient intake. Budgetary constraints and physical limitations may impair food shopping and meal preparation. Education regarding healthy versus "empty-calorie" foods is helpful.

Health promotion teaching includes encouraging a diet that is low in sodium and saturated fats and high in vegetables, fruits, and fish. The older adult requires a variety of foods to maintain balanced nutrition. No more than $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of dietary calories should be consumed as fat. Reducing salt intake is also advocated, because sodium reduction has been shown to correct hypertension in some people. Protein intake should remain the same in later adulthood as in earlier years. Carbohydrates, a major source of energy, should supply the diet with $55 \%$ to $60 \%$ of the daily calories. Simple sugars should be avoided and complex carbohydrates encouraged. Potatoes, whole grains, brown rice, and fruit provide the person with minerals, vitamins, and fiber and should be encouraged. Drinking 8 to 10 eight-ounce glasses of water per day is recommended unless contraindicated by a med-
ical condition. A multivitamin each day helps to maintain daily nutritional needs.

\section*{Sleep}

Sleep disturbances frequently occur in older people, affecting more than $50 \%$ of adults 65 years of age or older. The elderly often experience variations in their normal sleep-wake cycles, and the lack of quality sleep at night often creates the need for napping during the day. Laboratory screening can help to rule out disease processes that might be affecting an older person's ability to sleep at night. If a spouse notes excessive snoring, a sleep study is indicated to rule out sleep apnea. The nurse can recommend prudent sleep hygiene behaviors such as avoiding daytime napping, eating a light snack before bedtime, and decreasing the overall time in bed to adjust for the fewer hours of sleep needed than when the patient was younger (Grandjean \& Gibbons, 2000).

\section*{Musculoskeletal System}

A gradual, progressive decrease in bone mass begins before the age of 40 years. Excessive loss of bone density results in osteoporosis, which affects both older men and women but is most prevalent in postmenopausal women. It is also seen in older men who are receiving hormone treatments for prostate cancer. A higher incidence is found among northern Europeans and Asians. Its typical form is associated with inactivity, inadequate calcium intake, loss of estrogens, and a history of cigarette smoking. The danger of fracture as a result of bone reabsorption is especially high for the dorsal portion of the vertebra, humerus, radius, femur, and tibia. A loss of height occurs in later life as a result of osteoporotic changes of the spine, kyphosis (excessive convex curvature of the spine), and flexion of the hips and knees. These changes negatively affect mobility, balance, and internal organ function (Fig. 12-2).

The muscles diminish in size and lose strength, flexibility, and endurance with decreased activity and advanced age. Back pain is common. Beginning in middle age, the cartilage of joints progressively deteriorates. Degenerative joint disease is found in everyone past the age of 70 years.

Calcium supplements, vitamin D, fluoride, estrogens, and weight-bearing exercises are often prescribed for the person who is at high risk for or already has osteoporosis. Although osteoporosis cannot be reversed, the disease process can be slowed. A bone density test is the gold standard to assess for osteoporosis. Once it is diagnosed and treatment begun, yearly follow-up determinations of the bone density level are indicated. For skeletal health, the nurse can recommend the following (Scheiber \& Torregrosa, 2000):
- A high calcium intake, $1500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. Dairy products and dark green vegetables are excellent sources, as are soups and broths made with a soup bone and cooked with added vinegar to leach calcium from the bone. Calcium supplements can be recommended to ensure that the daily calcium intake is adequate.
- A low-phosphorus diet. A calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 1:1 is ideal; red meats, cola drinks, and processed foods that are low in calcium and high in phosphorus are avoided.
- Weight-bearing exercise. The pull of muscle insertions on the long bones strengthens the muscles and retards calcium resorption.
- Reduction of caffeine and alcohol. This assists in stopping further demineralization and renal excretion of calcium.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 12-2 Age-related musculoskeletal changes affect posture, stance, and gait.}
\end{figure}
- Smoking cessation.
- Selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as raloxifene (Evista), preserve bone mineral density without estrogenic effects on the uterus. This medication is indicated for both prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been the mainstay of therapy for perimenopausal women, recent studies have demonstrated greater risks than previously recognized (Chen, Weiss, Newcomb, Barlow \& White, 2002).
- The bisphosphate drugs (e.g., Fosamax, Actonel). These drugs bind to mineralized bone surfaces to inhibit osteoclastic activity and promote bone formation.
Muscle strength and flexibility can be enhanced with a program of regular exercise. The axiom "use it or lose it" is very relevant when considering the physical capacity of aged people. The nurse plays an important role by encouraging older adults to participate in a regular exercise program. Regular exercise increases the strength and efficiency of heart contractions, improves oxygen uptake by cardiac and skeletal muscles, reduces fatigue, increases energy, and reduces cardiovascular risk factors. Muscle endurance, strength, and flexibility-all outcomes of regular exercise-also help to promote independence and psychological well-being. Aerobic exercises are the foundation of programs of cardiovascular endurance conditioning. A physical examination by a physician or nurse practitioner is necessary before initiating an exercise program, and older persons should perform exercises in moderation and use short rests to avoid undue fatigue. Swimming and brisk walking are often recommended because they are managed easily and usually are enjoyed by the older person.

Information about the nature and time course of menopauseassociated bone loss through early markers may be used to help to preserve bone and thus stop the natural sequelae of osteoporosis. A nurse-led research team used frequent sequential serum markers to confirm these changes and found a correlation with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and concentrations of folliclestimulating hormone as a marker for vitamin K status. Therefore, perimenopausal women with elevated ALP can be targeted for health promotion to preserve bone density (Lukacs, 2000). Further information about osteoporosis is presented in Chapter 68.

\section*{Nervous System}

The structure and function of the nervous system change with advanced age, and a reduction in cerebral blood flow accompanies nervous system changes. The loss of nerve cells contributes to a progressive loss of brain mass, and the synthesis and metabolism of the major neurotransmitters are also reduced. Because nerve impulses are conducted more slowly, older people take longer to respond and react. The autonomic nervous system performs less efficiently, and postural hypotension, which causes the person to lose consciousness or feel lightheaded on standing up quickly, may occur. Cerebral ischemia with related lightheadedness may interfere with mobility and safety. The nurse advises the person to allow a longer time to respond to a stimulus and to move more deliberately. Homeostasis is more difficult to maintain, but in the absence of pathologic changes, the older person functions adequately and retains cognitive and intellectual abilities.

Mental function is threatened by physical or emotional stresses. A sudden onset of confusion may be the first symptom of an infection or change in physical condition (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, medication interactions, dehydration, and others).

A slowed reaction time places the older person at risk for falls and injuries, including driving errors. Compared with the permile fatality rate for drivers aged 25 to 69 years, that for drivers 70 years of age and older is nine times as high. When an elderly person has been witnessed driving unsafely, he or she should receive a driving fitness evaluation; this is often administered by an occupational therapist in conjunction with a neuropsychologist, who can help with the more detailed cognitive testing (Dolinar, McQuillen, \& Ranseen, 2001).

\section*{Sensory System}

Sensory losses with old age affect all sensory organs and can be devastating to the person who cannot see to read or watch television, hear conversation well enough to communicate, or discriminate taste well enough to enjoy food.

\section*{SENSORY LOSSES VERSUS SENSORY DEPRIVATION}

Sensory losses can often be helped by assistive devices such as glasses and hearing aids. In contrast, sensory deprivation is the absence of stimuli in the environment or the inability to interpret existing stimuli (perhaps as a result of a sensory loss). This deprivation can lead to boredom, confusion, irritability, disorientation, and anxiety. Meaningful sensory stimulation offered to the older person is often helpful in correcting this problem. One sense can substitute for another in observing and interpreting stimuli. The nurse can enhance sensory stimulation in the environment with colors, pictures, textures, tastes, smells, and sounds. The stimuli are most meaningful if they are interpreted to the older person and if they are changed often. Cognitively impaired persons respond well to touch and to familiar music.

\section*{VISION}

As new cells form on the outside surface of the lens of the eye, the older central cells accumulate and become yellow, rigid, dense, and cloudy, leaving only the outer portion of the lens elastic enough to change shape (accommodate) and focus at near and far distances. As the lens becomes less flexible, the near point of focus gets farther away. This condition, presbyopia, usually begins in the fifth decade of life, and requires the wearing of reading glasses to magnify objects. In addition, the yellowing, cloudy lens causes light to scatter and makes the older person sensitive to glare. The ability to discern blue from green decreases. The pupil dilates slowly and less completely because of increased stiffness of the muscles of the iris, so the older person takes longer to adjust when going to and from light and dark environments or settings and needs brighter light for close vision. Although pathologic visual conditions are not part of normal aging, the incidence of eye disease (most commonly cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) increases in older people.

Age-related macular degeneration, in its most severe forms, is the most common cause of blindness in adults older than 55 years of age in the United States, and it is estimated to affect more than 10 million Americans. Risk factors include sunlight exposure, cigarette smoking, and heredity, and people with fair skin and blue eyes are much more prone to the disease. Sunglasses and hats with visors provide some protection. Yearly eye checkups ensure early detection, which makes surgical correction much more successful. Optical aids to magnify print and printed objects may help those already suffering from the effects of macular degeneration to continue to read (Friberg, 2000).

\section*{HEARING}

Presbycusis, a loss of the ability to hear high-frequency tones attributed to irreversible inner ear changes, occurs in midlife. Older people are often unable to follow conversation because tones of high-frequency consonants (letters $\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{th}, \mathrm{ch}, \mathrm{sh}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{t}, \mathrm{p}$ ) all sound alike. Hearing loss may cause the older person to respond inappropriately, misunderstand conversation, and avoid social interaction. This behavior may be erroneously interpreted as confusion. Wax buildup or other correctable problems may also be responsible for major hearing difficulties. A properly prescribed and fitted hearing aid may be useful in reducing hearing deficits.

\section*{TASTE AND SMELL}

Of the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter), sweet tastes are particularly dulled in older people. Blunted taste may contribute to the preference for salty, highly seasoned foods, but herbs, onions, garlic, and lemon should be encouraged as substitutes for salt to flavor food.

\section*{PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF AGING}

Successful psychological aging is reflected in the older person's ability to adapt to physical, social, and emotional losses and to achieve contentment, serenity, and life satisfactions. Because changes in life patterns are inevitable over a lifetime, the older person needs resiliency and coping skills when confronting stresses and change. A positive self-image enhances risk taking and participation in new, untested roles.

Although attitudes toward old people differ in ethnic subcultures, a subtle theme of ageism-prejudice or discrimination against older people-predominates in our society. It is often
based on stereotypes, simplified and often untrue beliefs that reinforce society's negative image of the aged person. Elderly people make up an extremely heterogeneous group, yet negative stereotypes are attributed to all of them.

Fear of aging and the inability of many to confront their own aging process may trigger ageist beliefs. Retirement and perceived nonproductivity are also responsible for negative feelings, since the younger working person may see the older person as not contributing to society and draining economic resources. This negative image is so common in American society that the elderly themselves often believe it. Only through an understanding of the aging process and respect for each person as an individual can the myths of aging be dispelled. If the elderly are treated with dignity and encouraged to maintain autonomy, the quality of their lives will improve.

\section*{Stress and Coping in the Older Adult}

Coping patterns and the ability to adapt to stress are developed over the course of a lifetime and remain consistent later in life. Experiencing success in younger adulthood helps a person develop a positive self-image that remains solid through even the adversities of old age. A person's abilities to adapt to changes, make decisions, and respond predictably are also determined by past experiences. A flexible, well-functioning person will probably continue as such. Losses may accumulate within a short period of time, however, and become overwhelming. The older person will often have fewer choices and diminished resources to deal with stressful events. Common stressors of old age include normal aging changes that impair physical function, activities, and appearance; disabilities from chronic illness; social and environmental losses related to loss of income and decreased ability to perform previous roles and activities; and the deaths of significant others. Many older adults rely strongly on their spiritual beliefs for comfort during stressful times.

Lack of social engagement (interaction with people within their environment) may be a modifiable risk factor for death in older persons residing in nursing homes. A 5-year study of more than 900 residents of nursing homes, whose average age was 87 years, revealed that those who did not receive social interaction were 2.3 times more likely to die during the follow-up period (Kiely et al., 2000).

\section*{Developmental Theories of Aging}

Erikson (1963) theorized that a person's life consists of eight stages, each stage representing a crucial turning point in the life span stretching from birth to death with its own developmental conflict to be resolved. According to Erikson, the major developmental task of old age is to either achieve ego integrity or suffer despair. Achieving ego integrity requires accepting one's lifestyle, believing that one's choices were the best that could be made at a particular time, and being in control of one's life. Despair results when an older person feels dissatisfied and disappointed with his or her life, and would live differently if given another chance.

Havighurst (1972) also suggested a list of developmental tasks that occur during a lifetime. The tasks of the older person include adjusting to retirement after a lifetime of employment with a possible reduction of income, decreases in physical strength and health, the death of a spouse, establishing affiliation with one's age group, adapting to new social roles in a flexible way, and establishing satisfactory physical living arrangements.

Combining the concepts of both Erikson and Havighurst suggests the following developmental tasks for the older adult: (1) maintenance of self-worth, (2) conflict resolution, (3) adjustment to the loss of dominant roles, (4) adjustment to the deaths of significant others, (5) environmental adaptation, and (6) maintenance of optimal levels of wellness.

\section*{Sociologic Theories of Aging}

Sociologic theories of aging attempt to predict and explain the social interactions and roles that contribute to the older adult's successful adjustment to old age. The activity theory proposes that life satisfaction in normal aging requires maintaining the active lifestyle of middle age (Havighurst, 1972). The continuity theory proposes that successful adjustment to old age requires continuing life patterns across a lifetime (Atchley, 1989; Neugarten, 1961). Continuity and a connection to the past are maintained through a continuation of well-established habits, values, and interests that are integral to the person's present lifestyle.

\section*{COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF AGING}

Cognition can be affected by many variables, including sensory impairment, physiologic health, environment, and psychosocial influences. Older adults may experience temporary changes in cognitive function when hospitalized or admitted to skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation centers, or long-term care facilities. These changes are related to differences in environment or in medical therapy, or to alteration in role performance.

\section*{Intelligence}

When intelligence test scores from people of all ages are compared (cross-sectional testing), test scores for older adults show a progressive decline beginning in midlife. Research has shown, however, that environment and health have a considerable influence on scores and that certain types of intelligence (eg, spatial perceptions and retention of nonintellectual information) decline, whereas other types do not (problem-solving ability based on past experiences, verbal comprehension, mathematical ability). Cardiovascular health, a stimulating environment, high levels of education, occupational status, and income all appear to have a positive effect on intelligence scores in later life.

\section*{Learning and Memory}

The ability to learn and acquire new skills and information decreases in the older adult, particularly after the seventh decade of life. Despite this, many older people continue to learn and participate in varied educational experiences. Motivation, speed of performance, and physical status all are important influences on learning.

The components of memory, an integral part of learning, include short-term memory ( 5 to 30 seconds), recent memory (1 hour to several days), and long-term memory (lifetime). Acquisition of information, registration (recording), retention (storing), and recall (retrieval) are essential components of the memory process. Sensory losses, distractions, and disinterest interfere with acquiring and recording information. Age-related loss occurs more frequently with short-term and recent memory; in the absence of a pathologic process, this is called benign senescent forgetfulness. A nurse considers the process by which older adults learn when he or she uses the following strategies:
- Supplies mnemonics to enhance recall of related data
- Encourages ongoing learning
- Links new information with familiar information
- Uses visual, auditory, and other sensory cues
- Encourages learners to wear prescribed glasses and hearing aids
- Provides glare-free lighting

\section*{ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF AGING}

About $95 \%$ of the elderly live in the community, and $75 \%$ own their homes. In 1991, about $31 \%$ of elderly persons were living alone ( $79 \%$ of these were women). In the 65 years and older age group, half as many women as men were married and living with their spouses: $40 \%$ of women compared with $74 \%$ of men. About $48 \%$ of the women older than 65 years of age were widowed, compared with only $15 \%$ of the men. This difference in marital status is a result of several factors: women have a longer life expectancy than men do, women tend to marry older men, and women tend to remain widowed, whereas men often remarry (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000).

\section*{Living Arrangement Options}

Ideally, older persons do best in their own, familiar environment. But adjustments to the environment may be required to allow the older adult to remain in his or her own home or apartment. Sometimes, in order to enable them to remain in their own home, an older adult or couple seek out family members who might be willing to live in the home, or agree to board someone in exchange for completion of household chores.

Sometimes older adults or couples agree to move in with adult children. This can be a rewarding experience as the children, their parents, and the grandchildren interact and share household responsibilities. It can also be stressful, depending on the family dynamics. Adult children and their older parents may also choose to pool their financial resources by moving into a house that has an attached "in-law suite." This arrangement provides security for the older adult along with privacy for both families.

Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), are becoming more popular as the first of the baby boomers enter their retirement years. CCRCs are retirement communities consisting of single-dwelling houses or apartments for those individuals who are still able to manage all of their day-to-day needs, assisted living apartments for those who need limited assistance with their daily living needs, and skilled nursing services when continuous nursing assistance is required. These communities usually contract for a large down payment before the resident moves into the community. This payment allows the individual or couple the option to reside in the community from the time of total independence through the need for assisted or skilled nursing care. This concept allows for decisions about living arrangements and health care to be made before any decline in health status occurs. A CCRC also provides continuity at a time in an older adult's life when many other factors, such as health status, income, and availability of friends and family members, may be changing.

Assisted living facilities are an option when physical or cognitive changes require at least minimal supervision. Assisted living allows for a degree of independence while providing minimal nursing assistance (eg, administration of medication and coordination of scheduled and acute care medical assistance). Other services, such as laundry, cleaning, and meals, may also be included.

Skilled nursing facilities offer continuous nursing care. Usually, if an older adult suffers a major health event such as a stroke, myocardial infarction, or cancer and is hospitalized, Medicare will cover the cost of the first 30 to 90 days in a skilled nursing facility if ongoing therapy is needed. The stipulation for continued Medicare coverage during this time is documentation of persistent improvement in the required therapies, which most often include physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, and cognitive therapy. Some individuals choose to have nursing home insurance as a means of paying, at least in part, for the cost of these services, should they become necessary. When an individual's financial resources become exhausted as a result of prolonged nursing home care, the family, the institution, or both may apply for Medicaid reimbursement. An increasing number of skilled nursing facilities offer subacute care. This area of the facility offers a high level of nursing care and may either prevent the need for an individual to be transferred to a hospital setting or allow a hospitalized individual to be transferred back to the facility sooner.

\section*{Life Care Plans}

A life care plan is an individualized document that assesses and evaluates a client's present and future health care and living needs. The typical components of a life care plan are listed in Chart 12-2. Life care plans were originally developed in 1981 as standardized, efficient guidelines for medical and ancillary quality-of-life services. A life care plan provides valuable information regarding factors that can radically affect the individual's health care and quality of life. A life care plan is often requested for individuals with catastrophic injuries or illness (eg, traumatic brain injury, amputation, multiple sclerosis) who will require ongoing rehabilitative

and medical services. A life care plan may also serve as the blueprint for what will be expected in long-term care. These plans provide a guideline of anticipated patient care needs for families, insurance companies, attorneys, discharge planners, case managers, and all medical and nursing professionals. The cost of the life care plan varies, depending on the planner, the severity of the injury or illness, and who is paying for the service, but the average cost is currently between $\$ 5,000$ and $\$ 20,000$ (Schuman, 2001).

\section*{The Role of the Family}

Planning for care and understanding the psychosocial issues confronting the older person must be accomplished within the context of the family. If dependency needs occur, the spouse often assumes the role of primary caregiver. In the absence of the surviving spouse, an adult child usually assumes caregiver responsibilities and may eventually need help in providing care and support. Two common myths in American society are that adult children and their aged parents are socially alienated and that adult children abandon their parents when health and other dependency problems arise. Extensive research refutes both of these beliefs. The family is an important source of support for older people (Fig. 12-3). Approximately $81 \%$ of elderly persons have living children. Of those elders living alone, two thirds have at least one child living within 30 minutes of their home, and $62 \%$ see at least one adult child weekly (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000).

Social attitudes and cultural values often dictate that adult children should provide services and financial support and assume the burden of care if their aged parents are unable to care for themselves. Illness creates special problems for people who live alone. If community agencies or adult children are unable to provide care, elders are at high risk for institutionalization.

Regardless of the amount of responsibility and love an adult child exhibits toward dependent elderly parents, strains do develop if care continues for a long period. Research exploring the

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 12-3 Families are an important source of psychosocial and physical support for elders and youngsters alike. Caring interaction among grandchildren, grandparents, and other family members typically contributes to the health of all.}
\end{figure}
relationship between aged parents and their adult children shows that the quality of the parent-child relationship declines with the poor health of the parent. Under certain circumstances of high risk, strains in intergenerational relationships can result in elder abuse (Hoban \& Kearney, 2000; Phillips, 2000; Tumolo, 2000).

Elder abuse is an active or passive act or behavior that is harmful to the elderly person. Such behavior includes physical violence, personal neglect, financial exploitation, violation of rights, denial of health care, and self-inflicted abuse. Preventive action should be taken when strains are evident, before elder abuse occurs. Interdisciplinary team members can be enlisted to help the caregiver develop self-awareness, increased insight, and an understanding of the aging process. At the same time, community resources may be useful for both the aged person and the caregiver (Geldmacher, Heck, \& O'Toole, 2001).

\section*{Community Support Services}

Many community supports exist that help the older person maintain independence. Informal sources of help, such as family, friends, the mail carrier, church members, and neighbors, can all keep an informal watch. Area Agencies on Aging perform many community services, including telephone reassurance, friendly visitors, home repair services, and home-delivered meals. Homemaker and chore services can be obtained at an hourly rate through these agencies or through local community nursing services. If a person is unable to pay, these services may be subsidized through local and state funds.

Other community support services are available to help the older person outside the home. Senior centers have social and health promotion activities, and some provide a nutritious noontime meal. Adult day care facilities offer daily nursing care and social opportunities; these services also enable family members to carry on daily activities while the older person is at the day care center.

\section*{Home Health Care}

Home care is often used as a means to prevent hospitalization for frail, elderly outpatients or to shorten a hospital stay. It can also be used as a high-tech substitute for hospitalization and can include the use of intravenous therapy and other therapies previously delivered in the acute care setting. Home health care was the area of U.S. health care that saw the most rapid rate of growth in the 1990s, and by the end of the 1990s it had come to represent almost one tenth of the total Medicare budget. Rather than viewing home health care as a means of controlling health care costs, the Federal government's Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), formerly the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), devised plans to limit the growth of home health care services. The first system put into place to accomplish decreased allocations for home health was called the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for home care, implemented in 2000. Later came a means of quantifying needed home care, called the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). The OASIS rates individual consumers of home health care in terms of their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Nursing care and rehabilitation services requiring the expertise of a registered nurse and other health professionals were traditionally paid for by Medicare. With the advent of the PPS, limits on reimbursement may mean consideration of alternative means of reimbursement for such services, including private pay and health insurance products (HCFA, 2000; Plotkin \& Roche, 2000; Nus-
baum, 2000). Figure 12-4 shows the estimated growth in Medicare and out-of-pocket annual spending between 2000 and 2025.

\section*{Safety and Comfort in the Home Environment}

Injuries rank seventh as a cause of death for older people. The nurse can encourage lifestyle and environmental changes that older adults and their families can adopt. Adequate lighting with minimal glare and shadow can be achieved through the use of small area lamps, indirect lighting, sheer curtains to diffuse direct sunlight, dull rather than shiny surfaces, and nightlights. Sharply contrasting colors can be used to mark the edges of stairs. Grab bars by the tub and toilet are useful. Loose clothing, improperly fitting shoes, scatter rugs, small objects, and pets create hazards and increase the risk of falls. A person functions best in familiar settings if furniture and objects remain as unchanged as is safely possible.

\section*{Hospice Services}

Hospice services are a dignified alternative to the chaos of the acute care setting when a patient with an end-stage disease is not expected to live long. Hospice is a program of supportive and palliative services for dying patients and their families that includes physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions of care. Under Medicare and Medicaid, all needed medical and nursing services are provided to keep the patient as pain free and comfortable as possible. The family must agree to assist in the care of the patient, and services are brought into the home as needed. Hospice services may also be incorporated into the care of residents in long-term care facilities and include care for end-stage dementia.

Hospice services that are provided in a person's home also are rated via the OASIS system. Although this system can be very

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-224.jpg?height=1053&width=805&top_left_y=1506&top_left_x=1052}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 12-4 Medicare beneficiary's out-of-pocket spending.}
\end{figure}
cumbersome and time-consuming in hospice care because of the many care providers involved, it can serve as an excellent tool with which nurses can assess the effects of particular services on specific patient outcomes (Plotkin \& Roche, 2000). For further discussion of hospice care and services see Chapter 17.

Home care and hospice nurses are in a unique position to facilitate early discussions about a patient's wishes and goals at the end of life. Too often, discussion regarding end-of-life care is postponed until a crisis situation occurs, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to be an active participant in the discussion. Home health nurses can assist the patient and family with identifying available options and initiating conversation about preparing an end-of-life plan (Norlander \& McSteen, 2000).

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC ASPECTS OF AGING}

Older people use more medications than does any other age group: although they comprise only $12.6 \%$ of the total population, they use $30 \%$ of all prescribed medications and $40 \%$ of all over-the-counter medications. Medications have improved the health and well-being of older people by alleviating symptoms of discomfort, treating chronic illnesses, and curing infectious processes. Problems commonly occur, however, because of medication interactions, multiple medication effects, multiple medication use (polypharmacy), and noncompliance. Combinations of prescription medications and some over-the-counter medications further complicate the problem.

Any medication is capable of altering nutritional status, which, in the elderly, may already be compromised by a marginal diet or by chronic disease and its treatment. Medications can depress the appetite, cause nausea and vomiting, irritate the stomach, cause constipation or diarrhea, and decrease absorption of nutrients. In addition, they can alter electrolyte balance and carbohydrate and fat metabolism. A few examples of medications capable of altering the nutritional status are antacids, which produce thiamine deficiency; cathartics, which diminish absorption; antibiotics and phenytoin, which reduce utilization of folic acid; and phenothiazines, estrogens, and corticosteroids, which increase food intake and cause weight gain.

\section*{Altered Pharmacokinetics}

Pharmacokinetics is the study of the actions of medications in the body, including the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Variability in these processes in older people (Table 12-3) is caused, in part, by a reduced capacity of the liver and kidneys to metabolize and excrete the medications and by lowered efficiency of the circulatory and nervous systems in coping with the effect of certain medications. Many medications and their metabolites are excreted by the kidney. With advanced age, body weight, total body water, lean body mass, and plasma albumin (protein) all decrease, while body fat increases. Consequently, agents that are highly protein-bound have fewer binding sites and higher pharmacologic activity, whereas fat-soluble agents have more binding sites, and therefore enhanced storage and delayed elimination.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The nurse administering medications to older people must be aware of the following:
- Medications removed from the body primarily by renal excretion remain in the body for a longer time in people with
decreased renal function. Often dosages must be reduced, because overdosage and medication toxicity at usual therapeutic dosages are common.
- Medications with a narrow safety margin (eg, digitalis glycosides) must be administered cautiously.
- A decline in cardiac output may decrease the delivery rate to the target organ or storage tissue.
- The circulatory and central nervous systems of older people are less able to cope with the effects of certain medications, even when blood levels are normal.
- Idiosyncratic or unusual responses to medications may manifest as toxic reactions and complications.
- As a result of a slowing metabolism, medication levels may increase in the tissues and plasma, leading to prolonged medication action.
- Many elderly people have multiple medical problems that require treatment with one or more medications. The possibility of interactions between medications is further magnified if the older person is also taking one or more over-the-counter medications.
- A high-fiber diet and the use of psyllium (Metamucil) or other laxatives may accelerate gastrointestinal transport and reduce absorption of medications taken concurrently.
- If, for any reason, a patient is not dependable about taking medication, the nurse must be sure that the pill or capsule is actually swallowed and not retained between the cheeks and the gums or teeth.

Teaching self-administration of medication requires asking the patient questions and requesting return demonstrations to ensure that learning has occurred. Sensory and memory losses, as well as decreased manual dexterity, can affect the patient's ability to carry out instructions properly, and the teaching plan will need to be adjusted to meet each patient's needs. The following steps taken by the nurse can help the patient to manage his or her medications and improve compliance:
- Explain the action, side effects, and dosage of each medication.
- Write out the medication schedule.
- Encourage the use of standard containers without safety lids (if there are no children in the household).
- Suggest the use of a multiple-day, multiple-dose medication dispenser to help patients adhere to the medication schedule (Fig. 12-5).
- Destroy old, unused medications.
- Review the medication schedule periodically.
- Discourage the use of over-the-counter medications and herbal agents without consulting a health professional.
- Encourage the patient to take all medications, including over-the-counter medications, with him or her regularly when visiting the primary health care provider.

\section*{Physical Health Problems in Older Populations}

\section*{GERIATRIC SYNDROMES: MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLE ETIOLOGIC FACTORS}

The frail elderly frequently experience multiple problems, or syndromes. Illness, whether acute or chronic, generally results from several factors rather than from a single cause. When combined with a decrease in host resistance, these factors lead to illness or injury. Although the problems may have developed slowly, the onset of symptoms is often acute. Furthermore, the

presenting symptoms may appear in other body systems before becoming apparent in the affected system. The term "frail" is used to describe those elders who are at highest risk for adverse health outcomes or geriatric syndromes. There are no standard clinical criteria for frailty. According to the most widely agreed on definition, frail people are those who are most vulnerable to

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-226.jpg?height=292&width=824&top_left_y=2192&top_left_x=133}

\end{figure}
significant problems because they meet one or more of the following conditions:
- Being 85 years of age or older
- Being unable to perform IADLs or ADLs independently
- Suffering from multiple chronic diseases

As with specific illnesses, geriatric syndromes are never a normal consequence of aging. Early intervention can prevent further complications and help to maximize the quality of life for many older people (Hazzard et al., 1999).

\section*{Impaired Mobility}

The causes of decreased mobility are many and varied. Common causes are Parkinson's disease, diabetic neuropathy, cardiovascular compromise, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and sensory deficits. Environmental barriers and iatrogenic factors are also significant. Elderly patients should be encouraged to stay as active as possible to avoid the downward spiral of immobility. During illness, bed
rest should be kept to a minimum, because even brief periods of bed rest quickly lead to deconditioning and, consequently, to a wide range of complications. When bed rest cannot be avoided, the patient should perform active range-of-motion and strengthening exercises with the unaffected extremities, and the nurse should perform passive range-of-motion exercises on the affected extremities. Frequent position changes help offset the hazards of immobility. Both the staff and the patient's family can assist in maintaining the current level of mobility (Tappen, Roach, Applegate, \& Stowell, 2000).

\section*{Dizziness}

Older people frequently seek help for dizziness, which presents a particular challenge because there are so many possible internal and external causes. For many, the problem is further complicated because of an inability to differentiate between the true dizziness (a sensation of disorientation in relation to position) and vertigo (a spinning sensation). Other similar sensations include near-syncope and disequilibrium. The causes for these sensations range in severity from minor, as in a buildup of ear wax, to severe, as in dysfunction of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, proprioceptive receptors, or the vestibular system. Even a minor reversible cause, such as an ear wax impaction, can result in a loss of balance and a subsequent fall and injury. Because of the many predisposing factors, nurses should seek to identify potentially treatable factors related to the dizziness. This impairment reduction strategy may reduce the vulnerability of older persons to injury (Tinetti, Williams, \& Gill, 2000).

\section*{Falls and Falling}

Falling is a common and preventable source of mortality and morbidity in older adults. As the major cause of trauma in the elderly, falls are not often fatal but do threaten health and the quality of life. Normal and pathologic consequences of aging that contribute to increased falls include visual changes such as loss of depth perception, susceptibility to glare, loss of visual acuity, and difficulty in light accommodation. Neurologic changes include loss of balance, dizziness, loss of position sense, and delayed reaction time (Ruckenstein, 2001). Cardiovascular changes may result in cerebral hypoxia and postural hypotension. Cognitive changes include confusion, loss of judgment, and impulsive behavior. Musculoskeletal changes include altered posture and decreased muscle strength. Use of many medications, medication interactions, and alcohol precipitate falls by causing drowsiness, incoordination, and postural hypotension. Osteoporosis-related fractures can have a negative effect on the individual's ability to maintain an independent living arrangement (Peterson, 2001).

Overall, elderly women who fall sustain a greater degree of injury than do elderly men. The most common fracture occurring from a fall is hip fracture resulting from the combined comorbidities of osteoporosis and the condition or situation that provoked the fall. Studies have shown that elderly people who fall experience a greater decline in their ability to perform ADLs and social activities, have a greater chance of being institutionalized, and use more health care services than elderly people who do not fall (Capezuti, 2000; Tinetti, Williams, \& Gill, 2000).

In institutionalized elderly people, restraints in the form of physical modalities (lap belts; geriatric chairs; vest, waist, and jacket restraints) and chemical modalities (medications) are known to precipitate many of the injuries they were meant to prevent. Documented injuries and deaths resulting from these restraints
include strangulation, vascular and neurologic damage, pressure ulcers, skin tears, fractures, increased confusion, and significant emotional trauma. The time required to supervise restrained patients adequately is better used addressing the unmet need that provoked the behavior that resulted in the use of restraint. Because of the overwhelming negative consequences of restraint use, the accrediting agencies of nursing homes and acute care facilities now maintain stringent guidelines concerning their use.

\section*{Urinary Incontinence}

Urinary incontinence can be acute, developing during an illness, or it can develop chronically over a period of years. The older patient often does not report this very common problem unless specifically asked. Transient causes may be attributed to delirium and dehydration; restricted mobility and restraints; inflammation, infection, and impaction; and pharmaceuticals and polyuria (use the acronym DRIP to remember them). Once identified, the causative factor can be eliminated. Established incontinence may be a result of neurologic or structural abnormalities (Degler, 2000b).

The pelvic floor serves as the supporting mechanism or "hammock" for the bladder, uterus, and rectum. It may have become weakened as a result of pregnancy, labor and delivery, prior pelvic surgeries, or work that required prolonged standing or lifting. Dysfunction of the pelvic floor can be greatly improved with Kegel exercises. Other measures that help prevent episodes of incontinence include having quick access to toilet facilities and wearing clothing that can be unfastened easily.

The patient with this problem should be urged to seek help from appropriate health personnel, because incontinence can be as emotionally devastating as it is physically debilitating. Nurses who specialize in behavioral approaches to urinary incontinence management are particularly successful in assisting an individual either to regain continence or to significantly improve the level of continence. Although medications such as anticholinergics may decrease some of the symptoms of urge incontinence (detrusor instability), their side effects (dry mouth, slowed gastrointestinal motility, and confusion) may make them inappropriate choices for the elderly. Various surgical procedures are also used to manage urinary incontinence, particularly stress urinary incontinence.

Detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility is a type of urge incontinence that is seen predominantly in the elderly population. In this variation of urge incontinence, the patient has absolutely no warning that he or she is about to lose urine. When toileted, the patient often voids only a small volume of urine or none at all, then experiences a large volume of incontinence after leaving the bathroom. The nursing staff should be familiar with this form of incontinence and should not show disapproval to the patient. Many patients with dementia suffer from this type of incontinence because both incontinence and dementia are a result of dysfunction in similar areas of the brain. Prompted, timed voiding can be of assistance to these individuals, although clean intermittent catheterization is the preferred management.

\section*{ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME IN OLDER ADULTS}

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is no longer only a disease of young people. It is increasingly recognized that AIDS does not spare the older segment of society. According to a report of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1981 to 1989, more than $10 \%$ of all AIDS patients nationwide were

50 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis, and about $3 \%$ were age 60 years or older. In that report, male homosexual contact and blood transfusions were the predominant modes of transmission among older patients. Transmission by contaminated blood products has declined in recent years, so the predominant mode of transmission in older people now is through sexual contact. The most common AIDS-indicator disease in the older person is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Wasting syndrome and HIV encephalopathy are also common in older HIV-infected people. Survival time is significantly shorter in older patients than in younger patients with AIDS (Ory \& Mack, 1998).

\section*{Common Mental Health Problems in Older Populations}

Older adults are less likely than younger people to seek treatment for mental health symptoms, so health professionals are challenged to recognize, assess, refer, collaborate, treat, and support those older adults who exhibit noticeable changes in intellect or affect. In a community setting, the nurse may be the only health care provider who has contact with the person. Symptoms should not be dismissed as age-related changes; a thorough assessment may reveal a treatable, reversible physical or mental condition.

\section*{DEPRESSION}

Depression is the most common affective or mood disorder of old age and is often responsive to treatment. Its classification and diagnosis vary according to the number, severity, and duration of symptoms. Depression disrupts quality of life, increases the risk of suicide, and becomes self-perpetuating. It may also be an early sign of a chronic illness or the result of physical illness. Signs of depression include feelings of sadness, fatigue, diminished memory and concentration, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, sleep disturbances, appetite disturbances with excessive weight loss or gain, restlessness, impaired attention span, and suicidal ideation.

Although depression among the elderly is widespread, it is often undiagnosed and untreated. Attentive clinical evaluation is essential. Geriatric depression and symptoms of dementia often overlap, so cognitive impairment may be a result of depression rather than dementia. When depression and medical illnesses coexist, as they often do, neglect of the depression can retard physical recovery. Symptoms might be secondary to a medication interaction or an undiagnosed physical condition. Assessing the patient's mental status, including assessing for depression, is vital and must not be overlooked (Charts 12-3 and 12-4).

Depressive illness in late life should be vigorously treated with antidepressants. Psychosocial approaches have also been found to be effective. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine (Paxil), are clinically useful and exhibit rapid action with a low occurrence of adverse effects. Tricyclic antidepressants, specifically nortriptyline (Aventyl), desipramine (Norpramin), and doxepin (Sinequan), are also clinically effective for depression. Anticholinergic, cardiac, and orthostatic side effects, as well as interactions with other medications, require that these agents be used with care: the dosage must be managed carefully to relieve symptoms and at the same time avoid medication toxicity. It may take 4 to 6 weeks for symptoms to recede, so the
nurse should offer explanations and encouragement during this period.

Alcohol abuse related to depression is significant in the elderly population. Alcohol-related problems in older people often remain hidden, however, since many older adults deny their habit when questioned. Alcohol abuse is especially dangerous in the older person because of changes in renal and liver function as well as the probability of side effects in interactions with prescriptive medications (Adams, Atkinson, Ganz, \& O'Conner, 2000).

\section*{DELIRIUM}

Delirium, often called acute confusional state, begins with confusion and progresses to disorientation. The patient may experience an altered level of consciousness ranging from stupor to excessive activity. Thinking is disorganized, and the attention span is characteristically short. Hallucinations, delusions, fear, anxiety, and paranoia may also be evident. Because of the acute and unexpected onset of symptoms and the unknown underlying cause, delirium is a medical emergency. Delirium occurs secondary to a number of causes, including physical illness, medication or alcohol toxicity, dehydration, fecal impaction, malnutrition, infection, head trauma, lack of environmental cues, and sensory deprivation or overload. Older adults are particularly
vulnerable to acute confusion because of their decreased biologic reserve and the large number of medications that many take. The nurse must recognize the grave implications of the acute symptoms and report them immediately. If the delirium goes unrecognized and the underlying cause is not treated, permanent, irreversible brain damage or death can follow. Delirium is sometimes mistaken for dementia (see Table 12-4 for a comparison of dementia and delirium).

Therapeutic interventions vary, depending on the reason for the symptoms. Because medication interactions and toxicity are
often implicated, nonessential medications should be stopped. Nutritional and fluid intake should be supervised and monitored. The environment should be quiet and calm. To increase orientation and provide familiar environmental cues, the nurse encourages family members or friends to touch and talk to the patient. It is important to question the family carefully about the patient's prior cognitive state. Ongoing mental status assessments using this baseline are helpful in evaluating responses to treatment and to the hospital or extended care facility admission.

\section*{THE DEMENTIAS: MULTI-INFARCT DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE}

Dementia reportedly affects $3 \%$ to $11 \%$ of community-residing adults older than 65 years of age and $20 \%$ to $50 \%$ of communityresiding adults older than age 85 . Most of those suffering from dementia who are in the over- 85 age group reside in institutional settings. Of those individuals 100 years and older, almost $60 \%$ are noted to demonstrate dementia. Despite this high incidence, clinicians fail to detect dementia in $21 \%$ to $72 \%$ of patients. In order for a diagnosis of dementia to be made, at least two domains of altered function must exist-memory and at least one of the following: language, perception, visuospatial function, calculation, judgment, abstraction, and problem-solving (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research [Mayo], 2001).

Symptoms are usually subtle in onset and often progress slowly until they are obvious and devastating. The changes characteristic of dementia fall into three general categories: cognitive, functional, and behavioral. Reversible causes of dementia include alcohol abuse, medication use (polypharmacy), psychiatric disorders, and normal-pressure hydrocephalus. The three most common nonreversible dementias are Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, and mixed Alzheimer's and multi-infarct dementia. Alzheimer's disease accounts for more than $60 \%$ of all dementias, and multi-infarct dementia (vascular dementia) accounts for another 5\% to 20\%. Other non-Alzheimer's dementias include Parkinson's disease, AIDS-related dementia, and Pick's disease. These remaining dementias account for fewer than $15 \%$ of cases and are relatively uncommon (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2000).

Dementia is characterized by an uneven, downward decline in mental function. Multi-infarct dementia is sometimes confused with Alzheimer's disease, paranoia, or delirium because of its unpredictable clinical course. The diagnosis can be even more difficult if the patient is suffering from both Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia.

Multi-infarct, or vascular dementia, has the following defining characteristics:
- There must be evidence of dementia.
- There must be evidence of cerebrovascular disease (by history, clinical examination, or brain imaging).
- The two disorders must be reasonably related.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible, degenerative neurologic disease that begins insidiously and is characterized by gradual losses of cognitive function and disturbances in behavior and affect. Alzheimer's disease is not found exclusively in the elderly; in $1 \%$ to $10 \%$ of cases, its onset occurs in middle age. A family history of Alzheimer's disease and the presence of Down syndrome are two established risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. If family members have at least one other relative with Alzheimer's disease, then a familial component, which non-

specifically includes both environmental triggers and genetic determinants, is said to exist. Genetic studies show that autosomaldominant forms of Alzheimer's disease are associated with early onset and early death.

In 1987, chromosome 21 was first implicated in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Soon after, the gene coding for amyloid precursor protein ( $A P P$ ) was also found to be on chromosome 21. Not until 1991 was an actual mutation in association with familial Alzheimer's disease found in the $A P P$ gene of chromosome 21. For those with this gene, onset of Alzheimer's disease began in their 50s. Only a few of the cases of familial Alzheimer's disease have been found to involve this genetic mutation. In 1992, chromosome 14 was found to contain an unidentified mutation also linked to familial Alzheimer's disease. Since 1995, molecular biologists have been discovering even more-specific genetic information about the various forms of Alzheimer's disease, including genetic differences between early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These genetic differences are helping to pinpoint risk factors associated with the disease, although the genetic indicators are not specific enough to be used as reliable diagnostic markers (Mayo, 2001).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Specific neuropathologic and biochemical changes are found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These include neurofibrillary tangles (a tangled mass of nonfunctioning neurons) and senile or neuritic plaques (deposits of amyloid protein, part of a larger protein, $A P P$ ) in the brain. This neuronal damage occurs primarily in the cerebral cortex and results in decreased brain size. Similar changes are found to a lesser extent in the normal brain tissue of older adults. Cells that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine are the ones principally affected by this disease. Biochemically, the enzyme active in producing acetylcholine, which is specifically involved in memory processing, is decreased.

Several theories are currently being tested to explain what predisposes an individual to develop the plaques and neurotangles that can be seen at autopsy on biopsy of the brains of Alzheimer's patients (Mayo, 2001). Scientists continue to increase their understanding of the complex ways in which aging and genetic and nongenetic factors affect and damage brain cells over time and eventually lead to Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have recently discovered how and why amyloid plaques form and cause neuronal death, as well as the possible relationship between various forms of tau protein and impaired function, which leads to neuronal death. The major role of tau protein is to regulate the assembly and stability of neurons. Researchers are also beginning to discover the roles of inflammation and oxidative stress and the contribution of brain infarctions to the disease (Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, 1999).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, forgetfulness and subtle memory loss occur. The patient may experience small difficulties in work or social activities but has adequate cognitive function to hide the loss and can function independently. Depression may occur at this time. With further progression of the disease, the deficits can no longer be concealed. Forgetfulness is manifested in many daily actions. These patients may lose their ability to recognize familiar faces, places, and objects and may get lost in a familiar environment. They may repeat the same stories because they forget that they have already told them. Trying to reason with the
person and using reality orientation only increase the patient's anxiety without increasing function. Conversation becomes difficult, and there are word-finding difficulties. The ability to formulate concepts and think abstractly disappears; for instance, the patient can interpret a proverb only in concrete terms. The patient is often unable to recognize the consequences of his or her actions and will therefore exhibit impulsive behavior. For example, on a hot day, the patient may decide to wade in the city fountain fully clothed. The patient has difficulty with everyday activities, such as operating simple appliances and handling money.

Personality changes are also usually evident. The patient may become depressed, suspicious, paranoid, hostile, and even combative. Progression of the disease intensifies the symptoms: speaking skills deteriorate to nonsense syllables, agitation and physical activity increase, and the patient may wander at night. Eventually, assistance is needed for most ADLs, including eating and toileting, since dysphagia occurs and incontinence develops. The terminal stage, in which the patient is usually immobile and requires total care, may last for months or years. Occasionally, the patient may recognize family or caretakers. Death occurs as a result of complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition, or dehydration.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The health history, including medical history; family history; social and cultural history; medication history, and the physical examination, including functional and mental health status, are key in the diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease. Diagnostic tests, including complete blood count, the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test for syphilis, HIV testing, chemistry profile, and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and thyroid hormone levels, as well as screening with electroencephalography (EEG), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid may all refute or support a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease.

Depression can closely mimic early-stage Alzheimer's disease and coexists in many patients. A depression scale is helpful in screening for underlying depression. Tests for cognitive function, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (see Chart 12-3) and the clock-drawing test, are useful for screening. CT and MRI scans of the brain are useful for excluding hematoma, brain tumor, stroke, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, and atrophy but are not reliable in making a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Infections, physiologic disturbances such as hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency can produce cognitive impairment that may be misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. Biochemical abnormalities can be excluded through examination of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, but the findings are not specific enough to make the diagnosis. A diagnosis of "probable Alzheimer's disease" is made when the medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests have excluded all known causes of other dementias. The diagnosis can be confirmed only by cerebral biopsy (Mayo, 2001).

\section*{Medical Management}

In the fall of 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first medication for treatment of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, tacrine hydrochloride (Cognex). This agent enhances acetylcholine uptake in the brain, thus maintaining memory skills for a period of time. Because this medication can cause
liver toxicity, patients must be closely monitored. It was not until early 1997 that donepezil (Aricept), a second medication in this category of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, was introduced. In 2000, a third medication in this class, rivastigmine (Exelon) was introduced in the United States after completion of research trials conducted in more than 70 countries. These two newer preparations have far fewer side effects, although they continue to require ongoing monitoring. They vary in their level of effectiveness from patient to patient, due in part to their window of effectiveness, which in general is limited to the early stages of dementia (Fillit, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Management}

Although Alzheimer's disease is the focus of this nursing management discussion, the interventions described apply to all patients with dementia, regardless of the cause. Nursing interventions are aimed at maintaining the patient's physical safety; reducing anxiety and agitation; improving communication; promoting independence in self-care activities; providing for the patient's needs for socialization, self-esteem, and intimacy; maintaining adequate nutrition; managing sleep pattern disturbances; and supporting and educating family caregivers. Research has demonstrated that when
the nurse can provide such support, older adults are able to maintain higher levels of perceived and actual health (Forbes, 2001).

\section*{SUPPORTING COGNITIVE FUNCTION}

As the patient's cognitive ability declines, the nurse provides a calm, predictable environment that helps the person interpret his or her surroundings and activities. Environmental stimuli are limited, and a regular routine is followed. A quiet, pleasant manner of speaking, clear and simple explanations, and use of memory aids and cues help to minimize confusion and disorientation and give the patient a sense of security. Prominently displayed clocks and calendars may enhance orientation to time. Colorcoding the doorway may help the patient who has difficulty locating his or her room. Active participation may help the patient to maintain cognitive, functional, and social interaction abilities for a longer period. Physical activity and communication have also been demonstrated to slow some of the cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease (Nursing Research Profile 12-1).

\section*{PROMOTING PHYSICAL SAFETY}

A safe environment allows the patient to move about as freely as possible and relieves the family of constant worry about safety.

Tappen, R., Roach, K., Applegate, E. B., \& Stowell, P. (2000). Effect of a combined walking and conversation intervention on functional mobility of nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders, 14, 196-201.

\section*{Purpose}

Motor loss becomes evident in the later stages of Alzheimer's disease, leading to gait disturbances that predispose the individual to falls and subsequent injuries. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a combination of exercise and conversation, compared with walkingonly exercise and conversation-only treatments, on the functional mobility of frail nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease.

\section*{Design}

A repeated-measures three-group design was used. Sixty-five nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: walking only, having conversation only, or walking and conversing with the study nurses. Treatments were given for 30 minutes three times a week for 16 weeks. The residents' functional mobility was measured before initiation of the treatments and after 16 weeks of intervention. At the end of the intervention period, descriptive statistics, the Student $t$ test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the chi square test were used to compare the three groups.

\section*{Conclusions}

As expected, the ambulation function of the participants in the "conversation only" group dropped dramatically. Those participants who were assisted to walk without conversation demonsatrated a dramatic drop in ambulation function as well. Of all three groups, the least decline occurred in ambulation function over time in the group of participants with whom the nurses carried on a conversation while these participants were being assisted to walk. This information suggests that while attempting to maintain physical function in the patient with Alzheimer's disease, the nurse can best achieve this goal if socialization is incorporated into exercise sessions.

\section*{Implications for Practice}

This study demonstrated that assisted walking with conversation can contribute to maintenance of functional mobility in institutionalized patients with Alzheimer's disease. Staff caring for these patients can promote patients' acceptance of assisted walking through the use of effective communication strategies.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}

To prevent falls and other injuries, all obvious hazards are removed. Nightlights are helpful. The patient's intake of medications and food is monitored. Smoking is allowed only with supervision. A hazard-free environment allows the patient maximum independence and a sense of autonomy. Because of a short attention span and forgetfulness, wandering behavior can often be reduced by gently persuading or distracting the patient. Restraints are avoided because they may increase agitation. Doors leading from the house must be secured. Outside the home, all activities must be supervised to protect the patient, and the patient should wear an identification bracelet or neck chain in case he or she becomes separated from the caregiver.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY AND AGITATION}

Despite profound cognitive losses, the patient will, at times, be aware of his or her rapidly diminishing abilities. The patient will need constant emotional support that reinforces a positive selfimage. When losses of skills occur, goals are adjusted to fit the patient's declining ability.

The environment should be kept uncluttered, familiar, and noise free. Excitement and confusion can be upsetting and may precipitate a combative, agitated state known as a catastrophic reaction (overreaction to excessive stimulation). During such a reaction, the patient responds by screaming, crying, or becoming abusive (physically or verbally). This may be the patient's only way of expressing an inability to cope with the environment. When this occurs, it is important to remain calm and unhurried. Measures such as listening to music, stroking, rocking, or distraction may quiet the patient. Frequently, the patient forgets what triggered the reaction. Structuring of activities is also helpful. Becoming familiar with the patient's predicted responses to certain stressors helps caregivers to avoid similar situations.

By the time most older persons with dementia have progressed to the late stages of the disease, they typically reside in nursing homes and are predominantly cared for by nurses' aides. Dementia education for caregivers is imperative to minimize patient agitation and is very effectively taught by advanced practice nurse specialists (Nursing Research Profile 12-2).

\section*{IMPROVING COMMUNICATION}

To promote the patient's interpretation of messages, the nurse remains unhurried and reduces noises and distractions. The nurse uses clear, easy-to-understand sentences to convey messages, because the patient frequently forgets the meaning of words or has difficulty organizing and expressing thoughts. Lists and simple written instructions can serve as reminders to the patient and are often helpful. Sometimes, the patient can point to an object or use nonverbal language to communicate. Tactile stimuli, such as a hug or a hand pat, are usually interpreted as signs of affection, concern, and security.

\section*{PROMOTING INDEPENDENCE IN SELF-CARE ACTIVITIES}

Pathophysiologic changes in the brain make it difficult for a person with Alzheimer's disease to maintain physical independence. The nurse should help the person remain functionally independent for as long as possible. One way to do this is to simplify daily activities by organizing them into short, achievable steps so that the patient experiences a sense of accomplishment. Frequently, an occupational therapist can suggest ways to simplify tasks or recommend adaptive equipment. Direct patient supervision is sometimes necessary, but maintaining personal dignity and autonomy is important for the person with Alzheimer's disease. He or she is encouraged to make choices when appropriate and to participate in self-care activities as much as possible.

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 12-2 \\ Identification of Agitation in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease}

Whall, A. L., Black, M. E. A., Yankou, D. J., et al. (1999). Nurse aides' identification of onset and level of agitation in late stage dementia patients. American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 14, 202-206.

\section*{Purpose}

Nursing assistants provide the majority of care to patients in nursing homes. They are vital links in the early identification, and therefore in the treatment, of agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nurses' aides (NAs) are sometimes characterized as unwilling or unable to manage patients' agitation. This study examines the process by which nurses' aides can successfully identify this agitation.

\section*{Design}

NAs from five different nursing homes owned by the same corporate entity were asked to participate in the study. Criteria to participate included being employed for at least 1 year. (Research demonstrates that NAs who remain at a facility longer than 1 year usually have a commitment to those they serve.) The NAs did not receive any additional wages and were only promised a letter to indicate that they had participated in the study. Each NA received approximately 1 hour of training via audio tapes and conversation with nurse experts. Each NA was then paired with a nurse expert to assess his or her skill at appropriately identifying levels of agitation in patients with late-stage Alzheimer's disease.

\section*{Conclusions}

This study demonstrated that NAs with a minimum of 1 year of employment did an excellent job in acquiring new observation skills with only 1 hour of training and positive reinforcement via a letter noting their participation in this study. The NAs' assessment of signs of agitation agreed with that of the nurse expert more than $90 \%$ of the time. All the NAs involved reported gaining helpful insights in managing agitated behavior as a result of participation in the study.

\section*{Implications for Practice}

The results of this study support the ability of NAs to accurately observe and report agitated behavior as a result of a brief training session using adult learning principles that stressed the importance of their input into the training and learning objectives. Early observation and reporting of agitated behavior is important to prevent agitation from increasing to the level of physical aggression.

\section*{PROVIDING FOR SOCIALIZATION AND INTIMACY NEEDS}

Because socialization with old friends can be comforting, visits, letters, and phone calls are encouraged. Visits should be brief and nonstressful; limiting visitors to one or two at a time helps to reduce overstimulation. Because recreation is important, the person is encouraged to enjoy simple activities. Realistic goals that provide satisfaction are appropriate. Hobbies and activities such as walking, exercising, and socializing can improve the quality of life. The nonjudgmental friendliness of a pet may provide a lonely person with stimulation, comfort, and contentment. Care of the pet by the patient can also provide a satisfying activity and an outlet for energy.

Alzheimer's disease does not eliminate the need for intimacy. The patient and his or her spouse may or may not continue to enjoy sexual activity. The spouse should be encouraged to talk about any sexual concerns, and sexual counseling may be suggested if necessary. Simple expressions of love, such as touching and holding, are often meaningful.

\section*{PROMOTING ADEQUATE NUTRITION}

Mealtime can be a pleasant, social occasion or a time of upset and distress, so it should be kept simple and calm, without confronta-
tions. The patient will prefer familiar foods that look appetizing and taste good. To avoid the patient's "playing" with the food, one dish is offered at a time. Food is cut into small pieces to prevent choking. Liquids may be easier to swallow if they are converted to gelatin. Hot food and beverages are served warm, but the temperature of the foods should be checked to prevent burns.

When lack of coordination interferes with self-feeding, adaptive equipment is helpful. Some patients may do well eating with their fingers. If this is the case, an apron or a smock, rather than a bib, is used to protect clothing. As deficits progress, it may be necessary to feed the patient. Forgetfulness, disinterest, dental problems, incoordination, overstimulation, and choking can all serve as barriers to good nutrition.

\section*{PROMOTING BALANCED ACTIVITY AND REST}

Many patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit sleep disturbances, wandering, and behaviors that may be deemed inappropriate. These behaviors are most likely to occur when there are underlying physical or psychological needs that are unmet. It is imperative that caregivers seek to learn the needs of the patient who is exhibiting this type of behavior, because further health decline can ensue if the source of the problem is not corrected. Adequate sleep and physical exercise are essential. If sleep is interrupted or the patient is unable to fall asleep, music, warm milk, or a back rub may help the person relax. During the day, the patient should be given sufficient opportunity to participate in exercise activities, because a regular pattern of activity and rest will enhance nighttime sleep. Long periods of daytime sleeping are discouraged.

\section*{SUPPORTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

The emotional burden placed on the family of a patient with Alzheimer's disease is enormous. The physical health of the patient is often very stable, and the mental degeneration is gradual. Because the diagnosis is not specific, the family may cling to the hope that the diagnosis is incorrect and that the person will improve if he or she tries harder. Aggression and hostility exhibited by the patient are often misunderstood by the caregiver or family, who feel unappreciated, frustrated, and angry. Feelings of guilt, nervousness, and worry contribute to caregiver fatigue, depression, and family dysfunction. In some cases caregivers themselves can become so fatigued as a result of the stress of caregiving that elder neglect or abuse can occur. This has been documented in home situations as well as institutions. If elder neglect or abuse of any kind-including physical, psychological, sexual, or financial abuse-is suspected, the local adult protective services agency must be notified; the role of the nurse is not to prove the neglect or abuse, but to report it (Tumolo, 2000).

The multiple needs of family caregivers have been addressed by the Alzheimer's Association. This national organization is a coalition of family members and professionals who share the goals of family support and service, education, research, and advocacy. Family support groups, respite care, and adult day care are available through the Alzheimer's Association. Concerned volunteers are trained to provide structure to caregiver support groups. Through the use of respite care, a service commonly provided, the caregiver can get away from the home for short periods while someone else is tending to the patient's needs.

The nurse must be sensitive to the highly emotional issues that the family is confronting. Support and education of the caregivers are essential components of care. The family can contact the Alzheimer's Association or a comparable group that provides the opportunity to meet with others who are experiencing similar problems.

\section*{The Older Adult in an Acute Care Setting: Altered Responses to IIIness}

The elderly person entering the acute care setting is at increased risk for complications, infections, and functional decline. The interdisciplinary team and nursing staff can help avert negative outcomes by being knowledgeable about the physiologic and psychological responses of older adults to acute illnesses and by planning and implementing preventive measures. In addition to the interventions discussed in the following paragraphs, general nursing measures that can be taken to avoid complications in the older adult include careful and frequent assessment of vital signs, mental status, fluid balance, and skin integrity; prompt identification and treatment of complications; promotion of independent selfcare and mobility; assistance with frequent position changes and deep-breathing exercises; alertness to possible medication reactions; and assistance with ADLs and toileting.

\section*{INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTION}

Infectious diseases present a significant threat of morbidity and mortality to older people, in part because of the blunted response of host defenses caused by a reduction in both cell-mediated and humoral immunity (see Chapters 50 and 51). Age-related loss of physiologic reserve and chronic illnesses also contribute to increased susceptibility. Pneumonia, urinary tract infections, tuberculosis (TB), gastrointestinal infections, and skin infections are some of the commonly occurring infections in older people.

The effects of influenza and pneumococcal infections on older people are also significant. Estimates place the number of deaths from influenza at 10,000 to 40,000 per year. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is responsible for 300,000 deaths annually in the United States, making it the second most common nosocomial infection (after urinary tract infection) and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infection. Many of these deaths involve older adults because of their increased vulnerability to infection (Smith-Sims, 2001).

The influenza vaccine is prepared yearly to adjust for the specific immunologic characteristics that are present in the influenza viruses at that time. It is an inactivated preparation that should be taken annually in the fall, preferably in November. The pneumococcal vaccine has 23 type-specific capsular polysaccharides. Protection lasts 4 years or longer. Revaccination is rarely recommended because of the higher incidence of local reaction on subsequent immunizations. Both of these injections can be received at the same time in separate injection sites. The nurse should urge older people to receive these vaccines. All health care providers working with older people or high-risk chronically ill people should also be immunized.

TB significantly affects older adults. Case rates for TB are highest among those who are 65 years of age or older, with the exception of persons with HIV infection. Nursing home residents account for the majority of the cases in the older population. Much of the infection rate is attributed to reactivation of old infection. Pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB often have subtle, nonspecific symptoms. This is of particular concern in the nursing home, because an active case of TB places patients and staff at risk for infection.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines suggest that all new admissions to nursing homes receive a Mantoux test (PPD test) unless there is a history of TB or a previous positive response. All patients whose tests are not positive (a positive test is indicated by induration of more than 10 mm
at 48 to 72 hours) should receive a second test in 1 week. The first PPD serves to boost the suppressed immune response that may occur with an older person. Chest x-ray studies and possibly sputum studies should be used to follow up on PPD-positive responders and converters. For positive converters, a course of preventive therapy for 6 to 12 months with isoniazid (INH) reduces the risk of active disease by $70 \%$. All negative testers should be periodically retested. The nurse can facilitate this process within the care facility (CDC, 2000).

\section*{ALTERED PAIN AND FEBRILE RESPONSES}

Many altered physical, emotional, and systemic reactions to disease are attributed to age-related changes in older people. Useful and reliable physical indicators of illness in young and middleaged people cannot be relied on for the diagnosis of potential lifethreatening problems in older adults. The response to pain in older people may be lessened because of reduced acuity of touch, alterations in neural pathways, and diminished processing of sensory data. Research has demonstrated the absence of chest pain in many older adults experiencing a myocardial infarction. Hiatal hernia or upper gastrointestinal distress is often responsible for chest pain in elderly people. Acute abdominal conditions, such as mesenteric infarction and appendicitis, often go unrecognized in elderly people because of atypical signs and absence of pain (Kufrovich, 2001).

The baseline body temperature for older people is about $1^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ lower than it is for younger people. In the event of illness, therefore, the body temperature of an older person may not reach a sufficient elevation to qualify as a traditionally defined "fever." A temperature of $37.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, in combination with systemic symptoms, may signal infection. A temperature of $38.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ is almost certainly a serious infection that needs prompt attention. A blunted fever in the face of an infection often indicates a poor prognosis. Elevations in temperature rarely exceed $39.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \left(103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. The nurse must be alert to other subtle signs of infection: mental confusion, increased respirations, tachycardia, and changed facial appearance and color.

\section*{ALTERED EMOTIONAL IMPACT}

The emotional component of illness in older people may differ from that in younger people. Many elderly people equate good health with the absence of old age. "You are as old as you feel" is a belief of many. An illness that requires hospitalization or a change in lifestyle is an imminent threat to well-being. Admission to the hospital is often feared and actively avoided. Economic concerns and fear of becoming a burden to the family often lead to high anxiety in older people. The nurse must recognize the implications of fear, anxiety, and dependency in elderly patients. Autonomy and independent decision making are encouraged. A positive and confident demeanor in the nurse and the family promote a positive mental outlook in the elderly patient. In addition to anxiety and fear, older people are at high risk for disorientation, confusion, change in level of consciousness, and other symptoms of delirium if they are admitted to the hospital.

\section*{ALTERED SYSTEMIC RESPONSE}

The effect of illness on an aged person has far-reaching repercussions. The decline in organ function that occurs in every system of the aging body eventually forces one or more body systems to
function at full capacity. Illness places new demands on body systems that have little or no reserve to meet this crisis. Homeostasis, the ability of the body to maintain an internal balance of function and chemical composition, is jeopardized. The older person may be unable to respond effectively to an acute illness or, if a chronic health condition is present, he or she may be unable to sustain appropriate responses over a long period. Furthermore, the older person's ability to respond to definitive treatment is impaired. These altered responses reinforce the need for the nurse to monitor all of the older adult's body system functions closely, being alert to signs of impending systemic complication.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Mrs. C., a 64-year-old woman, arrives at the presurgical admission unit for her scheduled toe amputation; she has chronic arterial insufficiency, secondary to diabetes, with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation. As you review the list of medications that she has brought with her, you discover that she has listed, "Coumadin 3 mg per day", and "Warfarin 1 mg per day." As you question her, she reports that her physician provided a new prescription for her anticoagulation at her preoperative visit last week. She was unaware that Coumadin and warfarin were the same medication and continued on the Coumadin while starting the "new" prescription. What will your first action be?
2. You are working for a home health agency and making regular visits to an 85-year-old widow who recently moved in with her daughter because of declining health. On your first visit since her move, you noted a bruise on the patient's hip. She stated that she had bumped into a chair on the way to the bathroom. On the next visit, you find her in dirty clothing. She stated that the washing machine was broken and her daughter was waiting for the repairman. Today as you visit with the patient, there is a cut on her arm and more bruises. She confides that her daughter is overworked and sometimes gets a bit "impatient" as she is providing care for her. Describe the most appropriate plan of action.
3. As a charge nurse in a skilled nursing facility, your daily assessment of Mr. Jones, a 75-year-old man with late-stage Alzheimer's disease, normally finds him to be medically stable, with a pleasant but confused affect. When you assess him today, his vital signs continue to be stable; however, he angrily yells at you when you speak to him, he is notably agitated, and he cries with pain as he is attempting to void. Based on your understanding of the altered response to acute infection in the elderly, what assessment parameters would you evaluate? What plan of action would you initiate?

\section*{Pain Management}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Differentiate between acute pain, chronic pain, and cancer pain.
2. Describe the negative consequences of pain.
3. Describe the pathophysiology of pain.
4. Describe factors that can alter the perception of pain.
5. Demonstrate appropriate use of pain measurement instruments.
6. Explain the physiologic basis of pain relief interventions.
7. Explain the impact of aging on pain.
8. Discuss when opioid tolerance may be a problem.
9. Identify appropriate pain relief interventions for selected groups of patients.
10. Compare the various types of neurosurgical procedures used to treat intractable pain.
11. Develop a plan to prevent and treat the adverse effects of opioid analgesic agents.
12. Use the nursing process as a framework for the care of patients with pain.

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage (Merskey \& Bogduk, 1994). It is the most common reason for seeking health care. It occurs with many disorders, diagnostic tests, and treatments. It disables and distresses more people than any single disease. Since nurses spend more time with the patient in pain than do other health care providers, nurses need to understand the pathophysiology of pain, the physiologic and psychological consequences of acute and chronic pain, and the methods used to treat pain. Nurses encounter patients in pain in a variety of settings, including acute care, outpatient, and long-term care settings, as well as in the home. Thus, they must have the knowledge and skills to assess pain, to implement pain relief strategies, and to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, regardless of setting.

\section*{The FifthVital Sign}

Pain management is considered such an important part of care that the American Pain Society coined the phrase "Pain: The 5th Vital Sign" (Campbell, 1995) to emphasize its significance and to increase the awareness among health care professionals of the importance of effective pain management. Documentation of pain assessment is now as prominent as the documentation of the "traditional" vital signs. Pain assessment and management are also mandated by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) (2003).

Calling pain the fifth vital sign suggests that the assessment of pain should be as automatic as taking a patient's blood pressure and pulse. The JCAHO (2003) has incorporated pain and pain management into its standards. JCAHO's standards state that "pain is assessed in all patients" and that "patients have the right to appropriate assessment and management of pain." These standards reflect the importance of pain management.

In health care, the primary care provider's role is to assess and ameliorate pain by administering medications and other treatments. The nurse collaborates with other health care professionals while administering most pain relief interventions, evaluating their effectiveness, and serving as patient advocate when the intervention is ineffective. In addition, the nurse serves as an educator to the patient and family, teaching them to manage the pain relief regimen themselves when appropriate.

The International Association for the Study of Pain definition mentioned earlier encompasses the multidimensional nature of pain (Merskey \& Boduck, 1994). A broad definition of pain is "whatever the person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does" (McCaffery \& Beebe, 1989, p.7). This definition emphasizes the highly subjective nature of pain and pain management. The patient is the best authority on the existence of pain. Therefore, validation of the existence of pain is based on the patient's report that it exists.

Although it is important to believe the patient who reports pain, it is equally important to be alert to patients who deny pain in situations where pain would be expected. A nurse who suspects pain in a patient who denies it should explore with the patient the reason for suspecting pain, such as the fact that the disorder or procedure is usually painful or that the patient grimaces when moving or avoids movement. Exploring why the patient may be denying pain is also helpful. Some people deny pain because they fear the treatment that may result if they report or admit pain. Others deny pain for fear of becoming addicted to opioids (previously referred to as narcotics) if these medications are prescribed.

\section*{Types of Pain}

Pain is categorized according to its duration, location, and etiology. Three basic categories of pain are generally recognized: acute pain, chronic (nonmalignant) pain, and cancer-related pain.
addiction: a behavioral pattern of substance use characterized by a compulsion to take the drug primarily to experience its psychic effects
agonist: a substance that when combined with the receptor produces the drug effect or desired effect. Endorphins and morphine are agonists on the opioid receptors.
algogenic: causing pain
antagonist: a substance that blocks or reverses the effects of the agonist by occupying the receptor site without producing the drug effect. Naloxone (Narcan) is an opioid antagonist.
balanced analgesia: using more than one form of analgesia concurrently to obtain more pain relief with fewer side effects
breakthrough pain: a sudden and temporary increase in pain occurring in a patient being managed with opioid analgesia
endorphins and enkephalins: morphinelike substances produced by the body. Primarily found in the central nervous system, they have the potential to reduce pain.
dependence: occurs when a patient who has been taking opioids experiences a with-
drawal syndrome when the opioids are discontinued; often occurs with opioid tolerance and does not indicate an addiction
nociception: activation of sensory transduction in nerves by thermal, mechanical, or chemical energy impinging on specialized nerve endings. The nerves involved convey information about tissue damage to the central nervous system.
nociceptor: a receptor preferentially sensitive to a noxious stimulus
non-nociceptor: nerve fiber that usually does not transmit pain
opioid: a morphine-like compound that produces bodily effects including pain relief, sedation, constipation, and respiratory depression. This term is preferred over narcotic.
pain: an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience resulting from actual or potential tissue damage
pain threshold: the point at which a stimulus is perceived as painful
pain tolerance: the maximum intensity or duration of pain that a person is willing to endure
patient-controlled analgesia (PCA): selfadministration of analgesic agents by a patient instructed about the procedure
placebo effect: analgesia that results from the expectation that a substance will work, not from the actual substance itself
prostaglandins: chemical substances that increase the sensitivity of pain receptors by enhancing the pain-provoking effect of bradykinin
referred pain: pain perceived as coming from an area different from that in which the pathology is occurring. An example would be the perception of left arm or jaw pain in a person having a myocardial infarction.
sensitization: a heightened response seen after exposure to a noxious stimulus. Response to the same stimulus is to feel more pain.
tolerance: occurs when a person who has been taking opioids becomes less sensitive to their analgesic properties (and usually side effects). Characterized by the need for increasing doses to maintain the same level of pain relief.

\section*{ACUTE PAIN}

Usually of recent onset and commonly associated with a specific injury, acute pain indicates that damage or injury has occurred. Pain is significant in that it draws attention to its existence and teaches the person to avoid similar potentially painful situations. If no lasting damage occurs and no systemic disease exists, acute pain usually decreases along with healing. For purposes of definition, acute pain can be described as lasting from seconds to 6 months. However, the 6 -month time frame has been criticized (Brookoff, 2000) as inaccurate since many acute injuries heal within a few weeks and most heal by 6 weeks. In a situation where healing is expected in 3 weeks and the patient continues to suffer pain, it should be considered chronic and treated with interventions used for chronic pain. Waiting for the full 6-month time frame in this example could cause needless suffering.

\section*{CHRONIC (NONMALIGNANT) PAIN}

Chronic pain is constant or intermittent pain that persists beyond the expected healing time and that can seldom be attributed to a specific cause or injury. It may have a poorly defined onset, and it is often difficult to treat because the cause or origin may be unclear. Although acute pain may be a useful signal that something is wrong, chronic pain usually becomes a problem in its own right.

Chronic pain may be defined as pain that lasts for 6 months or longer, although 6 months is an arbitrary period for differentiating between acute and chronic pain. An episode of pain may assume the characteristics of chronic pain before 6 months have elapsed, or some types of pain may remain primarily acute in nature for longer than 6 months. Nevertheless, after 6 months, most pain experiences are accompanied by problems related to the pain itself. Chronic pain serves no useful purpose. If it persists, it may become the patient's primary disorder.

The nurse may come in contact with patients with chronic pain when they are admitted to the hospital for treatment or when they are seen out of the hospital for home care. Frequently the nurse is called on in community-based settings to assist patients in managing pain. For more information on common pain syndromes, see Chart 13-1.

\section*{CANCER-RELATED PAIN}

Pain associated with cancer may be acute or chronic. Pain resulting from cancer is so ubiquitous that after fear of dying, it is the second most common fear of newly diagnosed cancer patients (Lema, 1997). More than half of the 1,308 cancer patients included in a study conducted by Foley (1999) reported being in moderate to severe pain $50 \%$ of the time. Pain in the patient suffering from cancer can be directly associated with the cancer (eg, bony infiltration with tumor cells or nerve compression), a result of cancer treatment (eg, surgery or radiation), or not associated with the cancer (eg, trauma). Most pain associated with cancer, however, is a direct result of tumor involvement. An approach to cancer pain management is illustrated in Figure 13-1. This three-step approach illustrates the types of analgesic medications used for various levels of pain. A cancer pain algorithm developed as a set of analgesic guiding principles appears in Figure 13-2.

\section*{PAIN CLASSIFIED BY LOCATION}

The previous discussion of acute and chronic pain is an example of the categorization of pain according to duration. Pain is sometimes categorized according to location, such as pelvic pain, head-
ache, and chest pain. This type of categorization is helpful in communicating and treating pain. For example, chest pain suggests angina or a myocardial infarction and indicates the need for treatment according to cardiac care standards.

\section*{PAIN CLASSIFIED BY ETIOLOGY}

Categorizing pain according to etiology is another way to think about pain and its management. Burn pain and postherpetic neuralgia are examples of pain described by their etiology. Clinicians often can predict the course of pain and plan effective treatment using this categorization.

\section*{Harmful Effects of Pain}

Regardless of its nature, pattern, or cause, pain that is inadequately treated has harmful effects beyond the suffering it causes. For example, unrelieved pain impairs the postoperative patient's ability to sleep (Raymond, Nielsen, Lauigne et al., 2001). Zalon (1997) found that the most common response to severe pain in frail, elderly postoperative women was to lie absolutely still, a response likely to result in postoperative complications.

\section*{EFFECTS OF ACUTE PAIN}

Unrelieved acute pain can affect the pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and immune systems. The stress response ("neuroendocrine response to stress") that occurs with trauma also occurs with other causes of severe pain. The widespread endocrine, immunologic, and inflammatory changes that occur with stress can have significant negative effects. This is particularly harmful in patients compromised by age, illness, or injury.

The stress response generally consists of increased metabolic rate and cardiac output, impaired insulin response, increased production of cortisol, and increased retention of fluids (see Chap. 6 for details about the stress response). The stress response may increase the patient's risk for physiologic disorders (eg, myocardial infarction, pulmonary infection, thromboembolism, and prolonged paralytic ileus). The patient with severe pain and associated stress may be unable to take a deep breath and may experience increased fatigue and decreased mobility. Although these effects may be tolerated by a young, healthy person, they may hamper recovery in an elderly, debilitated, or critically ill person. Effective pain relief may result in a faster recovery and improved outcomes.

\section*{EFFECTS OF CHRONIC PAIN}

Like acute pain, chronic pain also has adverse effects. Suppression of the immune function associated with chronic pain may promote tumor growth. Also, chronic pain often results in depression and disability. Although health care providers express concern about the large quantities of opioid medications required to relieve chronic pain in some patients, it is safe to use large doses of these medications to control progressive chronic pain. In fact, failure to administer adequate pain relief may be unsafe because of the consequences of unrelieved pain (McCracken \& Iverson, 2001).

Regardless of how the patient copes with chronic pain, pain for an extended period can result in disability. Patients with a number of chronic pain syndromes report depression, anger, and fatigue (Meuser, Pietruck, Radruch et al., 2001; Raymond et al., 2001). The patient may be unable to continue the activities and

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome
Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is the name given to a group of conditions previously described as causalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), and other diagnoses. Complex regional pain syndrome describes a variety of painful conditions that often follow an injury. The magnitude and duration of the pain far exceeds the expected duration and often results in significant impairment of motor function. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is categorized as CRPS type I and occurs after a relatively minor trauma. Characterized by unexplained diffuse burning pain, usually in the periphery of an extremity, CRPS type I is accompanied by weakness, a skin color and temperature change relative to the other extremity, limited range of motion, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, edema, altered hair growth, and sweating (Janig, 2001).

Pain, which worsens with movement, cutaneous stimulation, or stress, often occurs after surgery or trauma to the extremity but is not limited to the area of surgery or trauma. CRPS type I is more common than CRPS type II and is usually managed through a pain clinic. Currently, regional sympathetic blockade and regional IV bretylium offer promise for relief. Tricyclic antidepressants may be tried as well. Complex regional pain syndrome type II refers to causalgia. Type II is more likely to develop after trauma with detectable peripheral nerve lesions (Janig, 2001).

\section*{Postmastectomy Pain Syndrome (PMP)}

Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMP) occurs after mastectomy with node dissection but is not necessarily related to the continuation of disease. Characterized by the sensation of constriction accompanied by a burning, prickling, or numbness in the posterior arm, axilla, or chest wall, PMP is often aggravated by movement of the shoulder, resulting in a frozen shoulder from immobilization (Miaskowski \& Dibble, 1995).

Post-traumatic headache disorder occurs after trauma to the head and is characterized by daily and persistent headache. It is more likely to follow mild head injury than moderate to severe injury (Uomoto \& Esselman, 1993).

\section*{Fibromyalgia (Fibrositis)}

Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome characterized by generalized musculoskeletal pain, trigger points, stiffness, fatigability, and sleep disturbances, is aggravated by stress and overexertion. Treatment consists of NSAIDs, trigger point injections with local anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, stress reduction, and regular exercise.

\section*{Hemiplegia-Associated Shoulder Pain}

Hemiplegia-associated shoulder pain is a pain syndrome that affects as many as $80 \%$ of stroke patients. It may result from stretching of the shoulder joint due to the uncompensated pull of gravity on the impaired arm. It may be preventable with functional electrical stimulation of involved shoulder muscles.

\section*{Pain Associated With Sickle Cell Disease}

Pain experienced by patients with sickle cell disease results from venous occlusion caused by the sickle shape of the blood cells, impaired circulation to a muscle or organ, ischemia, and infarction. Acute pain may be managed with IV opioid analgesics administered according to a schedule or by a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and NSAIDs. Warm soaks and elevating the affected body part may help as well. Meperidine (Demerol) therapy is not recommended in patients with compromised renal function, nor is cold therapy. Patients with sickle cell disease may have a long history of chronic pain. Some issues related to their history include tolerance, possible long-term dependence, racial prejudice, and inadequate pain treatment.

\section*{AIDS-Related Pain}

As AIDS progresses, so do problems that produce increasing amounts of pain, such as neuropathy, esophagitis, headaches, postherpetic pain, and abdominal, back, bone, and joint pain. Pain relief interventions are individualized and may consist of NSAIDs, long-lasting opioids, such as fentanyl patches, and topical lidocaine. Tricyclic antidepressants may provide comfort in neuropathic and postherpetic pain.

\section*{Burn Pain}

Possibly the most severe pain, burn pain tends to be underrated by health care professionals the longer they work with burn patients. Besides administration of IV opioid analgesic agents, current therapies to ameliorate pain in burn patients include débridement under general anesthesia; anxiety reduction; intervention with PCA devices, such as hand-held nitrous oxide delivery system; and cognitive techniques, particularly hypnosis.

\section*{Guillain-Barré Syndrome and Pain}

A progressive, inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system, Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by flaccid paralysis accompanied by paresthesia and pain-muscle pain and severe, unrelenting, burning pain. Complaints of severe pain may be difficult to accept in the face of the characteristic flaccid facial response; therefore, the nurse must be sensitive and learn to disregard nonverbal cues that contradict the verbal report of pain. Treatment interventions include NSAIDs for muscle pain and opioids if NSAIDs are ineffective. Causalgia and neurogenic pain may be relieved by systemic or epidural opioids or, possibly, antiseizure agents or tricyclic antidepressants. To relieve the burning, some patients beg to have windows opened and clothing removed, even in cold weather. This suggests that gentle ice massage may help. Research is needed, however, to test this theory.

\section*{Opioid Tolerance}

Opioid tolerance is common among patients treated for chronic pain, especially patients being treated by multiple health care providers. Opioid tolerance should be suspected when a patient (1) complains of significantly more pain than is usually associated with the condition, (2) requires unusually high doses of opioids to achieve pain relief, or (3) experiences an unusually low incidence and severity of side effects from opioids. Cancer patients also often develop a tolerance to opioids, requiring larger and larger doses of medication to obtain pain relief. In such cases, the nurse must recognize what is happening, seek additional information from the patient or family, and then procure additional prescriptions for analgesics or an alternative intervention. In patients undergoing surgery, epidural local anesthetic agents provide excellent postoperative analgesia, but the problem of opioid tolerance must be elicited from the patient preoperatively.

Occasionally a recovering heroin addict is seen in an acute pain situation (surgery or trauma). This patient may be undergoing treatment with naltrexone (Trexan), a long-acting form of the opioid antagonist naloxone (Narcan). Both the short-acting naloxone and the longacting naltrexone act by binding to the opioid receptors, so opioids cannot be effective. If surgery is planned, the naltrexone should be discontinued a few days before the procedure. Should a patient receiving naltrexone be in immediate need of pain relief, very high doses of opioids are necessary. Alternative methods of pain relief (local or regional blockade and NSAIDs) should be incorporated in the pain management plan.

interpersonal relationships he or she engaged in before the pain began. Disabilities may range from curtailing participation in physical activities to being unable to take care of personal needs, such as dressing or eating. The nurse needs to understand the effects of chronic pain on the patient and family and needs to be knowledgeable about pain relief strategies and appropriate resources to assist effectively with pain management.

\section*{Pathophysiology of Pain}

The sensory experience of pain depends on the interaction between the nervous system and the environment. The processing of noxious stimuli and the resulting perception of pain involve the peripheral and central nervous systems.

\section*{PAIN TRANSMISSION}

Among the nerve mechanisms and structures involved in the transmission of pain perceptions to and from the area of the brain that interprets pain are nociceptors, or pain receptors, and chemical mediators. Nociceptors are receptors that are preferentially sensitive to a noxious stimulus. Nociceptors are also called pain receptors, but the former term is preferred.

\section*{Nociceptors}

Nociceptors are free nerve endings in the skin that respond only to intense, potentially damaging stimuli. Such stimuli may be mechanical, thermal, or chemical in nature. The joints, skeletal muscle, fascia, tendons, and cornea also have nociceptors that have the potential to transmit stimuli that produce pain. However, the large internal organs (viscera) do not contain nerve endings that respond only to painful stimuli. Pain originating in these organs results from intense stimulation of receptors that have other purposes. For example, inflammation, stretching, ischemia, dilation, and spasm of the internal organs all cause an intense response in these multipurpose fibers and can cause severe pain.

Nociceptors are part of complex multidirectional pathways. These nerve fibers branch very near their origin in the skin and send fibers to local blood vessels, mast cells, hair follicles, and sweat glands. When these fibers are stimulated, histamine is released from the mast cells, causing vasodilation. Nociceptors respond to high-intensity mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Some receptors respond to only one type of stimuli; others, called polymodal nociceptors, respond to all three types of stimuli. These highly specialized neurons transfer the mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimulus into electrical activity or action potentials.

The cutaneous fibers located more centrally further branch and communicate with the paravertebral sympathetic chain of the nervous system and with large internal organs. As a result of the connections between these nerve fibers, pain is often accompanied by vasomotor, autonomic, and visceral effects. In a patient with severe acute pain, for example, gastrointestinal peristalsis may decrease or stop.

\section*{Peripheral Nervous System}

A number of algogenic (pain-causing) substances that affect the sensitivity of nociceptors are released into the extracellular tissue as a result of tissue damage. Histamine, bradykinin, acetylcholine, serotonin, and substance $P$ are chemicals that increase the transmission of pain. The transmission of pain is also referred to as nociception. Prostaglandins are chemical substances thought to increase the sensitivity of pain receptors by enhancing the painprovoking effect of bradykinin. These chemical mediators also cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, resulting in redness, warmth, and swelling of the injured area.

Once nociception is initiated, the nociceptive action potentials are transmitted by the peripheral nervous system (Porth, 2002). The first-order neurons travel from the periphery (skin, cornea, visceral organs) to the spinal cord via the dorsal horn. There are two main types of fibers involved in the transmission of nociception. Smaller, myelinated $\mathrm{A} \boldsymbol{\delta}$ (A delta) fibers transmit nociception rapidly, which produces the initial "fast pain." Type C fibers are larger, unmyelinated fibers that transmit what is called second pain. This type of pain has dull, aching, or burning qualities that last longer than the initial fast pain. The type and concentration of nerve fibers to transmit pain vary by tissue type.

If there is repeated C fiber input, a greater response is noted in dorsal horn neurons, causing the person to perceive more pain. In other words, the same noxious stimulus produces hyperalgesia, and the person reports greater pain than was felt at the first stimulus. For this reason, it is important to treat patients with analgesic agents when they first feel the pain. Patients require less medication and experience more effective pain relief if analgesia is administered before the patient becomes sensitized to the pain.

Chemicals that reduce or inhibit the transmission or perception of pain include endorphins and enkephalins. These morphinelike neurotransmitters are endogenous (produced by the body). They are examples of substances that reduce nociceptive transmission when applied to certain nerve fibers. The term "endorphin" is a combination of two words: endogenous and morphine. Endorphins and enkephalins are found in heavy concentrations in the central nervous system, particularly the spinal and medullary dorsal horn, the periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus, and amygdala. Morphine and other opioid medications act at receptor sites to suppress the excitation initiated by noxious stimuli. The binding of opioids to receptor sites is responsible for the

effects noted after their administration. Each receptor (mu, kappa, delta) responds differently when activated. Table 13-1 summarizes the classification and action of opioid receptors.

\section*{Central Nervous System}

After tissue injury occurs, nociception (the neurologic transmission of pain impulses) to the spinal cord via the $\mathrm{A} \boldsymbol{\delta}$ and C fibers continues. The fibers enter the dorsal horn, which is divided into laminae based on cell type. The laminae II cell type is commonly referred to as the substantia gelatinosa. In the substantia gelatinosa are projections that relay nociception to other parts of the spinal cord (Fig. 13-3).

Nociception continues from the spinal cord to the reticular formation, thalamus, limbic system, and cerebral cortex. Here nociception is localized and its characteristics become apparent to the person, including the intensity. The involvement of the reticular formation, limbic, and reticular activating systems is responsible for the individual variations in the perception of noxious stimuli. Individuals may report the same stimulus differently based on their anxiety, past experiences, and expectations. This is a result of the conscious perception of pain.

For pain to be consciously perceived, neurons in the ascending system must be activated. Activation occurs as a result of input from the nociceptors located in the skin and internal organs. Once activated, the inhibitory interneuronal fibers in the
dorsal horn inhibit or turn off the transmission of noxious stimulating information in the ascending pathway.

\section*{Descending Control System}

The descending control system is a system of fibers that originate in the lower and midportion of the brain (specifically the periaqueductal gray matter) and terminate on the inhibitory interneuronal fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This system is probably always somewhat active; it prevents continuous transmission of stimuli as painful, partly through the action of the endorphins. As nociception occurs, the descending control system is activated to inhibit pain.

Cognitive processes may stimulate endorphin production in the descending control system. The effectiveness of this system is illustrated by the effects of distraction. The distractions of visitors

\section*{Physiology/Pathophysiology}

or a favorite TV show may increase activity in the descending control system. Therefore, the person who has visitors may not report pain because activation of the descending control system results in less noxious or painful information being transmitted to consciousness. Once the distraction by the visitors ends, activity in the descending control system decreases, resulting in increased transmission of painful stimuli.

The interconnections between the descending neuronal system and the ascending sensory tract are called inhibitory interneuronal fibers. These fibers contain enkephalin and are primarily activated through the activity of non-nociceptor peripheral fibers (fibers that normally do not transmit painful or noxious stimuli) in the same receptor field as the pain receptor, and descending fibers, grouped together in a system called descending control. The enkephalins and endorphins are thought to inhibit pain impulses by stimulating the inhibitory interneuronal fibers, which in turn reduce the transmission of noxious impulses via the ascending system (Puig \& Montes, 1998).

The classic gate control theory of pain, described by Melzack and Wall in 1965, was the first to clearly articulate the existence of a pain-modulating system (Melzack, 1996). This theory proposes that stimulation of the skin evokes nervous impulses that are then transmitted by three systems located in the spinal cord. The substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn, the dorsal column fibers, and the central transmission cells act to influence nociceptive impulses. The noxious impulses are influenced by a "gating mechanism." Melzack and Wall proposed that stimulation of the large-diameter fibers inhibits the transmission of pain, thus "closing the gate." Conversely, when smaller fibers are stimulated, the gate is opened. The gating mechanism is influenced by nerve impulses that descend from the brain. This theory proposes a specialized system of large-diameter fibers that activate selective cognitive processes via the modulating properties of the spinal gate. Figure 13-4 shows a schematic representation of a gate control system and nociceptive pathways.

The gate control theory was important because it was the first theory to suggest that psychological factors play a role in the perception of pain. The theory guided research toward the cognitivebehavioral approaches to pain management. This theory helps to explain how interventions such as distraction and music therapy provide pain relief.

Melzack (1996) extended the gate control theory after carefully analyzing phantom limb pain. He proposed that a large, widespread network of neurons exists that consists of loops between the thalamus and cortex and between the cortex and the limbic system. Melzack labeled this network the neuromatrix. As

For example, stimulation of the nociceptor will result in the transmission of an impulse that will be interpreted as pain. When it is stimulated it will stimulate transmission at the next fiber junction (represented as $+>-$ ). The interneuronal fiber is an inhibitory neuron (->-). When it is stimulated it, in turn, inhibits or shuts off transmission at the next junction. So a placebo has a (+) stimulatory effect on the descending control system, which has a stimulatory effect ( + ) on the interneuronal fiber, which has an inhibitory effect ( - ) on the ascending control system.

\end{figure}
information is processed in the neuromatrix, a characteristic pattern emerges. This pattern, referred to as the neurosignature, is a continuous outflow from the neuromatrix. Ultimately, the neurosignature output, with a constant stream of input and varying patterns, produces the feelings of the whole body with constantly changing qualities.

Melzack (1996) theorized that in the absence of modulating inputs from the missing limb, the active neuromatrix produces a neurosignature pattern that is perceived as pain. The neuromatrix theory highlights the role of the brain in sustaining the experience of pain. Some researchers have criticized this theory as not adding to the understanding of how psychological factors influence pain (Keefe, Lefebvre \& Starr, 1996). While the neuromatrix theory might explain unusual pain phenomena, its contribution to understanding pain management remains to be seen.

\section*{FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PAIN RESPONSE}

A person's pain experience is influenced by a number of factors, including past experiences with pain, anxiety, culture, age, gender, and expectations about pain relief. These factors may increase or decrease the person's perception of pain, increase or decrease tolerance for pain, and affect the responses to pain.

\section*{Past Experience}

It is tempting to expect that a person who has had multiple or prolonged experiences with pain would be less anxious and more tolerant of pain than one who has had little pain. For most people, however, this is not true. Often, the more experience a person has had with pain, the more frightened he or she is about subsequent painful events. This person may be less able to tolerate pain; that is, he or she wants relief from pain sooner and before it becomes severe. This reaction is more likely to occur if the person has received inadequate pain relief in the past. A person with repeated pain experiences may have learned to fear the escalation of pain and its inadequate treatment. Once a person experiences severe pain, that person knows just how severe it can be. Conversely, someone who has never had severe pain may have no fear of such pain.

The way a person responds to pain is a result of many separate painful events during a lifetime. For some, past pain may have been constant and unrelenting, as in prolonged or chronic and persistent pain. The individual who has pain for months or years may become irritable, withdrawn, and depressed.

The undesirable effects that may result from previous experience point to the need for the nurse to be aware of the patient's past experiences with pain. If pain is relieved promptly and adequately, the person may be less fearful of future pain and better able to tolerate it.

\section*{Anxiety and Depression}

Although it is commonly believed that anxiety will increase pain, this is not necessarily true. Research has demonstrated no consistent relationship between anxiety and pain, nor has research shown that preoperative stress reduction training reduces postoperative pain (Keogh, Ellery, Hunt et al., 2001; Rhudy \& Meagher, 2000). Postoperative anxiety is most related to preoperative anxiety and postoperative complications. However, anxiety that is relevant or related to the pain may increase the patient's perception of pain. For example, a patient who was treated 2 years ago for breast cancer and now has hip pain may fear that the pain indicates metastasis. In this case, the anxiety may result in increased pain. Anxiety that is unrelated to the pain may distract the patient and may actually decrease the perception of pain. For example, a mother who is hospitalized with complications from abdominal surgery and is anxious about her children may perceive less pain as her anxiety about her children increases.

The routine use of antianxiety medications to treat anxiety in someone with pain may prevent the person from reporting pain because of sedation and may impair the patient's ability to take deep breaths, get out of bed, and cooperate with the treatment plan. The most effective way to relieve pain is by directing the treatment at the pain rather than at the anxiety.

Just as anxiety is associated with pain because of concerns and fears about the underlying disease, depression is associated with chronic pain and unrelieved cancer pain. In chronic pain situations, depression is associated with major life changes due to the limiting effects of the pain, specifically unemployment. Longer durations of pain are associated with an increased incidence of depression (Wall, 1999). Unrelieved cancer pain drastically in-
terferes with the patient's quality of life, and relieving the pain may go a long way toward treating the depression.

\section*{Culture}

Beliefs about pain and how to respond to it differ from one culture to the next. Early in childhood, individuals learn from those around them what responses to pain are acceptable or unacceptable. For example, a child may learn that a sports injury is not expected to hurt as much as a comparable injury caused by a motor vehicle crash. The child also learns what stimuli are expected to be painful and what behavioral responses are acceptable. These beliefs vary from one culture to another; therefore, people from different cultures who experience the same intensity of pain may not report it or respond to it in the same ways.

Cultural factors must be taken into account to effectively manage pain. Many studies have examined the cultural aspects of pain. Inconsistent results, methodologic weaknesses or flaws (Lasch, 2000), and failure of many researchers to carefully distinguish ethnicity, culture, and race make it difficult to interpret the findings of many of these studies. Factors that help to explain differences in a cultural group include age, gender, education level, and income. In addition, the degree to which a patient identifies with a culture influences the degree to which he or she will adopt new health behaviors or cling to traditional health beliefs and practices. Other factors that affect a patient's response to pain include his or her interaction with the health care system and provider factors (Lasch, Wilkes, Montuori et al., 2000).

The nurse's cultural values may differ from those of other cultures. The nurse's cultural expectations and values may include avoiding exaggerated expressions of pain, such as excessive crying

\section*{Pain Management Outcomes for Hospitalized Hispanic Patients}

McNeill, J. A., Sherwood, G. D., Starck, P. L., \& Nieto, B. (2001). Pain management outcomes for hospitalized Hispanic patients. Pain Management Nursing, 2(1), 25-36.

\section*{Purpose}

It has been suggested that members of minority groups are likely to receive inadequate pain management. Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States, yet few studies have examined pain and its management in this group. The purposes of the study were to describe the experience of acute pain and pain management and outcomes of pain management, and to identify predictors of patient satisfaction in a minority sample.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This cross-sectional, descriptive study explored the outcomes of the pain experience of hospitalized Hispanic patients and identified factors that contribute to patient satisfaction with pain management. The study sample consisted of 104 patients who were postoperative or diagnosed with a painful condition and who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours. The subjects identified themselves as Hispanic and spoke English.

The researchers used the American Pain Society's Patient Outcome Questionnaire-Modified and the Pain Management Index to measure the degree of pain, effectiveness of pain management, and patient satisfaction. Data related to analgesic orders and administration were obtained from the patients' medical records.

\section*{Findings}

Ninety-eight percent of the patients reported pain in the last 24 hours. The most interference caused by the pain was for participation in activities related to postoperative recovery (mean $=7.1, \mathrm{SD}=2.9$ ) (on a $0-10$ numeric scale with higher scores indicating more interference).

The least pain interference was in the area of interpersonal relationships (mean $=3.1, \mathrm{SD}=3.2$ ). The mean score on satisfaction with pain management (on a $1-6$ scale with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction) was 4.74 ( $\mathrm{SD}=1.2$ ). Satisfaction with pain management was inversely and significantly correlated with pain intensity. The lower the patient's pain score, the greater the satisfaction with management of pain. Only $66 \%$ of patients who reported pain received an analgesic within the previous 24 hours, although all patients had analgesics prescribed.

The sample was divided into two groups: satisfied ( $\mathrm{n}=77$ ) and dissatisfied ( $\mathrm{n}=23$ ) with pain management. The dissatisfied patients reported higher pain now ( $\mathrm{p}=0.000$ ), higher general pain in the last 24 hours ( $\mathrm{p}=0.000$ ), and greater interference related to pain for activity ( $\mathrm{p}=0.000$ ). Seventy-nine ( $77 \%$ ) of the patients recalled receiving information about the importance of pain management. This factor did not influence satisfaction.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings in this study are similar to those noted in a sample of Caucasian patients. The satisfied and dissatisfied groups differed in the areas of pain rating now and general level of pain and interference related to pain regarding sleep, general activity, mood, and relationships. The reason for the reported high degree of satisfaction when those who reported pain and interference with activities is unclear. In spite of the inverse correlation between pain intensity and satisfaction, the satisfaction ratings were high. Further research is needed to identify the factors that determine satisfaction with pain management.
and moaning, seeking immediate relief from pain, and giving complete descriptions of the pain. A patient's cultural expectations may be to moan and complain about pain, to refuse pain relief measures that do not cure the cause of the pain, or to use adjectives such as "unbearable" in describing the pain. A patient from another cultural background may behave in a quiet, stoic manner rather than express the pain loudly. The nurse must react to the person's pain perception and not to the pain behavior because the behavior is different from his or her own culture.

Recognizing the values of one's own culture and learning how these values differ from those of other cultures help to avoid evaluating the patient's behavior on the basis of one's own cultural expectations and values. A nurse who recognizes cultural differences will have a greater understanding of the patient's pain and will be more accurate in assessing pain and behavioral responses to pain, as well as more effective in relieving the pain.

The main issues to consider when caring for patients of a different culture are:
- What does the illness mean to the patient?
- Are there culturally based stigmas related to this illness or pain?
- What is the role of the family in health care decisions?
- Are traditional pain-relief remedies used?
- What is the role of stoicism in that culture?
- Are there culturally determined ways of expressing and communicating pain?
- Does the patient have any fears about the pain?
- Has the patient seen or does the patient want to see a traditional healer?

Regardless of the patient's culture, nurses need to learn about that particular culture and be aware of power and communication issues that will affect care outcomes. Nurses need to avoid stereotyping patients by culture and provide individualized care rather than assuming that a patient of a specific culture will exhibit more or less pain. In addition to avoiding stereotyping, health care providers need to individualize the amount of medications or therapy according to the information provided by the patient. Nurses need to recognize that stereotypes exist and become sensitive to how stereotypes negatively affect care. Patients in turn must be instructed about how and what to communicate about their pain.

\section*{Age}

Age has long been the focus of research on pain perception and pain tolerance, and again the results have been inconsistent. For example, although some researchers have found that older adults require a higher intensity of noxious stimuli than do younger adults before they report pain (Washington, Gibson \& Helme, 2000), others have found no differences in responses of younger and older adults (Edwards \& Filligim, 2000). Other researchers have found that elderly patients (older than 65 years of age) reported significantly less pain than younger patients ( Li , Greenwald, Gennis et al., 2001). Experts in the field of pain management have concluded that if pain perception is diminished in the elderly person, it is most likely secondary to a disease process (eg, diabetes) rather than to aging (American Geriatrics Society, 1998). More research is needed in the area of aging and its effects on pain perception to understand what the elderly are experiencing.

Although many elderly people seek health care because of pain, others are reluctant to seek help even when in severe pain
because they consider pain to be part of normal aging. Assessment of pain in older adults may be difficult because of the physiologic, psychosocial, and cognitive changes that often accompany aging. In one study, as many as $93 \%$ of nursing home residents reported being in pain daily for the past 6 months (Weiner, Peterson, Ladd et al., 1999). Unrelieved pain contributes to the problems of depression, sleep disturbances, delayed rehabilitation, malnutrition, and cognitive dysfunction (Miaskowski, 2000).

The way an older person responds to pain may differ from the way a younger person responds. Because elderly people have a slower metabolism and a greater ratio of body fat to muscle mass than younger people, small doses of analgesic agents may be sufficient to relieve pain, and these doses may be effective longer (Buffum \& Buffum, 2000). Elderly patients deal with pain according to their lifestyle, personality, and cultural background, as do younger adults. Many elderly people are fearful of addiction and, as a result, will not report that they are in pain or ask for pain medication. Others fail to seek care because they fear that the pain may indicate serious illness or they fear loss of independence.

Elderly patients must receive adequate pain relief after surgery or trauma. When an elderly person becomes confused after surgery or trauma, the confusion is often attributed to medications, which are then discontinued. However, confusion in the elderly may be a result of untreated and unrelieved pain. In some cases postoperative confusion clears once the pain is relieved. Judgments about pain and the adequacy of treatment should be based on the patient's report of pain and pain relief rather than on age.

\section*{Gender}

Researchers have studied gender differences in pain levels and in responses to pain. Once again, the results have been inconsistent. In one study, women tended to report higher levels of pain than men and reported their highest intensity of pain during the day, while men reported the highest intensity at night (Morin, Lund, Villarroel et al., 2000). Kelly (1998) reported no gender differences in pain.

Riley, Robinson, Wade et al. (2001) compared pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and pain-related emotions (depression, anxiety, frustration, fear, and anger) in men and women who were asked to rate their experiences with chronic pain. Women had higher pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, frustration, and fear compared to men. Robinson, Riley, Meyers et al. (2001) reported that men and women are socialized to respond differently and differ in their expectations relative to pain perception. In a study of responses of men and women to chronic pain and anxiety, Edwards, Auguston and Fillingim (2000) noted no difference between genders regarding pain and depression. There was, however, a difference in anxiety and gender, with men being more anxious about their pain.

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of opioids differ in men and women and have been attributed to hepatic metabolism, where the microsomal enzyme activity differs (Vallerand \& Polomano, 2000). Genetic factors play a role in the varied responses to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seen in men and women (Buffum \& Buffum, 2000).

\section*{Placebo Effect}

A placebo effect occurs when a person responds to the medication or other treatment because of an expectation that the treatment will work rather than because it actually does so. Simply
receiving a medication or treatment may produce positive effects. The placebo effect results from the natural (endogenous) production of endorphins in the descending control system. It is a true physiologic response that can be reversed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist (Wall, 1999).

A patient's positive expectations about treatment may increase the effectiveness of a medication or other intervention. Often the more cues the patient receives about the intervention's effectiveness, the more effective it will be. A person who is informed that a medication is expected to relieve pain is more likely to experience pain relief than one who is told that a medication is unlikely to have any effect.

Researchers have shown that different verbal instructions given to patients about therapies affect patient behavior and significantly reduce opioid intake. Pollo, Amanzio, Arslanina et al. (2001) studied the effect of information and expectations in patients who had undergone thoracotomy. Patients in three groups were given an intravenous infusion of normal saline solution and could receive a dose of buprenorphine (Buprenex) on request. One group was given no information about the analgesic effect of the regimen; one group was informed that the infusion received could be an analgesic or a placebo; the third was told that the infusion was a powerful analgesic. Although the three groups did not differ in reported level of pain, the group told that the infusion was a powerful analgesic used less opioid than the other two groups.

A meta-analysis of 114 published research studies comparing placebo with no treatment showed similar results (Hrobjartsson \& Gotzsche, 2001). The studies analyzed investigated many clinical conditions; 27 of the 114 trials involved the treatment of pain. Other clinical conditions in the studies included obesity, asthma, hypertension, insomnia, and anxiety. Pain was the only condition in which a placebo effect was demonstrated.

The American Society of Pain Management Nurses (1996) holds the position that placebos (tablets or injections with no active ingredients) should not be used to assess or manage pain in any patient regardless of age or diagnosis. Furthermore, the group recommends that all health care institutions have policies in place prohibiting the use of placebos for this purpose. Educational programs should be conducted to educate providers about effective pain management, and ethics committees should assist in formulating these policies (Chart 13-2).

\section*{Nursing Assessment of Pain}

The highly subjective nature of pain makes pain assessment and management challenges for every clinician. The report of pain is a social transaction; thus, assessment and management of pain require a good rapport with the person in pain. In assessing a patient with pain, the nurse reviews the patient's description of the pain and other factors that may influence pain (eg, previous experience, anxiety, and age) as well as the person's response to pain relief strategies. Documentation of the pain level as rated on a pain scale becomes part of the patient's medical record, as does a record of the pain relief obtained from interventions.

Pain assessment includes determining what level of pain relief the acutely ill patient believes is needed to recover quickly or improve function, or what level of relief the chronically or terminally ill patient requires to maintain comfort (Chart 13-3). Part of a thorough pain assessment is to understand the patient's expectations and misconceptions about pain (Chart 13-4). A person who understands that pain relief not only contributes to comfort but also hastens recovery is more likely to request or selfadminister treatment appropriately.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF PAIN}

The factors to consider in a complete pain assessment are the intensity, timing, location, quality, personal meaning, aggravating and alleviating factors, and pain behaviors. The pain assessment begins by observing the patient carefully, noting the patient's overall posture and presence or absence of overt pain behaviors and asking the person to describe, in his or her own words, the specifics of the pain. The words used to describe the pain may point toward the etiology. For example, the classic description of chest pain that results from a myocardial infarction includes pressure or squeezing on the chest. A detailed history should follow the initial description of pain.

\section*{Intensity}

The intensity of pain ranges from none to mild discomfort to excruciating. There is no correlation between reported intensity and the stimulus that produced it. The reported intensity is influenced by the person's pain threshold and pain tolerance. Pain threshold is the smallest stimulus for which a person reports pain, and the tolerance is the maximum amount of pain a person can tolerate. To understand variations, the nurse can ask about the present pain intensity as well as the least and the worst pain intensity. Various tools and surveys are helpful to patients trying to describe pain intensity. Examples of pain scales appear in Figure 13-5.

\section*{Timing}

Sometimes the etiology of pain can be determined when time aspects are known. Therefore, the nurse inquires about the onset, duration, relationship between time and intensity, and whether there are changes in rhythmic patterns. The patient is asked if the pain began suddenly or increased gradually. Sudden pain that rapidly reaches maximum intensity is indicative of tissue rupture, and immediate intervention is necessary. Pain from ischemia gradually increases and becomes intense over a longer time. The chronic pain of arthritis illustrates the usefulness of determining the relationship between time and intensity, because people with arthritis usually report that pain is worse in the morning.

Pain is one of the most feared symptoms at the end of life. Most patients will experience pain as a terminal illness progresses. The inadequate treatment of cancer pain has been well documented (Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, 1994), and in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) (1995) investigators noted that nearly $40 \%$ of severely chronically ill and older patients who died in hospitals suffered moderate to severe pain in the last 3 days of life. The suffering caused by unrelieved pain touches all aspects of quality of life (activity, appetite, sleep) and can weaken an already fatigued person. Psychologically, unrelieved pain can create anxiety, and depression, negatively affect relationships, and promote thoughts of suicide.

The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) implemented pain standards in January 2001. These standards present a unique opportunity to improve care for hospitalized patients. Even though hospices and palliative care agencies are not subject to JCAHO review, many patients with chronic illness who are receiving palliative care may be hospitalized at various times. The standards emphasize pain assessment, patient and family education, continuity of care for symptom management, and evaluation of interventions.

Current barriers to pain management include lack of education, lack of access to opioids, fear of addiction, and legislative issues.

\section*{Need for Education}

Ferrell et al. (2000) noted that of 45,683 nursing text pages reviewed, 902 were related to pain at the end of life. The end-of-life content constituted $2 \%$ of text pages, while the pain content represented only $0.5 \%$. The researchers concluded that more specific content is needed to assist in educating students about pain and pain at the end of life.

\section*{Accessibility}

The lack of access to opioids is another barrier to adequate pain relief. Patients may have difficulty affording medications. Some pharmacists, fearing crime, paperwork, and regulatory oversight, may not stock opioids or may keep limited quantities on hand. Some insurance companies limit the types of medications and the amount and frequency of renewal of analgesics.

\section*{Addiction Fears}

The fear of addiction plays a role even at the end of life. Family members may be hesitant to assist the patient in pain management for fear of the social stigma of addiction. This causes needless pain and suffering.

\section*{Legal Barriers}

Legislative issues play a role in the inadequate management of pain. Many states are enacting Intractable Pain Statutes. These laws aim to reduce physicians' fear of civil or criminal liability or disciplinary action for aggressively managing pain. The tracking system by the Drug Enforcement Agency acts as a deterrent since opioids prescribed by
physicians can be tracked. Some physicians fear that prescribing "too many" opioids could be interpreted as treating an addicted patient.

\section*{Other Issues}

Pain management at the end of life differs little from general pain management. Patients still require comprehensive pain assessment and pain management, even though assessment may be hampered by confusion, delirium, or unconsciousness. Caregivers are taught to observe for signs of restlessness or facial expressions as a "proxy" indicator of pain.

Analgesic agents should be titrated to find the most effective dose and the best tolerated route. The nurse and family members should assess the effectiveness of the current pain therapy. If the pain is not relieved, a larger dose of medication may be necessary. If the pain continues, another medication may be needed or the patient should be given a different analgesic. The titration process requires frequent assessment to effectively manage pain. The analgesic agent or treatment should be appropriate for the type of pain. For example, neuropathic pain, usually described as burning, tingling, numbness, shooting, stabbing or electric, requires a different treatment approach compared to acute pain.

Nonpharmacologic approaches, such as guided imagery and relaxation, can be used to decrease pain and help the patient cope. Careful patient positioning and environmental control are other methods to increase patient comfort.

Respiratory depression should be assessed because over time, patients become tolerant to this side effect. The rate, depth, and level of consciousness should be monitored to determine whether respiratory depression is occurring and requires treatment. A respiratory rate of 6 per minute or greater is usually adequate. If respiratory depression is suspected, a decrease in the opioid dose may be indicated. Frequent stimulation to encourage deep breathing may be required until the opioid is metabolized. In the last few days of life the patient may become restless, which is an indicator of pain. The need to increase the opioid to provide pain relief and the respiratory effects of opioids are considered in decision making. However, comfort should be a priority in the case of a person who clearly is at the end of life, where cure is no longer the goal.

Side effects from analgesics must be managed as in other painful conditions. Tolerance to constipation is rare. Thus, a careful bowel regimen involving diet, bowel stimulants, stool softeners, and/or osmotic agents, must be instituted. Vigilance in the assessment, management, and treatment evaluation of other side effects is similar to that included in previous discussions.

Careful assessment and management of pain at the end of life can make a "good" death possible. Education of health care providers and the family can help patients realize the goal of adequate pain relief throughout the dying process.

\section*{Location}

The location of pain is best determined by having the patient point to the area of the body involved. Some general assessment forms have drawings of human figures, and the patient is asked to shade in the area involved. This is especially helpful if the pain radiates (referred pain). The shaded figures are helpful in determining the effectiveness of treatment or change in the location of pain over time.

\section*{Quality}

The nurse asks the patient to describe the pain in his or her own words without offering clues. For example, the patient is asked
to describe what the pain feels like. Sufficient time must be allowed for the patient to describe the pain and for the nurse to carefully record all words that are used. If the patient cannot describe the quality of the pain, words such as burning, aching, throbbing, or stabbing can be offered. It is important to document the exact words used to describe the pain and which words were suggested by the nurse conducting the assessment.

\section*{Personal Meaning}

Patients experience pain differently, and the pain experience can mean many different things. It is important to ask how the pain has affected the person's daily life. Some people can continue to
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-250.jpg?height=813&width=866&top_left_y=186&top_left_x=112)
work or study, while others may be disabled. The patient is asked if family finances have been affected. For others, the recurrence of pain may mean worsening of the disease, such as the spread of cancer. The meaning attached to the pain experience helps the nurse understand how the patient is affected and assists in planning treatment.

\section*{Aggravating and Alleviating Factors}

The nurse asks the patient what if anything makes the pain worse and what makes it better and asks specifically about the relationship between activity and pain. This helps detect factors associated with pain. For example, in a patient with advanced metastatic cancer, pain with coughing may signal spinal cord compression. The nurse ascertains whether environmental factors influence pain since they may easily be changed to help the patient. For example, making the room warmer may help the patient relax and may improve the patient's pain. Finally, the patient is asked if pain is influenced by or affects the quality of sleep or anxiety. Both can significantly affect pain intensity and the quality of life.

Knowledge of alleviating factors assists the nurse in developing a treatment plan. Therefore, it is important to ask about the patient's use of medication (prescribed and over the counter) and the amount and frequency. In addition, the nurse asks if herbal remedies, nonpharmacologic interventions, or alternative therapies have been used with success. This information assists the nurse in determining teaching needs.

\section*{Pain Behaviors}

When experiencing pain, people express pain with many different behaviors. These nonverbal and behavioral expressions of pain are not consistent or reliable indicators of the quality or intensity of pain, and they should not be used to determine the presence of or the degree of pain experienced. Patients may grimace, cry, rub the affected area, guard the affected area, or immobilize it. Others may moan, groan, grunt, or sigh. Not all patients exhibit the same behaviors, and there may be different meanings associated with the same behavior.

\end{figure}

FIGURE 13-5 Examples of pain intensity scales.

Sometimes in the nonverbal patient, pain behaviors are used as a proxy to assess pain. It is unwise to make judgments and formulate treatment plans based on behaviors that may or may not indicate pain. In the case of an unconscious person, pain should always be assumed to be present and treated. All patients have a right to adequate pain management.

Physiologic responses to pain, such as tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, pallor, diaphoresis, mydriasis, hypervigilance, and increased muscle tone, are related to stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. These responses are short-lived as the body adapts to the stress. These physiologic signs could be the result of a change in the patient's condition, such as the onset of hypovolemia. Using physiologic signs to indicate pain is unreliable. Although it is important to observe for any and all pain behaviors, the absence of these behaviors does not indicate an absence of pain.

\section*{INSTRUMENTS FOR ASSESSING THE PERCEPTION OF PAIN}

Only the patient can accurately describe and assess his or her pain. Clinicians consistently underestimate a patient's level of pain (McCaffery \& Ferrell, 1997; McCaffery, Ferrell \& Pasaro, 2000; Puntillo, Miaskowski, Kehrle et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 1998). Therefore, a number of pain assessment instruments have been developed to assist in the assessment of a patient's perception of pain (see Fig. 13-5). Such instruments may be used to document the need for intervention, to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, and to identify the need for alternative or additional interventions if the initial intervention is ineffective in relieving the pain. For a pain assessment instrument to be useful, it must require little effort on the part of the patient, be easy to understand and use, be easily scored, and be sensitive to small

\section*{Pain Assessment and Titration of Analgesic Agents}

McCaffery, M., Ferrell, B. R., \& Pasero, C. (2000). Nurses' personal opinions about patients' pain and their effect on recorded assessments and titration of opioid doses. Pain Management Nursing, 1(3), 79-87.

\section*{Purpose}

Nurses have a key role in pain assessment and management in all areas of clinical practice. Although previous studies have identified lack of knowledge about pain management as a factor contributing to undertreatment of pain, little is known about their personal opinions related to pain management. This study was conducted to explore how nurses' personal opinions about pain intensity influence their decisions about pain assessment and about titration of the prescribed opioid to relieve severe pain.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

In this descriptive study, surveys were distributed as a pretest to a convenience sample of nurses attending pain conferences before receiving any information on pain. Data were collected at 20 locations throughout the United States. The surveys presented two vignettes describing patients with postoperative pain. The patients were identical except for their behavior; one patient was smiling and joking while the other remained quiet in bed and grimaced. Nurses were asked to identify their personal opinions about both patients' reported pain intensity, what they would document in the patient record, and what opioid dose they would administer. Patients in both vignettes rated their pain as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 , indicating inadequate pain management and ineffective opioid doses to relieve the severe pain. In both vignettes, it was made clear that increasing the opioid dose would be safe and appropriate. Completed surveys were returned by 1,276 nurses. Of these, a random sample of 100 surveys from each section of the country was
obtained for a total of 400 surveys. Data from the 400 surveys were analyzed.

\section*{Findings}

Although the nurses who completed the surveys indicated that they would record the patients' pain as 8 , fewer nurses believed the smiling patient than the grimacing patient. More nurses ( $78.3 \%$ ) believed the grimacing patient's pain intensity and $90 \%$ would have documented it correctly. A total of $39 \%$ of nurses reported believing the patient who was smiling, and $85.5 \%$ stated that they would have documented the reported pain intensity correctly. Nurses were also more likely to correctly increase the opioid dose for the grimacing patient; $62.5 \%$ of nurses indicated that they would have increased the dose for the grimacing patient, while only $47.3 \%$ reported that they would do so for the smiling patient. Of those nurses who would have increased the opioid dose for the grimacing patient, $16.3 \%$ would not do so for the smiling patient.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Comparing these results with those of previous studies conducted in 1990 and 1995, the authors noted considerable improvement in assessment and titration of opioids. However, the findings demonstrate that there is a continuing need for education about the different patient responses to pain and the importance of the patient's report of the intensity of pain. More education is needed to address nurses' responsibilities for opioid titration.
changes in the characteristic being measured. Figure 13-6 shows a pain assessment algorithm that can be used at the time of assessment to direct clinical decisions for pain management.

\section*{Visual Analogue Scales}

Visual analogue scales (VAS; see Fig. 13-5) are useful in assessing the intensity of pain. One version of the scale includes a horizontal $10-\mathrm{cm}$ line, with anchors (ends) indicating the extremes of pain. The person is asked to place a mark indicating where the current pain lies on the line. The left anchor usually represents "none" or "no pain," whereas the right anchor usually represents "severe" or "worst possible pain." To score the results, a ruler is placed along the line and the distance the person marked from the left or low end is measured and reported in millimeters or centimeters.

Some patients (eg, children, elderly patients, and visually or cognitively impaired patients) may find it difficult to use an unmarked VAS. In those circumstances, ordinal scales (simple descriptive pain intensity scale, or 0 to 10 numeric pain intensity scale) may be used.

\section*{Faces Pain Scale, Revised}

This instrument has seven faces depicting expressions that range from contented to obvious distress. The patient is asked to point to the face that most closely resembles the pain intensity felt. Evidence for reliability and validity has been established (Hicks, van Baeyer, Spafford et al., 2001; Hunter, McDowell, Hennessy et al., 2000). Figure 13-7 shows the Faces Pain Scale, Revised.

\section*{Guidelines for Using Pain Assessment Scales}

Using a written scale to assess pain may not be possible if the person is seriously ill, is in severe pain, or has just returned from surgery. In these cases, the nurse can ask the patient, "On a scale of 0 to 10,0 being no pain and 10 being pain as bad as it can be, how bad is your pain now?" For patients who have difficulty with a 0 to 10 scale, a 0 to 5 scale may be tried. Whichever scale is used, it should be used consistently. Most patients usually can respond without difficulty. Ideally, the nurse teaches the patient how to use the pain scale before the pain occurs (eg, before surgery). The patient's numerical rating is documented and used to assess the effectiveness of pain relief interventions.

If the person does not speak English or cannot communicate clearly information needed to manage pain, an interpreter, translator, or family member familiar with the person's method of communication should be consulted and a method established for pain assessment. Often a chart can be constructed with English words on one side and the foreign language on the other. The patient can then point to the corresponding word to tell the clinician about the pain.

When a person with pain is cared for at home by family caregivers or the home care nurse, a pain scale may help in assessing the effectiveness of the interventions, if the scale is used before and after the interventions are administered. Scales that address the location and pattern of pain may be useful to the home care nurse in identifying new sources or sites of pain in the chronically or terminally ill patient and in monitoring changes in the patient's level of pain. The patient and family caregivers can be taught to use a pain assessment scale to assess and manage the patient's pain. The home care nurse who sees

FIGURE 13-6 Pain assessment algorithm. Redrawn with permission from Salerno, E., \& Willens, J. S. (1996). Pain management handbook: An interdisciplinary approach. St. Louis: C. V. Mosby.
the patient only at intervals may thus benefit from consulting the patient's or family's written record of the pain scores to evaluate how effective the pain management strategies have been over time.

On occasion, a person will deny having pain when most people in similar circumstances would report significant pain. For example, it is not uncommon for a patient recovering from a total joint replacement to deny feeling "pain," but on further questioning will readily admit to having a "terrible ache, but I wouldn't call it pain." From then on, when evaluating this person's pain, the nurse would use the patient's words rather than the word "pain."

\section*{NURSE'S ROLE IN PAIN MANAGEMENT}

Before discussing what the nurse can do to intervene in the patient's pain, the nurse's role in pain management is reviewed. The nurse helps relieve pain by administering pain-relieving interventions (including both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches), assessing the effectiveness of those interventions, monitoring for adverse effects, and serving as an advocate for the patient when the prescribed intervention is ineffective in relieving pain. In addition, the nurse serves as an educator to the patient and family to enable them to manage the prescribed intervention themselves when appropriate.

FIGURE 13-7 Faces Pain Scale-Revised. This pain scale is especially suited for helping children describe pain. Instructions for using this scale follow: "These faces show how much something can hurt. This face (point to left-most face) shows no pain. The faces show more and more pain (point to each from left to right) up to this one (point to right-most face). It shows very much pain. Point to the face that shows how much you hurt (right now). Score the chosen face $\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{2}, \boldsymbol{4}, \boldsymbol{6}$ or $\mathbf{1 0}$, counting left to right, so $\boldsymbol{0}=$ no pain and $\mathbf{1 0}=$ very much pain. Do not use words like happy or sad. This scale is intended to measure how children feel inside, not how their face looks. From the Pediatric Pain Sourcebook. Original copyright © 2001.

\section*{Identifying Goals for Pain Management}

The information the nurse obtains from the pain assessment is used to identify goals for managing the pain. The goals identified are shared or validated with the patient. For a few patients, the goal may be elimination of the pain. For many, however, this expectation may be unrealistic. Other goals may include a decrease in the intensity, duration, or frequency of pain, and a decrease in the negative effects the pain has on the patient. For example, pain may have a negative effect by interfering with sleep and thereby hampering recovery from an acute illness or decreasing appetite. In such instances, the goals might be to sleep soundly and to take adequate nutrition. Chronic pain may affect the person's quality of life by interfering with work or interpersonal relationships. Thus, a goal may be to decrease time lost from work or to increase the quality of interpersonal relationships.

To determine the goal, a number of factors are considered. The first is the severity of the pain, as judged by the patient. The second factor is the anticipated harmful effects of pain. A highrisk patient is at much greater risk for the harmful effects of pain than a young healthy patient. The third factor is the anticipated duration of the pain. In patients with pain from a disease such as cancer, the pain may be prolonged, possibly for the remainder of the patient's life. Therefore, interventions will be needed for some time and should not detract from the patient's quality of life. A different set of interventions is required if the patient is likely to have pain for only a few days or weeks.

In a study of the dying experience, family members of 2,451 people who had died were interviewed (Lynn, Teno, Phillips et al., 1997). Of these patients, $55 \%$ were conscious during their last 3 days of life. Of the conscious patients, 4 in 10 were considered by their family members to be in severe pain most of the time. These findings strongly suggest that pain relief for dying patients should be a primary goal.

The goals for the patient may be accomplished by pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic means, but most success will be achieved with a combination of both. In the acute stages of illness, the patient may be unable to participate actively in relief measures, but when sufficient mental and physical energy is present, the patient may learn self-management techniques to relieve the pain. Thus, as the patient progresses through the stages of recovery, a goal may be to increase the patient's use of selfmanagement pain relief measures.

\section*{Establishing the Nurse-Patient Relationship and Teaching}

A positive nurse-patient relationship and teaching are key to managing analgesia in the patient with pain, because open communication and patient cooperation are essential to success. A positive nurse-patient relationship characterized by trust is essential. By conveying to the patient the belief that he or she has pain, the nurse often helps reduce the patient's anxiety. Acknowledging to the patient, "I know that you have pain" often eases the patient's mind. Occasionally, patients who fear that no one believes the reported pain feel relieved when they know that the nurse can be trusted to believe the pain exists.

Teaching is equally important, because the patient or family may be responsible for managing the pain at home and preventing or managing side effects. Teaching patients about pain and strategies to relieve it may reduce pain in the absence of other pain relief measures and may enhance the effectiveness of the pain relief measures used.

The nurse also provides information by explaining how pain can be controlled. The patient is informed, for example, that pain should be reported in the early stages. When the patient waits too long to report pain, sensitization may occur and the pain may be so intense that it is difficult to relieve. The phenomenon of sensitization is important in effective pain management. Since a heightened response is seen after exposure to a noxious stimulus, the response to that stimulus will be greater, causing the person to feel more pain. When health care providers assess and treat pain before it becomes severe, sensitization is diminished or avoided, and thus less medication is needed.

\section*{Providing Physical Care}

The patient in pain may be unable to participate in the usual activities of daily living or to perform usual self-care and may need assistance to carry out these activities. The patient is usually more comfortable when physical and self-care needs have been met and efforts have been made to ensure as comfortable a position as possible. A fresh gown and change of bed linens, along with efforts to make the person feel refreshed (eg, brushing teeth, combing hair), often increase the level of comfort and improve the effectiveness of the pain relief measures.

Providing physical care to the patient also gives the nurse (in acute, long-term, and home settings) the opportunity to perform a complete assessment and to identify problems that may contribute to the patient's discomfort and pain. Appropriate and gentle physical touch during care may be reassuring and comforting. If topical treatments such as fentanyl (an opioid analgesic) patches or intravenous or intraspinal catheters are used, the skin around the patch or catheter should be assessed for integrity during physical care.

\section*{Managing Anxiety Related to Pain}

Anxiety may affect a patient's response to pain. The patient who anticipates pain may become increasingly anxious. Teaching the patient about the nature of the impending painful experience and the ways to reduce pain often decreases anxiety; a person who is experiencing pain will use previously learned strategies to reduce anxiety and pain. Learning about measures to relieve pain may lessen the threat of pain and give the person a sense of control.

What the nurse explains about the available pain relief measures and their effectiveness may also affect the patient's anxiety level. The patient's anxiety may be reduced by explanations that point out the degree of pain relief that can be expected from each measure. For example, the patient who is informed beforehand that an intervention may not eliminate pain completely is less likely to become anxious when a certain amount of pain persists. Anxiety resulting from anticipation of pain or the pain experience itself may often be managed effectively by establishing a relationship with the patient and by patient teaching.

A patient who is anxious about pain may be less tolerant of the pain, which in turn may increase the anxiety level. To prevent the pain and anxiety from escalating, the anxiety-producing cycle must be interrupted. Low levels of pain are easier to reduce or control than are more intense levels. (This concept of sensitization was previously discussed.) Consequently, pain relief measures should be used before pain becomes severe. Many patients believe that they should not request pain relief measures until they cannot tolerate the pain, making it difficult for medications to provide relief. Therefore, it is important to explain to all patients that pain relief or control is more successful if such measures begin before the pain becomes unbearable.

\section*{Pain Management Strategies}

Reducing pain to a "tolerable" level was once considered the goal of pain management. However, even patients who have described pain relief as adequate often report disturbed sleep and marked distress because of pain. In view of the harmful effects of pain and inadequate pain management, the goal of tolerable pain has been replaced by the goal of relieving the pain. Pain management strategies include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. These approaches are selected on the basis of the patient's requirements and goals. Appropriate analgesic medications are used as prescribed. They are not considered a last resort to be used only when other pain relief measures fail. Any intervention is most successful if initiated before pain sensitization occurs, and the greatest success is usually achieved if several interventions are applied simultaneously.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS}

Managing a patient's pain pharmacologically is accomplished in collaboration with the physician or other primary care provider, the patient, and often the family. The physician or nurse practitioner prescribes specific medications for pain or may insert an intravenous line for administering analgesic medications. Alternatively, an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist may insert an epidural catheter for their administration. However, it is the nurse who maintains the analgesia, assesses its effectiveness, and reports if the intervention is ineffective or produces side effects.

The pharmacologic management of pain requires close collaboration and effective communication among health care providers. In the home setting, it is often the family who manages the patient's pain and assesses the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions, while it is the home care nurse who evaluates the adequacy of pain relief strategies and the family's ability to manage the pain. The home care nurse reinforces teaching and ensures communication among the patient, family care providers, physician, pharmacist, and other health care providers involved in the patient's care.

\section*{Premedication Assessment}

Before administering any medication, the nurse asks the patient about allergies to medications and the nature of any previous allergic responses. True allergic or anaphylactic responses to opioids are rare, but it is not uncommon for a patient to report an allergy to one of the opioids. On further examination, the nurse often learns that the extent of the allergy was "itching" or "nausea and vomiting." These responses are not allergies; rather, they are side effects that, when necessary, can be managed while the patient's pain is relieved. The patient's description of responses or reactions should be documented and reported before administering the medication.

The nurse obtains the patient's medication history (eg, current, usual, or recent use of prescription or over-the-counter medications or herbal agents), along with a history of health problems. Certain medications or conditions may affect the analgesic medication's effectiveness or the metabolism and excretion of analgesic agents. Before administering analgesic agents, the nurse should assess the patient's pain status, including the intensity of current pain, changes in pain intensity after the previous dose of medication, and side effects of the medication.

\section*{Approaches for Using Analgesic Agents}

Medications are most effective when the dose and interval between doses are individualized to meet the patient's needs. The only safe and effective way to administer analgesic medications is by asking the patient to rate the pain and by observing the response to medications.

\section*{BALANCED ANESTHESIA}

Pharmacologic interventions are most effective when a multimodal or balanced analgesia approach is used. Balanced analgesia refers to use of more than one form of analgesia concurrently to obtain more pain relief with fewer side effects. Three general categories of analgesic agents are opioids, NSAIDs, and local anesthetics. These agents work by different mechanisms. Using two or three types of agents simultaneously can maximize pain relief while minimizing the potentially toxic effects of any one agent. When one agent is used alone, it usually must be used in a higher dose to be effective. In other words, although it might require 15 mg morphine to relieve a certain pain, it may take only 8 mg morphine plus 30 mg ketorolac (an NSAID) to relieve the same pain.

\section*{PRO RE NATA (PRN)}

In the past, the standard method used by most nurses and physicians in administering analgesia was to administer the analgesic pro re nata (PRN), or "as needed." The standard practice was for the nurse to wait for the patient to complain of pain and then administer analgesia. As a result, many patients remained in pain because they did not know they needed to ask for medication or waited until the pain became intolerable.

By its very nature, the PRN approach to analgesia leaves the patient sedated or in severe pain much of the time. To receive pain relief from an opioid analgesic, the serum level of that opioid must be maintained at a minimum therapeutic level (Fig. 13-8). By the time the patient complains of pain, the serum opioid level is below the therapeutic level. From the time the patient requests pain medication until the nurse administers the medication, the patient's serum level continues to fall. The lower the serum opioid level, the more difficult it is to achieve the therapeutic level with the next dose. The only way to ensure significant periods of analgesia, using this method, is to give doses large enough to produce periods of sedation.

\section*{PREVENTIVE APPROACH}

Currently, a preventive approach to relieving pain by administering analgesic agents is considered the most effective strategy because a therapeutic serum level of medication is maintained. With the preventive approach, analgesic agents are administered at set intervals so that the medication acts before the pain becomes severe and before the serum opioid level falls to a subtherapeutic level.

Administering analgesic medication on a time basis, rather than on the basis of the patient's report of pain, prevents the serum drug level from falling to subtherapeutic levels. An example of this would be giving the patient the prescribed morphine or the prescribed NSAID (ibuprofen) every 4 hours rather than waiting until the patient complains of pain. If the patient's pain is likely to occur around the clock or for a great portion of a 24 -hour period, a regular around-the-clock schedule of administering analgesia may be indicated. Even if the analgesic is prescribed PRN, it can be administered on a preventive basis before the pa-

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
tient is in severe pain, as long as the prescribed interval between doses is observed. The preventive approach reduces the peaks and troughs in the serum level and provides more pain relief for the patient with fewer adverse effects.

Smaller doses of medication are needed with the preventive approach because the pain does not escalate to a level of severe intensity. Thus, a preventive approach may result in the administration of less medication over a 24-hour period, thereby helping prevent tolerance to analgesic agents and decreasing the severity of side effects (eg, sedation and constipation). Better pain control can be achieved with a preventive approach, reducing the amount of time the patient spends in pain.

In using the preventive approach, the nurse assesses the patient for sedation before administering the next dose. The goal is to provide analgesia before the pain becomes severe. It would not be safe to medicate a patient (with an opioid) repeatedly if he or she was sedated or having no pain. It may be necessary to decrease the dosage of the opioid analgesic so that the patient receives pain relief with less sedation.

\section*{INDIVIDUALIZED DOSAGE}

The dosage and the interval between doses should be based on the patient's requirements rather than on an inflexible standard or routine. People metabolize and absorb medications at different rates and experience different levels of pain. Therefore, one dose of an opioid medication given at specified intervals may be effective for one patient but ineffective for another.

Because of the fear of promoting addiction or causing respiratory depression, health care providers tend to prescribe and administer inadequate dosages of opioid agents to treat acute pain or chronic pain in the terminally ill patient (Chart 13-5). However, even prolonged administration of opioid agents is associated
with an extremely low incidence (less than $1 \%$ ) of addiction. Furthermore, small doses are not necessarily safe doses. For example, some patients receiving a relatively small dose ( 25 to 50 mg ) of meperidine (Demerol) intramuscularly have experienced respiratory depression, whereas other patients have not exhibited any sedation or respiratory depression with very large doses of opioids.

\section*{Chart 13-5 - Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{Inadequate Pain Management}

\section*{Situation}

When taking over the care of ethnic minority patients at the change of shift from a particular colleague, you usually find these patients to be in a great deal of pain. Your nonsystematic observations have led you to conclude these patients receive only a small portion of the analgesia prescribed for them. You have heard a nurse colleague state a belief that people of certain ethnic groups have "no pain tolerance" and are "just looking for drugs."

\section*{Dilemma}

Racial biases are difficult to change and deal with. To confront this nurse may not alter the behavior but will certainly disrupt the working relationships on the unit. It would be easier to look the other way. On the other hand, you believe that the nurse is giving inadequate and unethical care to selected patients and placing them at greater risk for postoperative complications.

\section*{Discussion}
- What information would you need to collect before acting?
- From whom could you seek counsel?
- Are the two aspects of the dilemma equally important?

Therefore, the effects of opioid analgesic medications must be monitored, especially when the first dose is given or when the dose is changed or given more frequently. The time, date, the patient's pain rating (scale of 0 to 10 ), the analgesic agent, other pain relief measures, side effects, and patient activity are recorded. When the first dose of an analgesic is administered, the nurse needs to record a pain rating score, blood pressure, and respiratory and pulse rates (all of which are considered "vital signs"). If the pain has not decreased in 30 minutes (sooner if an intravenous route is used) and the patient is reasonably alert and has a satisfactory respiratory status, blood pressure, and pulse rate, then some change in analgesia is indicated. Although the dose of analgesic medication is safe for this patient, it is ineffective in relieving the pain. Therefore, another dose of medication may be indicated. In such instances, the nurse consults with the physician to determine what further action is warranted.

\section*{PATIENT-CONTROLLED ANALGESIA}

Used to manage postoperative pain as well as chronic pain, patientcontrolled analgesia (PCA) allows patients to control the administration of their own medication within predetermined safety limits. This approach can be used with oral analgesic agents as well as with continuous infusions of opioid analgesic agents by intravenous, subcutaneous, or epidural routes. PCA can be used in the hospital or home setting.

The PCA pump permits the patient to self-administer continuous infusions of medication (basal rates) safely and to administer extra medication (bolus doses) with episodes of increased pain or painful activities. A PCA pump is electronically controlled by a timing device. Patients experiencing pain can administer small amounts of medication directly into their intravenous, subcutaneous, or epidural catheter by pressing a button. The pump then delivers a preset amount of medication.

The PCA pump also can be programmed to deliver a constant, background infusion of medication or basal rate and still allow the patient to administer additional bolus doses as needed. The timer can be programmed to prevent additional doses from being administered until a specified time period has elapsed (lock-out time) and until the first dose has had time to exert its maximal effect. Even if the patient pushes the button multiple times in rapid succession, no additional doses are released. If another dose is required at the end of the delay period, the button must be pushed again to receive the dose. Patients who are controlling their own opioid administration usually become sedated and stop pushing the button before any significant respiratory depression occurs. Nevertheless, assessing respiratory status remains a major role for the nurse.

A continuous infusion plus bolus doses may be effective with cancer patients who require large doses of analgesia, or for postsurgical patients. Although this allows more uninterrupted sleep, the risk of sedation increases, especially when the patient has minimal or decreasing pain.

Patients who use PCA achieve better pain relief (Walder, Schafer, Henzi et al., 2001) and often require less pain medication than those who are treated in the standard PRN fashion. Because the patient can maintain a near-constant level of medication, the periods of severe pain and sedation that occur with the traditional PRN regimen are avoided.

To initiate PCA or any analgesia used at home or in the hospital, it is important to avoid playing "catch-up." Pain should be brought under control before PCA starts, often by the use of an initial, larger bolus dose or loading dose. Then, after control is achieved, the pump is programmed to deliver small doses of med-
ication at a time. If the patient with severe pain has a low serum level of opioid analgesic because of an inadequate basal rate, it is difficult to regain control with the small doses available by pump. Before the PCA pump is used, repeated bolus doses of an intravenous opioid may be administered as prescribed over a short time until the pain is relieved. Then PCA is initiated. If pain control is not achieved with the maximal dose of medication prescribed, further prescriptions are obtained. The goal is to achieve a minimum therapeutic level of analgesia and to allow the patient to maintain that level by using the PCA pump. The patient is instructed not to wait until the pain is severe before pushing the button to obtain a bolus dose. The patient is also reminded not to become so distracted by an activity or visitor that he or she forgets to self-administer a prescribed dose of medication. One potential drawback to distraction is that a patient who is using a PCA pump may not self-administer any analgesia during the time of effective distraction. When distraction ends suddenly (eg, the movie ends or the visitors leave), the patient may be left without a therapeutic serum opioid level. When intermittent distraction is used for pain relief, a continuous low-level background infusion of opioid through the PCA pump may be prescribed so that when the distraction ends, it will not be necessary to try to catch up.

If PCA is to be used in the patient's home, the patient and family are taught about the operation of the pump and the side effects of the medication and strategies to manage them.

> NURSING ALERT Family members are cautioned not to push the button for the patient, especially if the patient is asleep, because this overrides some of the safety features of the system.

\section*{Local Anesthetic Agents}

Local anesthetics work by blocking nerve conduction when applied directly to the nerve fibers. They can be applied directly to the site of injury (eg, a topical anesthetic spray for sunburn) or directly to nerve fibers by injection or at the time of surgery. They can also be administered through an epidural catheter.

\section*{TOPICAL APPLICATION}

Local anesthetic agents have been successful in reducing the pain associated with thoracic or upper abdominal surgery when injected by the surgeon intercostally. Local anesthetic agents are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in decreased availability at the surgical or injury site and an increased anesthetic level in the blood, increasing the risk of toxicity. Therefore, a vasoconstrictive agent (eg, epinephrine or phenylephrine) is added to the anesthetic agent to decrease its systemic absorption and to maintain its concentration at the surgical or injury site.

A topical anesthetic agent known as eutectic mixture or emulsion of local anesthetics, or EMLA cream, has been effective in preventing the pain associated with invasive procedures such as lumbar puncture or the insertion of intravenous lines. To be effective, EMLA must be applied to the site 60 to 90 minutes before the procedure.

\section*{INTRASPINAL ADMINISTRATION}

Intermittent or continuous administration of local anesthetic agents through an epidural catheter has been used for years to produce anesthesia during surgery. Although the administration of local anesthetic agents in the spinal canal is still largely confined to acute pain, such as postoperative pain and pain associated with labor and delivery, the epidural administration of local anesthetic agents for pain management is increasing.

A local anesthetic agent administered through an epidural catheter is applied directly to the nerve root. The anesthetic agent can be administered continuously in low doses, intermittently on a schedule, or on demand as the patient requires it, and is often combined with the epidural administration of opioids. Surgical patients treated with this combination experience fewer complications after surgery, ambulate sooner, and have shorter hospital stays than patients receiving standard therapy (Correll, Viscusi, Grunwald et al., 2001).

\section*{Opioid Analgesic Agents}

Opioids can be administered by various routes, including oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraspinal, intranasal, rectal, and transdermal routes. The goal of administering opioids is to relieve pain and improve quality of life; therefore, the route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration are determined on an individual basis. Factors that are considered in determining the route, dose, and frequency of medication include the characteristics of the pain (eg, its expected duration and severity), the overall status of the patient, the patient's response to analgesic medications, and the patient's report of pain. Although the oral route is usually preferred for administering opioids, oral opioids must be given frequently enough and in large enough doses to be effective. Opioid analgesic agents given orally may provide a more consistent serum level than those given intramuscularly.

If the patient is expected to require opioid analgesic agents at home, the patient's and the family's ability to administer opioids as prescribed is considered in planning. Steps are taken to ensure that the medication will be available to the patient. Many pharmacies, especially those in smaller rural areas or inner cities, may be reluctant to stock large amounts of opioids. Therefore, arrangements for obtaining these prescription medications must be made ahead of time.

With the administration of opioids by any route, side effects must be considered and anticipated. Anticipating side effects and taking steps to minimize them increase the likelihood that the patient will receive adequate pain relief without interrupting therapy to treat these effects.

\section*{RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND SEDATION}

Respiratory depression is the most serious adverse effect of opioid analgesic agents administered by intravenous, subcutaneous, or epidural routes. However, it is relatively rare because doses administered through these routes are small, and tolerance to respiratory depressant effects increases if the dose is increased slowly. The risk of respiratory depression increases with age and the concomitant use of other opioids or other central nervous system depressants. The risk of respiratory depression also increases when the catheter is placed in the thoracic area and when the intraabdominal or intrathoracic pressure is increased.

The patient receiving opioids by any route must be assessed frequently for changes in respiratory status. Specific notable changes are decreasing respiratory rate or shallow respirations. Despite the risks associated with their use, intravenous and epidural opioids are considered safe, with the risks related to epidural administration no greater than those related to intravenous or other systemic routes of administration. Sedation, which may occur with any method of administering opioids, is likely to occur when opioid doses are increased. However, the patient often develops tolerance quickly, so that in a short time the patient is no longer sedated by the dose that initially caused sedation. Increasing the time between doses or reducing the dose temporarily, as prescribed, usually pre-
vents deep sedation from occurring. The patient at risk for sedation must be monitored closely for changes in respiratory status. The patient is also at risk for other problems associated with sedation and immobility. Therefore, the nurse must initiate strategies to prevent problems such as skin breakdown.

\section*{NAUSEA AND VOMITING}

Nausea and vomiting frequently occur with opioid use. Usually these effects occur some hours after the initial injection. Patients, especially postoperative patients, may not think to tell the nurse that they are nauseated, particularly if the nausea is mild. However, the patient receiving an opioid should be assessed for nausea and vomiting, which may be triggered by a position change and may be prevented by having the patient change positions slowly. Adequate hydration and the administration of antiemetic agents may decrease the incidence. Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting often subside within a few days.

\section*{CONSTIPATION}

Constipation, a common side effect of opioid use, may become so severe that the patient is forced to choose between relief of pain and relief of constipation. This situation can occur in patients after surgery and in patients receiving large doses of opioids to treat cancer-related pain. Preventing constipation must be a high priority in all patients receiving opioids. Whenever a patient receives opioids, a bowel regimen should begin at the same time. Tolerance to this side effect does not occur; rather, it persists even with long-term use of opioids.

Several strategies may help prevent and treat opioid-related constipation. Mild laxatives and a high intake of fluid and fiber may be effective in managing mild constipation. Unless contraindicated, a mild laxative and a stool softener should be administered on a regular schedule. Continued severe constipation, however, often requires the use of a stimulating cathartic agent, such as senna derivatives (Senokot) or bisacodyl (Dulcolax). Oral laxatives and stool softeners may prevent constipation; rectal suppositories may be used if oral agents fail (Plaisance \& Ellis, 2002).

\section*{INADEQUATE PAIN RELIEF}

One factor commonly associated with ineffective pain relief is an inadequate dose of opioid. This is most likely to occur when the caregiver underestimates the patient's pain or the route of administration is changed without the differences in absorption and action being considered. Consequently, the patient receives doses too small to be effective and, possibly, too infrequently to relieve pain. For example, if opioid delivery is changed from the intravenous route to the oral route, the oral dose must be approximately three times greater than that given parenterally to provide relief. Because of differences in absorption of orally administered opioids among individuals, the patient must be assessed carefully to ensure that the pain is relieved.

Table 13-2 lists opioids and dosages that are equivalent to morphine. In general, no recalculation needs to be done when switching from one brand of an agent to another brand of the same medication, with the exception of extended-release oral morphine. Currently, three brands of extended-release morphine (MS Contin, Oramorph, Kadian) are commonly used by cancer patients. Although these agents come in the same dosage form and contain the same drug, they are not considered therapeutically equivalent because they employ different release mechanisms. Patients who need to switch brands should be monitored carefully both for overdose and for inadequate pain relief.

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS OF OPIOIDS}

During the health history, when asked about drug allergies, patients with previous hospital experience (especially for surgery) may report that they are "allergic" to morphine. This report should be thoroughly investigated. Commonly, this "allergy" will be described as itching only. Pruritus (itching) is a frequent problem associated with opioids administered through any route, but it is not an allergic reaction. Itching can be relieved by administering prescribed antihistamines. Epidurally administered opioids may also cause urinary retention or pruritus. The patient should be monitored and may require urinary catheterization. Small doses of naloxone may be prescribed to relieve these problems in patients who are receiving epidural opioids for the relief of acute postoperative pain.

A number of factors may influence the safety and effectiveness of opioid administration. Opioid analgesic agents are primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidney. Therefore, metabolism and excretion of analgesic medications will be impaired in patients with liver or kidney disease, increasing the risk of cumulative or toxic effects. In addition, normeperidine, a metabolite of meperidine, may rapidly or unexpectedly accumulate to toxic levels. This is more likely to occur in patients with impaired kidney function and may result in seizures in susceptible patients.

Patients with untreated hypothyroidism are more susceptible to the analgesic effects and side effects of opioids. In contrast, patients with hyperthyroidism may require larger doses for pain relief. Patients with a decreased respiratory reserve from disease or aging may be more susceptible to the depressant effects of opioids and must be carefully monitored for respiratory depression.

Dehydrated patients are at increased risk for the hypotensive effects of opioids. Patients who become hypotensive after the administration of an opioid should be kept recumbent and rehydrated unless fluids are contraindicated. Patients who are dehydrated are also more likely to experience nausea and vomiting with opioid use. Rehydration usually relieves these symptoms.

Patients receiving certain other medications, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, phenothiazines, or tricyclic antidepressants, may have an exaggerated response to the depressant effects of opioids. Patients taking these medications should receive small doses of opioids and must be monitored closely. Continued pain in these patients indicates that a therapeutic level of the analgesic has not been achieved. The patient
must be monitored for sedation even if an analgesic effect has not been obtained.

\section*{TOLERANCE AND ADDICTION}

There is no maximum safe dosage of opioids, nor is there any easily identifiable therapeutic serum level. Both the maximal safe dosage and therapeutic serum level are relative and individual. Tolerance (the need for increasing doses of opioids to achieve the same therapeutic effect) will develop in almost all patients taking opioids over an extended period. Patients requiring opioids over a long term, especially cancer patients, will need increasing doses to relieve pain. After the first few weeks of therapy, the patient's dosing requirements usually level off. Patients who become tolerant to the analgesic effects of large doses of morphine may obtain pain relief by switching to a different opioid. Symptoms of physical dependence may occur when the opioids are discontinued; dependence often occurs with opioid tolerance and does not indicate an addiction.

> NURSING ALERT Although patients may need increasing levels of opioids, they are not addicted. Physical tolerance usually occurs in the absence of addiction. Tolerance to opioids is common and becomes a problem primarily in terms of delivering or administering the medication (eg, how to administer very large doses of morphine a day to a patient). On the other hand, addiction is rare and should never be the primary concern of the nurse caring for a patient in pain.

Addiction is a behavioral pattern of substance use characterized by a compulsion to take the drug primarily to experience its psychic effects. Fear that patients will become addicted or dependent on opioids has contributed to inadequate treatment of pain. This fear is commonly expressed by health care providers as well as patients and results from lack of knowledge about the low risk of addiction.

In an often-cited classic study (Porter \& Jick, 1980) of more than 11,000 patients receiving opioids for a medical indication, only four patients without a history of substance abuse could be identified as becoming addicted. Addiction following therapeutic opioid administration is so negligible that it should not be a consideration when caring for the patient in pain. Thus, patients and health care providers should be dissuaded from withholding pain medication because of concerns about addiction.

\section*{Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs}

NSAIDs are thought to decrease pain by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase (COX), the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandin from traumatized or inflamed tissues. There are two types of COX: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is involved with mediating prostaglandin formation involved in the maintenance of physiologic functions. Some of the physiologic functions include platelet aggregation through the provision of thromboxane precursors and increased gastric mucosal blood flow. This prevents ischemia and promotes mucosal integrity. Inhibition of COX-1 will result in gastric ulceration, bleeding, and renal damage. The second type, COX-2, mediates prostaglandin formation that results in symptoms of pain, inflammation, and fever. Thus, inhibition of COX-2 is desirable. Newer NSAIDs such as celecoxib (Celebrex), rofecoxib (Vioxx), and valdecoxib (Bextra) are COX-2 inhibitors. Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), another NSAID, blocks both COX-1 and COX-2 and is effective in relieving mild to moderate pain and has a low incidence of adverse effects. Aspirin, the oldest NSAID, also blocks COX-1 as well as COX-2; however, because it causes frequent and severe side effects, aspirin is infrequently used to treat significant acute or chronic pain.

NSAIDs are very helpful in treating arthritic diseases and may be especially powerful in treating cancer-related bone pain. They have been effectively combined with opioids to treat postoperative and other severe pain. The use of an NSAID with an opioid relieves pain more effectively than the opioid alone. In such cases, the patient may obtain pain relief with less opioid and fewer side effects. It has been shown that intraoperative administration of NSAIDs results in improved postoperative pain control following laparoscopic surgery and in some cases shorter hospital stays (McLaughlin, 1994).

A regimen of a fixed-dose, time-contingent NSAID (eg, every 4 hours) and a separately administered fluctuating dose of opioid may be effective in managing moderate to severe cancer pain. In more severe pain, the opioid dose will also be fixed, with an additional fluctuating dose as needed for breakthrough pain (a sudden increase in pain despite the administration of pain-relieving medications). These regimens result in better pain relief with fewer opioid-related side effects.

Most patients tolerate NSAIDs well. However, those with impaired kidney function may require a smaller dose and must be monitored closely for side effects. Patients taking NSAIDs bruise easily because NSAIDs have some anticoagulant effect. Moreover, they may displace other medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), from serum proteins and increase their effects. High doses or prolonged use can irritate the stomach and in some cases result in gastrointestinal bleeding as well. Thus, monitoring the patient for gastrointestinal bleeding is indicated.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations Related to Analgesic Agents}

Physiologic changes in older adults require that analgesic agents be administered with caution. Drug interactions are more likely to occur in older adults because of the higher incidence of chronic illness and the increased use of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Although the elderly population is an extremely heterogeneous group, differences in response to pain or medications by a patient in this 40-year span (60 to 100 years) are more likely to be due to chronic illness or other individual factors than age. Before administering opioid and nonopioid analgesic agents to elderly patients, the nurse needs to obtain a careful medication history to identify potential drug interactions.

Absorption and metabolism of medications are altered in elderly patients because of decreased liver, renal, and gastrointestinal function. In addition, changes in body weight, protein stores, and distribution of body fluid alter the distribution of medications in the body. As a result, medications are not metabolized as quickly and blood levels of the medication remain higher for a longer period. Elderly patients are more sensitive to medications and at an increased risk for drug toxicity (American Geriatrics Society, 1998).

Opioid and nonopioid analgesic medications can be given effectively to elderly patients but must be used cautiously because of the increased susceptibility to depression of both the nervous and the respiratory systems. Although there is no reason to avoid opioids simply because a person is elderly, meperidine should be avoided because its active and neurotoxic metabolite, normeperidine, is more likely to accumulate in the elderly. In addition, because of decreased binding of meperidine by plasma proteins, blood concentrations of the medication twice those found in younger patients may result.

In many cases, the initial dose of analgesic medication prescribed for an elderly patient may be the same as that for a younger person, or slightly smaller than the normal dose, but because of slowed metabolism and excretion related to aging, the safe interval for subsequent doses may be longer (or prolonged). As always, the best guide to pain management and administration of analgesic agents in all patients regardless of age is what the patient says. The elderly patient may obtain more pain relief for a longer time than a younger patient. As a result, smaller, less frequent doses may be required. The American Geriatrics Society (2002) has published clinical practice guidelines for managing chronic pain in elderly patients.

\section*{Tricyclic Antidepressant Agents and Anticonvulsant Medications}

Pain of neurologic origin (eg, causalgia, tumor impingement on a nerve, postherpetic neuralgia) is difficult to treat and in general is not responsive to opioid therapy. When these pain syndromes are accompanied by dysesthesia (burning or cutting pain), they may be responsive to a tricyclic antidepressant or an antiseizure agent. When indicated, tricyclic antidepressant agents, such as amitriptyline (Elavil) or imipramine (Tofranil), are prescribed in doses considerably smaller than those generally used for depression. The patient needs to know that a therapeutic effect may not occur before 3 weeks. Antiseizure medications such as phenytoin (Dilantin) or carbamazepine (Tegretol) also are used in doses lower than those prescribed for seizure disorders. Because a variety of medications can be tried, the nurse should be familiar with the possible side effects and should teach the patient and family how to recognize these effects.

\section*{ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION}

The route selected for administering an analgesic agent (Table 13-3) depends on the patient's condition and the desired effect of the medication. Analgesic agents can be administered by parenteral, oral, rectal, transdermal, transmucosal, intraspinal, or epidural routes. Each method of administration has advantages and disadvantages. The route chosen should be based on the patient's needs.

\section*{Parenteral}

Parenteral administration (intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous) of the analgesic medication produces effects more rapidly than oral administration, but these effects are of shorter

duration. Parenteral administration may be indicated if the patient is not permitted oral intake or is vomiting. Medication administered by the intramuscular route enters the bloodstream more slowly than medication given intravenously and is metabolized slowly. The rate of absorption may be erratic; it depends on the site selected and the amount of body fat.

The intravenous route is an alternative to intramuscular injection for many but not all analgesic medications. The intravenous route is the preferred parenteral route in most acute care situations because it is much more comfortable for the patient. In addition, peak serum levels and pain relief occur more rapidly and reliably. Because it peaks rapidly (usually within minutes) and is metabolized quickly, an appropriate intravenous dose will be smaller and prescribed at shorter intervals than an intramuscular dose.

Intravenous opioids may be administered by IV push or slow push (eg, over a 5 - to 10 -minute period) or by continuous infusion with a pump. Continuous infusion provides a steady level of analgesia and is indicated when pain occurs over a 24 -hour period (eg, after surgery for the first day or so, or in a patient with prolonged cancer pain who cannot take medication by other routes). The dose of analgesic agent is calculated carefully to relieve pain without producing respiratory depression and other side effects.

The subcutaneous route for infusion of opioid analgesic agents is used for patients with severe pain such as cancer pain; it is particularly useful for patients with limited intravenous access who cannot take oral medications, and patients who are managing their pain at home. The dose of opioid that can be infused through this route is limited because of the small volume that can be administered at one time into the subcutaneous tissue. However, this route is often an effective and convenient way to manage pain.

\section*{Oral Route}

If the patient can take medication by mouth, oral administration is preferred over parenteral administration because it is easy, noninvasive, and not painful. Severe pain can be relieved with oral opioids if the doses are high enough (see Table 13-2).

In terminally ill patients with prolonged pain, doses may gradually be increased as the disease progresses and causes more pain or as the person builds up a tolerance to the medication. If these higher doses are increased gradually, they usually provide additional pain relief without producing respiratory depression
or sedation. If the route of administration is changed from a parenteral route to the oral route at a dose that is not equivalent in strength (equianalgesic), the smaller oral dose may result in a withdrawal reaction and recurrence of pain.

\section*{Rectal Route}

The rectal route of administration may be indicated in patients who cannot take medications by any other route. The rectal route may also be indicated for patients with bleeding problems, such as hemophilia. The onset of action of opioids administered rectally is unclear but is delayed compared with other routes of administration. Similarly, the duration of action is prolonged.

\section*{Transdermal Route}

The transdermal route has been used to achieve a consistent opioid serum level through absorption of the medication via the skin. This route is most often used for cancer patients who are at home or in hospice care and who have been receiving oral sustained-release morphine. Fentanyl (Duragesic) is the only commercially available transdermal medication. The preparation is a patch consisting of a reservoir containing the medication and a membrane.

When the transdermal system is first applied to the skin, the fentanyl, which is fat-soluble, binds to the skin and fat layers. Then it is slowly and systemically absorbed. Therefore, there is a delay in effect while the dermal layer is being saturated. A drug reservoir actually forms in the upper layer of skin. This results in a slowly rising serum level and a slow tapering of the serum level once the patch is removed (see Fig. 13-8). Because it takes 12 to 24 hours for the fentanyl levels to gradually increase from the first patch, the last dose of sustained-release morphine should be given at the same time the first patch is applied (Donner et al., 1996). Transdermal fentanyl is associated with slightly less constipation than oral opioids. Absorption is increased in the febrile patient. A heating pad should never be applied to the area where the patch is applied. Transdermal fentanyl is much more expensive than sustained-release morphine but less costly than methods that deliver parenteral opioids.

Once it is determined that switching from other routes of morphine administration to the patch is appropriate, the correct dosage for the patch must be calculated. If the patient uses an opioid other than morphine, conversion to milligrams of oral morphine is the first step. After determining how many milligrams of morphine (or morphine equivalents) the patient has been using over 24 hours, an initial dose of transdermal fentanyl can be calculated.

Pasaro (1997) suggests one method of calculating the initial dose of fentanyl: the patient's daily dose of morphine is divided by two. Thus, the equivalent of 400 mg morphine used per day would be equivalent to 200 g fentanyl per hour. Patients switched from morphine to fentanyl need to be assessed not only for pain and potential side effects but also for dependence, reflected by withdrawal symptoms, which may consist of shivering, a feeling of coldness, sweating, headache, and paresthesia (Puntillo, Casella et al., 1997). Patients may require short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain before the systemic fentanyl level reaches a therapeutic level.

These conversions and the conversion-type table in the transdermal fentanyl packet insert should be used only to establish the initial dose of fentanyl when the patient switches from oral morphine to fentanyl (and not vice versa). These tables and equations
are not meant to be used to determine the dosages of oral morphine for a patient who has been receiving transdermal fentanyl. Many patients will not achieve satisfactory analgesia from the initial dose of transdermal fentanyl and will require an increase in their fentanyl dose to treat breakthrough pain. If the table or equation is used incorrectly to calculate a morphine dose, there is a risk of overdose. If the patient requires a change from transdermal fentanyl back to oral or intravenous morphine (as in the case of surgery), the patch should be removed and intravenous morphine supplied on an assessed need basis.

Before applying a new patch, the patient should be carefully checked for any older, forgotten patches. These should be discarded. Patches should be replaced every 72 hours.

\section*{Transmucosal Route}

The person with cancer pain who is being cared for at home may be receiving continuous opioids using sustained-release morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, transdermal fentanyl, or other medications. These patients often experience short episodes of severe pain (eg, after coughing or moving), or they may experience sudden increases in their baseline pain resulting from a change in their condition. These periods, called breakthrough pain, can be well managed with an oral dose of a short-acting transmucosal opioid that has a rapid onset of action. Currently the only transmucosal opioid available is fentanyl, a lozenge on an applicator stick (often referred to as a lollipop by patients).

Currently the only approved and commercially available transmucosal opioid analgesic agents in a nasal spray form are butorphanol (Stadol) and fentanyl. Butorphanol is a complex medication that simultaneously acts to induce or promote (agonist) and inhibit or reverse (antagonist) opioid effects. It works like an opioid agonist and an opioid antagonist at the same time. Butorphanol in any form cannot be combined with other opioids (eg, for cancer breakthrough pain) because the antagonist component will block the action of the opioids the patient is already receiving. The principal use of this agent is for brief, moderate to severe pain, such as migraine headaches.

Intranasal fentanyl is useful in cancer-related breakthrough pain. Given in this form, analgesia is achieved within 5 to 10 minutes and was rated as achieving analgesia superior to oral morphine by $50 \%$ of patients in one study (Zeppetella, 2000).

\section*{Intraspinal and Epidural Routes}

Infusion of opioids or local anesthetic agents into the subarachnoid space (intrathecal space or spinal canal) or epidural space has been used for effective control of pain in postoperative patients and those with chronic pain unrelieved by other methods. A catheter is inserted into the subarachnoid or the epidural space at the thoracic or lumbar level for administration of opioid or anesthetic agents (Fig. 13-9). With intrathecal administration, the medication infuses directly into the subarachnoid space and cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the spinal cord. With epidural administration, medication is deposited in the dura of the spinal canal and diffuses into the subarachnoid space. It is believed that pain relief from intraspinal administration of opioids is based on the existence of opioid receptors in the spinal cord.

Infusion of opioids and local anesthetic agents through an intrathecal or epidural catheter results in pain relief with fewer side effects, including sedation, than with systemic analgesia. Adverse effects associated with intraspinal administration include spinal headache resulting from loss of spinal fluid when the dura is punctured. This is more likely to occur in younger (less than 40 years of age) patients. The dura must be punctured with the intrathecal route, and dural puncture may occur inadvertently with the epidural route. When dural puncture inadvertently occurs, spinal fluid seeps out of the spinal canal. The resultant headache is likely to be more severe with an epidural needle because it is larger than a spinal needle, and therefore more spinal fluid escapes.

Although respiratory depression generally peaks 6 to 12 hours after epidural opioids are administered, it can occur earlier or up to 24 hours after the first injection. Depending on the lipophilicity (affinity for body fat) of the opioid injected, the time frame for respiratory depression can be short or long. Morphine is hydrophilic, and the time for peak effect is longer compared to fentanyl, which is a lipophilic opioid. All patients should be monitored closely for at least the first 24 hours after the first injection, longer if changes in respiratory status or level of consciousness occur. Opioid antagonist agents such as naloxone must be available for intravenous use if respiratory depression occurs.

The patient is also observed for urinary retention, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Precautions must be taken to avoid infection at the catheter site and catheter displacement. Only medications without preservatives should be administered

into the subarachnoid or epidural space because of the potential neurotoxic effects of preservatives.

During surgery, intrathecal opioids are used almost exclusively after a spinal anesthetic agent is administered. For patients undergoing large abdominal surgical procedures, especially those at risk for postoperative complications, a combination of a general inhaled anesthetic agent for the surgery and a local epidural anesthetic agent and epidural opioids administered after surgery results in excellent pain control with fewer postoperative complications.

Patients who have persistent, severe pain that fails to respond to other treatments, or those who obtain pain relief only with the risk of serious side effects, may benefit from medication administered by a long-term intrathecal or epidural catheter. After the physician tunnels the catheter through the subcutaneous tissue and places the inlet (or port) under the skin, the medication is injected through the skin into the inlet and catheter, which delivers the medication directly into the epidural space. The medication may need to be injected several times a day to maintain an adequate level of pain relief.

In patients who require more frequent doses or continuous infusions of opioid analgesic agents to relieve pain, an implantable infusion device or pump may be used to administer the medication continuously. The medication is administered at a small, constant dose at a preset rate into the epidural or subarachnoid space. The reservoir of the infusion device stores the medication for slow release and needs to be refilled every 1 or 2 months, depending on the patient's needs. This eliminates the need for repeated injections through the skin.

> NURSING ALERT An epidural catheter inserted for pain control is usually managed by the nurse. Baseline information necessary to provide safe and effective pain control includes the level or site of catheter insertion, the medications (eg, local anesthetic agents or opioids) that have been administered, and the medications anticipated in the future. The infusion rate is increased with caution when anesthetic agents are combined with opioids. Sensory deficits can occur and patients must be assessed frequently. An infusion with a lower concentration of anesthetic agent allows for administration of a greater concentration of the opioid with a lower risk of sensory deficits.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS}

Headache resulting from spinal fluid loss may be delayed. Therefore, the nurse needs to assess regularly for headache after either type of catheter is placed. Should headache occur, the patient should remain flat in bed and should be given large amounts of fluids (provided the medical condition allows), and the physician should be notified. An epidural blood patch may be carried out to reduce leakage of spinal fluid.

Cardiovascular effects (hypotension and decreased heart rate) may result from relaxation of the vasculature in the lower extremities. Therefore, the nurse assesses frequently for decreases in blood pressure, pulse rate, and urine output.

For patients experiencing urinary retention and pruritus, the physician may prescribe small doses of naloxone. The nurse administers these doses in a continuous intravenous infusion that is small enough to reverse the side effects of the opioids without reversing the analgesic effects. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may also be used to relieve opioid-related pruritus.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

The patient who receives epidural analgesic agents at home and the family must be taught how to administer the prescribed medication using sterile technique and how to assess for infection. The patient and family also need to learn how to recognize side
effects and what to do about them. Although respiratory depression is uncommon, urinary retention may be a problem, and patients and families must be prepared to deal with it if it occurs. Implanted analgesic delivery systems can be safely and confidently used at home only if health care personnel are available for consultation and, possibly, intervention on short notice.

\section*{NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS}

Although pain medication is the most powerful pain relief tool available to nurses, it is not the only one. Nonpharmacologic nursing activities can assist in relieving pain with usually low risk to the patient. Although such measures are not a substitute for medication, they may be all that is necessary or appropriate to relieve episodes of pain lasting only seconds or minutes. In instances of severe pain that lasts for hours or days, combining nonpharmacologic interventions with medications may be the most effective way to relieve pain.

\section*{Cutaneous Stimulation and Massage}

The gate control theory of pain proposes that the stimulation of fibers that transmit nonpainful sensations can block or decrease the transmission of pain impulses. Several nonpharmacologic pain relief strategies, including rubbing the skin and using heat and cold, are based on this theory.

Massage, which is generalized cutaneous stimulation of the body, often concentrates on the back and shoulders. A massage does not specifically stimulate the non-pain receptors in the same receptor field as the pain receptors, but it may have an impact through the descending control system (see earlier discussion). Massage also promotes comfort because it produces muscle relaxation.

\section*{Ice and Heat Therapies}

Ice and heat therapies may be effective pain relief strategies in some circumstances; however, their effectiveness and mechanism of action need further study. Proponents believe that ice and heat stimulate the non-pain receptors in the same receptor field as the injury.

For greatest effect, ice should be placed on the injury site immediately after injury or surgery. Ice therapy after joint surgery can significantly reduce the amount of analgesic medication required subsequently. Ice therapy may also relieve pain if applied later. Care must be taken to assess the skin prior to treatment and to protect the skin from direct application of the ice. Ice should be applied to an area for no longer than 20 minutes at a time. This prevents the rebound phenomenon that occurs as the body attempts to warm up, rendering the treatment useless. Long applications of ice may result in frostbite or nerve injury. Both ice and heat therapy must be applied carefully and monitored closely to avoid injuring the skin. Neither therapy should be applied to areas with impaired circulation or used with patients with impaired sensation.

Application of heat increases blood flow to an area and contributes to pain reduction by speeding healing. Both dry and moist heat may provide some analgesia, but their mechanisms of action are not well understood. Application of heat to inflamed joints, for example, may provide temporary comfort, but increasing the intra-articular temperature may impair healing (Oosterveld \& Rasker, 1994a, 1994b).

\section*{Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation}

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) uses a batteryoperated unit with electrodes applied to the skin to produce a tingling, vibrating, or buzzing sensation in the area of pain. It has
been used in both acute and chronic pain relief and is thought to decrease pain by stimulating the non-pain receptors in the same area as the fibers that transmit the pain. This mechanism is consistent with the gate control theory of pain and explains the effectiveness of cutaneous stimulation when applied in the same area as an injury. For example, when TENS is used in a postoperative patient, the electrodes are placed around the surgical wound.

Another possible explanation for the effectiveness of TENS is the placebo effect (the patient expects it to be effective). In a review of the literature, Carroll, Tramer, McQuay et al. (1996) found that in 15 of 17 studies with randomized control group designs, TENS was ineffective in relieving postoperative pain. In 17 of 19 studies that did not use this design, the authors of these studies concluded that TENS had a positive analgesic effect. The review of these studies suggests that a placebo effect may explain the effectiveness of TENS.

\section*{Distraction}

Distraction helps relieve both acute and chronic pain (Johnson \& Petrie, 1997). Distraction, which involves focusing the patient's attention on something other than the pain, may be the mechanism responsible for other effective cognitive techniques. Distraction is thought to reduce the perception of pain by stimulating the descending control system, resulting in fewer painful stimuli being transmitted to the brain. The effectiveness of distraction depends on the patient's ability to receive and create sensory input other than pain. Distraction techniques may range from simple activities, such as watching TV or listening to music, to highly complex physical and mental exercises. Pain relief generally increases in direct proportion to the person's active participation, the number of sensory modalities used, and the person's interest in the stimuli. Therefore, the stimulation of sight, sound, and touch is likely to be more effective in reducing pain than is the stimulation of a single sense.

Visits from family and friends are effective in relieving pain. Watching an action-packed movie on a large screen with "Surround-Sound" through headphones may be effective (provided the person finds it acceptable). Others may benefit from games and activities (eg, chess) that require concentration. Not all patients obtain pain relief with distraction, especially those in severe pain. With severe pain, the patient may be unable to concentrate well enough to participate in complex physical or mental activities.

\section*{Relaxation Techniques}

Skeletal muscle relaxation is believed to reduce pain by relaxing tense muscles that contribute to the pain. Considerable evidence supports relaxation as effective in relieving chronic low back pain (NIH Technology Assessment Panel, 1995). Few studies, however, support its effectiveness in reducing postoperative pain. This may be due to the relatively small role skeletal muscles play in postoperative pain, or to the need for the patient to practice the relaxation technique for it to be effective. Practicing the technique may not be possible when it is taught only once, immediately before surgery. A patient who already knows a technique for relaxing may only need to be reminded to use it to reduce or prevent increased pain.

A simple relaxation technique consists of abdominal breathing at a slow, rhythmic rate. The patient may close both eyes and breathe slowly and comfortably. A constant rhythm can be maintained by counting silently and slowly with each inhalation ("in, two, three") and exhalation ("out, two, three"). When teaching this technique, the nurse may count out loud with the patient at first. Slow, rhythmic breathing may also be used as a distraction technique. Relaxation techniques, as well as other noninvasive
pain relief measures, may require practice before the patient becomes skilled in using them.

Almost all people with chronic pain can benefit from some method of relaxation. Regular relaxation periods may help to combat the fatigue and muscle tension that occur with and increase chronic pain.

\section*{Guided Imagery}

Guided imagery is using one's imagination in a special way to achieve a specific positive effect. Guided imagery for relaxation and pain relief may consist of combining slow, rhythmic breathing with a mental image of relaxation and comfort. The nurse instructs the patient to close the eyes and breathe slowly in and out. With each slowly exhaled breath, the patient imagines muscle tension and discomfort being breathed out, carrying away pain and tension and leaving behind a relaxed and comfortable body. With each inhaled breath, the patient imagines healing energy flowing to the area of discomfort.

If guided imagery is to be effective, it requires a considerable amount of time to explain the technique and time for the patient to practice it. Usually, the patient is asked to practice guided imagery for about 5 minutes, three times a day. Several days of practice may be needed before the intensity of pain is reduced. Many patients begin to experience the relaxing effects of guided imagery the first time they try it. Pain relief can continue for hours after the imagery is used. The patient needs to be informed that guided imagery may work only for some people. Guided imagery should be used only in combination with all other forms of treatment that have demonstrated effectiveness.

\section*{Hypnosis}

Hypnosis, which has been effective in relieving pain or decreasing the amount of analgesic agents required in patients with acute and chronic pain, may promote pain relief in particularly difficult situations (eg, burns). The mechanism by which hypnosis acts is unclear. Its effectiveness depends on the hypnotic susceptibility of the individual (Farthing, Venturino, Brown et al., 1997). In some cases, hypnosis may be effective in the first session, with effectiveness increasing in additional sessions. In other cases, hypnosis does not work at all. Usually, hypnosis must be induced by a specially skilled person (a psychologist or a nurse with specialized training in hypnosis). Sometimes patients learn to perform self-hypnosis.

\section*{Neurologic and Neurosurgical Approaches to Pain Management}

In some situations, especially with long-term and severe intractable pain, usual pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of pain relief are ineffective. In those situations, neurologic and neurosurgical approaches to pain management may be considered. Intractable pain refers to pain that cannot be relieved satisfactorily by the usual approaches, including medications. Such pain usually is the result of malignancy (especially of the cervix, bladder, prostate, and lower bowel), but it may occur in other conditions, such as postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, spinal cord arachnoiditis, and uncontrollable ischemia and other forms of tissue destruction.

Neurologic and neurosurgical methods available for pain relief include (1) stimulation procedures (intermittent electri-
cal stimulation of a tract or center to inhibit the transmission of pain impulses), (2) administration of intraspinal opioids (see previous discussion), and (3) interruption of the tracts conducting the pain impulse from the periphery to cerebral integration centers. The latter are destructive or ablative procedures, and their effects are permanent. Ablative procedures are used when other methods of pain relief have failed.

\section*{STIMULATION PROCEDURES}

Electrical stimulation, or neuromodulation, is a method of suppressing pain by applying controlled low-voltage electrical pulses to the different parts of the nervous system. Electrical stimulation is thought to relieve pain by blocking painful stimuli (the gate control theory). This pain-modulating technique is administered by many modes. TENS and dorsal spinal cord stimulation are the most common types of electrical stimulation used. (See previous discussion of TENS.) In addition, there are also brain-stimulating techniques in which electrodes are implanted in the periventricular area of the posterior third ventricle, allowing the patient to stimulate this area to produce analgesia.

In spinal cord stimulation, a technique used for the relief of chronic, intractable pain, ischemic pain, and pain from angina, a surgically implanted device allows the patient to apply pulsed electrical stimulation to the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord to block pain impulses (Linderoth \& Meyerson, 2002). (The largest accumulation of afferent fibers is found in the dorsal column of the spinal cord.) The dorsal column stimulation unit consists of a radiofrequency stimulation transmitter, a transmitter antenna, a radiofrequency receiver, and a stimulation electrode. The batterypowered transmitter and antenna are worn externally; the receiver and electrode are implanted. A laminectomy is performed above the highest level of pain input, and the electrode is placed in the epidural space over the posterior column of the spinal cord. (The placement of the stimulating systems varies.) A subcutaneous pocket is constructed over the clavicular area or some other site for placement of the receiver. The two are connected by a subcutaneous tunnel. Careful patient selection is necessary, and not all patients receive total pain relief.

Deep brain stimulation is performed for special pain problems when the patient does not respond to the usual techniques of pain control. With the patient under local anesthesia, electrodes are introduced through a burr hole in the skull and inserted into a selected site in the brain, depending on the location or type of pain. After the effectiveness of stimulation is confirmed, the implanted electrode is connected to a radiofrequency device or pulsegenerator system operated by external telemetry. It is used in neuropathic pain that may occur with damage or injury that occurred following stroke, brain or spinal cord injuries, or phantom limb pain. Use of deep brain stimulation has decreased and may be related to improved pain control and intraspinal therapies (Rezai \& Lozano, 2002).

\section*{Interruption of Pain Pathways}

As described above, stimulation of a peripheral nerve, the spinal cord, or the deep brain using minute amounts of electricity and a stimulating device is used if all other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments fail to provide adequate relief. These treatments are reversible. If they need to be discontinued, the nervous system continues to function. Treatments that interrupt the pain pathways, however, are permanent.

Pain-conducting fibers can be interrupted at any point from their origin to the cerebral cortex. Some part of the nervous
system is destroyed, resulting in varying amounts of neurologic deficit and incapacity. In time, pain usually returns as a result of either regeneration of axonal fibers or the development of alternative pain pathways.

Destructive procedures used to interrupt the transmission of pain include cordotomy and rhizotomy. These procedures are offered if the patient is thought to be near the end of life and will have an improved quality of life as an outcome (Linderoth \& Meyerson, 2002). Often these procedures can provide pain relief for the duration of a patient's life. The use of other methods to interrupt pain transmission is waning since the use of intraspinal therapies and newer pain management treatments are available.

\section*{CORDOTOMY}

A cordotomy is the division of certain tracts of the spinal cord (Fig. 13-10). It may be performed percutaneously, by the open method after laminectomy, or by other techniques. Cordotomy is performed to interrupt the transmission of pain (Hodge \& Christensen, 2002). Care must be taken to destroy only the sensation of pain, leaving motor functions intact.

\section*{RHIZOTOMY}

Sensory nerve roots are destroyed where they enter the spinal cord. A lesion is made in the dorsal root to destroy neuronal dysfunction and reduce nociceptive input. With the advent of microsurgical techniques, the complications are few, with mild sensory deficits and mild weakness (Fig. 13-11).

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

With each of these procedures, patients are provided with written and verbal instructions about their expected effect on pain and on possible untoward consequences. The patient is monitored for

specific effects of each method of pain intervention, both positive and negative. The specific nursing care of patients who undergo neurologic and neurosurgical procedures for the relief of chronic pain depends on the type of procedure performed, its effectiveness in relieving the pain, and the changes in neurologic function that accompany the procedure. After the procedure, the patient's pain level and neurologic function are assessed. Other nursing interventions that may be indicated include positioning, turning and skin care, bowel and bladder management, and interventions to promote patient safety. Pain management remains an important aspect of nursing care with each of these procedures.

\section*{ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES}

People suffering chronic, debilitating pain are often desperate. Often they will try anything, recommended by anyone, at any price. Information about an array of potential therapies can be found on the Internet and in the self-help section of the bookstore. Therapies specifically recommended for pain from these sources include but are not limited to chelation, therapeutic touch, music therapy, herbal therapy, reflexology, magnetic therapy, electrotherapy, polarity therapy, acupressure, emu oil, pectin therapy, aromatherapy, homeopathy, and macrobiotic dieting. Many of these "therapies" (with the exception of macrobiotic dieting) are probably not harmful. However, they have yet to be proven effective by the standards used to evaluate the effectiveness of medical and nursing interventions. The National Institutes of Health has established an office to examine the effectiveness of alternative therapies.

Despite the lack of scientific evidence that these therapies are effective, a patient may find any one of them helpful via the
placebo response. It is important when caring for a patient who is using or considering using untested therapies (often referred to as alternative therapies) not to diminish the patient's hope and potential placebo response. This must be weighed against the professional nurse's responsibility to protect the patient from costly and potentially harmful and dangerous therapies that the patient is not in a position to evaluate scientifically.

Problems arise when patients do not find relief but are deprived of conventional therapy because the alternative therapy "should be helping," or when patients abandon conventional therapy for alternative therapy. In addition, few alternative therapies are free. Desperate patients may risk financial ruin seeking alternative therapies that do not work.

The nurse's role is to help the patient and family understand scientific research and how that differs from anecdotal evidence. Without diminishing the placebo effects the patient may receive, the nurse encourages the patient to assess the effectiveness of the therapy continually using standard pain assessment techniques. In addition, the nurse encourages the patient using alternative therapies to combine them with conventional therapies and to discuss this use with the physician.

\section*{Promoting Home and Community-Based Care}

In preparing the patient and family to manage pain at home, the patient and family need to be taught and guided about what type of pain or discomfort to expect, how long the pain is expected to last, and when the pain indicates a problem that should be reported. The person who has experienced acute pain as a result of injury, illness, procedure, or surgery will probably receive one or more prescriptions for analgesic medication.

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

The patient and family need to understand the purpose of each medication, the appropriate time to use it, the associated side effects, and the strategies that can be used to prevent these problems. The patient and family often need reassurance that pain can be successfully managed at home.

Inadequate control of pain at home is a common reason people seek health care or are readmitted to the hospital. When chronic pain exists, anxiety and fear are often intensified at the time the patient is about to return home. The patient and family are instructed about the techniques for assessing pain, using pain assessment tools, and administering pain medications. These instructions are given verbally and in writing (Chart 13-6).

Opportunities are provided for the patient and family members to practice administering the medication until they are comfortable and confident with the procedure. They are instructed about the risks of respiratory and central nervous system depression associated with opioids and ways to assess for these complications. If the medications cause other predictable effects, such as constipation, the instructions include measures for preventing and treating the problem, as described earlier. Steps are taken to ensure that the needed medications are available from the local pharmacy so that the patient receives the medication when required.

Education for patients and families must stress the need for keeping analgesic agents away from children, who might mistake them for candy. Elderly patients may become lax about this because no children live in the home, but visiting children can be placed at risk. Additionally, analgesic agents must be kept away from other family members who may take them inadvertently.

- Increase fluid intake (8 to 10 glasses of fluid). \\
- Exercise regularly. \\
- Increase fiber in the diet (bran, fresh fruits, vegetables). \\
- Use a mild laxative, such as milk of magnesia, if no bowel movement in 3 days. \\
- Take $\qquad$ every day at $\qquad$ (time) with a full glass of water. \\

Further, analgesic medications should be stored safely and out of sight to prevent others from taking them for their own use or for diverting them to others.

\section*{CONTINUING CARE}

If the patient is to receive parenteral or intraspinal analgesia at home, a referral to a home care nurse is indicated. The home care nurse makes a home visit to assess the patient and to determine if the pain management program is being implemented and if the technique for injecting or infusing the analgesic agent is being carried out safely and effectively. If the patient has an implanted infusion pump in place, the nurse examines the condition of the pump or injection site and may refill the reservoir with medication as prescribed or may supervise family members in the procedure. Any change in the patient's need for analgesic medications is assessed. In collaboration with the physician, the nurse then assists the patient and family in modifying the medication dose. These efforts enable the patient to obtain adequate pain relief while remaining at home and with family.

As tolerance develops, ever-increasing amounts of opioids are needed. It is important to assure the patient and family that slowly increasing doses will not cause an increased risk of respiratory depression and central nervous system depression, because the patient will become tolerant to these effects also. However, the patient will not become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids and will require increased efforts to prevent constipation.

\section*{Evaluating Pain Management Strategies}

An important aspect of caring for the patient in pain is reassessing the pain after the intervention has been implemented. The measure's effectiveness is based on the patient's assessment of pain, as reflected in pain assessment tools. If the intervention was ineffective, the nurse needs to consider other measures. If these are ineffective, the pain relief goals need to be reassessed in collaboration with the physician. The nurse serves as a patient advocate in obtaining additional pain relief.

\section*{REASSESSMENTS}

After interventions have had a chance to work, the patient is asked to rate the intensity of pain. This assessment is repeated at appropriate intervals after the intervention and compared with the previous rating. These assessments indicate the effectiveness of the pain relief measures and provide a basis for continuing or modifying the plan of care. See the accompanying Plan of Nursing Care for more information.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Achieves pain relief
a. Rates pain at a lower intensity (on a scale of 0 to 10 ) after intervention
b. Rates pain at a lower intensity for longer periods
2. Patient or family administers prescribed analgesic medications correctly
a. States correct dose of medication
b. Administers correct dose using correct procedure
c. Identifies side effects of medication
d. Describes actions taken to prevent or correct side effects
3. Uses nonpharmacologic pain strategies as recommended
a. Reports practice of nonpharmacologic strategies
b. Describes expected outcomes of nonpharmacologic strategies
4. Reports minimal effects of pain and minimal side effects of interventions
a. Participates in activities important to recovery (eg, drinking fluids, coughing, ambulating)
b. Participates in activities important to self and to family (eg, family activities, interpersonal relationships, parenting, social interaction, recreation, work)
c. Reports adequate sleep and absence of fatigue and constipation

\section*{Expected Outcomes}

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis: Pain}

Goal: Relief of pain or decrease in intensity of pain
1. Reassure patient that you know pain is real and will assist him or her in dealing with it.
2. Use pain assessment scale to identify intensity of pain.
3. Assess and record pain and its characteristics: location, quality, frequency, and duration.
4. Administer balanced analgesics as prescribed to promote optimal pain relief.
5. Readminister pain assessment scale.
6. Document severity of patient's pain on chart.
7. Obtain additional prescriptions as needed.
8. Identify and encourage patient to use strategies that have been successful with previous pain.
9. Teach patient additional strategies to relieve pain and discomfort: distraction, relaxation, cutaneous stimulation, etc.
10. Instruct patient and family about potential side effects of analgesics and their prevention and management.
1. Fear that pain will not be accepted as real increases tension and anxiety and decreases pain tolerance.
2. Provides baseline for assessing changes in pain level and evaluating interventions
3. Data assist in evaluating pain and pain relief and identifying multiple sources and types of pain.
4. Analgesics are more effective if administered early in pain cycle. Simultaneous use of analgesics that work on different portions of the nociceptive system will provide greater pain relief with fewer side effects.
5. Permits assessment of effectiveness of analgesia and identifies need for further action if ineffective
6. Assists in demonstrating need for additional analgesic or alternative approach to pain management
7. Inadequate pain relief results in an increased stress response, suffering, and prolonged hospitalizations.
8. Encourages use of pain relief strategies familiar to and accepted by patient
9. Use of these strategies along with analgesia may produce more effective pain relief.
10. Anticipating and preventing side effects enable the patient to continue analgesia without interruption because of side effects.
- Reports relief that pain is accepted as real and that he or she will receive assistance in pain relief
- Reports lower intensity of pain and discomfort after interventions implemented
- Reports less disruption from pain and discomfort after use of intervention
- Uses pain medication as prescribed
- Identifies effective pain relief strategies
- Demonstrates use of new strategies to relieve pain and reports their effectiveness
- Experiences minimal side effects of analgesia without interruption to treat side effects
- Increases interactions with family and friends

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. An 82-year-old woman with cancer has been admitted to a skilled care facility from her home. Her son reports that his mother has become increasingly forgetful and is now unable to manage her medication regimen. He says that she would forget when she took her antidepressant pills and Oxy Contin. She was so "doped up" that he couldn't bear to see her that way. She is being treated for cancer pain. Two weeks after admission, a pain assessment reveals a pain intensity of 8 on a 0 to 10 scale; she is refusing to get out of bed. Her son is with her and does not want the nurse to give the breakthrough medication or call the physician to titrate the OxyContin for maximal pain relief. Describe the strategies you would use to provide adequate pain management for this patient and the physiologic factors that need to be considered. Identify strategies that you would use to educate her son about her need for pain management. Identify the ethical issues involved in this situation.
2. A 45-year-old patient has just returned from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for which she takes celecoxib (Celebrex) 200 mg bid. She rates her pain intensity from the recent surgery as a 6 (on a 0 to 10 scale) and is complaining of severe pain in multiple joints. Discuss the factors contributing to the pain that this patient is experiencing. What would be the best approach to manage her pain? Analyze the effect of her rheumatoid arthritis and joint pain on her postoperative pain and its management.
3. A 62 -year-old man is receiving epidural infusions of an opioid for intractable pain. He will be discharged home, where his daughter will assist in his pain management. Describe the teaching required for the man and his daughter. What side effects should they observe for, and what actions should they take if they occur? How would you modify your discharge teaching plan if the patient lived alone?
4. A 35-year-old patient with a history of heroin use is admitted to the hospital with multiple stab wounds following an altercation. Two days after extensive surgery to repair his wounds, he reports severe, unrelenting pain and reports that the medication he is receiving (ie, an opioid) is ineffective in diminishing his pain. Several staff members believe that he does not have severe pain and only wants more medication because of his history of drug abuse. Describe how you would address pain relief in this patient, and provide rationale for your actions. How would you address the views of the staff members who believe that the patient should not receive additional medication?

Eluid and electrolyte balance is a dynamic process that is crucial for life. Potential and actual disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance occur in every setting, with every disorder, and with a variety of changes that affect well people (eg, increased fluid and sodium loss with strenuous exercise and high environmental temperature; inadequate intake of fluid and electrolytes) as well as those who are ill.

\section*{Fundamental Concepts}

The nurse needs to understand the physiology of fluid and electrolyte balance and acid-base balance to anticipate, identify, and respond to possible imbalances in each. The nurse also must use effective teaching and communication skills to help prevent and treat various fluid and electrolyte disturbances.

\section*{AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF BODY FLUIDS}

Approximately $60 \%$ of a typical adult's weight consists of fluid (water and electrolytes). Factors that influence the amount of body fluid are age, gender, and body fat. In general, younger people have a higher percentage of body fluid than older people, and men have proportionately more body fluid than women. Obese people have less fluid than thin people because fat cells contain little water.

Body fluid is located in two fluid compartments: the intracellular space (fluid in the cells) and the extracellular space (fluid outside the cells). Approximately two thirds of body fluid is in the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment and is located primarily in the skeletal muscle mass.

The extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment is further divided into the intravascular, interstitial, and transcellular fluid spaces. The intravascular space (the fluid within the blood vessels) contains plasma. Approximately 3 L of the average 6 L of blood volume is made up of plasma. The remaining 3 L is made up of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes. The interstitial space contains the fluid that surrounds the cell and totals about 11 to 12 L in an adult. Lymph is an example of interstitial fluid. The transcellular space is
the smallest division of the ECF compartment and contains approximately 1 L of fluid at any given time. Examples of transcellular fluid are cerebrospinal, pericardial, synovial, intraocular, and pleural fluids; sweat; and digestive secretions.

Body fluid normally shifts between the two major compartments or spaces in an effort to maintain an equilibrium between the spaces. Loss of fluid from the body can disrupt this equilibrium. Sometimes fluid is not lost from the body but is unavailable for use by either the ICF or ECF. Loss of ECF into a space that does not contribute to equilibrium between the ICF and the ECF is referred to as a third-space fluid shift, or "third spacing" for short.

An early clue of a third-space fluid shift is a decrease in urine output despite adequate fluid intake. Urine output decreases because fluid shifts out of the intravascular space; the kidneys then receive less blood and attempt to compensate by decreasing urine output. Other signs and symptoms of third spacing that indicate an intravascular fluid volume deficit include increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, decreased central venous pressure, edema, increased body weight, and imbalances in fluid intake and output (I\&O). Third-space shifts occur in ascites, burns, peritonitis, bowel obstruction, and massive bleeding into a joint or body cavity.

\section*{Electrolytes}

Electrolytes in body fluids are active chemicals (cations, which carry positive charges, and anions, which carry negative charges). The major cations in body fluid are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen ions. The major anions are chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, sulfate, and proteinate ions.

These chemicals unite in varying combinations. Therefore, electrolyte concentration in the body is expressed in terms of milliequivalents ( mEq ) per liter, a measure of chemical activity, rather than in terms of milligrams ( mg ), a unit of weight. More specifically, a milliequivalent is defined as being equivalent to the electrochemical activity of 1 mg of hydrogen. In a solution, cations and anions are equal in $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$.

Electrolyte concentrations in the ICF differ from those in the ECF, as reflected in Table 14-1. Because special techniques are
acidosis: an acid-base imbalance characterized by an increase in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration (decreased blood pH ). A low arterial pH due to reduced bicarbonate concentration is called metabolic acidosis; a low arterial pH due to increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is respiratory acidosis
active transport: physiologic pump that moves fluid from an area of lower concentration to one of higher concentration; active transport requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for energy
alkalosis: an acid-base imbalance characterized by a reduction in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration (increased blood pH ). A high arterial pH with increased bicarbonate concentration is called metabolic alkalosis; a high arterial pH due to reduced $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is respiratory alkalosis
diffusion: the process by which solutes move from an area of higher concentra-
tion to one of lower concentration; does not require expenditure of energy
hydrostatic pressure: the pressure created by the weight of fluid against the wall that contains it. In the body, hydrostatic pressure in blood vessels results from the weight of fluid itself and the force resulting from cardiac contraction.
hypertonic solution: a solution with an osmolality higher than that of serum hypotonic solution: a solution with an osmolality lower than that of serum
isotonic solution: a solution with the same osmolality as serum and other body fluids. Osmolality falls within normal range for serum ( $280-300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$ ).
osmolality: the number of osmoles (the standard unit of osmotic pressure) per kilogram of solution. Expressed as mOsm/kg. Used more often in clinical practice than the
term osmolarity to evaluate serum and urine. In addition to urea and glucose, sodium contributes the largest number of particles to osmolality.
osmolarity: the number of osmoles, the standard unit of osmotic pressure per liter of solution. It is expressed as milliosmoles per liter ( $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ); describes the concentration of solutes or dissolved particles.
osmosis: the process by which fluid moves across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration; the process continues until the solute concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane.
tonicity: the measurement of the osmotic pressure of a solution; another term for osmolality

required to measure electrolyte concentrations in the ICF, it is customary to measure the electrolytes in the most accessible portion of the ECF, namely the plasma.

Sodium ions, which are positively charged, far outnumber the other cations in the ECF. Because sodium concentration affects the overall concentration of the ECF, sodium is important in regulating the volume of body fluid. Retention of sodium is associated with fluid retention, and excessive loss of sodium is usually associated with decreased volume of body fluid.

As shown in Table 14-1, the major electrolytes in the ICF are potassium and phosphate. The ECF has a low concentration of potassium and can tolerate only small changes in potassium concentrations. Therefore, release of large stores of intracellular potassium, typically caused by trauma to the cells and tissues, can be extremely dangerous.

The body expends a great deal of energy maintaining the high extracellular concentration of sodium and the high intracellular concentration of potassium. It does so by means of cell membrane pumps that exchange sodium and potassium ions. Normal movement of fluids through the capillary wall into the tissues depends on hydrostatic pressure (the pressure exerted by the fluid on the walls of the blood vessel) at both the arterial and the venous ends of the vessel and the osmotic pressure exerted by the protein of plasma. The direction of fluid movement depends on the differences in these two opposing forces (hydrostatic versus osmotic pressure).

In addition to electrolytes, the ECF transports other substances, such as enzymes and hormones. It also carries blood components, such as red and white blood cells, throughout the body.

\section*{REGULATION OF BODY FLUID COMPARTMENTS}

\section*{Osmosis and Osmolality}

When two different solutions are separated by a membrane that is impermeable to the dissolved substances, fluid shifts through the membrane from the region of low solute concentration to the region of high solute concentration until the solutions are of equal concentration; this diffusion of water caused by a fluid concentration gradient is known as osmosis (Fig. 14-1 $A$ ). The magnitude of this force depends on the number of particles dissolved in the solutions, not on their weights. The number of dissolved particles contained in a unit of fluid determines the osmolality of a solution, which influences the movement of fluid between the fluid compartments. Tonicity is the ability of all the solutes to cause an osmotic driving force that promotes water movement from one compartment to another (Porth, 2002). The control of tonicity determines the normal state of cellular hydration and cell size. Sodium, mannitol, glucose, and sorbitol are effective osmoles (capable of affecting water movement). Three other terms are associated with osmosis: osmotic pressure, oncotic pressure, and osmotic diuresis.
- Osmotic pressure is the amount of hydrostatic pressure needed to stop the flow of water by osmosis. It is primarily determined by the concentration of solutes.
- Oncotic pressure is the osmotic pressure exerted by proteins (eg, albumin).
- Osmotic diuresis occurs when the urine output increases due to the excretion of substances such as glucose, mannitol, or contrast agents in the urine.

\section*{Diffusion}

Diffusion is the natural tendency of a substance to move from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration (see Fig. 14-1 B). It occurs through the random movement of ions and molecules. Examples of diffusion are the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the pulmonary capillaries and alveoli and the tendency of sodium to move from the ECF compartment, where the sodium concentration is high, to the ICF, where its concentration is low.

\section*{Filtration}

Hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries tends to filter fluid out of the vascular compartment into the interstitial fluid. Movement of water and solutes occurs from an area of high hydrostatic pressure to an area of low hydrostatic pressure. Filtration allows the kidneys to filter 180 L of plasma per day. Another example of filtration is the passage of water and electrolytes from the arterial capillary bed to the interstitial fluid; in this instance, the hydrostatic pressure is furnished by the pumping action of the heart.

\section*{Sodium-Potassium Pump}

As stated earlier, the sodium concentration is greater in the ECF than in the ICF, and because of this, sodium tends to enter the cell by diffusion. This tendency is offset by the sodium-potassium pump, which is located in the cell membrane and actively moves sodium from the cell into the ECF. Conversely, the high intracellular potassium concentration is maintained by pumping potassium into the cell. By definition, active transport implies that

EIGURE 14-1 (A) Osmosis: movement of fluid to area of high solute concentration and eventual equalization of solute concentration. (B) Diffusion: movement of fluid and solutes and equalization of solute concentration.
energy must be expended for the movement to occur against a concentration gradient.

\section*{ROUTES OF GAINS AND LOSSES}

Water and electrolytes are gained in various ways. A healthy person gains fluids by drinking and eating. In patients with some disorders, fluids may be provided by the parenteral route (intravenously or subcutaneously) or by means of an enteral feeding tube in the stomach or intestine.

NURSING ALERT When fluid balance is critical, all routes of gain and all routes of loss must be recorded and all volumes compared. Organs of fluid loss include the kidneys, skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

\section*{Kidneys}

The usual daily urine volume in the adult is 1 to 2 L . A general rule is that the output is approximately 1 mL of urine per kilogram of body weight per hour ( $1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ ) in all age groups.

\section*{Skin}

Sensible perspiration refers to visible water and electrolyte loss through the skin (sweating). The chief solutes in sweat are sodium, chloride, and potassium. Actual sweat losses can vary from 0 to $1,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ or more every hour, depending on the environmental
temperature. Continuous water loss by evaporation (approximately $600 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day) occurs through the skin as insensible perspiration, a nonvisible form of water loss. Fever greatly increases insensible water loss through the lungs and the skin, as does loss of the natural skin barrier (through major burns, for example).

\section*{Lungs}

The lungs normally eliminate water vapor (insensible loss) at a rate of approximately 400 mL every day. The loss is much greater with increased respiratory rate or depth, or in a dry climate.

\section*{GI Tract}

The usual loss through the GI tract is only 100 to 200 mL daily, even though approximately 8 L of fluid circulates through the GI system every 24 hours (called the GI circulation). Because the bulk of fluid is reabsorbed in the small intestine, diarrhea and fistulas cause large losses. In healthy people, the daily average intake and output of water are approximately equal (Table 14-2).

\section*{LABORATORY TESTS FOR EVALUATING FLUID STATUS}

Osmolality reflects the concentration of fluid that affects the movement of water between fluid compartments by osmosis. Osmolality measures the solute concentration per kilogram in blood and urine. It is also a measure of a solution's ability to cre-

ate osmotic pressure and affect the movement of water. Serum osmolality primarily reflects the concentration of sodium. Urine osmolality is determined by urea, creatinine, and uric acid. When measured with serum osmolality, urine osmolality is the most reliable indicator of urine concentration. Osmolality is reported as milliosmoles per kilogram of water ( $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$ ).

Osmolarity, another term that describes the concentration of solutions, is measured in milliosmoles per liter ( $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ). The term "osmolality," however, is used more often in clinical practice. Normal serum osmolality is 280 to $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$, and normal urine osmolality is 250 to $900 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$. Sodium predominates in ECF osmolality and holds water in this compartment.

Factors that increase and decrease serum and urine osmolality are identified in Table 14-3. Serum osmolality may be measured directly through laboratory tests or estimated at the bedside by doubling the serum sodium level or by using the following formula:
$\mathrm{Na}^{+} \times 2=\frac{\text { Glucose }}{18}+\frac{\text { BUN }}{3}=$ Approximate value of serum osmolality
The calculated value usually is within 10 mOsm of the measured osmolality.

Urine specific gravity measures the kidneys' ability to excrete or conserve water. The specific gravity of urine is compared to the weight of distilled water, which has a specific gravity of 1.000 . The normal range of specific gravity is 1.010 to 1.025 . Urine specific gravity can be measured at the bedside by placing a calibrated

hydrometer or urinometer in a cylinder of approximately 20 mL of urine. Specific gravity can also be assessed with a refractometer or dipstick with a reagent for this purpose. Specific gravity varies inversely with urine volume; normally, the larger the volume of urine, the lower the specific gravity. Specific gravity is a less reliable indicator of concentration than urine osmolality; increased glucose or protein in urine can cause a falsely high specific gravity. Factors that increase or decrease urine osmolality are the same for urine specific gravity.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is made up of urea, an end product of metabolism of protein (from both muscle and dietary intake) by the liver. Amino acid breakdown produces large amounts of ammonia molecules, which are absorbed into the bloodstream. Ammonia molecules are converted to urea and excreted in the urine. The normal BUN is 10 to $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(3.5-7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. The BUN level varies with urine output. Factors that increase BUN include decreased renal function, GI bleeding, dehydration, increased protein intake, fever, and sepsis. Those that decrease BUN include end-stage liver disease, a low-protein diet, starvation, and any condition that results in expanded fluid volume (eg, pregnancy).

Creatinine is the end product of muscle metabolism. It is a better indicator of renal function than BUN because it does not vary with protein intake and metabolic state. The normal serum creatinine is approximately 0.7 to $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (SI: $60-130 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ); however, its concentration depends on lean body mass and varies from person to person. Serum creatinine levels increase when renal function decreases.

Hematocrit measures the volume percentage of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in whole blood and normally ranges from $44 \%$ to $52 \%$ for males and $39 \%$ to $47 \%$ for females. Conditions that increase the hematocrit value are dehydration and polycythemia; those that decrease hematocrit are overhydration and anemia.

Urine sodium values change with sodium intake and the status of fluid volume (as sodium intake increases, excretion increases; as the circulating fluid volume decreases, sodium is conserved). Normal urine sodium levels range from 50 to $220 \mathrm{mEq} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$ ( $50-220 \mathrm{mmol} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$ ). A random specimen usually contains more than $40 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ of sodium. Urine sodium levels are used to assess volume status and are useful in the diagnosis of hyponatremia and acute renal failure.

\section*{HOMEOSTATIC MECHANISMS}

The body is equipped with remarkable homeostatic mechanisms to keep the composition and volume of body fluid within narrow limits of normal. Organs involved in homeostasis include the kidneys, lungs, heart, adrenal glands, parathyroid glands, and pituitary gland.

\section*{Kidney Functions}

Vital to the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, the kidneys normally filter 170 L of plasma every day in the adult, while excreting only 1.5 L of urine. They act both autonomously and in response to blood-borne messengers, such as aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Major functions of the kidneys in maintaining normal fluid balance include the following:
- Regulation of ECF volume and osmolality by selective retention and excretion of body fluids
- Regulation of electrolyte levels in the ECF by selective retention of needed substances and excretion of unneeded substances
- Regulation of pH of the ECF by retention of hydrogen ions
- Excretion of metabolic wastes and toxic substances

Given these functions, it is readily apparent that renal failure will result in multiple fluid and electrolyte problems. Renal function declines with advanced age, as do muscle mass and daily exogenous creatinine production. Thus, high-normal and minimally elevated serum creatinine values may indicate substantially reduced renal function in the elderly.

\section*{Heart and Blood Vessel Functions}

The pumping action of the heart circulates blood through the kidneys under sufficient pressure to allow for urine formation. Failure of this pumping action interferes with renal perfusion and thus with water and electrolyte regulation.

\section*{Lung Functions}

The lungs are also vital in maintaining homeostasis. Through exhalation, the lungs remove approximately 300 mL of water daily in the normal adult. Abnormal conditions, such as hyperpnea (abnormally deep respiration) or continuous coughing, increase this loss; mechanical ventilation with excessive moisture decreases it. The lungs also have a major role in maintaining acid-base balance. Changes from normal aging result in decreased respiratory function, causing increased difficulty in pH regulation in older adults with major illness or trauma.

\section*{Pituitary Functions}

The hypothalamus manufactures ADH , which is stored in the posterior pituitary gland and released as needed. ADH is sometimes called the water-conserving hormone because it causes the body to retain water. Functions of ADH include maintaining the osmotic pressure of the cells by controlling the retention or excretion of water by the kidneys and by regulating blood volume (Fig. 14-2).

\section*{Adrenal Functions}

Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid secreted by the zona glomerulosa (outer zone) of the adrenal cortex, has a profound effect on fluid balance. Increased secretion of aldosterone causes sodium retention (and thus water retention) and potassium loss. Conversely, decreased secretion of aldosterone causes sodium and water loss and potassium retention.

Cortisol, another adrenocortical hormone, has only a fraction of the mineralocorticoid potency of aldosterone. When secreted in large quantities, however, it can also produce sodium and fluid retention and potassium deficit.

\section*{Parathyroid Functions}

The parathyroid glands, embedded in the thyroid gland, regulate calcium and phosphate balance by means of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH influences bone resorption, calcium absorption from the intestines, and calcium reabsorption from the renal tubules.

\section*{Other Mechanisms}

Changes in the volume of the interstitial compartment within the ECF can occur without affecting body function. The vascular compartment, however, cannot tolerate change as readily and
must be carefully maintained to ensure that tissues receive adequate nutrients.

\section*{BARORECEPTORS}

The baroreceptors are small nerve receptors that detect changes in pressure within blood vessels and transmit this information to the central nervous system. They are responsible for monitoring the circulating volume, and they regulate sympathetic and parasympathetic neural activity as well as endocrine activities. They are categorized as low-pressure and high-pressure baroreceptor systems. Low-pressure baroreceptors are located in the cardiac atria, particularly the left atrium. The high-pressure baroreceptors are nerve endings in the aortic arch and in the cardiac sinus. Another high-pressure baroreceptor is located in the afferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the nephron.

As arterial pressure decreases, baroreceptors transmit fewer impulses from the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch to the vasomotor center. A decrease in impulses stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system. The outcome is an increase in cardiac rate, conduction, and contractility and in circulating blood volume. Sympathetic stimulation constricts renal arterioles; this increases the release of aldosterone, decreases glomerular filtration, and increases sodium and water reabsorption.

\section*{RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM}

Renin is an enzyme that converts angiotensinogen, an inactive substance formed by the liver, into angiotensin I. Renin is released by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys in response to decreased renal perfusion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, with its vasoconstrictor properties, increases arterial perfusion pressure and stimulates thirst. As the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, aldosterone is released in response to an increased release of renin. Aldosterone is a volume regulator and is also released as serum potassium increases, serum sodium decreases, or adrenocorticotropic hormone increases.

\section*{ADH AND THIRST}

ADH and the thirst mechanism have important roles in maintaining sodium concentration and oral intake of fluids. Oral intake is controlled by the thirst center located in the hypothalamus. As serum concentration or osmolality increases or blood volume decreases, neurons in the hypothalamus are stimulated by intracellular dehydration; thirst then occurs, and the person increases oral intake of fluids. Water excretion is controlled by ADH, aldosterone, and baroreceptors, as mentioned previously. The presence or absence of ADH is the most significant factor in determining whether the urine that is excreted is concentrated or dilute.

\section*{OSMORECEPTORS}

Located on the surface of the hypothalamus, osmoreceptors sense changes in sodium concentration. As osmotic pressure increases, the neurons become dehydrated and quickly release impulses to the posterior pituitary, which increases the release of ADH. ADH travels in the blood to the kidneys, where it alters permeability to water, causing increased reabsorption of water and decreased urine output. The retained water dilutes the ECF and returns its concentration to normal. Restoration of normal osmotic pressure provides feedback to the osmoreceptors to inhibit further ADH release (see Fig. 14-2).

\section*{RELEASE OF ATRIAL NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE}

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released by cardiac cells in the atria of the heart in response to increased atrial pressure. Any dis-

\end{figure}
order that results in volume expansion or increased cardiac filling pressures (eg, high sodium intake, heart failure, chronic renal failure, atrial tachycardia, or use of vasoconstrictor agents) will increase the release of ANP. The action of ANP is the direct opposite of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreases blood pressure and volume (Fig. 14-3). The ANP measured in plasma is normally 20 to $77 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}(20-77 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L})$. This level increases in acute heart failure, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, hyperthyroidism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and small cell lung cancer.

The level decreases in chronic heart failure and with the use of medications such as urea (Ureaphil) and prazosin (Minipress).

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Normal physiologic changes of aging, including reduced renal and respiratory function and reserve and alterations in the ratio of body fluids to muscle mass, may alter the responses of an elderly person to fluid and electrolyte changes and acid-base disturbances. In

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 14-3 Role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in maintenance of fluid balance.}
\end{figure}
addition, the frequent use of medications in older adults can affect renal and cardiac function and fluid balance, thereby increasing the likelihood of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Routine procedures, such as the vigorous administration of laxatives before colon x-ray studies, may produce a serious fluid volume deficit, necessitating the use of intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent hypotension and other effects of hypovolemia.

Alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance that may produce minor changes in young and middle-aged adults have the potential to produce profound changes in older adults, accompanied by a rapid onset of signs and symptoms. In other elderly patients, the clinical manifestations of fluid and electrolyte disturbances may be subtle or atypical. For example, fluid deficit or reduced sodium levels (hyponatremia) may cause confusion in the elderly person, whereas in young and middle-aged people the first sign commonly is increased thirst. Rapid infusion of an excessive volume of IV fluids may produce fluid overload and cardiac failure
in the elderly patient. These reactions are likely to occur more quickly and with the administration of smaller volumes of fluid than in healthy young and middle-aged adults because of the decreased cardiac reserve and reduced renal function that accompany aging.

Increased sensitivity to fluid and electrolyte changes in the elderly patient requires careful assessment, with attention to intake and output of fluids from all sources and to changes in daily weight; careful monitoring of side effects and interactions of medications; and prompt reporting and management of disturbances. Additional gerontologic considerations relating to specific fluid and electrolyte disturbances are discussed later in this chapter.

\section*{Fluid Volume Disturbances}

\section*{FLUID VOLUME DEFICIT (HYPOVOLEMIA)}

Fluid volume deficit (FVD) occurs when loss of extracellular fluid volume exceeds the intake of fluid. It occurs when water and electrolytes are lost in the same proportion as they exist in normal body fluids, so that the ratio of serum electrolytes to water remains the same. Fluid volume deficit (hypovolemia) should not be confused with the term dehydration, which refers to loss of water alone with increased serum sodium levels. FVD may occur alone or in combination with other imbalances. Unless other imbalances are present concurrently, serum electrolyte concentrations remain essentially unchanged.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

FVD results from loss of body fluids and occurs more rapidly when coupled with decreased fluid intake. FVD can develop from inadequate intake alone if the decreased intake is prolonged. Causes of FVD include abnormal fluid losses, such as those resulting from vomiting, diarrhea, GI suctioning, and sweating, and decreased intake, as in nausea or inability to gain access to fluids (Beck, 2000).

Additional risk factors include diabetes insipidus, adrenal insufficiency, osmotic diuresis, hemorrhage, and coma. Third-space fluid shifts, or the movement of fluid from the vascular system to other body spaces (eg, with edema formation in burns or ascites with liver dysfunction), also produce FVD.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

FVD can develop rapidly and can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the degree of fluid loss. Important characteristics of FVD include acute weight loss; decreased skin turgor; oliguria; concentrated urine; postural hypotension; a weak, rapid heart rate; flattened neck veins; increased temperature; decreased central venous pressure; cool, clammy skin related to peripheral vasoconstriction; thirst; anorexia; nausea; lassitude; muscle weakness; and cramps.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Laboratory data useful in evaluating fluid volume status include BUN and its relation to the serum creatinine concentration. A volume-depleted patient has a BUN elevated out of proportion to the serum creatinine level (a ratio greater than $20: 1$ ). The cause of hypovolemia may be determined through the health history and physical examination. The BUN can be elevated due to dehydration or decreased renal perfusion and function. Also, the
hematocrit level is greater than normal because the red blood cells become suspended in a decreased plasma volume.

Serum electrolyte changes may also exist. Potassium and sodium levels can be reduced (hypokalemia, hyponatremia) or elevated (hyperkalemia, hypernatremia).
- Hypokalemia occurs with GI and renal losses.
- Hyperkalemia occurs with adrenal insufficiency.
- Hyponatremia occurs with increased thirst and ADH release.
- Hypernatremia results from increased insensible losses and diabetes insipidus.

Urine specific gravity is increased in relation to the kidneys' attempt to conserve water and decreased with diabetes insipidus. Urine osmolality is greater than $450 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{Kg}$, since the kidneys try to compensate by conserving water. Normal values for these tests are listed in Table 14-4.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly patients have special nursing care needs because of their propensity for developing fluid and electrolyte imbalances (Beck, 2000; Kugler \& Hustead, 2000). Fluid balance in the elderly patient is often marginal at best because of certain physiologic changes associated with the aging process. Some of these changes include reduction in total body water (associated with increased body fat content and decreased muscle mass); reduction in renal function, resulting in decreased ability to concentrate urine; de-
creased cardiovascular and respiratory function; and disturbances in hormonal regulatory functions. Although these changes are viewed as normal in the aging process, they must be considered when the elderly person becomes ill because age-related changes predispose the person to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. These physiologic changes must be considered during assessment of the elderly patient as well as before initiating treatment for fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment of the elderly patient should be modified somewhat from that of younger adults. For example, skin turgor is less valid in the assessment of elderly patients because their skin has lost some of its elasticity; therefore, other assessment measures (eg, slowness in filling of veins of the hands and feet) become more important in detecting FVD. In the elderly patient, skin turgor is best tested over the forehead or the sternum, because alterations in skin elasticity are less marked in these areas. As in any patient, skin turgor should be monitored serially to detect subtle changes.

The nurse should perform a functional assessment of the aged person's ability to determine fluid and food needs and to obtain adequate intake. For example, is the patient mentally clear? Is the patient able to ambulate and use both arms and hands to reach fluids and foods? Is the patient able to swallow? All of these questions have a direct bearing on how patients will be able to meet their own need for fluids and foods. During an elderly patient's hospital stay, the nurse must provide fluids for any patient who is unable to carry out self-care activities.

\end{tabular}

Another concern is that some elderly patients deliberately restrict their fluid intake to avoid embarrassing episodes of incontinence. In this situation, the nurse also identifies interventions to deal with the incontinence, such as encouraging the patient to wear protective clothing or devices, carry a urinal in the car, or pace fluid intake to allow access to toilet facilities during the day. Elderly people without cardiovascular or renal dysfunction should be reminded to drink adequate fluids.

\section*{Medical Management}

When planning the correction of fluid loss for the patient with FVD, the health care provider considers the usual maintenance requirements of the patient and other factors (such as fever) that can influence fluid needs. When the deficit is not severe, the oral route is preferred, provided the patient can drink. When fluid losses are acute or severe, however, the IV route is required. Isotonic electrolyte solutions (eg, lactated Ringer's or $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride) are frequently used to treat the hypotensive patient with FVD because they expand plasma volume. As soon as the patient becomes normotensive, a hypotonic electrolyte solution (eg, 0.45\% sodium chloride) is often used to provide both electrolytes and water for renal excretion of metabolic wastes. These and additional fluids are listed in Table 14-5.

Accurate and frequent assessments of intake and output, weight, vital signs, central venous pressure, level of consciousness, breath sounds, and skin color should be performed to determine when therapy should be slowed to avoid volume overload. The rate of fluid administration is based on the severity of loss and the patient's hemodynamic response to volume replacement.

If the patient with severe FVD is not excreting enough urine and is therefore oliguric, the health care provider needs to determine whether the depressed renal function is the result of reduced renal blood flow secondary to FVD (prerenal azotemia) or, more seriously, to acute tubular necrosis from prolonged FVD. The test used in this situation is referred to as a fluid challenge test. During a fluid challenge test, volumes of fluid are administered at specific rates and intervals while the patient's hemodynamic response to this treatment is monitored (ie, vital signs, breath sounds, sensorium, central venous pressure, urine output).

A typical example of a fluid challenge involves administering 100 to 200 mL of normal saline solution over 15 minutes. The goal is to provide fluids rapidly enough to attain adequate tissue perfusion without compromising the cardiovascular system. The response by a patient with FVD but normal renal function will be increased urine output and an increase in blood pressure and central venous pressure.

Shock can occur when the volume of fluid lost exceeds $25 \%$ of the intravascular volume, or when fluid loss is rapid. Shock and its causes and treatment are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.

\section*{Nursing Management}

To assess for FVD, the nurse monitors and measures fluid intake and output at least every 8 hours, and sometimes hourly. As FVD develops, body fluid losses exceed fluid intake. This loss may be in the form of excessive urination (polyuria), diarrhea, vomiting, and so on. Later, after FVD fully develops, the kidneys attempt to conserve needed body fluids, leading to a urine output of less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ in an adult. Urine in this instance is concentrated and represents a healthy renal response. Daily body weights are monitored; an acute loss of $0.5 \mathrm{~kg}(1 \mathrm{lb})$ represents a fluid loss of approximately 500 mL . (One liter of fluid weighs approximately 1 kg , or 2.2 lb .)

Vital signs are closely monitored. The nurse observes for a weak, rapid pulse and postural hypotension (ie, a drop in systolic pressure exceeding 15 mm Hg when the patient moves from a lying to a sitting position). A decrease in body temperature often accompanies FVD, unless there is a concurrent infection.

Skin and tongue turgor is monitored on a regular basis. In a healthy person, pinched skin immediately returns to its normal position when released. This elastic property, referred to as turgor, is partially dependent on interstitial fluid volume. In a person with FVD, the skin flattens more slowly after the pinch is released. When FVD is severe, the skin may remain elevated for many seconds. Tissue turgor is best measured by pinching the skin over the sternum, inner aspects of the thighs, or forehead.

NURSING ALERT The skin turgor test is not as valid in elderly people as in younger people because skin elasticity decreases with age; therefore, other assessment parameters must be considered.

Evaluating tongue turgor, which is not affected by age, may be more valid than evaluating skin turgor. In a normal person, the tongue has one longitudinal furrow. In the person with FVD, there are additional longitudinal furrows and the tongue is smaller, because of fluid loss. The degree of oral mucous membrane moisture is also assessed; a dry mouth may indicate either FVD or mouth breathing.

Urinary concentration is monitored by measuring the urine specific gravity. In a volume-depleted patient, the urinary specific gravity should be above 1.020, indicating healthy renal conservation of fluid.

Mental function is eventually affected in severe FVD as a result of decreasing cerebral perfusion. Decreased peripheral perfusion can result in cold extremities. In patients with relatively normal cardiopulmonary function, a low central venous pressure is indicative of hypovolemia. Patients with acute cardiopulmonary decompensation require more extensive hemodynamic monitoring of pressures in both sides of the heart to determine if hypovolemia exists.

\section*{PREVENTING FVD}

To prevent FVD, the nurse identifies patients at risk and takes measures to minimize fluid losses. For example, if the patient has diarrhea, diarrhea control measures should be implemented and replacement fluids administered. These measures may include administering antidiarrheal medications and small volumes of oral fluids at frequent intervals.

\section*{CORRECTING FVD}

When possible, oral fluids are administered to help correct FVD, with consideration given to the patient's likes and dislikes. Also, the type of fluid the patient has lost is considered, and attempts are made to select fluids most likely to replace the lost electrolytes. If the patient is reluctant to drink because of oral discomfort, the nurse assists with frequent mouth care and provides nonirritating fluids. The patient may be offered small volumes of fluids at frequent intervals rather than a large volume all at once. If nausea is present, antiemetics may be needed before oral fluid replacement can be tolerated.

If the patient cannot eat and drink, the nurse may need to administer fluid by an alternative route (enteral or parenteral) prescribed to prevent renal damage related to prolonged FVD.

\section*{FLUID VOLUME EXCESS (HYPERVOLEMIA)}

Fluid volume excess (FVE) refers to an isotonic expansion of the ECF caused by the abnormal retention of water and sodium in approximately the same proportions in which they normally exist in the ECF. It is always secondary to an increase in the total body sodium content, which, in turn, leads to an increase in total body water. Because there is isotonic retention of body substances, the serum sodium concentration remains essentially normal.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

FVE may be related to simple fluid overload or diminished function of the homeostatic mechanisms responsible for regulating fluid balance. Contributing factors can include heart failure, renal failure, and cirrhosis of the liver. Another contributing factor is consumption of excessive amounts of table or other sodium salts. Excessive administration of sodium-containing fluids in a patient with impaired regulatory mechanisms may predispose him or her to a serious FVE as well (Beck, 2000).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations of FVE stem from expansion of the ECF and include edema, distended neck veins, and crackles (abnormal lung sounds). Other manifestations include tachycardia; increased blood pressure, pulse pressure, and central venous pressure; increased weight; increased urine output; and shortness of breath and wheezing.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Laboratory data useful in diagnosing FVE include BUN and hematocrit levels. In FVE, both of these values may be decreased because of plasma dilution. Other causes for abnormalities in these values include low protein intake and anemia. In chronic renal failure, both serum osmolality and the sodium level are decreased due to excessive retention of water. The urine sodium level is increased if the kidneys are attempting to excrete excess volume. Chest x-rays may reveal pulmonary congestion. Hypervolemia occurs when aldosterone is chronically stimulated (ie, cirrhosis, heart failure, and nephrotic syndrome). Urine sodium levels, therefore, will not rise in these conditions.

\section*{Medical Management}

Management of FVE is directed at the causes. When the fluid excess is related to excessive administration of sodium-containing fluids, discontinuing the infusion may be all that is needed. Symptomatic treatment consists of administering diuretics and restricting fluids and sodium.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Diuretics are prescribed when dietary restriction of sodium alone is insufficient to reduce edema by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and water by the kidneys. The choice of diuretic is based on the severity of the hypervolemic state, the degree of impairment of renal function, and the potency of the diuretic. Thiazide diuretics block sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, where only 5\% to 10\% of filtered sodium is reabsorbed. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix), bumetanide (Bumex), or torsemide (Demadex), can cause a greater loss of both sodium and water because they block sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of
the loop of Henle, where $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of filtered sodium is normally reabsorbed. Generally, thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL), trichlormethiazide (Diurese), and methyclothiazide (Enduron), are prescribed for mild to moderate hypervolemia and loop diuretics for severe hypervolemia.

Electrolyte imbalances may result from the effect of the diuretic. Hypokalemia can occur with all diuretics except those that work in the last distal tubule of the nephrons (eg, spironolactone). Potassium supplements can be prescribed to avoid this complication. Hyperkalemia can occur with diuretics that work in the last distal tubule, especially in patients with decreased renal function. Hyponatremia occurs with diuresis due to increased release of ADH secondary to reduction in circulating volume. Decreased magnesium levels occur with administration of loop and thiazide diuretics due to decreased reabsorption and increased excretion of magnesium by the kidney.

Azotemia (increased nitrogen levels in the blood) can occur with FVE when urea and creatinine are not excreted due to decreased perfusion by the kidneys and decreased excretion of wastes. High uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) can also occur from increased reabsorption and decreased excretion of uric acid by the kidneys.

\section*{HEMODIALYSIS}

When renal function is so severely impaired that pharmacologic agents cannot act efficiently, other modalities are considered to remove sodium and fluid from the body. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be used to remove nitrogenous wastes and control potassium and acid-base balance, and to remove sodium and fluid. Continuous renal replacement therapy may also be considered. See Chapter 44 for discussion of these treatment modalities.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

Treatment of FVE usually involves dietary restriction of sodium. An average daily diet not restricted in sodium contains 6 to 15 g of salt, whereas low-sodium diets can range from a mild restriction to as little as 250 mg of sodium per day, depending on the patient's needs. A mild sodium-restricted diet allows only light salting of food (about half the amount as usual) in cooking and at the table, and no addition of salt to commercially prepared foods that are already seasoned. Of course, foods high in sodium must be avoided. It is the sodium salt, sodium chloride, rather than sodium itself that contributes to edema. Therefore, patients need to read food labels carefully to determine salt content.

Because about half of ingested sodium is in the form of seasoning, seasoning substitutes can play a major role in decreasing sodium intake. Lemon juice, onions, and garlic are excellent substitute flavorings, although some patients prefer salt substitutes. Most salt substitutes contain potassium and must therefore be used cautiously by patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride). They should not be used at all in conditions associated with potassium retention, such as advanced renal disease. Salt substitutes containing ammonium chloride can be harmful to patients with liver damage.

In some communities, the drinking water may contain too much sodium for a sodium-restricted diet. Depending on its source, water may contain as little as 1 mg or more than $1,500 \mathrm{mg}$ per quart. Patients may need to use distilled water when the local water supply is very high in sodium. Also, patients on sodium-restricted diets should be cautioned to avoid water softeners that add sodium to water in exchange for other ions, such as calcium.

\section*{Nursing Management}

To assess for FVE, the nurse measures intake and output at regular intervals to identify excessive fluid retention. The patient is weighed daily and acute weight gain is noted. An acute weight gain of 0.9 kg (about 2 lb ) represents a gain of approximately 1 L of fluid. The nurse also needs to assess breath sounds at regular intervals in at-risk patients, particularly when parenteral fluids are being administered. The nurse monitors the degree of edema in the most dependent parts of the body, such as the feet and ankles in ambulatory patients and the sacral region in bedridden patients. The degree of pitting edema is assessed, and the extent of peripheral edema is monitored by measuring the circumference of the extremity with a tape marked in millimeters.

\section*{PREVENTING FVE}

Specific interventions vary somewhat with the underlying condition and the degree of FVE. Most patients, however, require sodium-restricted diets in some form, and adherence to the prescribed diet is encouraged. The patient is instructed to avoid over-the-counter medications without first checking with a health care provider because these substances may contain sodium. When fluid retention persists despite adherence to a prescribed diet, hidden sources of sodium, such as the water supply or use of water softeners, should be considered.

\section*{DETECTING AND CONTROLLING FVE}

Detecting FVE is of primary importance before the condition becomes critical. Interventions include promoting rest, restricting sodium intake, monitoring parenteral fluid therapy, and administering appropriate medications.

Some patients benefit from regular rest periods, as bed rest favors diuresis of edema fluid. The mechanism is probably related to diminished venous pooling and the subsequent increase in effective circulating blood volume and renal perfusion. Sodium and fluid restriction should be instituted as indicated. Because most patients with FVE require diuretics, the patient's response to these agents is monitored. The rate of parenteral fluids and the patient's response to these fluids are also closely monitored. If dyspnea or orthopnea is present, the patient is placed in a semi-Fowler's position to promote lung expansion. The patient is turned and positioned at regular intervals because edematous tissue is more prone to skin breakdown than normal tissue.

Because conditions predisposing to FVE are likely to be chronic, the patient is taught to monitor his or her response to therapy by documenting fluid intake and output and body weight changes. The importance of adhering to the treatment regimen is emphasized.

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS ABOUT EDEMA}

Because edema is a common manifestation of FVE, patients need to recognize its symptoms and importance. The nurse gives special attention to edema when teaching patients with FVE. Edema can occur from increased capillary fluid pressure, decreased capillary oncotic pressure, or increased interstitial oncotic pressure, thus expanding the interstitial fluid compartment. Edema can be localized (eg, in the ankle, as in rheumatoid arthritis) or generalized (as in cardiac and renal failure). Severe generalized edema is called anasarca.

Edema occurs when there is a change in the capillary membrane, increasing the formation of interstitial fluid or decreasing the removal of interstitial fluid. Sodium retention is a frequent cause of the increased extracellular fluid volume. Burns and infec-
tion are examples of conditions associated with increased interstitial fluid volume. Obstruction to lymphatic outflow, a plasma albumin level less than 1.5 to $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, or a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure contributes to increased interstitial fluid volume. The kidneys retain sodium and water when there is decreased extracellular volume as a result of decreased cardiac output from heart failure. A thorough medication history is necessary to identify any medications that may cause edema, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), estrogens, corticosteroids, or antihypertensives.

Ascites is a form of edema in which fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity; it results from nephrotic syndrome or cirrhosis. Patients commonly report shortness of breath and a sense of pressure because of pressure on the diaphragm.

Edema usually affects dependent areas. It can be seen in the ankles, sacrum, scrotum, or the periorbital region of the face. Pitting edema is so named because a pit forms after a finger is pressed into edematous tissue. In pulmonary edema, the amount of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and the alveoli increases. Manifestations include shortness of breath, increased respiratory rate, diaphoresis, and crackles and wheezing on auscultation of the lungs.

Decreased hematocrit resulting from hemodilution, arterial blood gas results indicative of respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia, and decreased serum sodium and osmolality from retention of fluid may occur with edema. BUN and creatinine levels increase, urine specific gravity decreases as the kidneys attempt to excrete excess water, and the urine sodium level drops due to increased aldosterone production.

The goal of treatment is to preserve or restore the circulating intravascular fluid volume. In addition to treating the cause, other treatments may include diuretic therapy, restriction of fluids and sodium, elevation of the extremities, application of elastic compression stockings, paracentesis, dialysis, or continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration in cases of renal failure or life-threatening fluid volume overload.

\section*{Electrolyte Imbalances}

Disturbances in electrolyte balances occur in clinical practice and must be corrected for the patient's health and safety. Table 14-6 summarizes the major fluid and electrolyte imbalances that are described in the text. An example of an electrolyte imbalance is an altered sodium balance.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF SODIUM}

Sodium is the most abundant electrolyte in the ECF; its concentration ranges from 135 to $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $135-145 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Consequently, sodium is the primary determinant of ECF osmolality. Decreased sodium is associated with parallel changes in osmolality. The fact that sodium does not easily cross the cell wall membrane, plus its abundance or high concentration, accounts for its primary role in controlling water distribution throughout the body. In addition, sodium is the primary regulator of ECF volume. A loss or gain of sodium is usually accompanied by a loss or gain of water. Sodium also functions in establishing the electrochemical state necessary for muscle contraction and the transmission of nerve impulses.

Sodium imbalance occurs frequently in clinical practice and can develop under simple and complex circumstances. Sodium deficit and excess are the two most common sodium imbalances.

\section*{SODIUM DEFICIT (HYPONATREMIA)}

Hyponatremia refers to a serum sodium level that is below normal (less than $135 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ [ $135 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ]). Plasma sodium concentration represents the ratio of total body sodium to total body water. A decrease in this ratio can occur from a low quantity of total body sodium with a lesser reduction in total body water, normal total body sodium content with excess total body water, and an excess of total body sodium with an even greater excess of total body water. However, a hyponatremic state can be superimposed on an existing FVD or FVE.

Sodium may be lost by way of vomiting, diarrhea, fistulas, or sweating, or it may be associated with the use of diuretics, particularly in combination with a low-salt diet. A deficiency of aldosterone, as occurs in adrenal insufficiency, also predisposes the patient to sodium deficiency.

\section*{Dilutional Hyponatremia}

In water intoxication (dilutional hyponatremia), the patient's serum sodium level is diluted by an increase in the ratio of water to sodium. This causes water to move into the cell, so that the patient develops an ECF volume excess. Predisposing conditions for this type of hyponatremia include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), hyperglycemia, and increased water intake through the administration of electrolyte-poor par-
enteral fluids, the use of tap-water enemas, or the irrigation of nasogastric tubes with water instead of normal saline solution.

Water may be gained abnormally by the excessive parenteral administration of dextrose and water solutions, particularly during periods of stress. It may also be gained by compulsive water drinking (psychogenic polydipsia).

\section*{SIADH}

The basic physiologic disturbances in SIADH are excessive ADH activity, with water retention and dilutional hyponatremia, and inappropriate urinary excretion of sodium in the presence of hyponatremia. SIADH can be the result of either sustained secretion of ADH by the hypothalamus or production of an ADHlike substance from a tumor (aberrant ADH production).

Conditions associated with SIADH include oat-cell lung tumors, head injuries, endocrine and pulmonary disorders, physiologic or psychological stress, and the use of medications such as oxytocin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, thioridazine, and amitriptyline. SIADH is discussed in more detail in Chapter 42.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia depend on the cause, magnitude, and speed with which the deficit occurs. Poor skin turgor, dry mucosa, decreased saliva production, orthostatic fall in blood
pressure, nausea, and abdominal cramping occur. Neurologic changes, including altered mental status, are probably related to the cellular swelling and cerebral edema associated with hyponatremia. As the extracellular sodium level decreases, the cellular fluid becomes relatively more concentrated and pulls water into the cells (Fig. 14-4). In general, patients with an acute decrease in serum sodium levels have more severe symptoms and higher mortality rates than do those with more slowly developing hyponatremia.

Features of hyponatremia associated with sodium loss and water gain include anorexia, muscle cramps, and a feeling of exhaustion. When the serum sodium level drops below $115 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $115 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), signs of increasing intracranial pressure, such as lethargy, confusion, muscle twitching, focal weakness, hemiparesis, papilledema, and seizures, may occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Regardless of the cause of hyponatremia, the serum sodium level is less than $135 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$; in SIADH it may be quite low, such as $100 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(100 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or less. Serum osmolality is also decreased, except in azotemia or ingestion of toxins. When hyponatremia is due primarily to sodium loss, the urinary sodium content is less than $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(20 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$, suggesting increased proximal reabsorption of sodium secondary to ECF volume depletion; the specific gravity is low, such as 1.002 to 1.004 . When hyponatremia is due to SIADH, however, the urinary sodium content is greater than $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ and the urine specific gravity is usually over 1.012. Although the patient with SIADH retains water abnormally and thus gains body weight, there is no peripheral edema; instead, fluid accumulates inside the cells. This phenomenon is sometimes manifested as "fingerprinting" when the finger is pressed over a bony prominence, such as the sternum.

\section*{Medical Management}

The key to treating hyponatremia is assessment; this includes the speed with which hyponatremia occurred rather than relying only on the patient's actual serum sodium value (Fall, 2000).

\end{figure}

\section*{SODIUM REPLACEMENT}

The obvious treatment for hyponatremia is careful administration of sodium by mouth, nasogastric tube, or the parenteral route. For patients who can eat and drink, sodium is easily replaced, because sodium is consumed abundantly in a normal diet. For those who cannot consume sodium, lactated Ringer's solution or isotonic saline ( $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride) solution may be prescribed. Serum sodium must not be increased by greater than $12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ in 24 hours, to avoid neurologic damage due to osmotic demyelination. This condition may occur when the serum sodium concentration is overcorrected (above $140 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) too rapidly or in the presence of hypoxia or anoxia (Pirzanda \& Imran, 2001). It may produce lesions in the pons that cause paraparesis, dysarthria, dysphagia, and coma. Table 14-5 describes the components of selected water and electrolyte solutions. The usual daily sodium requirement in adults is approximately 100 mEq , provided there are no abnormal losses.

In SIADH, the administration of hypertonic saline solution alone cannot change the plasma sodium concentration. Excess sodium would be excreted rapidly in a highly concentrated urine. With the addition of the diuretic furosemide (Lasix), urine is not concentrated and isotonic urine is excreted to effect a change in water balance. In patients with SIADH, in whom water restriction is difficult, lithium or demeclocycline can antagonize the osmotic effect of ADH on the medullary collecting tubule.

\section*{WATER RESTRICTION}

In a patient with normal or excess fluid volume, hyponatremia is treated by restricting fluid to a total of 800 mL in 24 hours. This is far safer than sodium administration and is usually effective. When neurologic symptoms are present, however, it may be necessary to administer small volumes of a hypertonic sodium solution, such as 3\% or 5\% sodium chloride. Incorrect use of these fluids is extremely dangerous because 1 L of $3 \%$ sodium chloride solution contains 513 mEq of sodium, and 1 L of $5 \%$ sodium chloride solution contains 855 mEq of sodium. If edema exists alone, sodium is restricted; if edema and hyponatremia occur together, both sodium and water are restricted.

> NURSING ALERT Highly hypertonic sodium solutions (3 $\%$ and 5\% sodium chloride) should be administered only in intensive care settings under close observation, because only small volumes are needed to elevate the serum sodium level from a dangerously low value. These fluids are administered slowly and in small volumes, and the patient is monitored closely for fluid overload. The purpose is to relieve acute manifestations of cerebral edema and to prevent neurologic complications rather than to correct the sodium concentration specifically. Along with the sodium solution, the patient may receive a loop diuretic to prevent ECF volume overload and to increase water excretion.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse needs to identify patients at risk for hyponatremia so that they can be monitored. Early detection and treatment of this disorder are necessary to prevent serious consequences. For patients at risk, the nurse monitors fluid intake and output as well as daily body weights. Abnormal losses of sodium or gains of water are noted. GI manifestations, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping, are also noted. The nurse must be particularly alert for central nervous system changes, such as lethargy, confusion, muscle twitching, and seizures. In
general, more severe neurologic signs are associated with very low sodium levels that have fallen rapidly because of fluid overloading. Serum sodium levels are monitored very closely in patients at risk for hyponatremia; when indicated, urinary sodium levels and specific gravity are also monitored.

Hyponatremia is a frequently overlooked cause of confusion in elderly patients. The elderly are at increased risk for hyponatremia because of changes in renal function and subsequent decreased ability to excrete excessive water loads. Administration of medications causing sodium loss or water retention is a predisposing factor.

\section*{DETECTING AND CONTROLLING HYPONATREMIA}

For patients experiencing abnormal losses of sodium who can consume a general diet, the nurse encourages foods and fluids with a high sodium content. For example, broth made with one beef cube contains approximately 900 mg of sodium; 8 oz of tomato juice contains approximately 700 mg of sodium. The nurse also needs to be familiar with the sodium content of parenteral fluids (see Table 14-5).

> NURSING ALERT When administering fluids to patients with cardiovascular disease, the nurse assesses for signs of circulatory overload (eg, cough, dyspnea, puffy eyelids, dependent edema, or weight gain in 24 hours). The lungs are auscultated for crackles. Extreme care is taken when administering highly hypertonic sodium (eg, 3\% or 5\% sodium chloride) fluids, because these fluids can be lethal if infused carelessly.

For patients taking lithium, the nurse observes for lithium toxicity, particularly when sodium is lost by an abnormal route. In such instances, supplemental salt and fluid are administered. Because diuretics promote sodium loss, patients taking lithium are instructed not to use diuretics without close medical supervision. For all patients on lithium therapy, adequate salt intake should be ensured.

Excess water supplements are avoided in patients receiving isotonic or hypotonic enteral feedings, particularly if abnormal sodium loss occurs or water is being abnormally retained (as in SIADH). Actual fluid needs are determined by evaluating fluid intake and output, urine specific gravity, and serum sodium levels.

\section*{RETURNING SODIUM LEVEL TO NORMAL}

When the primary problem is water retention, it is safer to restrict fluid intake than to administer sodium. Administering sodium to a patient with normovolemia or hypervolemia predisposes the patient to fluid volume overload. As stated previously, the nurse must monitor patients with cardiovascular disease very closely.

In severe hyponatremia, the aim of therapy is to elevate the serum sodium level only enough to alleviate neurologic signs and symptoms. It is generally recommended that the serum sodium concentration be raised no higher than $125 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(125 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ with a hypertonic saline solution.

\section*{SODIUM EXCESS (HYPERNATREMIA)}

Hypernatremia is a higher-than-normal serum sodium level (exceeding $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ [ $145 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ]) (Adrogue \& Madias, 2000a). It can be caused by a gain of sodium in excess of water or by a loss of water in excess of sodium. It can occur in patients with normal fluid volume or in those with FVD or FVE. With a water loss, the patient loses more water than sodium; as a result, the serum
sodium concentration increases and the increased concentration pulls fluid out of the cell. This is both an extracellular and intracellular FVD. In sodium excess, the patient ingests or retains more sodium than water.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

A common cause of hypernatremia is fluid deprivation in unconscious patients who cannot perceive, respond to, or communicate their thirst (Adrogue \& Madias, 2000a). Most often affected in this regard are very old, very young, and cognitively impaired patients. Administration of hypertonic enteral feedings without adequate water supplements leads to hypernatremia, as does watery diarrhea and greatly increased insensible water loss (eg, hyperventilation, denuding effects of burns).

Diabetes insipidus, a deficiency of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland, leads to hypernatremia if the patient does not experience, or cannot respond to, thirst or if fluids are excessively restricted. Less common causes are heat stroke, near-drowning in sea water (which contains a sodium concentration of approximately $500 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ), and malfunction of either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis proportioning systems. IV administration of hypertonic saline or excessive use of sodium bicarbonate also causes hypernatremia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical manifestations of hypernatremia are primarily neurologic and are presumably the consequence of cellular dehydration (Adrogue \& Madias, 2000a). Hypernatremia results in a relatively concentrated ECF, causing water to be pulled from the cells (see Fig. 14-4). Clinically, these changes may be manifested by restlessness and weakness in moderate hypernatremia and by disorientation, delusions, and hallucinations in severe hypernatremia. Dehydration (resulting in hypernatremia) is often overlooked as the primary reason for behavioral changes in the elderly patient. If hypernatremia is severe, permanent brain damage can occur (especially in children). Brain damage is apparently due to subarachnoid hemorrhages that result from brain contraction.

A primary characteristic of hypernatremia is thirst. Thirst is so strong a defender of serum sodium levels in healthy people that hypernatremia never occurs unless the person is unconscious or is denied access to water. Unfortunately, ill people may have an impaired thirst mechanism. Other signs include a dry, swollen tongue and sticky mucous membranes. Flushed skin, peripheral and pulmonary edema, postural hypotension, and increased muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes are additional signs and symptoms of hypernatremia. Body temperature may rise mildly but returns to normal when the hypernatremia is corrected.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In hypernatremia, the serum sodium level exceeds $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $145 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and the serum osmolality exceeds $295 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$ ( $295 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). The urine specific gravity and urine osmolality are increased as the kidneys attempt to conserve water (provided the water loss is from a route other than the kidneys) (Fall, 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

Hypernatremia treatment consists of a gradual lowering of the serum sodium level by the infusion of a hypotonic electrolyte solution (eg, $0.3 \%$ sodium chloride) or an isotonic nonsaline solution
(eg, dextrose $5 \%$ in water $\left[\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}\right]$ ). $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$ is indicated when water needs to be replaced without sodium. Many clinicians consider a hypotonic sodium solution to be safer than $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$ because it allows a gradual reduction in the serum sodium level and thereby decreases the risk of cerebral edema. It is the solution of choice in severe hyperglycemia with hypernatremia. A rapid reduction in the serum sodium level temporarily decreases the plasma osmolality below that of the fluid in the brain tissue, causing dangerous cerebral edema. Diuretics also may be prescribed to treat the sodium gain.

There is no consensus about the exact rate at which serum sodium levels should be reduced. As a general rule, the serum sodium level is reduced at a rate no faster than 0.5 to $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ to allow sufficient time for readjustment through diffusion across fluid compartments. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) may be prescribed to treat diabetes insipidus if it is the cause of hypernatremia.

\section*{Nursing Management}

As in hyponatremia, fluid losses and gains are carefully monitored in patients at risk for hypernatremia. The nurse should assess for abnormal losses of water or low water intake and for large gains of sodium, as might occur with ingestion of over-the-counter medications with a high sodium content (such as Alka-Seltzer). Also, it is important to obtain a medication history because some prescription medications have a high sodium content. In addition, the nurse notes the patient's thirst or elevated body temperature and evaluates it in relation to other clinical signs. The nurse monitors for changes in behavior, such as restlessness, disorientation, and lethargy.

\section*{PREVENTING HYPERNATREMIA}

The nurse attempts to prevent hypernatremia by offering fluids at regular intervals, particularly in debilitated patients unable to perceive or respond to thirst. If fluid intake remains inadequate, the nurse consults with the physician to plan an alternate route for intake, either by enteral feedings or by the parenteral route. If enteral feedings are used, sufficient water should be administered to keep the serum sodium and BUN within normal limits. As a rule, the higher the osmolality of the enteral feeding, the greater the need for water supplementation.

For patients with diabetes insipidus, adequate water intake must be ensured. If the patient is alert and has an intact thirst mechanism, merely providing access to water may be sufficient. If the patient has a decreased level of consciousness or other disability interfering with adequate fluid intake, parenteral fluid replacement may be prescribed. This therapy can be anticipated in patients with neurologic disorders, particularly in the early postoperative period.

\section*{CORRECTING HYPERNATREMIA}

When parenteral fluids are necessary for managing hypernatremia, the nurse monitors the patient's response to the fluids by reviewing serial serum sodium levels and by observing for changes in neurologic signs. With a gradual decrease in the serum sodium level, the neurologic signs should improve. As stated in the discussion on management, too-rapid reduction in the serum sodium level renders the plasma temporarily hypo-osmotic to the fluid in the brain tissue, causing movement of fluid into brain cells and dangerous cerebral edema (Adrogue \& Madias, 2000a).

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF POTASSIUM}

Potassium is the major intracellular electrolyte; in fact, $98 \%$ of the body's potassium is inside the cells. The remaining $2 \%$ is in the ECF, and it is this $2 \%$ that is important in neuromuscular function. Potassium influences both skeletal and cardiac muscle activity. For example, alterations in its concentration change myocardial irritability and rhythm. Under the influence of the sodiumpotassium pump and based on the body's needs, potassium is constantly moving in and out of cells. The normal serum potassium concentration ranges from 3.5 to $5.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(3.5-5.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$, and even minor variations are significant. Potassium imbalances are commonly associated with various diseases, injuries, medications (diuretics, laxatives, antibiotics), and special treatments, such as parenteral nutrition and chemotherapy (Cohn et al., 2000).

To maintain potassium balance, the renal system must function because $80 \%$ of the potassium is excreted daily from the body by way of the kidneys; the other $20 \%$ is lost through the bowel and in sweat. The kidneys are the primary regulators of potassium balance and accomplish this by adjusting the amount of potassium that is excreted in the urine. As serum potassium levels increase, so does the potassium level in the renal tubular cell. A concentration gradient occurs, favoring the movement of potassium into the renal tubule with the loss of potassium in the urine. Aldosterone also increases the excretion of potassium by the kidney. Because the kidneys do not conserve potassium as well as they conserve sodium, potassium may still be lost in urine in the presence of a potassium deficit.

\section*{POTASSIUM DEFICIT (HYPOKALEMIA)}

Hypokalemia (below-normal serum potassium concentration) usually indicates an actual deficit in total potassium stores. Hypokalemia may occur in patients with normal potassium stores; however, when alkalosis is present, a temporary shift of serum potassium into the cells occurs (see discussion of alkalosis later in this chapter).

As stated earlier, hypokalemia is a common imbalance (Gennari, 1998). GI loss of potassium is probably the most common cause of potassium depletion. Vomiting and gastric suction frequently lead to hypokalemia, partly because potassium is actually lost when gastric fluid is lost, but more so because potassium is lost through the kidneys in association with metabolic alkalosis. Because relatively large amounts of potassium are contained in intestinal fluids, potassium deficit occurs frequently with diarrhea. Intestinal fluid may contain as much potassium as $30 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Potassium deficit also occurs from prolonged intestinal suctioning, recent ileostomy, and villous adenoma (a tumor of the intestinal tract characterized by excretion of potassiumrich mucus).

Alterations in acid-base balance have a significant effect on potassium distribution. The mechanism involves shifts of hydrogen and potassium ions between the cells and the ECF. Hypokalemia can cause alkalosis, and in turn alkalosis can cause hypokalemia. For example, hydrogen ions move out of the cells in alkalotic states to help correct the high pH , and potassium ions move in to maintain an electrically neutral state. (This is discussed further in the section on acid-base balance.)

Hyperaldosteronism increases renal potassium wasting and can lead to severe potassium depletion. Primary hyperaldosteronism is seen in patients with adrenal adenomas. Secondary hyperaldosteronism occurs in patients with cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, and malignant hypertension (Wilcox, 1999).

Potassium-losing diuretics, such as the thiazides (eg, chlorothiazide [Diuril] and polythiazide [Renese]), can induce hypokalemia, particularly when administered in large doses to patients with inadequate potassium intake. Other medications that can lead to hypokalemia include corticosteroids, sodium penicillin, carbenicillin, and amphotericin B (Cohn et al., 2000; Gennari, 1998).

Because insulin promotes the entry of potassium into skeletal muscle and hepatic cells, patients with persistent insulin hypersecretion may experience hypokalemia, which is often the case in patients receiving high-carbohydrate parenteral fluids (as in parenteral nutrition).

Patients who are unable or unwilling to eat a normal diet for a prolonged period are at risk for hypokalemia. This may occur in debilitated elderly people, alcoholics, and patients with anorexia nervosa. In addition to poor intake, people with bulimia frequently suffer increased potassium loss through self-induced vomiting and laxative and diuretic abuse.

Magnesium depletion causes renal potassium loss and must be corrected first; otherwise, urine loss of potassium will continue. Penicillins may produce renal potassium loss by acting as poorly reabsorbable anions and thus increasing distal sodium delivery and sodium-potassium loss.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Potassium deficiency can result in widespread derangements in physiologic function. Severe hypokalemia can cause death through cardiac or respiratory arrest. Clinical signs rarely develop before the serum potassium level has fallen below $3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ unless the rate of fall has been rapid. Manifestations of hypokalemia include fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, leg cramps, decreased bowel motility, paresthesias (numbness and tingling), dysrhythmias, and increased sensitivity to digitalis (Gennari, 1998). If prolonged, hypokalemia can lead to an inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, causing dilute urine (resulting in polyuria, nocturia) and excessive thirst. Potassium depletion depresses the release of insulin and results in glucose intolerance.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

In hypokalemia, the serum potassium concentration is less than the lower limit of normal. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes can include flat T waves and/or inverted T waves, suggesting ischemia, and depressed ST segments (Fig. 14-5). An elevated U wave is specific to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia increases sensitivity to digitalis, predisposing the patient to digitalis toxicity at lower digitalis levels. Metabolic alkalosis is commonly associated with hypokalemia. This is discussed further in the section on acid-base disturbances.

The source of the potassium loss is usually evident from a careful history. When this is not the case, however, and the etiology of the loss is unclear, a 24-hour urinary potassium excretion test can be performed to distinguish between renal and extrarenal loss. Urinary potassium excretion exceeding $20 \mathrm{mEq} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$ with hypokalemia suggests that renal potassium loss is the cause.

\section*{Medical Management}

If hypokalemia cannot be prevented by conventional measures such as increased intake in the daily diet, it is treated with oral or IV replacement therapy (Gennari, 1998). Potassium loss must be corrected daily; administration of 40 to $80 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day of potas-

sium is adequate in the adult if there are no abnormal losses of potassium.

For patients at risk for hypokalemia, a diet containing sufficient potassium should be provided. Dietary intake of potassium in the average adult is 50 to $100 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day. Foods high in potassium include fruits (especially raisins, bananas, apricots, and oranges), vegetables, legumes, whole grains, milk, and meat.

When dietary intake is inadequate for any reason, the physician may prescribe oral or IV potassium supplements (Gennari, 1998). Many salt substitutes contain 50 to 60 mEq of potassium per teaspoon and may be sufficient to prevent hypokalemia.

1NURSING ALERT Oral potassium supplements can produce small bowel lesions; therefore, the patient must be assessed for and cautioned about abdominal distention, pain, or GI bleeding.

When oral administration of potassium is not feasible, the IV route is indicated. The IV route is mandatory for patients with severe hypokalemia (eg, a serum level of $2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Although
potassium chloride is usually used to correct potassium deficits, the physician may prescribe potassium acetate or potassium phosphate.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Because hypokalemia can be life-threatening, the nurse needs to monitor for its early presence in patients at risk. Fatigue, anorexia, muscle weakness, decreased bowel motility, paresthesias, and dysrhythmias are signals that warrant assessing the serum potassium concentration. When available, the ECG may provide useful information. For example, patients receiving digitalis who are at risk for potassium deficiency should be monitored closely for signs of digitalis toxicity, because hypokalemia potentiates the action of digitalis. Physicians usually prefer to keep the serum potassium level above $3.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $3.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) in patients receiving digitalis medications such as digoxin.

\section*{PREVENTING HYPOKALEMIA}

Measures are taken to prevent hypokalemia when possible (Gennari, 1998). Prevention may involve encouraging the patient at risk to eat foods rich in potassium (when the diet allows). Sources of potassium include fruit and fruit juices (bananas, melon, citrus fruit), fresh and frozen vegetables, fresh meats, and processed foods. When hypokalemia is due to abuse of laxatives or diuretics, patient education may help alleviate the problem. Part of the health history and assessment should be directed at identifying problems amenable to prevention through education. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary because 40 mEq of potassium is lost for every liter of urine output. The ECG is monitored for changes, and arterial blood gas values are checked for elevated bicarbonate and pH levels.

\section*{CORRECTING HYPOKALEMIA}

Great care should be exercised when administering potassium, particularly in older adults, who have lower lean body mass and total body potassium levels and therefore lower potassium requirements. Additionally, with the physiologic loss of renal function with advancing years, potassium may be retained more readily in older than in younger people.

\section*{ADMINISTERING IV POTASSIUM}

Potassium should be administered only after adequate urine flow has been established. A decrease in urine volume to less than $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ for 2 consecutive hours is an indication to stop the potassium infusion until the situation is evaluated. Potassium is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, when oliguria occurs, potassium administration can cause the serum potassium concentration to rise dangerously.

NURSING ALERT Potassium is never administered IV push or intramuscularly. IV potassium must be administered using an infusion pump to avoid replacing potassium too quickly.

Each health care facility has its own standard of care, which should be consulted; however, IV potassium should not be administered faster than $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{h}$ or in concentrations greater than 30 to $40 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ unless hypokalemia is severe, because this can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. When prepared for IV infusions, the fluid should be agitated well to prevent bolus doses that can result when the potassium concentrates at the bottom of the IV container.

NURSING ALERT Stocking premixed $100-\mathrm{mL}$ minibags of 20 mEq KCl is a safe alternative to adding a vial of KCl to an IV bag. The KCl must be well distributed to prevent it from pooling at the insertion site at the bottom of the bag and causing a lifethreatening elevation of the serum potassium level.

When potassium is administered through a peripheral vein, the rate of administration must be decreased to avoid irritating the vein and causing a burning sensation during administration. In general, concentrations greater than $60 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ are not administered in peripheral veins because venous pain and sclerosis may occur. For routine maintenance needs, potassium is suitably diluted and administered at a rate no faster than $10 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{h}$. In critical situations, more concentrated solutions (such as $40 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) may be administered through a central line. Even in extreme hypokalemia, however, potassium should be administered no faster than 20 to $40 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{h}$ (suitably diluted). In such a situation, the patient must be monitored by ECG and observed closely for other signs and symptoms, such as changes in muscle strength.

\section*{POTASSIUM EXCESS (HYPERKALEMIA)}

Hyperkalemia (greater-than-normal serum potassium concentration) seldom occurs in patients with normal renal function. Like hypokalemia, hyperkalemia is often due to iatrogenic (treatmentinduced) causes. Although less common than hypokalemia, hyperkalemia is usually more dangerous because cardiac arrest is more frequently associated with high serum potassium levels.

A variation of hyperkalemia, pseudohyperkalemia has a number of causes The most common causes are the use of a tight tourniquet around an exercising extremity while drawing a blood sample and hemolysis of the sample before analysis. Other causes include marked leukocytosis (white blood cell count exceeding $200,000)$ or thrombocytosis (platelet count exceeding 1 million), drawing blood above a site where potassium is infusing, and familial pseudohyperkalemia, where potassium leaks out of the red blood cells while the blood is awaiting analysis. Failure to be aware of these causes of pseudohyperkalemia can lead to aggressive treatment of a nonexistent hyperkalemia, resulting in serious lowering of serum potassium levels. Thus, measurements of grossly elevated levels should be verified.

The major cause of hyperkalemia is decreased renal excretion of potassium. Thus, significant hyperkalemia is commonly seen in patients with untreated renal failure, particularly those in whom potassium levels rise as a result of infection or excessive intake of potassium in food or medications. In addition, patients with hypoaldosteronism and Addison's disease are at risk for hyperkalemia because these conditions are characterized by deficient adrenal hormones, leading to sodium loss and potassium retention.

Medications have been identified as a probable contributing factor in more than $60 \%$ of hyperkalemic episodes. Medications commonly implicated are potassium chloride, heparin, ACE inhibitors, captopril, NSAIDs, and potassium-sparing diuretics. In most such cases, potassium regulation is compromised by renal insufficiency (Perazella, 2000).

Although a high intake of potassium can cause severe hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalemia rarely occurs in people with normal renal function. For all patients, however, improper use of potassium supplements predisposes them to hyperkalemia, especially when salt substitutes are used. Not all patients receiving potassium-losing diuretics re-
quire potassium supplements, and patients receiving potassiumconserving diuretics should not receive supplements.

> NURSING ALERT Potassium supplements are extremely dangerous when patients have impaired renal function and thus decreased ability to excrete potassium. Even more dangerous is the IV administration of potassium to such patients, as serum levels can rise very quickly. Aged (stored) blood should not be administered to patients with impaired renal function because the serum potassium concentration of stored blood increases as the storage time increases, a result of red blood cell deterioration. It is possible to exceed the renal tolerance of any patient with rapid IV potassium administration, as well as when large amounts of oral potassium supplements are ingested.

In acidosis, potassium moves out of the cells into the ECF. This occurs as hydrogen ions enter the cells, a process that buffers the pH of the ECF (acidosis is discussed later in this chapter). An elevated extracellular potassium level should be anticipated when extensive tissue trauma has occurred, as in burns, crushing injuries, or severe infections. Similarly, it can occur with lysis of malignant cells after chemotherapy.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The most important consequence of hyperkalemia is its effect on the myocardium. Cardiac effects of an elevated serum potassium level are usually not significant below a concentration of $7 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} (7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$, but they are almost always present when the level is $8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or greater. As the plasma potassium level rises, disturbances in cardiac conduction occur. The earliest changes, often occurring at a serum potassium level greater than $6 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} (6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$, are peaked, narrow T waves; ST-segment depression; and a shortened QT interval. If the serum potassium level continues to rise, the PR interval becomes prolonged and is followed by disappearance of the P waves. Finally, there is decomposition and prolongation of the QRS complex (see Fig. 14-5). Ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest may occur at any point in this progression.

Severe hyperkalemia causes skeletal muscle weakness and even paralysis, related to a depolarization block in muscle. Similarly, ventricular conduction is slowed. Although hyperkalemia has marked effects on the peripheral nervous system, it has little effect on the central nervous system. Rapidly ascending muscular weakness leading to flaccid quadriplegia has been reported in patients with very high serum potassium levels. Paralysis of respiratory and speech muscles can also occur. Additionally, GI manifestations, such as nausea, intermittent intestinal colic, and diarrhea, may occur in hyperkalemic patients.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Serum potassium levels and ECG changes are crucial to the diagnosis of hyperkalemia, as discussed above. Arterial blood gas analysis may reveal metabolic acidosis; in many cases, hyperkalemia occurs with acidosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

An immediate ECG should be obtained to detect changes. Shortened repolarization and peaked T waves are seen initially. It is prudent as well to obtain a repeat serum potassium level
from a vein without an IV infusion containing potassium to verify results.

In nonacute situations, restriction of dietary potassium and potassium-containing medications may suffice. For example, eliminating the use of potassium-containing salt substitutes in the patient taking a potassium-conserving diuretic may be all that is needed to deal with mild hyperkalemia.

Prevention of serious hyperkalemia by the administration, either orally or by retention enema, of cation exchange resins (eg, Kayexalate) may be necessary in patients with renal impairment. Cation exchange resins cannot be used if the patient has a paralytic ileus because intestinal perforation can occur. Kayexalate can bind with other cations in the GI tract and contribute to the development of hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia; it may also cause sodium retention and fluid overload (Karch, 2002).

\section*{EMERGENCY PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

When serum potassium levels are dangerously elevated, it may be necessary to administer IV calcium gluconate. Within minutes after administration, calcium antagonizes the action of hyperkalemia on the heart. Infusion of calcium does not reduce the serum potassium concentration but immediately antagonizes the adverse cardiac conduction abnormalities. Calcium chloride and calcium gluconate are not interchangeable: calcium gluconate contains 4.5 mEq of calcium and calcium chloride contains 13.6 mEq of calcium; therefore, caution must be used.

Monitoring the blood pressure is essential to detect hypotension, which may result from the rapid IV administration of calcium gluconate. The ECG should be continuously monitored during administration; the appearance of bradycardia is an indication to stop the infusion. The myocardial protective effects of calcium are transient, lasting about 30 minutes. Extra caution is required if the patient has been "digitalized" (received accelerated dosages of a digitalis-based cardiac glycoside to reach a desired serum digitalis level rapidly) because parenteral administration of calcium sensitizes the heart to digitalis and may precipitate digitalis toxicity.

IV administration of sodium bicarbonate may be necessary to alkalinize the plasma and cause a temporary shift of potassium into the cells. Also, sodium bicarbonate furnishes sodium to antagonize the cardiac effects of potassium. Effects of this therapy begin within 30 to 60 minutes and may persist for hours; however, they are temporary.

IV administration of regular insulin and a hypertonic dextrose solution causes a temporary shift of potassium into the cells. Glucose and insulin therapy has an onset of action within 30 minutes and lasts for several hours.

Beta-2 agonists also move potassium into the cells and may be used in the absence of ischemic cardiac disease. These stopgap measures only temporarily protect the patient from hyperkalemia. If the hyperkalemic condition is not transient, actual removal of potassium from the body is required; this may be accomplished by using cation exchange resins, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients at risk for potassium excess, for example those with renal failure, should be identified so they can be monitored closely for signs of hyperkalemia. The nurse observes for signs of muscle weakness and dysrhythmias. The presence of paresthesias is noted, as are GI symptoms such as nausea and intestinal colic. For patients at risk, serum potassium levels are measured periodically.

Elevated serum potassium levels may be erroneous; thus, highly abnormal levels should always be verified. To avoid false reports of hyperkalemia, prolonged use of a tourniquet while drawing the blood sample is avoided, and the patient is cautioned not to exercise the extremity immediately before the blood sample is obtained. The blood sample is delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible, because hemolysis of the sample results in a falsely elevated serum potassium level.

\section*{PREVENTING HYPERKALEMIA}

Measures are taken to prevent hyperkalemia in patients at risk, when possible, by encouraging the patient to adhere to the prescribed potassium restriction. Potassium-rich foods to be avoided include coffee, cocoa, tea, dried fruits, dried beans, and wholegrain breads. Milk and eggs also contain substantial amounts of potassium. Conversely, foods with minimal potassium content include butter, margarine, cranberry juice or sauce, ginger ale, gumdrops or jellybeans, hard candy, root beer, sugar, and honey.

\section*{CORRECTING HYPERKALEMIA}

As stated earlier, it is possible to exceed the tolerance for potassium in any person if it is administered rapidly by the IV route. Therefore, great care should be taken to monitor potassium solutions closely, paying close attention to the solution's concentration and rate of administration. When potassium is added to parenteral solutions, the potassium is mixed with the fluid by inverting the bottle several times. Potassium chloride should never be added to a hanging bottle because the potassium might be administered as a bolus (potassium chloride is heavy and settles to the bottom of the container).

It is important to caution patients to use salt substitutes sparingly if they are taking other supplementary forms of potassium or potassium-conserving diuretics. Also, potassium-conserving diuretics, such as spironolactone (Aldactone), triamterene (Dyrenium), and amiloride (Midamor); potassium supplements; and salt substitutes should not be administered to patients with renal dysfunction. Most salt substitutes contain approximately $50-60 \mathrm{mEq}$ of potassium per teaspoon.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF CALCIUM}

More than $99 \%$ of the body's calcium is located in the skeletal system; it is a major component of bones and teeth. About $1 \%$ of skeletal calcium is rapidly exchangeable with blood calcium; the rest is more stable and only slowly exchanged. The small amount of calcium located outside the bone circulates in the serum, partly bound to protein and partly ionized. Calcium plays a major role in transmitting nerve impulses and helps to regulate muscle contraction and relaxation, including cardiac muscle. Calcium is instrumental in activating enzymes that stimulate many essential chemical reactions in the body, and it also plays a role in blood coagulation. Because many factors affect calcium regulation, both hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia are relatively common disturbances.

The normal total serum calcium level is 8.5 to $10.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $2.1-2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). It exists in plasma in three forms: ionized, bound, and complexed. About $50 \%$ of the serum calcium exists in an ionized form that is physiologically active and important for neuromuscular activity and blood coagulation. The normal ionized serum calcium level is 4.5 to $5.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(1.1-1.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ and is the only form that is physiologically and clinically significant. Less than half of the plasma calcium is bound to serum proteins, primarily albumin. The remainder is combined with nonprotein anions: phosphate, citrate, and carbonate.

Calcium is absorbed from foods in the presence of normal gastric acidity and vitamin D. Calcium is excreted primarily in the feces, the remainder in urine. The serum calcium level is controlled by PTH and calcitonin. As ionized serum calcium decreases, the parathyroid glands secrete PTH. This event then increases calcium absorption from the GI tract, increases calcium reabsorption from the renal tubule, and releases calcium from the bone. The increase in calcium ion concentration suppresses PTH secretion. When calcium increases excessively, the thyroid gland secretes calcitonin. It briefly inhibits calcium reabsorption from bone and decreases the serum calcium concentration.

\section*{CALCIUM DEFICIT (HYPOCALCEMIA)}

Hypocalcemia (lower-than-normal serum concentration of calcium) occurs in a variety of clinical situations. A patient may have a total body calcium deficit (as in osteoporosis) but a normal serum calcium level. Elderly people with osteoporosis, who spend an increased amount of time in bed, are at increased risk for hypocalcemia as bed rest increases bone resorption.

Several factors can cause hypocalcemia. Primary hypoparathyroidism results in this disturbance, as does surgical hypoparathyroidism. The latter is far more common. Not only is hypocalcemia associated with thyroid and parathyroid surgery, but it can also occur after radical neck dissection and is most likely in the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery. Transient hypocalcemia can occur with massive administration of citrated blood (as in exchange transfusions in newborns), because citrate can combine with ionized calcium and temporarily remove it from the circulation.

Inflammation of the pancreas causes the breakdown of proteins and lipids. It is thought that calcium ions combine with the fatty acids released by lipolysis, forming soaps. As a result of this process, hypocalcemia occurs and is common in pancreatitis. It has also been suggested that hypocalcemia might be related to excessive secretion of glucagon from the inflamed pancreas, resulting in increased secretion of calcitonin (a hormone that lowers serum calcium).

Hypocalcemia is common in patients with renal failure because these patients frequently have elevated serum phosphate levels. Hyperphosphatemia usually causes a reciprocal drop in the serum calcium level. Other causes of hypocalcemia include inadequate vitamin D consumption, magnesium deficiency, medullary thyroid carcinoma, low serum albumin levels, alkalosis, and alcohol abuse. Medications predisposing to hypocalcemia include aluminum-containing antacids, aminoglycosides, caffeine, cisplatin, corticosteroids, mithramycin, phosphates, isoniazid, and loop diuretics.

Osteoporosis is associated with prolonged low intake of calcium and represents a total body calcium deficit, even though serum calcium levels are usually normal. This disorder occurs in millions of Americans and is most common in postmenopausal women. It is characterized by loss of bone mass, causing bones to become porous and brittle and therefore susceptible to fracture. See Chapter 68 for further discussion of osteoporosis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Tetany is the most characteristic manifestation of hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Tetany refers to the entire symptom complex induced by increased neural excitability. These symptoms are due to spontaneous discharges of both sensory and motor fibers in peripheral nerves. Sensations of tingling may occur in the

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
tips of the fingers, around the mouth, and less commonly in the feet. Spasms of the muscles of the extremities and face may occur. Pain may develop as a result of these spasms.

Trousseau's sign (Fig. 14-6) can be elicited by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm to about 20 mm Hg above systolic pressure; within 2 to 5 minutes, carpopedal spasm (an adducted thumb, flexed wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints, extended interphalangeal joints with fingers together) will occur as ischemia of the ulnar nerve develops. Chvostek's sign consists of twitching of muscles supplied by the facial nerve when the nerve is tapped about 2 cm anterior to the earlobe, just below the zygomatic arch.

Seizures may occur because hypocalcemia increases irritability of the central nervous system as well as of the peripheral nerves. Other changes associated with hypocalcemia include mental changes such as depression, impaired memory, confusion, delirium, and even hallucinations. A prolonged QT interval is seen on the ECG due to prolongation of the ST segment; a form of ventricular tachycardia called torsades de pointes may occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

When evaluating serum calcium levels, one must consider several other variables, such as the serum albumin level and arterial pH . Because abnormalities in serum albumin levels may affect interpretation of the serum calcium level, it may be necessary to calculate the corrected serum calcium if the serum albumin level is abnormal. For every decrease in serum albumin of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ below $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, the total serum calcium level is underestimated by approximately $0.8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The following is a quick method to calculate the corrected serum calcium level:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Measured total serum } \mathrm{Ca}^{++} \text {level }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})+0.8 \\
& \times(4.0-\text { measured albumin level }[\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}]) \\
& =\text { corrected total calcium concentration }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})

An example of the calculations needed to obtain the corrected total serum calcium level is as follows:

A patient's reported serum albumin level is $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$; the reported serum calcium level is $10.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.
- The decrease in serum albumin level from normal level (difference from normal albumin of $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) is calculated: $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}-2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}=1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$
- The following ratio is calculated:
$0.8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}: 1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}=? \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}: 1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
? $=0.8 \mathrm{mg} \times 1.5$
? $=1.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ calcium
- Add 1.2 to 10.5 mg (reported serum calcium level) to obtain the corrected total serum calcium level of $11.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. $1.2+10.5 \mathrm{mg}=11.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$

Clinicians often ignore a low serum calcium level in the presence of a similarly low serum albumin level. The ionized calcium level is usually normal in patients with reduced total serum calcium levels and concomitant hypoalbuminemia. When the arterial pH increases (alkalosis), more calcium becomes bound to protein. As a result, the ionized portion decreases. Symptoms of hypocalcemia may occur with alkalosis. Acidosis (low pH) has the opposite effect-that is, less calcium is bound to protein and thus more exists in the ionized form. However, relatively small changes in serum calcium levels occur in these acid-base abnormalities.

Ideally, the laboratory should measure the ionized level of calcium. In many laboratories, however, only the total calcium level is reported; thus, concentration of the ionized fraction must be estimated by simultaneous measurement of the serum albumin level. PTH levels are decreased in hypoparathyroidism. Magnesium and phosphorus levels need to be assessed to identify possible causes of decreased calcium.

\section*{Medical Management}

Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia is life-threatening and requires prompt treatment with IV administration of calcium (Marx, 2000). Parenteral calcium salts include calcium gluconate, calcium chloride, and calcium gluceptate. Although calcium chloride produces a significantly higher ionized calcium level than calcium gluconate, it is not used as often because it is more irritating and can cause sloughing of tissue if it infiltrates. Too-rapid IV administration of calcium can cause cardiac arrest, preceded by bradycardia. IV calcium administration is particularly dangerous in patients receiving digitalis-derived medications because calcium ions exert an effect similar to that of digitalis and can cause digitalis toxicity, with adverse cardiac effects. IV calcium should be diluted in $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$ and given as a slow IV bolus or a slow IV infusion using a volumetric infusion pump. The IV site must be observed often for any evidence of infiltration because of the risk for sloughing of tissues with calcium infusions. A $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride solution should not be used with calcium because it will increase renal calcium loss. Solutions containing phosphates or bicarbonate should not be used with calcium because they will cause precipitation when calcium is added. The nurse must clarify with the physician which calcium salt to administer, because calcium gluconate yields 4.5 mEq of calcium and calcium chloride provides 13.6 mEq of calcium. Calcium can cause postural hypotension; therefore, the patient is kept in bed for IV replacement and blood pressure is monitored.

Vitamin D therapy may be instituted to increase calcium absorption from the GI tract. Aluminum hydroxide, calcium acetate, or calcium carbonate antacids may be prescribed to decrease elevated phosphorus levels before treating hypocalcemia for the patient with chronic renal failure. Increasing the dietary intake of calcium to at least 1,000 to $1,500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day in the adult is recommended (eg, milk products; green, leafy vegetables; canned salmon; sardines; fresh oysters). Because hypomagnesemia can also cause tetany, if the tetany responds to IV calcium, then a low magnesium level is explored as a possible cause in chronic renal failure.

\section*{Nursing Management}

It is important to observe for hypocalcemia in patients at risk. Seizure precautions are initiated when hypocalcemia is severe. The status of the airway is closely monitored because laryngeal stridor can occur. Safety precautions are taken, as indicated, if confusion is present.

People at high risk for osteoporosis are instructed about the need for adequate dietary calcium intake; if not consumed in the diet, calcium supplements should be considered. Also, the value of regular weight-bearing exercise in decreasing bone loss should be emphasized, as should the effect of medications on calcium balance. For example, alcohol and caffeine in high doses inhibit calcium absorption, and moderate cigarette smoking increases urinary calcium excretion. Additional teaching topics may involve discussion of medications such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), and calcitonin to reduce the rate of bone loss. Teaching also addresses strategies to reduce risk for falls.

\section*{CALCIUM EXCESS (HYPERCALCEMIA)}

Hypercalcemia (excess of calcium in the plasma) is a dangerous imbalance when severe; in fact, hypercalcemic crisis has a mortality rate as high as $50 \%$ if not treated promptly.

The most common causes of hypercalcemia are malignancies and hyperparathyroidism. Malignant tumors can produce hypercalcemia by a variety of mechanisms. The excessive PTH secretion associated with hyperparathyroidism causes increased release of calcium from the bones and increased intestinal and renal absorption of calcium. Calcifications of soft tissue occur when the calcium-phosphorus product exceeds 70 (serum calcium [mg/dL] $\times$ serum phosphorus [mg/dL]) (Marx, 2000).

Bone mineral is lost during immobilization, sometimes causing elevation of total (and especially ionized) calcium in the bloodstream. Symptomatic hypercalcemia from immobilization, however, is rare; when it does occur, it is virtually limited to people with high calcium turnover rates (eg, adolescents during a growth spurt). Most cases of hypercalcemia secondary to immobility occur after severe or multiple fractures or spinal cord injury.

Thiazide diuretics may cause a slight elevation in serum calcium levels because they potentiate the action of PTH on the kidneys, reducing urinary calcium excretion. The milk-alkali syndrome can occur in patients with peptic ulcer treated for a prolonged period with milk and alkaline antacids, particularly calcium carbonate. Vitamin A and D intoxication, as well as the use of lithium, can cause calcium excess.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

As a rule, the symptoms of hypercalcemia are proportional to the degree of elevation of the serum calcium level. Hypercalcemia reduces neuromuscular excitability because it suppresses activity at the myoneural junction. Symptoms such as muscle weakness, incoordination, anorexia, and constipation may be due to decreased tone in smooth and striated muscle. Cardiac standstill can occur when the serum calcium level is about $18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(4.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. The inotropic effect of digitalis is enhanced by calcium; therefore, digitalis toxicity is aggravated by hypercalcemia.

Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation are common symptoms of hypercalcemia. Dehydration occurs with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and calcium reabsorption at the proximal renal tubule. Abdominal and bone pain may also be present. Ab-
dominal distention and paralytic ileus may complicate severe hypercalcemic crisis. Excessive urination due to disturbed renal tubular function produced by hypercalcemia may be present. Severe thirst may occur secondary to the polyuria caused by the high solute (calcium) load. Patients with chronic hypercalcemia may develop symptoms similar to those of peptic ulcer because hypercalcemia increases the secretion of acid and pepsin by the stomach.

Confusion, impaired memory, slurred speech, lethargy, acute psychotic behavior, or coma may occur. The more severe symptoms tend to appear when the serum calcium level is approximately $16 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or above. However, some patients become profoundly disturbed with serum calcium levels of only $12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. These symptoms resolve as serum calcium levels return to normal after treatment.

Hypercalcemic crisis refers to an acute rise in the serum calcium level to $17 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $4.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or higher. Severe thirst and polyuria are characteristically present. Other findings may include muscle weakness, intractable nausea, abdominal cramps, obstipation (very severe constipation) or diarrhea, peptic ulcer symptoms, and bone pain. Lethargy, confusion, and coma may also occur. This condition is very dangerous and may result in cardiac arrest.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The serum calcium level is greater than $10.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. Cardiovascular changes may include a variety of dysrhythmias and shortening of the QT interval and ST segment. The PR interval is sometimes prolonged. The double-antibody PTH test may be used to differentiate between primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy as a cause of hypercalcemia: PTH levels are increased in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism and suppressed in malignancy. X-rays may reveal the presence of osteoporosis, bone cavitation, or urinary calculi. The Sulkowitch urine test analyzes the amount of calcium in the urine; in hypercalcemia, dense precipitation is observed due to hypercalciuria.

\section*{Medical Management}

Therapeutic aims in hypercalcemia include decreasing the serum calcium level and reversing the process causing hypercalcemia. Treating the underlying cause (eg, chemotherapy for a malignancy or partial parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism) is essential.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

General measures include administering fluids to dilute serum calcium and promote its excretion by the kidneys, mobilizing the patient, and restricting dietary calcium intake. IV administration of $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride solution temporarily dilutes the serum calcium level and increases urinary calcium excretion by inhibiting tubular reabsorption of calcium. Administering IV phosphate can cause a reciprocal drop in serum calcium. Furosemide (Lasix) is often used in conjunction with administration of a saline solution; in addition to causing diuresis, furosemide increases calcium excretion.

Calcitonin can be used to lower the serum calcium level and is particularly useful for patients with heart disease or renal failure who cannot tolerate large sodium loads. Calcitonin reduces bone resorption, increases the deposit of calcium and phosphorus in the bones, and increases urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus. Although available in several forms, calcitonin derived
from salmon is commonly used. Skin testing for allergy to salmon calcitonin is necessary before the hormone is administered. Systemic allergic reactions are possible since this hormone is a protein; resistance to the medication may develop later because of antibody formation. Calcitonin is administered by intramuscular injection rather than subcutaneously because patients with hypercalcemia have poor perfusion of subcutaneous tissue.

For patients with cancer, treatment is directed at controlling the condition by surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Corticosteroids may be used to decrease bone turnover and tubular reabsorption for patients with sarcoidosis, myelomas, lymphomas, and leukemias; patients with solid tumors are less responsive. The bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity. Pamidronate (Aredia) is the most potent of these agents and is given IV; it causes a transient, mild pyrexia, decreased white blood cell count, and myalgia. Etidronate (Didronel) is another bisphosphonate that is given IV, but its action is slower. Mithramycin, a cytotoxic antibiotic, inhibits bone resorption and thus lowers the serum calcium level. This agent must be used cautiously because it has significant side effects, including thrombocytopenia, nephrotoxicity, rebound hypercalcemia when discontinued, and hepatotoxicity. Inorganic phosphate salts can be administered orally or by nasogastric tube (in the form of Phospho-Soda or Neutra-Phos), rectally (as retention enemas), or IV. IV phosphate therapy is used with extreme caution in the treatment of hypercalcemia because it can cause severe calcification in various tissues, hypotension, tetany, and acute renal failure.

\section*{Nursing Management}

It is important to monitor for hypercalcemia in patients at risk. Interventions such as increasing patient mobility and encouraging fluids can help prevent hypercalcemia, or at least minimize its severity. Hospitalized patients at risk for hypercalcemia are encouraged to ambulate as soon as possible; outpatients and those cared for in their homes are informed of the importance of frequent ambulation.

When encouraging oral fluids, the nurse considers the patient's likes and dislikes. Fluids containing sodium should be administered unless contraindicated by other conditions, because sodium favors calcium excretion. Patients are encouraged to drink 3 to 4 quarts of fluid daily. Adequate fiber should be provided in the diet to offset the tendency for constipation. Safety precautions are taken, as necessary, when mental symptoms of hypercalcemia are present. The patient and family are informed that these mental changes are reversible with treatment. Increased calcium potentiates the effects of digitalis; therefore, the patient is assessed for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. ECG changes (premature ventricular contractions, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and heart block) can occur; therefore, the cardiac rate and rhythm are monitored for any abnormalities.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF MAGNESIUM}

Next to potassium, magnesium is the most abundant intracellular cation. It acts as an activator for many intracellular enzyme systems and plays a role in both carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Magnesium balance is important in neuromuscular function. Because magnesium acts directly on the myoneural junction, variations in the serum concentration of magnesium affect neuromuscular irritability and contractility. For example, an excess of magnesium diminishes the excitability of the muscle cells, whereas a deficit increases neuromuscular irritability and contractility.

Magnesium produces its sedative effect at the neuromuscular junction, probably by inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It also increases the stimulus threshold in nerve fibers.

Magnesium exerts effects on the cardiovascular system, acting peripherally to produce vasodilation. Magnesium is thought to have a direct effect on peripheral arteries and arterioles, which results in a decreased total peripheral resistance. Magnesium disorders include hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia.

\section*{MAGNESIUM DEFICIT (HYPOMAGNESEMIA)}

Hypomagnesemia refers to a below-normal serum magnesium concentration. The normal serum magnesium level is 1.5 to $2.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (or $1.8-3.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} ; 0.8-1.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Approximately one third of serum magnesium is bound to protein; the remaining two thirds exists as free cations ( $\mathrm{Mg}^{++}$). Like calcium, it is the ionized fraction that is primarily involved in neuromuscular activity and other physiologic processes. As with calcium levels, magnesium levels should be evaluated in combination with albumin levels. Low serum albumin levels decrease total magnesium.

Hypomagnesemia is a common yet often overlooked imbalance in acutely and critically ill patients. It may occur with withdrawal from alcohol and administration of tube feedings or parenteral nutrition.

An important route for magnesium loss is the GI tract. Loss of magnesium from the GI tract may occur with nasogastric suction, diarrhea, or fistulas. Because fluid from the lower GI tract has a higher concentration of magnesium ( $10-14 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) than fluid from the upper tract ( $1-2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ), losses from diarrhea and intestinal fistulas are more likely to induce magnesium deficit than are those from gastric suction. Although magnesium losses are relatively small in nasogastric suction, hypomagnesemia will occur if losses are prolonged and magnesium is not replaced through IV infusion. Because the distal small bowel is the major site of magnesium absorption, any disruption in small bowel function, as in intestinal resection or inflammatory bowel disease, can lead to hypomagnesemia.

Alcoholism is currently the most common cause of symptomatic hypomagnesemia in the United States. Hypomagnesemia is particularly troublesome during treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Therefore, the serum magnesium level should be measured at least every 2 or 3 days in patients going through withdrawal from alcohol. The serum magnesium level may be normal on admission but fall as a result of metabolic changes, such as the intracellular shift of magnesium associated with IV glucose administration.

During nutritional repletion, the major cellular electrolytes move from the serum to newly synthesized cells. Thus, if the enteral or parenteral feeding formula is deficient in magnesium content, serious hypomagnesemia will occur. Because of this, serum magnesium levels should be measured at regular intervals in patients who are receiving parenteral nutrition and enteral feedings, especially those who have undergone a period of starvation. Other causes of hypomagnesemia include the administration of aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, cisplatin, diuretics, digitalis, and amphotericin and the rapid administration of citrated blood, especially to patients with renal or hepatic disease. Magnesium deficiency often occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis, secondary to increased renal excretion during osmotic diuresis and shifting of magnesium into the cells with insulin therapy. Other contributing causes are sepsis, burns, and hypothermia.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical manifestations of hypomagnesemia are largely confined to the neuromuscular system. Some of the effects are due directly to the low serum magnesium level; others are due to secondary changes in potassium and calcium metabolism. Symptoms do not usually occur until the serum magnesium level is less than $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $0.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ).

Among the neuromuscular changes are hyperexcitability with muscle weakness, tremors, and athetoid movements (slow, involuntary twisting and writhing). Others include tetany, generalized tonic-clonic or focal seizures, laryngeal stridor, and positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs (see earlier discussion in this chapter), which occur, in part, because of accompanying hypocalcemia.

Magnesium deficiency can disturb the ECG by prolonging the QRS, depressing the ST segment, and predisposing to cardiac dysrhythmias, such as premature ventricular contractions, supraventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes (a form of ventricular tachycardia), and ventricular fibrillation. Increased susceptibility to digitalis toxicity is associated with low serum magnesium levels. This is important because patients receiving digoxin are also likely to be receiving diuretic therapy, predisposing them to renal loss of magnesium.

Hypomagnesemia may be accompanied by marked alterations in mood. Apathy, depression, apprehension, and extreme agitation have been noted, as well as ataxia, dizziness, insomnia, and confusion. At times, delirium, auditory or visual hallucinations, and frank psychoses may occur.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

On laboratory analysis, the serum magnesium level is less than $1.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ or $1.8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $0.75 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Hypomagnesemia is frequently associated with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. About $25 \%$ of magnesium is protein-bound, principally to albumin. A decreased serum albumin level can, therefore, reduce the measured total magnesium concentration; however, it does not reduce the ionized plasma magnesium concentration. ECG evaluations reflect magnesium, calcium, and potassium deficiencies, tachydysrhythmias, prolonged PR and QT intervals, widening QRS, ST segment depression, flattened T waves, and a prominent U wave. Torsades de pointes is associated with a low magnesium level. Premature ventricular contractions, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and heart block may also occur. Urinary magnesium levels may be helpful in identifying causes of magnesium depletion and are measured after a loading dose of magnesium sulfate is administered. Two newer diagnostic techniques (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the ion selective electrode) are sensitive and direct means to measure ionized serum magnesium levels.

\section*{Medical Management}

Mild magnesium deficiency can be corrected by diet alone. Principal dietary sources of magnesium are green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and seafood. Magnesium is also plentiful in peanut butter and chocolate. When necessary, magnesium salts can be administered orally to replace continuous excessive losses. Diarrhea is a common complication of excessive ingestion of magnesium. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition require magnesium in the IV solution to prevent hypomagnesemia. IV administration
of magnesium sulfate must be given by an infusion pump and at a rate not to exceed $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$. A bolus dose of magnesium sulfate given too rapidly can produce cardiac arrest. Vital signs must be assessed frequently during magnesium administration to detect changes in cardiac rate or rhythm, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Monitoring urine output is essential before, during, and after magnesium administration; the physician is notified if urine volume decreases to less than 100 mL over 4 hours. Calcium gluconate must be readily available to treat hypocalcemic tetany or hypermagnesemia.

Overt symptoms of hypomagnesemia are treated with parenteral administration of magnesium. Magnesium sulfate is the most commonly used magnesium salt. Serial magnesium concentrations can be used to regulate the dosage.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse should be aware of patients at risk for hypomagnesemia and observe for its signs and symptoms. Patients receiving digitalis are monitored closely because a deficit of magnesium can predispose them to digitalis toxicity. When hypomagnesemia is severe, seizure precautions are implemented. Other safety precautions are instituted, as indicated, if confusion is observed.

Because difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) may occur in magnesium-depleted patients, the ability to swallow should be tested with water before oral medications or foods are offered. Dysphagia is probably related to the athetoid or choreiform (rapid, involuntary, and irregular jerking) movements associated with magnesium deficit. To determine neuromuscular irritability, the nurse needs to assess and grade deep tendon reflexes (see Chap. 60 for discussion of assessment and grading reflexes).

Teaching plays a major role in treating magnesium deficit, particularly that resulting from abuse of diuretic or laxative medications. In such cases, the nurse can instruct the patient about the need to consume magnesium-rich foods. For patients experiencing hypomagnesemia from abuse of alcohol, the nurse can provide teaching, counseling, support, and possible referral to alcohol abstinence programs or other professional help.

\section*{MAGNESIUM EXCESS (HYPERMAGNESEMIA)}

Hypermagnesemia is a greater-than-normal serum concentration of magnesium. A serum magnesium level can appear falsely elevated when blood specimens are allowed to hemolyze or are drawn from an extremity with a tourniquet that was applied too tightly.

By far the most common cause of hypermagnesemia is renal failure. In fact, most patients with advanced renal failure have at least a slight elevation in serum magnesium levels. This condition is aggravated when such patients receive magnesium to control seizures or inadvertently take one of the many commercial antacids that contain magnesium salts.

Hypermagnesemia can occur in a patient with untreated diabetic ketoacidosis when catabolism causes the release of cellular magnesium that cannot be excreted because of profound fluid volume depletion and resulting oliguria. An excess of magnesium can also result from excessive magnesium administered to treat hypertension of pregnancy and to lower serum magnesium levels. Increased serum magnesium levels can also occur in adrenocortical insufficiency, Addison's disease, or hypothermia. Excessive use of antacids (eg, Maalox, Riopan, Mylanta)
and laxatives (Milk of Magnesia) also increases serum magnesium levels.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Acute elevation of the serum magnesium level depresses the central nervous system as well as the peripheral neuromuscular junction. At mildly elevated levels, there is a tendency for lowered blood pressure because of peripheral vasodilation. Nausea, vomiting, soft tissue calcifications, facial flushing, and sensations of warmth may also occur. At higher magnesium concentrations, lethargy, difficulty speaking (dysarthria), and drowsiness can occur. Deep tendon reflexes are lost, and muscle weakness and paralysis may develop. The respiratory center is depressed when serum magnesium levels exceed $10 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. Coma, atrioventricular heart block, and cardiac arrest can occur when the serum magnesium level is greatly elevated and not treated.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

On laboratory analysis, the serum magnesium level is greater than $2.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ or $3.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $1.25 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). ECG findings may include a prolonged PR interval, tall T waves, and a widened QRS. ECG findings demonstrate a prolonged QT interval and atrioventricular blocks.

\section*{Medical Management}

Hypermagnesemia can be prevented by avoiding the administration of magnesium to patients with renal failure and by carefully monitoring seriously ill patients who are receiving magnesium salts. In patients with severe hypermagnesemia, all parenteral and oral magnesium salts are discontinued. In emergencies, such as respiratory depression or defective cardiac conduction, ventilatory support and IV calcium are indicated. In addition, hemodialysis with a magnesium-free dialysate can reduce the serum magnesium to a safe level within hours. Loop diuretics and $0.45 \%$ sodium chloride (half-strength saline) solution enhance magnesium excretion in patients with adequate renal function. IV calcium gluconate ( 10 mL of a $10 \%$ solution) antagonizes the neuromuscular effects of magnesium.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Patients at risk for hypermagnesemia are identified and assessed. When hypermagnesemia is suspected, the nurse monitors the vital signs, noting hypotension and shallow respirations. The nurse also observes for decreased patellar reflexes and changes in the level of consciousness. Medications that contain magnesium are not given to patients with renal failure or compromised renal function, and patients with renal failure are cautioned to check with their health care providers before taking over-the-counter medications. Caution is essential when preparing and administering magnesiumcontaining fluids parenterally because available parenteral magnesium solutions (eg, $2-\mathrm{mL}$ ampules or $50-\mathrm{mL}$ vials) differ in concentration.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF PHOSPHORUS}

Phosphorus is a critical constituent of all the body's tissues. It is essential to the function of muscle and red blood cells, the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3-diphospho-
glycerate, and the maintenance of acid-base balance, as well as to the nervous system and the intermediary metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The normal serum phosphorus level is 2.5 to $4.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(0.8-1.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ and may be as high as $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $1.94 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) in infants and children. Serum phosphorus levels are presumably greater in children because of the high rate of skeletal growth. Phosphorus is the primary anion of the ICF. About $85 \%$ of phosphorus is located in bones and teeth, $14 \%$ in soft tissue, and less than $1 \%$ in the ECF. Phosphorus is critical to nerve and muscle function and provides structural support to bones and teeth. Phosphorus levels decrease with age.

\section*{PHOSPHORUS DEFICIT (HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA)}

Hypophosphatemia is a below-normal serum concentration of inorganic phosphorus. Although it often indicates phosphorus deficiency, hypophosphatemia may occur under a variety of circumstances in which total body phosphorus stores are normal. Conversely, phosphorus deficiency is an abnormally low content of phosphorus in lean tissues and may exist in the absence of hypophosphatemia.

Hypophosphatemia may occur during the administration of calories to patients with severe protein-calorie malnutrition. It is most likely to occur with overzealous intake or administration of simple carbohydrates. This syndrome can be induced in anyone with severe protein-calorie malnutrition (eg, patients with anorexia nervosa or alcoholism, or elderly debilitated patients unable to eat). As many as $50 \%$ of patients hospitalized because of chronic alcoholism have hypophosphatemia.

Marked hypophosphatemia may develop in malnourished patients who receive parenteral nutrition if the phosphorus loss is not adequately corrected. Other causes of hypophosphatemia include prolonged intense hyperventilation, alcohol withdrawal, poor dietary intake, diabetic ketoacidosis, and major thermal burns. Low magnesium levels, low potassium levels, and hyperparathyroidism related to increased urinary losses of phosphorus contribute to hypophosphatemia. Respiratory alkalosis can cause a decrease in phosphorus because of an intracellular shift of phosphorus.

Excess phosphorus binding by antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or albumin may decrease the phosphorus available from the diet to amounts below that required to maintain serum phosphorus balance. The degree of hypophosphatemia depends on the amount of phosphorus in the diet compared to the dose of antacid. Vitamin D regulates intestinal ion absorption; therefore, a deficiency of vitamin D may cause decreased calcium and phosphorus levels, which may lead to osteomalacia (softened, brittle bones).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Most of the signs and symptoms of phosphorus deficiency appear to result from a deficiency of ATP, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, or both. ATP deficiency impairs cellular energy resources; diphosphoglycerate deficiency impairs oxygen delivery to tissues.

A wide range of neurologic symptoms may occur, such as irritability, fatigue, apprehension, weakness, numbness, paresthesias, confusion, seizures, and coma. Low levels of diphosphoglycerate may reduce the delivery of oxygen to peripheral tissues, resulting in tissue anoxia. Hypoxia then leads to an increase in respiratory rate and respiratory alkalosis, causing phosphorus to move into the cells and potentiating hypophosphatemia.

It is thought that hypophosphatemia predisposes a person to infection. In laboratory animals, hypophosphatemia is associated with depression of the chemotactic, phagocytic, and bacterial activity of granulocytes.

Muscle damage may develop as the ATP level in the muscle tissue declines. Clinical manifestations are muscle weakness, muscle pain, and at times acute rhabdomyolysis (disintegration of striated muscle). Weakness of respiratory muscles may greatly impair ventilation. Hypophosphatemia also may predispose a person to insulin resistance and thus hyperglycemia. Chronic loss of phosphorus can cause bruising and bleeding from platelet dysfunction.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

On laboratory analysis, the serum phosphorus level is less than $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(0.80 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ in adults. When reviewing laboratory results, the nurse should keep in mind that glucose or insulin administration causes a slight decrease in the serum phosphorus level. PTH levels are increased in hyperparathyroidism. Serum magnesium may decrease due to increased urinary excretion of magnesium. Alkaline phosphatase is increased with osteoblastic activity. X-rays may show skeletal changes of osteomalacia or rickets.

\section*{Medical Management}

Prevention of hypophosphatemia is the goal. In patients at risk for hypophosphatemia, serum phosphate levels should be closely monitored and correction initiated before deficits become severe. Adequate amounts of phosphorus should be added to parenteral solutions, and attention should be paid to the phosphorus levels in enteral feeding solutions.

Severe hypophosphatemia is dangerous and requires prompt attention. Aggressive IV phosphorus correction is usually limited to patients whose serum phosphorus levels fall below $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $0.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and whose GI tract is not functioning. Possible dangers of IV phosphorus administration include tetany from hypocalcemia and metastatic calcification from hyperphosphatemia. The rate of phosphorus administration should not exceed $10 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{h}$, and the site should be carefully monitored because tissue sloughing and necrosis can occur with infiltration. In less acute situations, oral phosphorus replacement is usually adequate.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse identifies patients at risk for hypophosphatemia and monitors for it. Because malnourished patients receiving parenteral nutrition are at risk when calories are introduced too aggressively, preventive measures involve gradually introducing the solution to avoid rapid shifts of phosphorus into the cells.

For patients with documented hypophosphatemia, careful attention is given to preventing infection because hypophosphatemia may alter the granulocytes. In patients requiring correction of phosphorus losses, the nurse frequently monitors serum phosphorus levels and documents and reports early signs of hypophosphatemia (apprehension, confusion, change in level of consciousness). If the patient experiences mild hypophosphatemia, foods such as milk and milk products, organ meats, nuts, fish, poultry, and whole grains should be encouraged. With moderate hypophosphatemia, supplements such as Neutra Phos capsules ( 250 mg phosphorus/capsule) or Fleets Phospho Soda ( 815 mg phosphorus $/ 5 \mathrm{~mL}$ ) may be prescribed (Metheny, 2000).

\section*{PHOSPHORUS EXCESS (HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA)}

Hyperphosphatemia is a serum phosphorus level that exceeds normal. Various conditions can lead to this imbalance, but the most common is renal failure. Other causes include chemotherapy for neoplastic disease, hypoparathyroidism, respiratory acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis, high phosphate intake, profound muscle necrosis, and increased phosphorus absorption. The primary complication of increased phosphorus is metastatic calcification (soft tissue, joints, and arteries), which results when the calciummagnesium product (calcium $\times$ magnesium) exceeds $70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

An elevated serum phosphorus level causes few symptoms. Symptoms that do occur usually result from decreased calcium levels and soft tissue calcifications. The most important short-term consequence is tetany. Because of the reciprocal relationship between phosphorus and calcium, a high serum phosphorus level tends to cause a low serum calcium concentration. Tetany can result, causing tingling sensations in the fingertips and around the mouth. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, hyperreflexia, and tachycardia may occur.

The major long-term consequence is soft tissue calcification, which occurs mainly in patients with a reduced glomerular filtration rate. High serum levels of inorganic phosphorus promote precipitation of calcium phosphate in nonosseous sites, decreasing urine output, impairing vision, and producing palpitations.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

On laboratory analysis, the serum phosphorus level exceeds $4.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $1.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) in adults. Serum phosphorus levels are normally higher in children, presumably because of the high rate of skeletal growth. The serum calcium level is useful also for diagnosing the primary disorder and assessing the effects of treatments. X-ray studies may show skeletal changes with abnormal bone development. PTH levels are decreased in hypoparathyroidism. BUN and creatinine levels are used to assess renal function.

\section*{Medical Management}

When possible, treatment is directed at the underlying disorder. For example, hyperphosphatemia may be related to volume depletion or respiratory or metabolic acidosis. In renal failure, elevated PTH production contributes to a high phosphorus level and bone disease. Measures to decrease the serum phosphate level in these patients include vitamin D preparations such as calcitol (Rocaltrol, in oral preparation), Calcijex (for IV administration), or paricalcitol (Zemplar). Vitamin D does not increase the serum calcium, thus permitting more aggressive treatment of hyperphosphatemia with calcium-binding antacids, phosphate-binding gels or antacids, restriction of dietary phosphate, and dialysis.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse monitors patients at risk for hyperphosphatemia. When a low-phosphorus diet is prescribed, the patient is instructed to avoid phosphorus-rich foods such as hard cheese, cream, nuts, whole-grain cereals, dried fruits, dried vegetables, kidneys, sardines, sweetbreads, and foods made with milk. When appropriate, the nurse instructs the patient to avoid phosphate-
containing substances such as laxatives and enemas that contain phosphate. The nurse also teaches the patient to recognize the signs of impending hypocalcemia and to monitor for changes in urine output.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF CHLORIDE}

Chloride, the major anion of the ECF, is found more in interstitial and lymph fluid compartments than in blood. Chloride is also contained in gastric and pancreatic juices and sweat. Sodium and chloride in water make up the composition of the ECF and assist in determining osmotic pressure.

The serum level of chloride reflects a change in dilution or concentration of the ECF and does so in direct proportion to sodium. Aldosterone secretion increases sodium reabsorption, thereby increasing chloride reabsorption. The choroid plexus, where cerebrospinal fluid forms in the brain, depends on sodium and chloride to attract water to form the fluid portion of the cerebrospinal fluid. Bicarbonate has an inverse relationship with chloride. As chloride moves from plasma into the red blood cells (called the chloride shift), bicarbonate moves back into the plasma. Hydrogen ions are formed, which then help to release oxygen from hemoglobin. When the level of one of these three electrolytes (sodium, bicarbonate, or chloride) is disturbed, the other two will be affected as well.

\section*{CHLORIDE DEFICIT (HYPOCHLOREMIA)}

Chloride control depends on the intake of chloride and the excretion and reabsorption of its ions in the kidneys. Chloride is produced in the stomach as hydrochloric acid; a small amount of chloride is lost in the feces. Chloride-deficient formulas, saltrestricted diets, GI tube drainage, and severe vomiting and diarrhea are risk factors for hypochloremia. As chloride decreases (usually because of volume depletion), sodium and bicarbonate ions are retained by the kidney to balance the loss. Bicarbonate accumulates in the ECF, which raises the pH and leads to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of hypochloremia are those of acid-base and electrolyte imbalances. The signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis may also be noted. Metabolic alkalosis is a disorder that results in a high pH and a high serum bicarbonate level as a result of excess alkali intake or loss of hydrogen ions. With compensation, the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ increases to 50 mm Hg . Hyperexcitability of muscles, tetany, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, weakness, twitching, and muscle cramps may result. Hypokalemia can cause hypochloremia, resulting in cardiac dysrhythmias. In addition, because low chloride levels parallel low sodium levels, a water excess may occur. Hyponatremia can cause seizures and coma.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The normal serum chloride level is 96 to $106 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(96-106 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. Inside the cell, the chloride level is $4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. In addition to the chloride level, sodium and potassium levels are also evaluated because these electrolytes are lost along with chloride. Arterial blood gas analysis identifies the acid-base imbalance, which is usually metabolic alkalosis. The urine chloride level, which is also measured, decreases in hypochloremia.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment involves correcting the cause of hypochloremia and contributing electrolyte and acid-base imbalances. Normal saline ( $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride) or half-strength saline ( $0.45 \%$ sodium chloride) solution is administered IV to replace the chloride. The physician may reevaluate whether patients receiving diuretics (loop, osmotic, or thiazide) should discontinue these medications or change to another diuretic.

Foods high in chloride are provided; these include tomato juice, salty broth, canned vegetables, processed meats, and fruits. A patient who drinks free water (water without electrolytes) or bottled water will excrete large amounts of chloride; therefore, this kind of water should be avoided. Ammonium chloride, an acidifying agent, may be prescribed to treat metabolic alkalosis; the dosage depends on the patient's weight and serum chloride level. This agent is metabolized by the liver, and its effects last for about 3 days.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse monitors intake and output, arterial blood gas values, and serum electrolyte levels, as well as the patient's level of consciousness and muscle strength and movement. Changes are reported to the physician promptly. Vital signs are monitored and respiratory assessment is carried out frequently. The nurse teaches the patient about foods with high chloride content.

\section*{CHLORIDE EXCESS (HYPERCHLOREMIA)}

Hyperchloremia exists when the serum level exceeds $106 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ( $106 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Hypernatremia, bicarbonate loss, and metabolic acidosis can occur with high chloride levels. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is also known as normal anion gap acidosis (see discussion in Acid-Base Disturbances section of this chapter). It is usually caused by the loss of bicarbonate ions via the kidney or the GI tract with a corresponding increase in chloride ions. Chloride ions in the form of acidifying salts accumulate and acidosis occurs with a decrease in bicarbonate ions.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The signs and symptoms of hyperchloremia are the same as those of metabolic acidosis, hypervolemia, and hypernatremia. Tachypnea; weakness; lethargy; deep, rapid respirations; diminished cognitive ability; and hypertension occur. If untreated, hyperchloremia can lead to a decrease in cardiac output, dysrhythmias, and coma. A high chloride level is accompanied by a high sodium level and fluid retention.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The serum chloride level is $108 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(108 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or greater, the serum sodium level is greater than $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(145 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$, the serum pH is less than 7.35, the serum bicarbonate level is less than $22 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(22 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$, and there is a normal anion gap of 8 to $12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(8-12 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. Urine chloride excretion increases.

Calculation of the serum anion gap is important in analyzing acid-base disorders. The sum of all negatively charged electrolytes (anions) equals the sum of all positively charged electrolytes (cations) with several anions that are not routinely measured leading to an anion gap. It is based primarily on three electrolytes: sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate or serum $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. A low anion
gap may be attributed to hypoproteinemia, while an elevated anion gap can be due to metabolic acidosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Correcting the underlying cause of hyperchloremia and restoring electrolyte, fluid, and acid-base balance are essential. Lactated Ringer's solution may be prescribed to convert lactate to bicarbonate in the liver, which will increase the base bicarbonate level and correct the acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be given IV to increase bicarbonate levels, which leads to the renal excretion of chloride ions as bicarbonate and chloride compete for combination with sodium. Diuretics may be administered to eliminate chloride as well. Sodium, fluids, and chloride are restricted.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Monitoring vital signs, arterial blood gas values, and intake and output is important to assess the patient's status and the effectiveness of treatment. Assessment findings related to respiratory, neurologic, and cardiac systems are documented and changes discussed with the physician. The nurse teaches the patient about the diet that should be followed to manage hyperchloremia.

\section*{Acid-Base Disturbances}

Acid-base disturbances are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Identification of the specific acid-base imbalance is important in identifying the underlying cause of the disorder and in determining appropriate treatment (Kraut \& Madias, 2001).

Plasma pH is an indicator of hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$concentration. Homeostatic mechanisms keep pH within a normal range (7.35-7.45). These mechanisms consist of buffer systems, the kidneys, and the lungs. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration is extremely important: the greater the concentration, the more acidic the solution and the lower the pH . The lower the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, the more alkaline the solution and the higher the pH . The pH range compatible with life (6.8-7.8) represents a tenfold difference in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in plasma.

\section*{BUFFER SYSTEMS}

Buffer systems prevent major changes in the pH of body fluids by removing or releasing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$; they can act quickly to prevent excessive changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. Hydrogen ions are buffered by both intracellular and extracellular buffers. The body's major extracellular buffer system is the bicarbonate-carbonic acid buffer system. This is the system that is assessed when arterial blood gases are measured. Normally, there are 20 parts of bicarbonate ( $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$) to one part of carbonic acid ( $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ). If this ratio is altered, the pH will change. It is the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ that is important in maintaining pH , not absolute values. Carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ is a potential acid; when dissolved in water, it becomes carbonic acid ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}=\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ). Thus, when $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is increased, the carbonic acid content is also increased, and vice versa. If either bicarbonate or carbonic acid is increased or decreased so that the $20: 1$ ratio is no longer maintained, acid-base imbalance results.

Less important buffer systems in the ECF include the inorganic phosphates and the plasma proteins. Intracellular buffers include proteins, organic and inorganic phosphates, and, in red blood cells, hemoglobin.

\section*{Kidneys}

The kidneys regulate the bicarbonate level in the ECF; they can regenerate bicarbonate ions as well as reabsorb them from the renal tubular cells. In respiratory acidosis and most cases of metabolic acidosis, the kidneys excrete hydrogen ions and conserve bicarbonate ions to help restore balance. In respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, the kidneys retain hydrogen ions and excrete bicarbonate ions to help restore balance. The kidneys obviously cannot compensate for the metabolic acidosis created by renal failure. Renal compensation for imbalances is relatively slow (a matter of hours or days).

\section*{Lungs}

The lungs, under the control of the medulla, control the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and thus the carbonic acid content of the ECF. They do so by adjusting ventilation in response to the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood. A rise in the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in arterial blood $\left(\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}\right)$ is a powerful stimulant to respiration. Of course, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood $\left(\mathrm{PaO}_{2}\right)$ also influences respiration. Its effect, however, is not as marked as that produced by the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$.

In metabolic acidosis, the respiratory rate increases, causing greater elimination of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (to reduce the acid load). In metabolic alkalosis, the respiratory rate decreases, causing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to be retained (to increase the acid load).

\section*{ACUTE AND CHRONIC METABOLIC ACIDOSIS (BASE BICARBONATE DEFICIT)}

Metabolic acidosis is a clinical disturbance characterized by a low pH (increased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration) and a low plasma bicarbonate concentration. It can be produced by a gain of hydrogen ion or a loss of bicarbonate (Swenson, 2001). It can be divided clinically into two forms, according to the values of the serum anion gap: high anion gap acidosis and normal anion gap acidosis. The anion gap reflects normally unmeasured anions (phosphates, sulfates, and proteins) in plasma. Measuring the anion gap is essential in analyzing acid-base disorders correctly. The anion gap can be calculated by either one of the following equations:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Anion gap }=\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{K}^{+}-\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right) \\
& \text {Anion gap }=\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Potassium is often omitted from the equation because of its low level in the plasma; thus, the second equation is used more often than the first.

The normal value for an anion gap is 8 to $12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(8-12 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) without potassium in the equation. The normal value for the anion gap if including potassium in the equation is 12 to $16 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(12-16 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. The unmeasured anions in the serum normally account for less than $16 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ of the anion production. An anion gap greater than $16 \mathrm{mEq}(16 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ suggests excessive accumulation of unmeasured anions. An anion gap occurs because not all electrolytes are measured. More anions are left unmeasured than cations.

Normal anion gap acidosis results from the direct loss of bicarbonate, as in diarrhea, lower intestinal fistulas, ureterostomies, and use of diuretics; early renal insufficiency; excessive administration of chloride; and the administration of parenteral nutrition without bicarbonate or bicarbonate-producing solutes (eg, lactate).

Normal anion gap acidosis is also referred to as hyperchloremic acidosis. A reduced or negative anion gap is primarily caused by hypoproteinemia. Disorders that cause a decreased or negative anion gap are rare compared to those related to an increased or high anion gap (Rose \& Post, 2001).

High anion gap acidosis results from excessive accumulation of fixed acid. If it is increased to $30 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(30 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or more, then a high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present regardless of what the pH and the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$are. High ion gap occurs in ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, the late phase of salicylate poisoning, uremia, methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity, and ketoacidosis with starvation. The hydrogen is buffered by $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, causing the bicarbonate concentration to fall. In all of these instances, abnormally high levels of anions flood the system, increasing the anion gap above normal limits.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis vary with the severity of the acidosis. They may include headache, confusion, drowsiness, increased respiratory rate and depth, nausea, and vomiting. Peripheral vasodilation and decreased cardiac output occur when the pH falls below 7. Additional physical assessment findings include decreased blood pressure, cold and clammy skin, dysrhythmias, and shock (Swenson, 2001).

Chronic metabolic acidosis is usually seen with chronic renal failure. The bicarbonate and pH decrease slowly; thus, the patient is asymptomatic until the bicarbonate is approximately $15 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ or less.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Arterial blood gas measurements are valuable in diagnosing metabolic acidosis (Swenson, 2001). Expected blood gas changes include a low bicarbonate level (less than $22 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and a low pH (less than 7.35). The cardinal feature of metabolic acidosis is a decrease in the serum bicarbonate level. Hyperkalemia may accompany metabolic acidosis as a result of the shift of potassium out of the cells. Later, as the acidosis is corrected, potassium moves back into the cells and hypokalemia may occur. Hyperventilation decreases the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level as a compensatory action. As stated previously, calculation of the anion gap is helpful in determining the cause of metabolic acidosis. An ECG will detect dysrhythmias caused by the increased potassium.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment is directed at correcting the metabolic defect (Swenson, 2001). If the problem results from excessive intake of chloride, treatment is aimed at eliminating the source of the chloride. When necessary, bicarbonate is administered if the pH is less than 7.1 and the bicarbonate level is less than 10. Although hyperkalemia occurs with acidosis, hypokalemia may occur with reversal of the acidosis and subsequent movement of potassium back into the cells. Therefore, the serum potassium level is monitored closely and hypokalemia is corrected as acidosis is reversed.

In chronic metabolic acidosis, low serum calcium levels are treated before treating chronic metabolic acidosis to avoid tetany resulting from an increase in pH and a decrease in ionized calcium. Alkalyzing agents may be given if the serum bicarbonate level is less than $12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Treatment modalities may also include hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

\section*{ACUTE AND CHRONIC METABOLIC ALKALOSIS (BASE BICARBONATE EXCESS)}

Metabolic alkalosis is a clinical disturbance characterized by a high pH (decreased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration) and a high plasma bicarbonate concentration. It can be produced by a gain of bicarbonate or a loss of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(Khanna \& Kurtzman, 2001).

Probably the most common cause of metabolic alkalosis is vomiting or gastric suction with loss of hydrogen and chloride ions. The disorder also occurs in pyloric stenosis, in which only gastric fluid is lost. Gastric fluid has an acid pH (usually $1-3$ ); therefore, loss of this highly acidic fluid increases the alkalinity of body fluids. Other situations predisposing to metabolic alkalosis include those associated with loss of potassium, such as diuretic therapy that promotes excretion of potassium (eg, thiazides, furosemide), and excessive adrenocorticoid hormones (as in hyperaldosteronism and Cushing's syndrome).

Hypokalemia produces alkalosis in two ways: (1) the kidneys conserve potassium, and thus $\mathrm{H}^{+}$excretion increases; and (2) cellular potassium moves out of the cells into the ECF in an attempt to maintain near-normal serum levels (as potassium ions leave the cells, hydrogen ions must enter to maintain electroneutrality). Excessive alkali ingestion from antacids containing bicarbonate or from using sodium bicarbonate during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can also cause metabolic alkalosis.

Chronic metabolic alkalosis can occur with long-term diuretic therapy (thiazides or furosemide), villous adenoma, external drainage of gastric fluids, significant potassium depletion, cystic fibrosis, and the chronic ingestion of milk and calcium carbonate.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Alkalosis is primarily manifested by symptoms related to decreased calcium ionization, such as tingling of the fingers and toes, dizziness, and hypertonic muscles. The ionized fraction of serum calcium decreases in alkalosis as more calcium combines with serum proteins. Because it is the ionized fraction of calcium that influences neuromuscular activity, symptoms of hypocalcemia are often the predominant symptoms of alkalosis. Respirations are depressed as a compensatory action by the lungs. Atrial tachycardia may occur. As the pH increases above 7.6 and hypokalemia develops, ventricular disturbances may occur. Decreased motility and paralytic ileus may also occur.

Symptoms of chronic metabolic alkalosis are the same as for acute metabolic alkalosis, and as potassium decreases, frequent premature ventricular contractions or $U$ waves are seen on the ECG.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Evaluation of arterial blood gases reveals a pH greater than 7.45 and a serum bicarbonate concentration greater than $26 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. The $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ increases as the lungs attempt to compensate for the excess bicarbonate by retaining $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. This hypoventilation is more pronounced in semiconscious, unconscious, or debilitated patients than in alert patients. The former may develop marked hypoxemia as a result of hypoventilation. Hypokalemia may accompany metabolic alkalosis.

Urinary chloride levels may help to identify the cause of metabolic alkalosis if the patient's history provides inadequate information. Metabolic alkalosis is the setting in which urine chloride concentration may be a more accurate estimate of volume than is the urine sodium concentration. Urine chloride concentrations
help to differentiate between vomiting or diuretic ingestion or one of the causes of mineralocorticoid excess. Hypovolemia and hypochloremia in patients with vomiting or cystic fibrosis, those receiving nutritional repletion, or those taking diuretics produce urine chloride concentrations less than $25 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Signs of hypovolemia are not present and the urine chloride concentration exceeds $40 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ in patients with mineralocorticoid excess or alkali loading; these patients usually have expanded fluid volume. The urine chloride concentration should be less than $15 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ when decreased chloride levels and hypovolemia occur.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of metabolic alkalosis is aimed at reversing the underlying disorder (Khanna \& Kurtzman, 2001).

Sufficient chloride must be supplied for the kidney to absorb sodium with chloride (allowing the excretion of excess bicarbonate). Treatment also includes restoring normal fluid volume by administering sodium chloride fluids (because continued volume depletion serves to maintain the alkalosis). In patients with hypokalemia, potassium is administered as KCl to replace both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$losses. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), reduce the production of gastric HCl , thereby decreasing the metabolic alkalosis associated with gastric suction. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are useful in treating metabolic alkalosis in patients who cannot tolerate rapid volume expansion (eg, patients with heart failure). Because of volume depletion from GI loss, the patient's fluid intake and output must be monitored carefully. Management of chronic metabolic alkalosis is aimed at correcting the underlying acid-base disorder.

\section*{ACUTE AND CHRONIC RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS (CARBONIC ACID EXCESS)}

Respiratory acidosis is a clinical disorder in which the pH is less than 7.35 and the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is greater than 42 mm Hg . It may be either acute or chronic.

Respiratory acidosis is always due to inadequate excretion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with inadequate ventilation, resulting in elevated plasma $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels and thus elevated carbonic acid ( $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ) levels (Epstein \& Singh, 2001). In addition to an elevated $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, hypoventilation usually causes a decrease in $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$. Acute respiratory acidosis occurs in emergency situations, such as acute pulmonary edema, aspiration of a foreign object, atelectasis, pneumothorax, overdose of sedatives, sleep apnea syndrome, administration of oxygen to a patient with chronic hypercapnia (excessive $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood), severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Respiratory acidosis can also occur in diseases that impair respiratory muscles, such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Mechanical ventilation can be associated with hypercapnia if the rate of effective alveolar ventilation is inadequate. Ventilation is fixed in these patients, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ may be retained if the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production is increased.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical signs in acute and chronic respiratory acidosis vary. Sudden hypercapnia (elevated $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ) can cause increased pulse and respiratory rate, increased blood pressure, mental cloudiness, and feeling of fullness in the head. An elevated $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ causes cerebrovascular vasodilation and increased cerebral blood flow, par-
ticularly when it is higher than 60 mm Hg . Ventricular fibrillation may be the first sign of respiratory acidosis in anesthetized patients.

If respiratory acidosis is severe, intracranial pressure may increase, resulting in papilledema and dilated conjunctival blood vessels. Hyperkalemia may result as hydrogen concentration overwhelms the compensatory mechanisms and moves into cells, causing a shift of potassium out of the cell.

Chronic respiratory acidosis occurs with pulmonary diseases such as chronic emphysema and bronchitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. As long as the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ does not exceed the body's ability to compensate, the patient will be asymptomatic. However, if the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ rises rapidly, cerebral vasodilation will increase intracranial pressure; cyanosis and tachypnea will develop. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who gradually accumulate $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ over a prolonged period (days to months) may not develop symptoms of hypercapnia because compensatory renal changes have had time to occur.

> NURSING ALERT When the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is chronically above 50 mm Hg , the respiratory center becomes relatively insensitive to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as a respiratory stimulant, leaving hypoxemia as the major drive for respiration. Oxygen administration may remove the stimulus of hypoxemia, and the patient develops "carbon dioxide narcosis" unless the situation is quickly reversed. Therefore, oxygen is administered only with extreme caution.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Arterial blood gas evaluation reveals a pH less than 7.35, a $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ greater than 42 mm Hg , and a variation in the bicarbonate level, depending on the duration of the acidosis in acute respiratory acidosis. When compensation (renal retention of bicarbonate) has fully occurred, the arterial pH may be within the lower limits of normal. Depending on the cause of respiratory acidosis, other diagnostic measures would include monitoring of serum electrolyte levels, chest x-ray for determining any respiratory disease, and a drug screen if an overdose is suspected. An ECG to identify any cardiac involvement as a result of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be indicated as well.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment is directed at improving ventilation (Epstein \& Singh, 2001); exact measures vary with the cause of inadequate ventilation. Pharmacologic agents are used as indicated. For example, bronchodilators help reduce bronchial spasm, antibiotics are used for respiratory infections, and thrombolytics or anticoagulants are used for pulmonary emboli.

Pulmonary hygiene measures are initiated, when necessary, to clear the respiratory tract of mucus and purulent drainage. Adequate hydration ( $2-3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) is indicated to keep the mucous membranes moist and thereby facilitate the removal of secretions. Supplemental oxygen is used as necessary.

Mechanical ventilation, used appropriately, may improve pulmonary ventilation. Inappropriate mechanical ventilation (eg, increased dead space, insufficient rate or volume settings, high fraction of inspired oxygen [ $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ ] with excessive $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production) may cause such rapid excretion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that the kidneys will be unable to eliminate excess bicarbonate quickly enough to prevent alkalosis and seizures. For this reason, the elevated $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ must be decreased slowly. Placing the patient in a semi-Fowler's position
facilitates expansion of the chest wall. Treatment of chronic respiratory acidosis is the same as for acute respiratory acidosis.

\section*{ACUTE AND CHRONIC RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS (CARBONIC ACID DEFICIT)}

Respiratory alkalosis is a clinical condition in which the arterial pH is greater than 7.45 and the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is less than 38 mm Hg . As with respiratory acidosis, acute and chronic conditions can occur.

Respiratory alkalosis is always due to hyperventilation, which causes excessive "blowing off" of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and, hence, a decrease in the plasma carbonic acid concentration. Causes can include extreme anxiety, hypoxemia, the early phase of salicylate intoxication, gram-negative bacteremia, and inappropriate ventilator settings that do not match the patient's requirements.

Chronic respiratory alkalosis results from chronic hypocapnia, and decreased serum bicarbonate levels are the consequence. Chronic hepatic insufficiency and cerebral tumors are predisposing factors.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical signs consist of lightheadedness due to vasoconstriction and decreased cerebral blood flow, inability to concentrate, numbness and tingling from decreased calcium ionization, tinnitus, and at times loss of consciousness. Cardiac effects of respiratory alkalosis include tachycardia and ventricular and atrial dysrhythmias (Foster et al., 2001).

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Analysis of arterial blood gases assists in the diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis. In the acute state, the pH is elevated above normal as a result of a low $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and a normal bicarbonate level. (The kidneys cannot alter the bicarbonate level quickly.) In the compensated state, the kidneys have had sufficient time to lower the bicarbonate level to a near-normal level. Evaluation of serum electrolytes is indicated to identify any decrease in potassium as hydrogen is pulled out of the cells in exchange for potassium; decreased calcium, as severe alkalosis inhibits calcium ionization, resulting in carpopedal spasms and tetany; or decreased phosphate due to alkalosis, causing an increased uptake of phosphate by the cells. A toxicology screen should be performed to rule out salicylate intoxication.

Patients with chronic respiratory alkalosis are usually asymptomatic, and the diagnostic evaluation and plan of care are the same as for acute respiratory alkalosis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment depends on the underlying cause of respiratory alkalosis (Foster et al., 2001). If the cause is anxiety, the patient is instructed to breathe more slowly to allow $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to accumulate or to breathe into a closed system (such as a paper bag). A sedative may be required to relieve hyperventilation in very anxious patients. Treatment for other causes of respiratory alkalosis is directed at correcting the underlying problem.

\section*{MIXED ACID-BASE DISORDERS}

At times patients can simultaneously experience two or more independent acid-base disorders. A normal pH in the presence of changes in the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration imme-
diately suggests a mixed disorder. The only mixed disorder that cannot occur is a mixed respiratory acidosis and alkalosis, because it is impossible to have alveolar hypoventilation and hyperventilation at the same time. An example of a mixed disorder is the simultaneous occurrence of metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis during respiratory and cardiac arrest.

\section*{COMPENSATION}

Generally, the pulmonary and renal systems compensate for each other to return the pH to normal. In a single acid-base disorder, the system not causing the problem will try to compensate by returning the ratio of bicarbonate to carbonic acid to the normal 20:1. The lungs compensate for metabolic disturbances by changing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ excretion. The kidneys compensate for respiratory disturbances by altering bicarbonate retention and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion.

In respiratory acidosis, excess hydrogen is excreted in the urine in exchange for bicarbonate ions. In respiratory alkalosis, the renal excretion of bicarbonate increases, and hydrogen ions are retained. In metabolic acidosis, the compensatory mechanisms increase the ventilation rate and the renal retention of bicarbonate.

In metabolic alkalosis, the respiratory system compensates by decreasing ventilation to conserve $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and raise the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. Because the lungs respond to acid-base disorders within minutes, compensation for metabolic imbalances occurs faster than compensation for respiratory imbalances. Table 14-7 summarizes compensation effects.

\section*{BLOOD GAS ANALYSIS}

Blood gas analysis is often used to identify the specific acid-base disturbance and the degree of compensation that has occurred. The analysis is usually based on an arterial blood sample, but when an arterial sample cannot be obtained, a mixed venous sample may be used. Results of arterial blood gas analysis provide information about alveolar ventilation, oxygenation, and acid-base balance. It is necessary to evaluate the serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride) and carbon dioxide along with arterial blood gas data as they are often the first sign of an acid-base disorder. The health history, physical examination, previous blood gas results, and serum electrolytes should always be part of the assessment used to determine the cause of the acid-base disorder (Kraut \& Madias, 2001). Treatment of the underlying condition usually corrects most acid-base disorders. Table 14-8 compares normal ranges of venous and arterial blood gas values. See also Chart 14-1.

IV fluid administration is performed in the hospital, outpatient diagnostic and surgical settings, clinics, and home to replace fluids, administer medications, and provide nutrients when no other route is available.

\section*{PURPOSE}

The choice of an IV solution depends on the purpose of its administration. Generally, IV fluids are administered to achieve one or more of the following goals:
- To provide water, electrolytes, and nutrients to meet daily requirements
- To replace water and correct electrolyte deficits
- To administer medications and blood products

IV solutions contain dextrose or electrolytes mixed in various proportions with water. Pure, electrolyte-free water can never be administered IV because it rapidly enters red blood cells and causes them to rupture.

\section*{TYPES OF IV SOLUTIONS}

Solutions are often categorized as isotonic, hypotonic, or hypertonic, according to whether their total osmolality is the same as, less than, or greater than that of blood (see the section Laboratory Tests for Evaluating Fluid Status for a discussion of osmolality).

Electrolyte solutions are considered isotonic if the total electrolyte content (anions + cations) is approximately $310 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. They are considered hypotonic if the total electrolyte content is less than $250 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ and hypertonic if the total electrolyte content exceeds $375 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. The nurse must also consider a solution's osmolality, keeping in mind that the osmolality of plasma is approximately $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}(300 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. For example, a $10 \%$ dextrose solution has an osmolality of approximately $505 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.

\section*{Chart 14-1 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Arterial Blood Gases}

The following steps are recommended to evaluate arterial blood gas values. They are based on the assumption that the average values are:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pH}=7.4 \\
& \mathrm{PaCO}_{2}=40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \\
& \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}=24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}
\end{aligned}$$
1. First, note the $p H$. It can be high, low, or normal, as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pH}>7.4 \text { (alkalosis) } \\
& \mathrm{pH}<7.4 \text { (acidosis) } \\
& \mathrm{pH}=7.4 \text { (normal) }
\end{aligned}$$

A normal pH may indicate perfectly normal blood gases, or it may be an indication of a compensated imbalance. A compensated imbalance is one in which the body has been able to correct the pH by either respiratory or metabolic changes (depending on the primary problem). For example, a patient with primary metabolic acidosis starts out with a low bicarbonate level but a normal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level. Soon afterward, the lungs try to compensate for the imbalance by exhaling large amounts of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (hyperventilation). As another example, a patient with primary respiratory acidosis starts out with a high $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level; soon afterward, the kidneys attempt to compensate by retaining bicarbonate. If the compensatory mechanism is able to restore the bicarbonate to carbonic acid ratio back to $20: 1$, full compensation (and thus normal pH ) will be achieved.
2. The next step is to determine the primary cause of the disturbance. This is done by evaluating the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$in relation to the pH .

\section*{Example: $\mathbf{p H} \boldsymbol{>} \mathbf{7 . 4}$ (alkalosis)}
a. If the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is $<40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the primary disturbance is respiratory alkalosis. (This situation occurs when a patient hyperventilates and "blows off" too much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Recall that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissolved in water becomes carbonic acid, the acid side of the "carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system.")
b. If the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is $>24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, the primary disturbance is metabolic alkalosis. (This situation occurs when the body gains too
much bicarbonate, an alkaline substance. Bicarbonate is the basic or alkaline side of the "carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system.")

\section*{Example: $\mathbf{p H}<7.4$ (acidosis)}
a. If the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is $>40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the primary disturbance is respiratory acidosis. (This situation occurs when a patient hypoventilates and thus retains too much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, an acidic substance.)
b. If the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is $<24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, the primary disturbance is metabolic acidosis. (This situation occurs when the body's bicarbonate level drops, either because of direct bicarbonate loss or because of gains of acids such as lactic acid or ketones.)
3. The next step involves determining if compensation has begun. This is done by looking at the value other than the primary disorder. If it is moving in the same direction as the primary value, compensation is underway. Consider the following gases:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
pH & $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ & $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ \\
(1) 7.20 & 60 mm Hg & $24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ \\
(2) 7.40 & 60 mm Hg & $37 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
\end{tabular}

The first set (1) indicates acute respiratory acidosis without compensation (the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is high, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is normal). The second set (2) indicates chronic respiratory acidosis. Note that compensation has take place; that is, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$has elevated to an appropriate level to balance the high $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and produce a normal pH .
4. Two distinct acid-base disturbances may occur simultaneously. These can be identified when the pH does not explain one of the changes.

\section*{Example: Metabolic and respiratory acidosis}

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
a. pH & 7.21 & decreased acid \\
b. $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ & 52 & increased acid \\
c. $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ & 13 & decreased acid \\
\multicolumn{4}{l}{ This is an example of metabolic and respiratory acidosis. }
\end{tabular}

When administering parenteral fluids, the nurse monitors the patient's response to the fluids, considering the fluid volume, the content of the fluid, and the patient's clinical status.

\section*{Isotonic Fluids}

Fluids that are classified as isotonic have a total osmolality close to that of the ECF and do not cause red blood cells to shrink or swell. The composition of these fluids may or may not approximate that of the ECF. Isotonic fluids expand the ECF volume. One liter of isotonic fluid expands the ECF by 1 L ; however, it expands the plasma by only 0.25 L because it is a crystalloid fluid and diffuses quickly into the ECF compartment. For the same reason, 3 L of isotonic fluid is needed to replace 1 L of blood loss. Because these fluids expand the intravascular space, patients with hypertension and heart failure should be carefully monitored for signs of fluid overload.

\section*{$D_{5} W$}

A solution of $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$ has a serum osmolality of $252 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Once administered, the glucose is rapidly metabolized, and this initially isotonic solution then disperses as a hypotonic fluid, one-third extracellular and two-thirds intracellular. It is essential to consider this action of $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$, especially if the patient is at risk for increased intracranial pressure. During fluid resuscitation, this solution should not be used because it can cause hyperglycemia. Therefore, $\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}$ is used mainly to supply water and to correct an increased serum osmolality. About 1 L of D 5 W provides fewer than 200 kcal and is a minor source of calories for the body's daily requirements.

\section*{NORMAL SALINE SOLUTION}

Normal saline ( $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride) solution has a total osmolality of $308 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Because the osmolality is entirely contributed by electrolytes, the solution remains within the ECF. For this reason, normal saline solution is often used to correct an extracellular volume deficit. Although referred to as "normal," it contains only sodium and chloride and does not actually simulate the ECF. It is used with administration of blood transfusions and to replace large sodium losses, as in burn injuries. It is not used for heart failure, pulmonary edema, renal impairment, or sodium retention. Normal saline does not supply calories.

\section*{OTHER ISOTONIC SOLUTIONS}

Several other solutions contain ions in addition to sodium and chloride and are somewhat similar to the ECF in composition. Lactated Ringer's solution contains potassium and calcium in addition to sodium chloride. It is used to correct dehydration and sodium depletion and replace GI losses. Lactated Ringer's solution contains bicarbonate precursors as well. These solutions are marketed, with slight variations, under various trade names.

\section*{Hypotonic Fluids}

One purpose of hypotonic solutions is to replace cellular fluid, because it is hypotonic as compared with plasma. Another is to provide free water for excretion of body wastes. At times, hypotonic sodium solutions are used to treat hypernatremia and other hyperosmolar conditions. Half-strength saline ( $0.45 \%$ sodium chloride) solution, with an osmolality of $154 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, is frequently used. Multiple-electrolyte solutions are also available. Excessive infusions of hypotonic solutions can lead to intravascular fluid depletion, decreased blood pressure, cellular edema, and cell damage. These solutions exert less osmotic pressure than the ECF.

\section*{Hypertonic Fluids}

When normal saline solution or lactated Ringer's solution contains 5\% dextrose, the total osmolality exceeds that of the ECF. The dextrose is quickly metabolized, however, and only the isotonic solution remains. Therefore, any effect on the intracellular compartment is temporary. Similarly, with hypotonic multipleelectrolyte solutions containing 5\% dextrose, once the dextrose is metabolized, these solutions disperse as hypotonic fluids.

Higher concentrations of dextrose, such as $50 \%$ dextrose in water, are administered to help meet caloric requirements. These solutions are strongly hypertonic and must be administered into central veins so that they can be diluted by rapid blood flow.

Saline solutions are also available in osmolar concentrations greater than that of the ECF. These solutions draw water from the ICF to the ECF and cause cells to shrink. If administered rapidly or in large quantity, they may cause an extracellular volume excess and precipitate circulatory overload and dehydration. As a result, these solutions must be administered cautiously and usually only when the serum osmolality has decreased to dangerously low levels. Hypertonic solutions exert an osmotic pressure greater than that of the ECF.

\section*{Other IV Substances}

When the patient's GI tract is unable to tolerate food, nutritional requirements are often met using the IV route. Parenteral solutions may include high concentrations of glucose, protein, or fat to meet nutritional requirements. The parenteral route may also be used to administer colloids, plasma expanders, and blood products. Examples of blood products include whole blood, packed red blood cells, albumin, and cryoprecipitate; these are discussed in more detail in Chapter 33.

Many medications are also delivered by the IV route, either by infusion or directly into the vein. Because IV medications enter the circulation rapidly, administration by this route is potentially very hazardous. All medications can produce adverse reactions; however, medications given by the IV route can cause these reactions within 15 minutes after administration because the medications are delivered directly into the bloodstream. Administration rates and recommended dilutions for individual medications are available in specialized texts pertaining to IV medications and in manufacturers' package inserts; these should be consulted to ensure safe IV administration of medications.

> NURSING ALERT The nurse must assess the patient for a history of allergic reactions to medications; although this is important when any medication is to be administered, it is even more important with IV administration because the medication is delivered directly into the bloodstream.

\section*{Nursing Management of the Patient Receiving IV Therapy}

Venipuncture, or the ability to gain access to the venous system for administering fluids and medications, is an expected nursing skill in many settings. This responsibility includes selecting the appropriate venipuncture site and type of cannula and being proficient in the technique of vein entry.

\section*{PREPARING TO ADMINISTER IV THERAPY}

Before performing venipuncture, the nurse carries out hand hygiene, applies gloves, and informs the patient about the procedure. Next the nurse selects the most appropriate insertion site and type of cannula for a particular patient. Factors influencing these choices include the type of solution to be administered, the expected duration of IV therapy, the patient's general condition, and the availability of veins. The skill of the person initiating the infusion is also an important consideration.

\section*{CHOOSING AN IV SITE}

Many sites can be used for IV therapy, but ease of access and potential hazards vary. Veins of the extremities are designated as peripheral locations and are ordinarily the only sites used by nurses. Because they are relatively safe and easy to enter, arm veins are most commonly used (Fig. 14-7). The metacarpal, cephalic, basilic, and median veins as well as their branches are recommended sites because of their size and ease of access. More distal sites should be used first, with more proximal sites used subsequently. Leg veins should rarely, if ever, be used because of the high risk of thromboembolism. Additional sites to avoid include veins distal to a previous IV infiltration or phlebitic area, sclerosed or thrombosed veins, an arm with an arteriovenous shunt or fistula, or an arm affected by edema, infection, blood clot, or skin breakdown. The arm on the side of a mastectomy is avoided because of impaired lymphatic flow.

Central veins commonly used by physicians include the subclavian and internal jugular veins. It is possible to gain access to

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-306.jpg?height=1112&width=874&top_left_y=1415&top_left_x=101}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 14-7 Site selection for peripheral cannulation of veins: anterior (palmar) veins at left, posterior (dorsal) veins at right.}
\end{figure}
(or cannulate) these larger vessels even when peripheral sites have collapsed, and they allow for the administration of hyperosmolar solutions. Hazards are much greater, however, and may include inadvertent entry into an artery or the pleural space.

Ideally, both arms and hands are carefully inspected before choosing a specific venipuncture site that does not interfere with mobility. For this reason, the antecubital fossa is avoided, except as a last resort. The most distal site of the arm or hand is generally used first so that subsequent IV access sites can be moved progressively upward. The following are factors to consider when selecting a site for venipuncture:
- Condition of the vein
- Type of fluid or medication to be infused
- Duration of therapy
- Patient's age and size
- Whether the patient is right- or left-handed
- Patient's medical history and current health status
- Skill of the person performing the venipuncture

After applying a tourniquet, the nurse palpates and inspects the vein. The vein should feel firm, elastic, engorged, and round, not hard, flat, or bumpy. Because arteries lie close to veins in the antecubital fossa, the vessel should be palpated for arterial pulsation (even with a tourniquet on), and cannulation of pulsating vessels should be avoided. General guidelines for selecting a cannula include:
- Length: $3 / 4$ to 1.25 inches long
- Diameter: narrow diameter of the cannula to occupy minimal space within the vein
- Gauge: 20 to 22 gauge for most IV fluids; a larger gauge for caustic or viscous solutions; 14 to 18 gauge for blood administration and for trauma patients and those undergoing surgery
Hand veins are easiest to cannulate. Cannula tips should not rest in a flexion area (eg, the antecubital fossa) as this could inhibit the IV flow.

\section*{SELECTING VENIPUNCTURE DEVICES}

Equipment used to gain access to the vasculature includes cannulas, needleless IV delivery systems, and peripherally inserted central catheter or midline catheter access lines.

Cannulas. Most peripheral access devices are cannulas. They have an obturator inside a tube that is later removed. "Catheter" and "cannula" are terms that are used interchangeably. The main types of cannula devices available are those referred to as winged infusion sets (butterfly) with a steel needle or as an over-the-needle catheter with wings, indwelling plastic cannulas inserted over a steel needle, and indwelling plastic cannulas inserted through a steel needle. Scalp vein or butterfly needles are short steel needles with plastic wing handles. These are easy to insert, but because they are small and nonpliable, infiltration occurs easily. The use of these needles should be limited to obtaining blood specimens or administering bolus injections or infusions lasting only a few hours, as they increase the risk for vein injury and infiltration. Insertion of an over-the-needle catheter requires the additional step of advancing the catheter into the vein after venipuncture. Because these devices are less likely to cause infiltration, they are frequently preferred over winged infusion sets.

Plastic cannulas inserted through a hollow needle are usually called intracatheters. They are available in long lengths and are well suited for placement in central locations. Because insertion requires threading the cannula through the vein for a relatively long distance, these can be difficult to insert. The most commonly used infusion device is the over-the-needle catheter. A hollow metal stylet is preinserted into the catheter and extends through the distal tip of the catheter to allow puncture of the vessel, in an effort to guide the catheter as the venipuncture is performed. The vein is punctured and a flashback of blood appears in the closed chamber behind the catheter hub. The catheter is threaded through the stylet into the vein and the stylet is then removed. There are many safety over-the-needle catheter designs available with retracting stylets to protect health care workers from needlestick injuries.

Many types of cannulas are available for IV therapy. Some of the variations in these cannulas include the thickness of the cannula wall (affects rate of flow), the sharpness of the insertion needles (determines needle insertion technique), the softening properties of the cannula (influences the length of time the cannula can remain in place), safety features (minimizes risk of needlestick injuries and blood-borne exposure), and the number of lumens (determines the number of solutions that can be infused simultaneously). Cannula systems that help prevent needlesticks and transmission of blood-borne diseases are discussed below. Most standard peripheral catheters are composed of some form of plastic. Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene)-coated catheters have less thrombogenic properties and are less inflammatory than polyurethane or PVC. Catheter size for steel needles can range from $3 / 8$ to 1.5 inches in length and 27 to 13 gauge. Plastic catheters range in length from $5 / 8$ to 2 inches or as long as 12 inches. The size of the catheter ranges from 27 to 12 gauge.

To select the ideal product for use, consideration should be given to which product provides the greatest patient satisfaction and offers quality, cost-effective infusion care. All devices should be radiopaque to determine catheter location by x-ray, if indicated. All catheters are thrombogenic and differ only in their degree of thrombus occurrence. Biocompatibility, another characteristic of a catheter, ensures that inflammation and irritation do not occur. Silicone catheters are the most bioinert catheter available today.

Needleless IV Delivery Systems. In an effort to decrease needlestick injuries and exposure to HIV, hepatitis, and other bloodborne pathogens, agencies have implemented needleless IV delivery systems. These systems have built-in protection against needlestick injuries and provide a safe means of using and disposing of an IV administration set (which consists of tubing, an area for inserting the tubing into the container of IV fluid, and an adapter for connecting the tubing to the needle). Numerous companies produce needleless components. IV line connectors allow the simultaneous infusion of IV medications and other intermittent medications (known as a piggyback delivery) without the use of needles (Fig. 14-8). Technology is advancing and moving away from use of the traditional stylet. An example is a self-sheathing stylet that is recessed into a rigid chamber at the hub of the catheter when its insertion is complete. Other designs have placed the stylet at the end of a flexible wire to avoid needlesticks.

Many examples of these devices are on the market. Each institution must evaluate products to determine its own needs based on OSHA guidelines and the institution's policies and procedures.

Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter or Midline Catheter Access Lines. Patients who need moderate- to long-term parenteral therapy often receive a peripherally inserted central

After drawing medication into a syringe according to manufacturer's guidelines and swabbing the Y-site intersection with antiseptic, the nurse can insert the syringe-cannula apparatus into the Y site ( $\mathbf{B}$ ) and deliver bolus dose medications. If a blood tube holder $(\mathbf{C})$ is attached to the cannula, blood can be withdrawn safely without fear of contact or spills.

catheter or a midline catheter. These catheters are also used for patients with limited peripheral access (eg, obese or emaciated patients, IV/injection drug users) who require IV antibiotics, blood, and parenteral nutrition. For these devices to be used, the median cephalic, basilic, and cephalic veins must be pliable (not sclerosed or hardened) and not subject to repeated puncture. If these veins are damaged, then central venous access via the subclavian or internal jugular vein, or surgical placement of an implanted port or a vascular access device, must be considered as an alternative. Table 14-9 compares peripherally inserted central and midline catheter lines.

The principles for inserting these lines are much the same as those for inserting peripheral catheters; however, their insertion should be undertaken only by those who are experienced and specially skilled in inserting IV lines.

The physician prescribes the line and the solution to be infused. Insertion of either line requires sterile technique. The size of the catheter lumen chosen is based on the type of solution, the size of the patient, and the vein to be used. The patient's consent is obtained before use of these catheters. Use of the dominant arm is recommended as the site for inserting the cannula into the superior vena cava to ensure adequate arm movement, which encourages blood flow and reduces the risk of dependent edema.

\section*{TEACHING THE PATIENT}

Except in emergency situations, a patient should be prepared in advance for an IV infusion. The venipuncture, the expected length of infusion, and activity restrictions are explained. Then the patient should have an opportunity to ask questions and voice concerns. For example, some patients believe they will die if small bubbles in the tubing enter their veins. After acknowledging this fear, the nurse can explain that usually only relatively large volumes of air administered rapidly are dangerous.

\section*{PREPARING THE IV SITE}

Before preparing the skin, the nurse should ask the patient if he or she is allergic to latex or iodine, products commonly used in preparing for IV therapy. Excessive hair at the selected site may be removed by clipping to increase the visibility of the veins and to facilitate insertion of the cannula and adherence of dressings to the IV insertion site. Because infection can be a major complication of IV therapy, the IV device, the fluid, the container, and the tubing must be sterile. The insertion site is scrubbed with a sterile pad soaked in $10 \%$ povidone-iodine (Betadine) or chlorhexidine gluconate solution for 2 to 3 minutes, working from the center of the area to the periphery and allowing the area to air day. The site should not be wiped with $70 \%$ alcohol because the alcohol negates the effect of the disinfecting solution. (Alcohol pledgets are used for 30 seconds instead, only if the patient is allergic to iodine.) The nurse must perform hand hygiene and put on gloves. Nonsterile disposable gloves must be worn during the venipuncture procedure because of the likelihood of coming into contact with the patient's blood.

\section*{PERFORMING VENIPUNCTURE}

Guidelines and a suggested sequence for venipuncture are presented in Chart 14-2. For veins that are very small or particularly fragile, modifications in the technique may be necessary. Alternative methods can be found in journal articles or in specialized textbooks of IV therapy. Institutional policies and procedures determine whether all nurses must be certified to perform veni-
puncture. A nurse certified in IV therapy or an IV team can be consulted to assist with initiating IV therapy.

\section*{MAINTAINING THERAPY}

Maintaining an existing IV infusion is a nursing responsibility that demands knowledge of the solutions being administered and the principles of flow. In addition, patients must be assessed carefully for both local and systemic complications.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING FLOW}

The flow of an IV infusion is governed by the same principles that govern fluid movement in general.
- Flow is directly proportional to the height of the liquid column. Raising the height of the infusion container may improve a sluggish flow.
- Flow is directly proportional to the diameter of the tubing. The clamp on IV tubing regulates the flow by changing the tubing diameter. In addition, the flow is faster through large-gauge rather than small-gauge cannulas.
- Flow is inversely proportional to the length of the tubing. Adding extension tubing to an IV line will decrease the flow.
- Flow is inversely proportional to the viscosity of a fluid. Viscous IV solutions, such as blood, require a larger cannula than do water or saline solutions.

\section*{MONITORING FLOW}

Because so many factors influence gravity flow, a solution does not necessarily continue to run at the speed originally set. Therefore, the nurse monitors IV infusions frequently to make sure that the fluid is flowing at the intended rate. The IV container should be marked with tape to indicate at a glance whether the correct amount has infused. The flow rate is calculated when the solution is originally started, then monitored at least hourly. To calculate the flow rate, the nurse determines the number of drops delivered per milliliter; this varies with equipment and is usually printed on the administration set packaging. A formula that can be used to calculate the drop rate is:
$\mathrm{gtt} / \mathrm{mL}$ of infusion set $/ 60(\mathrm{~min}$ in hr$) \times$ total hourly $\mathrm{vol}=\mathrm{gtt} / \mathrm{min}$
Flushing of a vascular device is performed to ensure patency and prevent the mixing of incompatible medications or solutions. This procedure should be carried out at established intervals, according to hospital policy and procedure, especially for intermittently used catheters. Most manufacturers and researchers (LeDuc, 1997) suggest the use of saline for flushing. The volume of the flush solution should be equal to at least twice the volume capacity of the catheter. The catheter should be clamped before the syringe is completely empty and withdrawn to prevent reflux of blood into the lumen, which could cause catheter clotting.

A variety of electronic infusion devices are available to assist in IV fluid delivery. These devices allow more accurate administration of fluids and medications than is possible with routine gravity-flow setups. A pump is a positive-pressure device that uses pressure to infuse fluid at a pressure of 10 psi . Newer models use a pressure of 5 psi . The pressure exerted by the pump overrides vascular resistance (increased tubing length, low height of the IV container).

Volumetric pumps calculate the volume delivered by measuring the volume in a reservoir that is part of the set and calibrated in $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{h}$. A controller is an infusion assist device that relies on gravity for infusion; the volume is calibrated in drops/min. A controller

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR Guidelines for Starting an Intravenous Infusion}

\section*{NURSING ACTION}

\section*{Preparation}
1. Verify prescription for IV therapy, check solution label, and identify patient.
2. Explain procedure to patient.
3. Carry out hand hygiene and put on disposable nonlatex gloves.
4. Apply a tourniquet 4-6 inches above the site and identify a suitable vein.
5. Choose site. Use distal veins of hands and arms first.
6. Choose IV cannula or catheter.
7. Connect infusion bag and tubing, and run solution through tubing to displace air; cover end of tubing.
8. Raise bed to comfortable working height and position for patient; adjust lighting. Position patient's arm below heart level to encourage capillary filling. Place protective pad on bed under patient's arm.

\section*{Procedure}
1. Depending on agency policy and procedure, lidocaine $1 \%$ (without epinephrine) $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{~mL}$ may be injected locally to the IV site or a transdermal analgesic cream (EMLA) may be applied to the site 60 minutes before IV placement or blood withdrawal. Intradermal injection of bacteriostatic $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride may have a local anesthetic effect.
2. Question the patient carefully about sensitivity to latex; use blood-pressure cuff rather than latex tourniquet if there is possibility of sensitivity.
3. Apply a new tourniquet for each patient or a blood pressure cuff 15 to 20 cm ( $6-8 \mathrm{in}$ ) above injection site. Palpate for a pulse distal to the tourniquet. Ask patient to open and close fist several times or position patient's arm in a dependent position to distend a vein.
4. Ascertain if the patient is allergic to iodine. Prepare site by scrubbing with chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine swabs for $2-3 \mathrm{~min}$ in circular motion, moving outward from injection site. Allow to dry.
a. If the site selected is excessively hairy, clip hair. (Check agency's policy and procedure about this practice.)
b. $70 \%$ isopropyl alcohol is an alternative solution that may be used.
5. With hand not holding the venous access device, steady patient's arm and use finger or thumb to pull skin taut over vessel.
6. Holding needle bevel up and at $5^{\circ}-25^{\circ}$ angle, depending on the depth of the vein, pierce skin to reach but not penetrate vein.
7. Decrease angle of needle further until nearly parallel with skin, then enter vein either directly above or from the side in one quick motion.

\section*{RATIONALE}
1. Serious errors can be avoided by careful checking.
2. Knowledge increases patient comfort and cooperation.
3. Asepsis is essential to prevent infection. Prevents exposure of nurse to patient's blood and of patient and nurse to latex.
4. This will distend the veins and allow them to be visualized.
5. Careful site selection will increase likelihood of successful venipuncture and preservation of vein. Using distal sites first preserves sites proximal to the previously cannulated site for subsequent venipunctures. Veins of feet and lower extremity should be avoided due to risk of thrombophlebitis. (In consultation with the physician, the saphenous vein of the ankle or dorsum of the foot may occasionally be used.)
6. Length and gauge of cannula should be appropriate for both site and purpose of infusion. The shortest gauge and length needed to deliver prescribed therapy should be used.
7. Prevents delay; equipment must be ready to connect immediately after successful venipuncture to prevent clotting
8. Proper positioning will increase likelihood of success and provide comfort for patient.
1. Reduces pain locally from procedure and decreases anxiety about pain

\section*{2. Reduces risk of allergic reaction}
3. The tourniquet distends the vein and makes it easier to enter; it should never be tight enough to occlude arterial flow. If a radial pulse cannot be palpated distal to the tourniquet, it is too tight. A new tourniquet should be used for each patient to prevent the transmission of microorganisms. A blood pressure cuff may be used for elderly patients to avoid rupture of the veins. A clenched fist encourages the vein to become round and turgid. Positioning the arm below the level of the patient's heart promotes capillary filling. Warm packs can promote vasodilation as well.
4. Strict asepsis and careful site preparation are essential to prevent infection.
5. Applying traction to the vein helps to stabilize it.
6. Bevel-up position usually produces less trauma to skin and vein. A superficial vein needs a smaller cannula angle and a vein deeper in subcutaneous tissue requires a greater cannula angle.
7. Two-stage procedure decreases chance of thrusting needle through posterior wall of vein as skin is entered. No attempt should be made to reinsert the stylet because of risk of severing or puncturing the catheter.

\section*{NURSING ACTION}
8. If backflow of blood is visible, straighten angle and advance needle. Additional steps for catheter inserted over needle: a. Advance needle $0.6 \mathrm{~cm}(1 / 4-1 / 2 \mathrm{in})$ after successful venipuncture.
b. Hold needle hub, and slide catheter over the needle into the vein. Never reinsert needle into a plastic catheter or pull the catheter back into the needle.
c. Remove needle while pressing lightly on the skin over the catheter tip; hold catheter hub in place.
9. Release tourniquet and attach infusion tubing; open clamp enough to allow drip.
10. Slip a sterile 2 -in $\times 2$-in gauze pad under the catheter hub.
11. Anchor needle firmly in place with tape.
12. Cover the insertion site with a transparent dressing, bandage, or sterile gauze; tape in place with nonallergenic tape but do not encircle extremity.
13. Tape a small loop of IV tubing onto dressing.
14. Cover the insertion site with a dressing according to hospital policy and procedure. A gauze or transparent dressing may be used.
15. Label dressing with type and length of cannula, date, time, and initials.
16. A padded, appropriate-length arm board may be applied to an area of flexion (neurovascular checks should be performed frequently).
17. Calculate infusion rate and regulate flow of infusion. For hourly IV rate use the following formula: gtt $/ \mathrm{mL}$ of infusion set $/ 60 (\min$ in hr$) \times$ total hourly $\mathrm{vol}=\mathrm{gtt} / \mathrm{min}$
18. Document site, cannula size and type, the number of attempts at insertion, time, solution, IV rate, and patient response to procedure.

\section*{RATIONALE}
8. Backflow may not occur if vein is small; this position decreases chance of puncturing posterior wall of vein.
a. Advancing the needle slightly makes certain the plastic catheter has entered the vein.
b. Reinsertion of the needle or pulling the catheter back can sever the catheter, causing catheter embolism.
c. Slight pressure prevents bleeding before tubing is attached.
9. Infusion must be attached promptly to prevent clotting of blood in cannula. After two unsuccessful attempts at venipuncture, assistance by a more experienced health care provider is recommended to avoid unnecessary trauma to the patient and the possibility of limiting future sites for vascular access.
10. The gauze acts as a sterile field.
11. A stable needle is less likely to become dislodged or to irritate the vein.
12. Tape encircling extremity can act as a tourniquet.
13. The loop decreases the chance of inadvertent cannula removal if the tubing is pulled.
14. Transparent dressings allow assessment of the insertion site for phlebitis, infiltration, and infection without removing the dressing.
15. Labeling facilitates assessment and safe discontinuation.
16. Secures cannula placement and allows correct flow rate (neurovascular checks assess nerve, muscle, and vascular function to be sure function is not affected by immobilization)
17. Infusion must be regulated carefully to prevent overinfusion or underinfusion. Calculation of the IV rate is essential for the safe delivery of fluids. Safe administration requires knowledge of the volume of fluid to be infused, total infusion time, and the calibration of the administration set (found on the IV tubing package; $10,12,15$, or 60 drops to deliver 1 mL of fluid).
18. Documentation is essential to promote continuity of care.
uses a drop sensor to monitor the flow. Factors essential for the safe use of pumps include alarms to signify the presence of air in the IV line and occlusion. The standard for the accurate delivery of fluid or medication via an electronic IV infusion pump is plus or minus $5 \%$. The manufacturer's directions must be read carefully before using any infusion pump or controller, because there are many variations in available models. Use of these devices does not eliminate the need for the nurse to monitor the infusion and the patient frequently.

\section*{DISCONTINUING AN INFUSION}

The removal of an IV catheter is associated with two possible dangers: bleeding and catheter embolism. To prevent excessive bleeding, a dry, sterile pressure dressing should be held over the site as the catheter is removed. Firm pressure is applied until hemostasis occurs.

If a plastic IV catheter is severed, the loose fragment can travel to the right ventricle and block blood flow. To detect this com-
plication when the catheter is removed, the nurse compares the expected length of the catheter with its actual length. Plastic catheters should be withdrawn carefully and their length measured to make certain that no fragment has broken off.

Great care must be exercised when using scissors around the dressing site. If the catheter clearly has been severed, the nurse can attempt to occlude the vein above the site by applying a tourniquet to prevent the catheter from entering the central circulation (until surgical removal is possible). As always, however, it is better to prevent a potentially fatal problem than to deal with it after it has occurred. Fortunately, catheter embolism can be prevented easily by following simple rules:
- Avoid using scissors near the catheter.
- Avoid withdrawing the catheter through the insertion needle.
- Follow the manufacturer's guidelines carefully (eg, cover the needle point with the bevel shield to prevent severance of the catheter).

\section*{MANAGING SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS}

IV therapy predisposes the patient to numerous hazards, including both local and systemic complications. Systemic complications occur less frequently but are usually more serious than local complications. They include circulatory overload, air embolism, febrile reaction, and infection.

Fluid Overload. Overloading the circulatory system with excessive IV fluids causes increased blood pressure and central venous pressure. Signs and symptoms of fluid overload include moist crackles on auscultation of the lungs, edema, weight gain, dyspnea, and respirations that are shallow and have an increased rate. Possible causes include rapid infusion of an IV solution or hepatic, cardiac, or renal disease. The risk for fluid overload and subsequent pulmonary edema is especially increased in elderly patients with cardiac disease; this is referred to as circulatory overload.

The treatment for circulatory overload is decreasing the IV rate, monitoring vital signs frequently, assessing breath sounds, and placing the patient in a high Fowler's position. The physician is contacted immediately. This complication can be avoided by using an infusion pump for infusions and by carefully monitoring all infusions. Complications of circulatory overload include heart failure and pulmonary edema.

Air Embolism. The risk of air embolism is rare but ever-present. It is most often associated with cannulation of central veins. Manifestations of air embolism include dyspnea and cyanosis; hypotension; weak, rapid pulse; loss of consciousness; and chest, shoulder, and low back pain. Treatment calls for immediately clamping the cannula, placing the patient on the left side in the Trendelenburg position, assessing vital signs and breath sounds, and administering oxygen. Air embolism can be prevented by using a Luer-Lok adapter on all lines, filling all tubing completely with solution, and using an air detection alarm on an IV pump. Complications of air embolism include shock and death. The amount of air necessary to induce death in humans is not known; however, the rate of entry is probably as important as the actual volume of air.

Septicemia and Other Infection. Pyrogenic substances in either the infusion solution or the IV administration set can induce a febrile reaction and septicemia. Signs and symptoms include an abrupt temperature elevation shortly after the infusion is started, backache, headache, increased pulse and respiratory rate, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, chills and shaking, and general malaise. In severe septicemia, vascular collapse and septic shock may occur. Causes of septicemia include contamination of the IV product or a break in aseptic technique, especially in immunocompromised patients. Treatment is symptomatic and includes culturing of the IV cannula, tubing, or solution if suspect and establishing a new IV site for medication or fluid administration. See Chapter 15 for a discussion of septic shock.

Infection ranges in severity from local involvement of the insertion site to systemic dissemination of organisms through the bloodstream, as in septicemia. Measures to prevent infection are essential at the time the IV line is inserted and throughout the entire infusion. Prevention includes:
- Careful hand hygiene before every contact with any part of the infusion system or patient
- Examining the IV containers for cracks, leaks, or cloudiness, which may indicate a contaminated solution
- Using strict aseptic technique
- Firmly anchoring the IV cannula to prevent to-and-fro motion
- Inspecting the IV site daily and replacing a soiled or wet dressing with a dry sterile dressing. (Antimicrobial agents that should be used for site care include $2 \%$ tincture of iodine, $10 \%$ povidone-iodine, alcohol, or chlorhexidine, used alone or in combination.)
- Removing the IV cannula at the first sign of local inflammation, contamination, or complication
- Replacing the peripheral IV cannula every 48 to 72 hours, or as indicated
- Replacing the IV cannula inserted during emergency conditions (with questionable asepsis) as soon as possible
- Using a 0.2 -micron air-eliminating and bacteria/particulate retentive filter with non-lipid-containing solutions that require filtration. The filter can be added to the proximal or distal end of the administration set. If added to the proximal end between the fluid container and the tubing spike, the filter ensures sterility and particulate removal from the infusate container and prevents inadvertent infusion of air. If added to the distal end of the administration set, it filters air particles and contaminants introduced from add-on devices, secondary administration sets, or interruptions to the primary system.
- Replacing the solution bag and administration set in accordance with agency policy and procedure
- Infusing or discarding medication or solution within 24 hours of its addition to an administration set
- Changing primary and secondary continuous administration sets every 72 hours, or immediately if contamination is suspected
- Changing primary intermittent administration sets every 24 hours, or immediately if contamination is suspected

\section*{MANAGING LOCAL COMPLICATIONS}

Local complications of IV therapy include infiltration and extravasation, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, hematoma, and clotting of the needle.

Infiltration and Extravasation. Infiltration is the unintentional administration of a nonvesicant solution or medication into surrounding tissue. This can occur when the IV cannula dislodges or perforates the wall of the vein. Infiltration is characterized by edema around the insertion site, leakage of IV fluid from the insertion site, discomfort and coolness in the area of infiltration, and a significant decrease in the flow rate. When the solution is particularly irritating, sloughing of tissue may result. Closely monitoring the insertion site is necessary to detect infiltration before it becomes severe.

Infiltration is usually easily recognized if the insertion area is larger than the same site of the opposite extremity; however, it is not always so obvious. A common misconception is that a backflow of blood into the tubing proves that the catheter is properly placed within the vein. If the catheter tip has pierced the wall of the vessel, however, IV fluid will seep into tissues as well as flow into the vein. Although blood return occurs, infiltration has occurred as well. A more reliable means of confirming infiltration is to apply a tourniquet above (or proximal to) the infusion site and tighten it enough to restrict venous flow. If the infusion continues to drip despite the venous obstruction, infiltration is present.

As soon as the nurse notes infiltration, the infusion should be stopped, the IV discontinued, and a sterile dressing applied to the
site after careful inspection to determine the extent of infiltration. The infiltration of any amount of blood product, irritant, or vesicant is considered the most severe.

The IV infusion should be started in a new site or proximal to the infiltration if the same extremity is used. A warm compress may be applied to the site if small volumes of noncaustic solutions have infiltrated over a long time, and the affected extremity should be elevated to promote the absorption of fluid. If the infiltration is recent, a cold compress may be applied to the area. Infiltration can be detected and treated early by inspecting the site every hour for redness, pain, edema, blood return, coolness at the site, and IV fluid draining from the IV site. Using the appropriate size and type of cannula for the vein prevents this complication. According to the Infusion Nursing Standards of Practice, a standardized infiltration scale should be used to document the infiltration (Alexander, 2000):

0 = No symptoms
$1=$ Skin blanched, edema less than 1 inch in any direction, cool to touch, with or without pain
$2=$ Skin blanched, edema 1 to 6 inches in any direction, cool to touch, with or without pain
$3=$ Skin blanched, translucent, gross edema greater than 6 inches in any direction, cool to touch, mild to moderate pain, possible numbness
$4=$ Skin blanched, translucent, skin tight, leaking, skin discolored, bruised, swollen, gross edema greater than 6 inches in any direction, deep pitting tissue edema, circulatory impairment, moderate to severe pain, infiltration of any amount of blood products, irritant, or vesicant
Extravasation is similar to infiltration, with an inadvertent administration of vesicant or irritant solution or medication into the surrounding tissue. Medications such as dopamine, calcium preparations, and chemotherapeutic agents can cause pain, burning, and redness at the site. Blistering, inflammation, and necrosis of tissues can occur. The extent of tissue damage is determined by the concentration of the medication, the quantity that extravasated, the location of the infusion site, the tissue response, and the duration of the process of extravasation.

The infusion must be stopped and the physician notified promptly. The agency's protocol for extravasation is initiated; the protocol may specify specific treatments, including antidotes specific to the medication that extravasated, and may indicate whether the IV line should remain in place or be removed before treatment. The protocol often specifies that the infusion site be infiltrated with an antidote prescribed after assessment by the physician and application of warm or cold compresses, depending on the medication infusing. This extremity should not be used for further cannula placement. Thorough neurovascular assessments of the affected extremity must be performed frequently.

Reviewing the institution's IV policy and procedures and incompatibility charts and checking with the pharmacist before administering any IV medication, whether given peripherally or centrally, is a prudent way to determine incompatibilities and vesicant potential to prevent extravasation. Careful, frequent monitoring of the IV site, avoiding insertion of IV devices in areas of flexion, securing the IV line, and using the smallest catheter possible that accommodates the vein help minimize the incidence and severity of this complication. In addition, when vesicant medication is administered by IV push, it should be given through a side port of an infusing IV solution to dilute the medication and decrease the severity of tissue damage if extravasation oc-
curs. Extravasation should always be rated as a grade 4 on the infiltration scale.

Phlebitis. Phlebitis is defined as inflammation of a vein related to a chemical or mechanical irritation, or both. It is characterized by a reddened, warm area around the insertion site or along the path of the vein, pain or tenderness at the site or along the vein, and swelling. The incidence of phlebitis increases with the length of time the IV line is in place, the composition of the fluid or medication infused (especially its pH and tonicity), the size and site of the cannula inserted, ineffective filtration, improper anchoring of the line, and the introduction of microorganisms at the time of insertion. The Intravenous Nursing Society has identified specific standards for assessing phlebitis (Alexander, 2000); these appear in Chart 14-3.

Treatment consists of discontinuing the IV and restarting it in another site, and applying a warm, moist compress to the affected site. Phlebitis can be prevented by using aseptic technique during insertion, using the appropriate-size cannula or needle for the vein, considering the composition of fluids and medications when selecting a site, observing the site hourly for any complications, anchoring the cannula or needle well, and changing the IV site according to agency policy and procedures.

Thrombophlebitis. Thrombophlebitis refers to the presence of a clot plus inflammation in the vein. It is evidenced by localized pain, redness, warmth, and swelling around the insertion site or along the path of the vein, immobility of the extremity because of discomfort and swelling, sluggish flow rate, fever, malaise, and leukocytosis.

Treatment includes discontinuing the IV infusion, applying a cold compress first to decrease the flow of blood and increase platelet aggregation followed by a warm compress, elevating the extremity, and restarting the line in the opposite extremity. If the patient has signs and symptoms of thrombophlebitis, the IV line should not be flushed (although flushing may be indicated in

\section*{Chart 14-3 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Phlebitis}

According to the Infusion Nurses Society, documentation of phlebitis should be standardized. Phlebitis should be graded according to the most severe presenting indication

1 Erythema at access site with or without pain
2 Pain at access site Erythema, edema, or both
3 Pain at access site Erythema, edema, or both Streak formation Palpable venous cord (1 in. or shorter)
4 Pain at access site with erythema Streak formation Palpable venous cord (longer than 1 in.) Purulent drainage

}
the absence of phlebitis to ensure cannula patency and to prevent mixing incompatible medications and solutions).

Thrombophlebitis can be prevented by avoiding trauma to the vein at the time the IV is inserted, observing the site every hour, and checking medication additives for compatibility.

Hematoma. Hematoma results when blood leaks into tissues surrounding the IV insertion site. Leakage can result from perforation of the opposite vein wall during venipuncture, the needle slipping out of the vein, and insufficient pressure applied to the site after removing the needle or cannula. The signs of a hematoma include ecchymosis, immediate swelling at the site, and leakage of blood at the site.

Treatment includes removing the needle or cannula and applying pressure with a sterile dressing; applying ice for 24 hours to the site to avoid extension of the hematoma and then a warm compress to increase absorption of blood; assessing the site; and restarting the line in the other extremity if indicated. A hematoma can be prevented by carefully inserting the needle and using diligent care when a patient has a bleeding disorder, takes anticoagulant medication, or has advanced liver disease.

Clotting and Obstruction. Blood clots may form in the IV line as a result of kinked IV tubing, a very slow infusion rate, an empty IV bag, or failure to flush the IV line after intermittent medication or solution administrations. The signs are decreased flow rate and blood backflow into the IV tubing.

If blood clots in the IV line, the infusion must be discontinued and restarted in another site with a new cannula and administration set. The tubing should not be irrigated or milked. Neither the infusion rate nor the solution container should be raised, and the clot should not be aspirated from the tubing. Clotting of the needle or cannula may be prevented by not permitting the IV solution bag to run dry, taping the tubing to prevent kinking and maintain patency, maintaining an adequate flow rate, and flushing the line after intermittent medication or other solution administration. In some cases, a specially trained nurse or physician may inject a thrombolytic agent into the catheter to clear an occlusion resulting from fibrin or clotted blood.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. At times, IV therapy must be administered in the home setting, in which case much of the daily management rests with the patient and family. Teaching becomes essential to ensure that the patient and family can manage the IV fluid and infusion properly and avoid complications. Written instructions as well as demonstration and return demonstration help reinforce the key points for all these functions.

Continuing Care. Home infusion therapies cover a wide range of treatments, including antibiotic, analgesic, and antineoplastic medications; blood or blood component therapy; and parenteral nutrition. When direct nursing care is necessary, arrangements can be made to have an infusion nurse visit the home and administer the IV therapy as prescribed. In addition to implementing and monitoring the IV therapy, the nurse carries out a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition and continues to teach the patient and family about the skills involved in overseeing the IV therapy setup. Any dietary changes that may be necessary because of fluid or electrolyte imbalances are explained or reinforced during such sessions.

Periodic laboratory testing may be necessary to assess the effects of IV therapy and the patient's progress. Blood specimens may be
obtained by a laboratory near the patient's home, or a home visit may be arranged to obtain blood specimens for analysis.

The nurse collaborates with the case manager in assessing the patient, family, and home environment; developing a plan of care in accordance with the patient's treatment plan and level of ability; and arranging for appropriate referral and follow-up if necessary. Any necessary equipment may be provided by the agency or purchased by the patient, depending on the terms of the home care arrangements. Appropriate documentation is necessary to assist in obtaining third-party payment for the service provided.

\section*{critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A 40 -year-old man with peptic ulcer disease reports vomiting, nausea, dry mucous membranes, and abdominal pain for the last 2 days. His BP is $92 / 64$ and pulse is 120 . His laboratory results show a serum sodium level of $125 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, urine sodium level of $5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, and measured serum osmolality of $270 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.

\section*{Shock and Multisystem Failure}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}
on completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe shock and its underlying pathophysiology.
2. Compare clinical findings of the compensatory and progressive stages of shock.
3. Describe organ damage that may occur with shock.
4. Compare hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and circulatory shock in terms of causes, pathophysiologic effects, and medical and nursing management.
5. Describe indications for varying types of fluid replacement.
6. Identify vasoactive medications used in treating shock, and describe nursing implications associated with their use.
7. Discuss the importance of nutritional support in all forms of shock.
8. Discuss the role of the nurse in psychosocial support of both the patient experiencing shock and the family.
9. Discuss the syndrome of multiple organ dysfunction.
$\int_{\text {hock is a life-threatening condition with a variety of under- }}$ lying causes. It is characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion that, if untreated, results in cell death. The nurse caring for the patient with shock or at risk for shock must understand the underlying mechanisms of shock and recognize its subtle as well as more obvious signs. Rapid assessment and response are essential to the patient's recovery.

Shock can best be defined as a condition in which systemic blood pressure is inadequate to deliver oxygen and nutrients to support vital organs and cellular function (Mikhail, 1999). Adequate blood flow to the tissues and cells requires the following components: adequate cardiac pump, effective vasculature or circulatory system, and sufficient blood volume. When one component is impaired, blood flow to the tissues is threatened or compromised. Without treatment, inadequate blood flow to the tissues results in poor delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the cells, cellular starvation, cell death, organ dysfunction progressing to organ failure, and eventual death.

\section*{Significance of Shock}

Shock affects all body systems. It may develop rapidly or slowly, depending on the underlying cause. During shock, the body struggles to survive, calling on all its homeostatic mechanisms to restore blood flow and tissue perfusion. Any insult to the body can create a cascade of events resulting in poor tissue perfusion. Therefore, almost any patient with any disease state may be at risk for developing shock.

Nursing care of the patient with shock requires ongoing systematic assessment. Many of the interventions required in caring for the patient with shock call for close collaboration with other members of the health care team and a physician's orders. The nurse must anticipate such orders because they need to be executed with speed and accuracy.

\section*{Conditions Precipitating Shock CLASSIFICATION OF SHOCK}

Shock can be classified by etiology and may be described as (1) hypovolemic shock, (2) cardiogenic shock, or (3) circulatory or distributive shock. Some authors identify a fourth category, obstructive shock, that results from disorders that cause mechanical obstruction to blood flow through the central circulatory system despite normal myocardial function and intravascular volume.

Examples include pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, dissecting aortic aneurysm, and tension pneumothorax. In this discussion, obstructive disorders are discussed as examples of noncoronary cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a decrease in the intravascular volume. Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart has an impaired pumping ability; it may be of coronary or noncoronary origin. Circulatory shock results from a maldistribution or mismatch of blood flow to the cells.

\section*{NORMAL CELLULAR FUNCTION}

Energy metabolism occurs within the cell, where nutrients are chemically broken down and stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Cells use this stored energy to perform necessary functions, such as active transport, muscle contraction, and biochemical synthesis, as well as specialized cellular functions, such as the conduction of electrical impulses. ATP can be synthesized aerobically (in the presence of oxygen) or anaerobically (in the absence of oxygen). Aerobic metabolism yields far greater amounts of ATP per mole of glucose than does anaerobic metabolism and, therefore, is a more efficient and effective means of producing energy. Additionally, anaerobic metabolism results in the accumulation of the toxic end product lactic acid, which must be removed from the cell and transported to the liver for conversion into glucose and glycogen.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

In shock, the cells lack an adequate blood supply and are deprived of oxygen and nutrients; therefore, they must produce energy through anaerobic metabolism. This results in low energy yields from nutrients and an acidotic intracellular environment. Because of these changes, normal cell function ceases (Fig. 15-1). The cell swells and the cell membrane becomes more permeable, allowing electrolytes and fluids to seep out of and into the cell. The sodium-potassium pump becomes impaired; cell structures, primarily the mitochondria, are damaged; and death of the cell results.

\section*{Vascular Responses}

Oxygen attaches to the hemoglobin molecule in red blood cells, and the blood carries it to body cells. The amount of oxygen that is delivered to cells depends both on blood flow to a specific area and on blood oxygen concentration. Blood is continuously re-
anaphylactic shock: circulatory shock state resulting from a severe allergic reaction producing an overwhelming systemic vasodilation and relative hypovolemia
biochemical mediators: messenger substances that may be released by a cell to create an action at that site or be carried by the bloodstream to a distant site before being activated; also called cytokines
cardiogenic shock: shock state resulting from impairment or failure of the myocardium
colloids: intravenous solutions that contain molecules that are too large to pass through capillary membranes
crystalloids: electrolyte solutions that move freely between the intravascular compartment and interstitial spaces
circulatory shock: shock state resulting from displacement of blood volume creating a relative hypovolemia and inadequate delivery of oxygen to the cells; also called distributive shock
hypovolemic shock: shock state resulting from decreased intravascular volume due to fluid loss
neurogenic shock: shock state resulting from loss of sympathetic tone causing relative hypovolemia
septic shock: circulatory shock state resulting from overwhelming infection causing relative hypovolemia
shock: physiologic state in which there is inadequate blood flow to tissues and cells of the body
systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(SIRS): overwhelming inflammatory response in the absence of infection causing relative hypovolemia and decreased tissue perfusion

cycled through the lungs to be reoxygenated and to eliminate end products of cellular metabolism, such as carbon dioxide. The heart muscle is the pump that propels the freshly oxygenated blood out to the body tissues. This process of circulation is facilitated through an elaborate and dynamic vasculature consisting of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins, and venules. The vasculature can dilate or constrict based on central and local regulatory mechanisms. Central regulatory mechanisms stimulate dilation or constriction of the vasculature to maintain an adequate blood pressure. Local regulatory mechanisms, referred to as autoregulation, stimulate vasodilation or vasoconstriction in response to biochemical mediators (also called cytokines) released by the cell, communicating its need for oxygen and nutrients (Jindal, Hollenberg \& Dellinger, 2000) A biochemical mediator is a substance released by a cell or immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) or macrophages; the substance triggers an action at a cell site or travels in the bloodstream to a distant site, where it triggers action.

\section*{Blood Pressure Regulation}

Three major components of the circulatory system—blood volume, the cardiac pump, and the vasculature-must respond effectively to complex neural, chemical, and hormonal feedback systems to maintain an adequate blood pressure and ultimately perfuse body tissues.

Blood pressure is regulated through a complex interaction of neural, chemical, and hormonal feedback systems affecting both cardiac output and peripheral resistance. This relationship is expressed in the following equation:
$$\text { Mean arterial blood pressure }=\text { cardiac output } \times \text { peripheral resistance }$$

Cardiac output is determined by stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected at systole) and heart rate. Peripheral resistance is determined by the diameter of the arterioles.

Tissue perfusion and organ perfusion depend on mean arterial pressure (MAP). The MAP is the average pressure at which blood moves through the vasculature. Although true MAP can be calculated only by complex methods, Chart 15-1 displays a convenient formula for clinical use in estimating MAP. MAP should exceed 70 to 80 mm Hg for cells to receive the oxygen and nutrients needed to metabolize energy in amounts sufficient to sustain life (Balk, 2000a).

Blood pressure is regulated by the baroreceptors (pressure receptors) located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. These pressure receptors convey impulses to the sympathetic nervous center in the medulla of the brain. When blood pressure drops, catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) are released from the adrenal medulla of the adrenal glands. This increases heart rate and vasoconstriction, thus restoring blood pressure. Chemoreceptors, also located in the aortic arch and carotid arteries, regulate blood pressure and respiratory rate using much the same mechanism in response to changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood. These primary regulatory mechanisms can respond to changes in blood pressure on a moment-to-moment basis.

$$\mathrm{MAP}=\frac{125+(2 \times 75)}{3}$$ \\
MAP = 92 (rounded to nearest 1/10)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The kidneys also play an important role in blood pressure regulation. They regulate blood pressure by releasing renin, an enzyme needed for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This stimulation of the renin-angiotensin mechanism and resulting vasoconstriction indirectly lead to the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which promotes the retention of sodium and water. The increased concentration of sodium in the blood then stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary gland. ADH causes the kidneys to retain water further in an effort to raise blood volume and blood pressure. These secondary regulatory mechanisms may take hours or days to respond to changes in blood pressure.

To summarize, adequate blood volume, an effective cardiac pump, and an effective vasculature are necessary to maintain blood pressure and tissue perfusion. When one of the three components of this system begins to fail, the body is able to compensate through increased work by the other two (Fig. 15-2). When
compensatory mechanisms can no longer compensate for the failed system, body tissues are inadequately perfused, and shock occurs. Without prompt intervention, shock progresses, resulting in organ dysfunction, organ failure, and death.

\section*{Stages of Shock}

Some think of the shock syndrome as a continuum along which the patient struggles to survive. A convenient way to understand the physiologic responses and subsequent clinical signs and symptoms is to divide the continuum into separate stages: compensatory, progressive, and irreversible. (Although some authorities identify an initial stage of shock, changes attributed to this stage occur at the cellular level and are generally not detectable clinically.) The earlier that medical management and nursing interventions can be initiated along this continuum, the greater the patient's chance of survival.

Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders Company.

\section*{COMPENSATORY STAGE}

In the compensatory stage of shock, the patient's blood pressure remains within normal limits. Vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and increased contractility of the heart contribute to maintaining adequate cardiac output. This results from stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and subsequent release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). The patient displays the often-described "fight or flight" response. The body shunts blood from organs such as the skin, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract to the brain and heart to ensure adequate blood supply to these vital organs. As a result, the patient's skin is cold and clammy, bowel sounds are hypoactive, and urine output decreases in response to the release of aldosterone and ADH .

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Despite a normal blood pressure, the patient shows numerous clinical signs indicating inadequate organ perfusion (Chart 15-2). The result of inadequate perfusion is anaerobic metabolism and a buildup of lactic acid, producing metabolic acidosis. The respiratory rate increases in response to metabolic acidosis. This rapid respiratory rate facilitates removal of excess carbon dioxide but raises the blood pH and often causes a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. The alkalotic state causes mental status changes, such as confusion or combativeness, as well as arteriolar dilation. If treatment begins in this stage of shock, the prognosis for the patient is good.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical treatment is directed toward identifying the cause of the shock, correcting the underlying disorder so that shock does not progress, and supporting those physiologic processes that thus far have responded successfully to the threat. Because compensation cannot be effectively maintained indefinitely, measures such as fluid replacement and medication therapy must be initiated to maintain an adequate blood pressure and reestablish and maintain adequate tissue perfusion.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Early intervention along the continuum of shock is the key to improving the patient's prognosis. Therefore, the nurse needs to assess systematically those patients at risk for shock to recognize the subtle clinical signs of the compensatory stage before the patient's blood pressure drops.

\section*{MONITORING TISSUE PERFUSION}

In assessing tissue perfusion, the nurse observes for changes in level of consciousness, vital signs (including pulse pressure), urinary output, skin, and laboratory values. In the compensatory stage of shock, serum sodium and blood glucose levels are elevated in response to the release of aldosterone and catecholamines.

The role of the nurse at the compensatory stage of shock is to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and promptly report deviations to the physician, assist in identifying and treating the underlying disorder by continuous in-depth assessment of the patient, administer prescribed fluids and medications, and promote patient safety. Vital signs are key indicators of the patient's hemodynamic status; however, blood pressure is an indirect method of monitoring tissue hypoxia. Pulse pressure correlates well to stroke volume, the amount of blood ejected from the heart with systole. Pulse pressure is calculated by subtracting the diastolic measurement from the systolic measurement; the difference is the pulse pressure. Normally, the pulse pressure is 30 to 40 mm Hg (Mikhail, 1999). Narrowing or decreased pulse pressure is an earlier indicator of shock than a drop in systolic blood pressure. Decreased or narrowing pulse pressure, an early indication of decreased stroke volume, is illustrated in the following example:

Systolic blood pressure - diastolic blood pressure $=$ pulse pressure
Normal pulse pressure:

Systolic BP
$120 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Hg}-80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}=40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$

Narrowing of pulse pressure:

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Systolic BP & Diastolic BP \\
90 mm Hg & -70 mm Hg
\end{tabular}$=$\begin{tabular}{l} 
Pulse Pressure \\
20 mm Hg
\end{tabular}

Elevation in the diastolic blood pressure with release of catecholamines and attempts to increase venous return through vasoconstriction is an early compensatory mechanism in response to decreased stroke volume, blood pressure, and overall cardiac output.

NURSING ALERT By the time blood pressure drops, damage has already been occurring on the cellular and tissue levels. Therefore, the patient at risk for shock must be assessed and monitored closely before the blood pressure falls.

Although treatments are prescribed and initiated by the physician, the nurse usually implements them, operates and troubleshoots equipment used in treatment, monitors the patient's status during treatment, and assesses the immediate effects of treatment. Additionally, the nurse assesses the response of the patient and the family to the crisis and to treatment.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

While experiencing a major threat to health and well-being and being the focus of attention of many health care providers, the patient often becomes anxious and apprehensive. Providing brief explanations about the diagnostic and treatment procedures, supporting the patient during those procedures, and providing information about their outcomes are usually effective in reducing stress and anxiety and thus promoting the patient's physical and mental well-being.

\section*{PROMOTING SAFETY}

Another nursing intervention is monitoring potential threats to the patient's safety, because a high anxiety level and altered mental status typically impair a person's judgment. In this stage, patients who were previously cooperative and followed instructions may now disrupt intravenous lines and catheters and complicate their condition. Therefore, close monitoring is essential.

\section*{PROGRESSIVE STAGE}

In the progressive stage of shock, the mechanisms that regulate blood pressure can no longer compensate and the MAP falls below normal limits, with an average systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg (Abraham et al., 2000).

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Although all organ systems suffer from hypoperfusion at this stage, two events perpetuate the shock syndrome. First, the overworked heart becomes dysfunctional; the body's inability to meet increased oxygen requirements produces ischemia; and biochemical mediators cause myocardial depression (Kumar, Haery \& Parrillo, 2000; Price, Anning, Mitchell et al., 1999). This leads to failure of the cardiac pump, even if the underlying cause of the shock is not of cardiac origin. Second, the autoregulatory function of the microcirculation fails in response to numerous biochemical mediators released by the cells, resulting in increased capillary permeability, with areas of arteriolar and venous constriction further compromising cellular perfusion. At this stage, the patient's prognosis worsens. The relaxation of precapillary sphincters causes fluid to leak from the capillaries, creating interstitial edema and return of less fluid to the heart. Even if the underlying cause of the shock is reversed, the breakdown of the circulatory system itself perpetuates the shock state, and a vicious circle ensues.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Chances of survival depend on the patient's general health before the shock state as well as the amount of time it takes to restore tissue perfusion. As shock progresses, organ systems decompensate.

\section*{RESPIRATORY EFFECTS}

The lungs, which become compromised early in shock, are affected at this stage. Subsequent decompensation of the lungs increases the likelihood that mechanical ventilation will be needed if shock progresses. Respirations are rapid and shallow. Crackles are heard over the lung fields. Decreased pulmonary blood flow causes arterial oxygen levels to decrease and carbon dioxide levels to increase. Hypoxemia and biochemical mediators cause an intense inflammatory response and pulmonary vasoconstriction, perpetuating the pulmonary capillary hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. The hypoperfused alveoli stop producing surfactant and
subsequently collapse. Pulmonary capillaries begin to leak their contents, causing pulmonary edema, diffusion abnormalities (shunting), and additional alveolar collapse. Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are common as the pulmonary damage progresses (Fein \& Calalang-Colucci, 2000). This condition is sometimes referred to as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury (ALI), shock lung, or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Further explanation of ARDS, as well as its nursing management, can be found in Chapter 23.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

A lack of adequate blood supply leads to dysrhythmias and ischemia. The patient has a rapid heart rate, sometimes exceeding 150 bpm . The patient may complain of chest pain and even suffer a myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzyme levels (eg, lactate dehydrogenase, CPK-MB, and cTn-I) rise. In addition, myocardial depression and ventricular dilation may further impair the heart's ability to pump enough blood to the tissues to meet oxygen requirements.

\section*{NEUROLOGIC EFFECTS}

As blood flow to the brain becomes impaired, the patient's mental status deteriorates. Changes in mental status occur as a result of decreased cerebral perfusion and hypoxia; the patient may initially exhibit confusion or a subtle change in behavior. Subsequently, lethargy increases and the patient begins to lose consciousness. The pupils dilate and are only sluggishly reactive to light.

\section*{RENAL EFFECTS}

When the MAP falls below 80 mm Hg (Guyton \& Hall, 2000), the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys cannot be maintained, and drastic changes in renal function occur. Acute renal failure (ARF) can develop. ARF is characterized by an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels, fluid and electrolyte shifts, acid-base imbalances, and a loss of the renalhormonal regulation of blood pressure. Urinary output usually decreases to below $0.5 / \mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ per hour (or below 30 mL per hour) but can be variable depending on the phase of ARF. For further information about ARF, see Chapter 45.

\section*{HEPATIC EFFECTS}

Decreased blood flow to the liver impairs the liver cells' ability to perform metabolic and phagocytic functions. Consequently, the patient is less able to metabolize medications and metabolic waste products, such as ammonia and lactic acid. The patient becomes more susceptible to infection as the liver fails to filter bacteria from the blood. Liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], formerly serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]; alanine aminotransferase [ALT], formerly serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]; lactate dehydrogenase) and bilirubin levels are elevated, and the patient appears jaundiced.

\section*{GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS}

Gastrointestinal ischemia can cause stress ulcers in the stomach, placing the patient at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. In the small intestine, the mucosa can become necrotic and slough off, causing bloody diarrhea. Beyond the local effects of impaired perfusion, gastrointestinal ischemia leads to bacterial toxin translocation, in which bacterial toxins enter the bloodstream through the lymph system. In addition to causing infection, bacterial toxins can cause cardiac depression, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and an intense inflammatory response with activa-
tion of additional biochemical mediators. The net result is interference with healthy cells and their ability to metabolize nutrients (Balk, 2000b; Jindal et al., 2000).

\section*{HEMATOLOGIC EFFECTS}

The combination of hypotension, sluggish blood flow, metabolic acidosis, and generalized hypoxemia can interfere with normal hemostatic mechanisms. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can occur either as a cause or as a complication of shock. In this condition, widespread clotting and bleeding occur simultaneously. Bruises (ecchymoses) and bleeding (petechiae) may appear in the skin. Coagulation times (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time) are prolonged. Clotting factors and platelets are consumed and require replacement therapy to achieve hemostasis. Further discussion of disseminated intravascular coagulation appears in Chapter 33.

Specific medical management in the progressive stage of shock depends on the type of shock and its underlying cause. It is also based on the degree of decompensation in the organ systems. Medical management specific to each type of shock is discussed in later sections of this chapter. Although there are several differences in medical management by type of shock, some medical interventions are common to all types. These include use of appropriate intravenous fluids and medications to restore tissue perfusion by (1) optimizing intravascular volume, (2) supporting the pumping action of the heart, and (3) improving the competence of the vascular system. Other aspects of management may include early enteral nutritional support and use of antacids, histamine-2 blockers, or antipeptic agents to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Nursing care of the patient in the progressive stage of shock requires expertise in assessing and understanding shock and the significance of changes in assessment data. The patient in the progressive stage of shock is often cared for in the intensive care setting to facilitate close monitoring (hemodynamic monitoring, electrocardiographic monitoring, arterial blood gases, serum electrolyte levels, physical and mental status changes), rapid and frequent administration of various prescribed medications and fluids, and possibly intervention with supportive technologies, such as mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and intra-aortic balloon pump.

Working closely with other members of the health care team, the nurse carefully documents treatments, medications, and fluids that are administered by members of the team, recording the time, dosage or volume, and the patient's response. Additionally, the nurse coordinates both the scheduling of diagnostic procedures that may be carried out at the bedside and the flow of health care personnel involved in the patient's care.

\section*{PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS}

If supportive technologies are used, the nurse helps reduce the risk of related complications and monitors the patient for early signs of complications. Monitoring includes evaluating blood levels of medications, observing invasive vascular lines for signs of infection, and checking neurovascular status if arterial lines are inserted, especially in the lower extremities. Simultaneously, the nurse promotes the patient's safety and comfort by ensuring that
all procedures, including invasive procedures and arterial and venous punctures, are carried out using correct aseptic techniques and that venous and arterial puncture and infusion sites are maintained with the goal of preventing infection. Positioning and repositioning the patient to promote comfort, prevent pulmonary complications, and maintain skin integrity are integral to caring for the patient in shock.

\section*{PROMOTING REST AND COMFORT}

Efforts are made to minimize the cardiac workload by reducing the patient's physical activity and fear or anxiety. Promoting rest and comfort is a priority in the patient's care. To ensure that the patient gets as much uninterrupted rest as possible, the nurse performs only essential nursing activities. To conserve the patient's energy, the nurse protects the patient from temperature extremes (excessive warmth or shivering cold), which can increase the metabolic rate and subsequently the cardiac workload. The patient should not be warmed too quickly, and warming blankets should not be applied because they can cause vasodilation and a subsequent drop in blood pressure.

\section*{SUPPORTING FAMILY MEMBERS}

Because the patient in shock is the object of intense attention by the health care team, the family members may feel neglected; however, they may be reluctant to ask questions or seek information for fear that they will be in the way or will interfere with the attention given to the patient. The nurse should make sure that the family is comfortably situated and kept informed about the patient's status. Often, family members need advice from the health care team to get some rest; they are more likely to take this advice if they feel that the patient is being well cared for and that they will be notified of any significant changes in the patient's status. A visit from the hospital chaplain may be comforting to the family and provides some attention to the family while the nurse concentrates on the patient.

\section*{IRREVERSIBLE STAGE}

The irreversible (or refractory) stage of shock represents the point along the shock continuum at which organ damage is so severe that the patient does not respond to treatment and cannot survive. Despite treatment, blood pressure remains low. Complete renal and liver failure, compounded by the release of necrotic tissue toxins, creates an overwhelming metabolic acidosis. Anaerobic metabolism contributes to a worsening lactic acidosis. Reserves of ATP are almost totally depleted, and mechanisms for storing new supplies of energy have been destroyed. Multiple organ dysfunction progressing to complete organ failure has occurred, and death is imminent. Multiple organ dysfunction can occur as a progression along the shock continuum or as a syndrome unto itself and is further described later in this chapter.

\section*{Medical Management}

Medical management during the irreversible stage of shock is usually the same as for the progressive stage. Although the patient's condition may have progressed from the progressive to the irreversible stage, the judgment that the shock is irreversible can be made only retrospectively on the basis of the patient's failure to respond to treatment. Strategies that may be experimental (ie, investigational medications, such as antibiotic agents and immunomodulation therapy) may be tried to reduce or reverse the severity of shock.

\section*{Nursing Management}

As in the progressive stage of shock, the nurse focuses on carrying out prescribed treatments, monitoring the patient, preventing complications, protecting the patient from injury, and providing comfort. Offering brief explanations to the patient about what is happening is essential even if there is no certainty that the patient hears or understands what is being said.

As it becomes obvious that the patient is unlikely to survive, the family needs to be informed about the prognosis and likely outcomes. Opportunities should be provided, throughout the patient's care, for the family to see, touch, and talk to the patient. A close family friend or spiritual advisor may be of comfort to the family in dealing with the inevitable death of the patient. Whenever possible and appropriate, the family should be approached regarding any living will, advance directive, or other written or verbal wishes the patient may have shared in the event that he or she cannot participate in end-of-life decisions. In some cases, ethics committees may assist the family and health care team in making difficult decisions.

During this stage of shock, families may misinterpret the actions of the health care team. They have been told that nothing has been effective in reversing the shock and that the patient's survival is very unlikely, yet the health care team continues to work feverishly on the patient. A distraught, grieving family may interpret this as a chance for recovery when none exists. As a result, family members may become angry when the patient dies. Conferences with all members of the health care team and the family will promote better understanding by the family of the patient's prognosis and the purpose for the measures being taken. During these conferences, it is essential to explain that the equipment and treatments being provided are for the patient's comfort and do not suggest that the patient will recover. Families should be encouraged to express their wishes concerning the use of life-support measures.

\section*{Overall Management Strategies in Shock}

As described previously and in the discussion of types of shock to follow, management in all types and all phases of shock includes the following:
- Fluid replacement to restore intravascular volume
- Vasoactive medications to restore vasomotor tone and improve cardiac function
- Nutritional support to address the metabolic requirements that are often dramatically increased in shock

Therapies described in this section require collaboration among all members of the health care team to ensure that the manifestations of shock are quickly identified and that adequate and timely treatment is instituted to achieve the best outcome possible.

\section*{FLUID REPLACEMENT}

Fluid replacement is administered in all types of shock. The type of fluids administered and the speed of delivery vary, but fluids are given to improve cardiac and tissue oxygenation, which in part depends on flow. The fluids administered may include crystalloids (electrolyte solutions that move freely between intravascular and interstitial spaces), colloids (large-molecule intravenous solutions), or blood components.

\section*{Crystalloid and Colloid Solutions}

The best fluid to treat shock remains controversial. In emergencies, the "best" fluid is often the fluid that is readily available. Both crystalloids and colloids, as described later, can be given to restore intravascular volume. Blood component therapy is used most frequently in hypovolemic shock.

Crystalloids are electrolyte solutions that move freely between the intravascular compartment and the interstitial spaces. Isotonic crystalloid solutions are often selected because they contain the same concentration of electrolytes as the extracellular fluid and therefore can be given without altering the concentrations of electrolytes in the plasma.

Common intravenous fluids used for resuscitation in hypovolemic shock include $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride solution (normal saline) and lactated Ringer's solution (Choi et al., 1999). Ringer's lactate is an electrolyte solution containing the lactate ion, which should not be confused with lactic acid. The lactate ion is converted to bicarbonate, which helps to buffer the overall acidosis that occurs in shock.

A disadvantage of using isotonic crystalloid solutions is that three parts of the volume are lost to the interstitial compartment for every one part that remains in the intravascular compartment. This occurs in response to mechanisms that store extracellular body fluid. Diffusion of crystalloids into the interstitial space necessitates that more fluid be administered than the amount lost (Choi et al., 1999).

Care must be taken when rapidly administering isotonic crystalloids to avoid causing excessive edema, particularly pulmonary edema. For this reason, and depending on the cause of the hypovolemia, a hypertonic crystalloid solution, such as $3 \%$ sodium chloride, is sometimes administered in hypovolemic shock. Hypertonic solutions produce a large osmotic force that pulls fluid from the intracellular space to the extracellular space to achieve a fluid balance (Choi et al., 1999; Fein \& CalalangColucci, 2000). The osmotic effect of hypertonic solutions results in fewer fluids being administered to restore intravascular volume. Complications associated with use of hypertonic saline solution include excessive serum osmolality, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and altered thermoregulation.

Generally, intravenous colloidal solutions are considered to be plasma proteins, which are molecules that are too large to pass through capillary membranes. Colloids expand intravascular volume by exerting oncotic pressure, thereby pulling fluid into the intravascular space. Colloidal solutions have the same effect as hypertonic solutions in increasing intravascular volume, but less volume of fluid is required than with crystalloids. Additionally, colloids have a longer duration of action than crystalloids because the molecules remain within the intravascular compartment longer.

An albumin solution is commonly used to treat hypovolemic shock. Albumin is a plasma protein; an albumin solution is prepared from human plasma and is heated to reduce its potential to transmit disease. The disadvantages of albumin are its high cost and limited availability, which depends on blood donors. Synthetic colloid preparations, such as hetastarch and dextran solution, are now widely used. Dextran, however, may interfere with platelet aggregation and therefore is not indicated if hemorrhage is the cause of the hypovolemic shock or if the patient has a coagulation disorder (coagulopathy).

NURSING ALERT With all colloidal solutions, side effects include the rare occurrence of anaphylactic reactions, for which the nurse must monitor the patient closely.

\section*{Complications of Fluid Administration}

Close monitoring of the patient during fluid replacement is necessary to identify side effects and complications. The most common and serious side effects of fluid replacement are cardiovascular overload and pulmonary edema.

Patients receiving fluid replacement must be monitored frequently for adequate urinary output, changes in mental status, skin perfusion, and changes in vital signs. Lung sounds are auscultated frequently to detect signs of fluid accumulation. Adventitious lung sounds, such as crackles, may indicate pulmonary edema.

Often a right atrial pressure line (also known as a central venous pressure line) is inserted. In addition to physical assessment, the right atrial pressure value helps in monitoring the patient's response to fluid replacement. A normal right atrial pressure value is 4 to 12 mm Hg or $\mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Several readings are obtained to determine a range, and fluid replacement is continued to achieve a pressure within normal limits. Hemodynamic monitoring with arterial and pulmonary artery lines may be implemented to allow close monitoring of the patient's perfusion and cardiac status as well as response to therapy.

\section*{VASOACTIVE MEDICATION THERAPY}

Vasoactive medications are administered in all forms of shock to improve the patient's hemodynamic stability when fluid therapy alone cannot maintain adequate MAP. Specific medications are selected to correct the particular hemodynamic alteration that is impeding cardiac output. Specific vasoactive medications are prescribed for the patient in shock because they can support the patient's hemodynamic status. These medications help to increase the strength of myocardial contractility, regulate the heart rate, reduce myocardial resistance, and initiate vasoconstriction.

Vasoactive medications are selected for their action on receptors of the sympathetic nervous system. These receptors are known as alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic receptors are further classified as beta ${ }_{1}$ - and beta ${ }_{2}$-adrenergic receptors. When alpha-adrenergic receptors are stimulated, blood vessels constrict in the cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal systems, skin, and kidneys. When beta ${ }_{1}$-adrenergic receptors are stimulated, heart rate and myocardial contraction increase. When
beta $_{2}$-adrenergic receptors are stimulated, vasodilation occurs in the heart and skeletal muscles, and the bronchioles relax. The medications used in treating shock consist of various combinations of vasoactive medications to maximize tissue perfusion by stimulating or blocking the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.

When vasoactive medications are administered, vital signs must be monitored frequently (at least every 15 minutes until stable, or more often if indicated). Vasoactive medications should be administered through a central venous line because infiltration and extravasation of some vasoactive medications can cause tissue necrosis and sloughing. An intravenous pump or controller should be used to ensure that the medications are delivered safely and accurately.

Individual medication dosages are usually titrated by the nurse, who adjusts the intravenous drip rates based on the physician's prescription and the patient's response. Dosages are changed to maintain the MAP (usually above 80 mm Hg ) at a physiologic level that ensures adequate tissue perfusion.

1NURSING ALERT Vasoactive medications should never be stopped abruptly because this could cause severe hemodynamic instability, perpetuating the shock state.

Dosages of vasoactive medications should be tapered and the patient should be weaned from the medication with frequent monitoring (every 15 minutes) of blood pressure. Table 15-1 presents some of the commonly prescribed vasoactive medications used in treating shock.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT}

Nutritional support is an important aspect of care for the patient with shock. Increased metabolic rates during shock increase energy requirements and therefore caloric requirements. The patient in shock requires more than 3,000 calories daily.

The release of catecholamines early in the shock continuum causes glycogen stores to be depleted in about 8 to 10 hours. Nutritional energy requirements are then met by breaking down lean body mass. In this catabolic process, skeletal muscle mass is broken down even when the patient has large stores of fat or adipose tissue. Loss of skeletal muscle can greatly prolong the recovery

Increase blood pressure by vasoconstriction

DISADVANTAGES
Increase oxygen demand of the heart

Cause hypotension

Increase afterload, thereby increasing cardiac workload; compromise perfusion to skin, kidneys, lungs, GI tract
time for the patient in shock. Parenteral or enteral nutritional support should be initiated as soon as possible, with some form of enteral nutrition always being administered. The integrity of the gastrointestinal system depends on direct exposure to nutrients. Additionally, glutamine (an essential amino acid during stress) is important in the immunologic function of the gastrointestinal tract, providing a fuel source for lymphocytes and macrophages. Glutamine can be administered through enteral nutrition (Rauen \& Munro, 1998).

Stress ulcers occur frequently in acutely ill patients because of the compromised blood supply to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, antacids, histamine-2 blockers (eg, famotidine [Pepcid], ranitidine [Zantac]), and antipeptic agents (eg, sucralfate [Carafate]) are prescribed to prevent ulcer formation by inhibiting gastric acid secretion or increasing gastric pH .

\section*{Hypovolemic Shock}

In addition to caring for the patient through different stages of shock, the nurse needs to tailor interventions to the type of shock, whether it is hypovolemic, cardiogenic, or circulatory shock.

Hypovolemic shock, the most common type of shock, is characterized by a decreased intravascular volume. Body fluid is contained in the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Intracellular fluid accounts for about two thirds of the total body water. The extracellular body fluid is found in one of two compartments: intravascular (inside blood vessels) or interstitial (surrounding tissues). The volume of interstitial fluid is about three to four times that of intravascular fluid. Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a reduction in intravascular volume of $15 \%$ to $25 \%$. This would represent a loss of 750 to $1,300 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ (154-lb) person.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Hypovolemic shock can be caused by external fluid losses, such as traumatic blood loss, or by internal fluid shifts, as in severe dehydration, severe edema, or ascites (Chart 15-3). Intravascular volume can be reduced both by fluid loss and fluid shifting between the intravascular and interstitial compartments.

The sequence of events in hypovolemic shock begins with a decrease in the intravascular volume. This results in decreased venous return of blood to the heart and subsequent decreased ventricular filling. Decreased ventricular filling results in decreased stroke volume (amount of blood ejected from the heart) and decreased cardiac output. When cardiac output drops, blood pressure drops and tissues cannot be adequately perfused (Fig. 15-3).

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 15-3 Pathophysiologic sequence of events in hypovolemic shock.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Medical Management}

Major goals in treating hypovolemic shock are to (1) restore intravascular volume to reverse the sequence of events leading to inadequate tissue perfusion, (2) redistribute fluid volume, and (3) correct the underlying cause of the fluid loss as quickly as possible. Depending on the severity of shock and the patient's condition, it is likely that efforts will be made to address all three goals simultaneously.

\section*{TREATMENT OF THE UNDERLYING CAUSE}

If the patient is hemorrhaging, efforts are made to stop the bleeding. This may involve applying pressure to the bleeding site or surgery to stop internal bleeding. If the cause of the hypovolemia is diarrhea or vomiting, medications to treat diarrhea and vomiting are administered as efforts are made simultaneously to identify and treat the cause. In the elderly patient, dehydration may be the cause of hypovolemic shock.

\section*{FLUID AND BLOOD REPLACEMENT}

Beyond reversing the primary cause of the decreased intravascular volume, fluid replacement (also referred to as fluid resuscitation) is of primary concern. At least two large-gauge intravenous lines are inserted to establish access for fluid administration. Two intravenous lines allow simultaneous administration of fluid, medications, and blood component therapy if required. Because the goal of the fluid replacement is to restore intravascular volume, it is necessary to administer fluids that will remain in the intravascular compartment and thus avoid creating fluid shifts from the intravascular compartment into the intracellular compartment. Table 15-2 summarizes the fluids commonly used in treating shock.

\section*{Table 15-2 - Fluid Replacement in Shock}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline FLUIDS & ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Crystalloids} \\
\hline 0.9\% sodium chloride (normal saline solution) & Widely available, inexpensive & Requires large volume of infusion; can cause pulmonary edema \\
\hline Lactated Ringer's & Lactate ion helps buffer metabolic acidosis & Requires large volume of infusion; can cause pulmonary edema \\
\hline Hypertonic saline (3\%, 5\%, 7.5\%) & Small volume needed to restore intravascular volume & Danger of hypernatremia \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Colloids} \\
\hline Albumin (5\%, 25\%) & Rapidly expands plasma volume & Expensive; requires human donors; limited supply; can cause heart failure \\

\hline Hetastarch & Synthetic; less expensive than albumin; effect lasts up to 36 h & Prolongs bleeding and clotting times \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Lactated Ringer's and $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride solutions are isotonic crystalloid fluids commonly used in treating hypovolemic shock (Jindal et al., 2000). Large amounts of fluid must be administered to restore intravascular volume because isotonic crystalloid solutions move freely between the fluid compartments of the body and do not remain in the vascular system.

Colloids (eg, albumin, hetastarch, and dextran) may also be used. Dextran is not indicated if the cause of the hypovolemic shock is hemorrhage because it interferes with platelet aggregation.

Blood products, also colloids, may need to be administered, particularly when the cause of the hypovolemic shock is hemorrhage. Because of the risk of transmitting bloodborne viruses and the scarcity of blood products, however, these products are used only if other alternatives are unavailable or blood loss is extensive and rapid. Packed red blood cells are administered to replenish the patient's oxygen-carrying capacity in conjunction with other fluids that will expand volume. Current recommendations are to base the need for transfusions on the patient's oxygenation needs, which are determined by vital signs, blood gas values, and clinical appearance rather than using an arbitrary laboratory value. Synthetic forms of blood (ie, compounds capable of carrying oxygen in the same way that blood does) are potential alternatives.

\section*{REDISTRIBUTION OF FLUID}

In addition to administering fluids to restore intravascular volume, positioning the patient properly assists fluid redistribution. A modified Trendelenburg position (Fig. 15-4) is recommended in hypovolemic shock. Elevating the legs promotes the return of venous blood. Positioning the patient in a full Trendelenburg position, however, makes breathing difficult and therefore is not recommended.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

If fluid administration fails to reverse hypovolemic shock, then the same medications given in cardiogenic shock are used because unreversed hypovolemic shock progresses to cardiogenic shock (the vicious circle).

If the underlying cause of the hypovolemia is dehydration, medications are also administered to reverse the cause of the dehydration. For example, insulin is administered if dehydration is
secondary to hyperglycemia; desmopressin (DDAVP) is administered for diabetes insipidus, antidiarrheal agents for diarrhea, and antiemetic medications for vomiting.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Primary prevention of shock is an essential focus of nursing intervention. Hypovolemic shock can be prevented in some instances by closely monitoring patients who are at risk for fluid deficits and assisting with fluid replacement before intravascular volume is depleted. In other circumstances, hypovolemic shock cannot be prevented, and nursing care focuses on assisting with treatment targeted at treating its cause and restoring intravascular volume.

General nursing measures include ensuring safe administration of prescribed fluids and medications and documenting their administration and effects. Another important nursing role is monitoring for signs of complications and side effects of treatment and reporting these signs early in treatment.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-327.jpg?height=549&width=837&top_left_y=1826&top_left_x=1127}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}

\section*{ADMINISTERING BLOOD AND FLUIDS SAFELY}

Administering blood transfusions safely is a vital nursing role. In emergency situations, it is important to obtain blood specimens quickly to obtain a baseline complete blood count and to type and cross-match the blood in anticipation of blood transfusions. The patient who receives a transfusion of blood products must be monitored closely for adverse effects (see Chap. 33).

Fluid replacement complications can occur, often when large volumes are administered rapidly. Therefore, the nurse monitors the patient closely for cardiovascular overload and pulmonary edema. The risk of these complications is increased in the elderly and in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. Hemodynamic pressure, vital signs, arterial blood gases, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and fluid intake and output are among the parameters monitored. The patient's temperature should also be monitored closely to ensure that rapid fluid resuscitation does not precipitate hypothermia. Intravenous fluids may need to be warmed during the administration of large volumes. Physical assessment focuses on observing the jugular veins for distention and monitoring jugular venous pressure. Jugular venous pressure is low in hypovolemic shock; it increases with effective treatment and is significantly increased with fluid overload and heart failure. The nurse needs to monitor cardiac and respiratory status closely and report changes in blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate, rhythm, and lung sounds to the physician.

\section*{IMPLEMENTING OTHER MEASURES}

Oxygen is administered to increase the amount of oxygen carried by available hemoglobin in the blood. A patient who is confused may feel apprehensive with an oxygen mask or cannula in place, and frequent explanations about the need for the mask may reduce some of the patient's fear and anxiety. Simultaneously, the nurse must direct efforts to the safety and comfort of the patient.

\section*{Cardiogenic Shock}

Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart's ability to contract and to pump blood is impaired and the supply of oxygen is inadequate for the heart and tissues. The causes of cardiogenic shock are known as either coronary or noncoronary. Coronary cardiogenic shock is more common than noncoronary cardiogenic shock and is seen most often in patients with myocardial infarction. Coronary cardiogenic shock occurs when a significant amount of the left ventricular myocardium has been destroyed (Price et al., 1999). Patients experiencing an anterior wall myocardial infarction are at the greatest risk for developing cardiogenic shock because of the potentially extensive damage to the left ventricle caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (Chart 15-4). Non-coronary causes can be related to
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-328.jpg?height=362&width=872&top_left_y=2248&top_left_x=106)
severe metabolic problems (severe hypoxemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hypocalcemia) and tension pneumothorax.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

In cardiogenic shock, cardiac output, which is a function of both stroke volume and heart rate, is compromised. When stroke volume and heart rate decrease or become erratic, blood pressure drops and tissue perfusion is compromised. Along with other tissues and organs being deprived of adequate blood supply, the heart muscle itself receives inadequate blood. The result is impaired tissue perfusion. Because impaired tissue perfusion weakens the heart and impairs its ability to pump blood forward, the ventricle does not fully eject its volume of blood at systole. As a result, fluid accumulates in the lungs. This sequence of events can occur rapidly or over a period of days (Fig. 15-5).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Patients in cardiogenic shock may experience angina pain and develop dysrhythmias and hemodynamic instability.

\section*{Medical Management}

The goals of medical management are to (1) limit further myocardial damage and preserve the healthy myocardium and (2) improve the cardiac function by increasing cardiac contractility, decreasing ventricular afterload, or both (Price et al., 1999). In general, these goals are achieved by increasing oxygen supply to the heart muscle while reducing oxygen demands.

\section*{CORRECTION OF UNDERLYING CAUSES}

As with all forms of shock, the underlying cause of cardiogenic shock must be corrected. It is necessary first to treat the oxygenation needs of the heart muscle to ensure its continued ability to pump blood to other organs. In the case of coronary cardiogenic shock, the patient may require thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In the case of noncoronary cardiogenic shock, the patient may require a cardiac valve replacement or correction of a dysrhythmia. For further explanation of these procedures, refer to Chapters 27 and 28.

\section*{INITIATION OF FIRST-LINE TREATMENT}

First-line treatment of cardiogenic shock involves the following actions:
- Supplying supplemental oxygen
- Controlling chest pain
- Providing selected fluid support
- Administering vasoactive medications
- Controlling heart rate with medication or by implementation of a transthoracic or intravenous pacemaker
- Implementing mechanical cardiac support (intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation therapy, ventricular assist systems, or extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass)

0xygenation. In the early stages of shock, supplemental oxygen is administered by nasal cannula at a rate of 2 to $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ to achieve an oxygen saturation exceeding $90 \%$. Monitoring arterial blood gas values and pulse oximetry values helps to indicate whether the patient requires a more aggressive method of oxygen delivery.

Pain Control. If the patient experiences chest pain, morphine sulfate is administered intravenously for pain relief. In addition to relieving pain, morphine dilates the blood vessels. This reduces the workload of the heart by both decreasing the cardiac filling pressure (preload) and reducing the pressure against which the heart muscle has to eject blood (afterload). Morphine also relieves the patient's anxiety. Cardiac enzyme (CPK-MB and cTn-I) levels are measured, and serial 12-lead electrocardiograms are obtained to assess the degree of myocardial damage.

Hemodynamic Monitoring. Hemodynamic monitoring is initiated to assess the patient's response to treatment. In many institutions, this is performed in the intensive care unit, where an arterial line can be inserted. The arterial line enables accurate and continuous monitoring of blood pressure and provides a port from which to obtain frequent arterial blood samples without having to perform repeated arterial punctures. A multilumen pulmonary artery catheter is inserted to allow measurement of the pulmonary artery pressures, myocardial filling pressures, cardiac output, and pulmonary and systemic resistance. For more information, see Chapter 30.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

Vasoactive medication therapy consists of multiple pharmacologic strategies to restore and maintain adequate cardiac output. In coronary cardiogenic shock, the aims of vasoactive medication therapy are improved cardiac contractility, decreased preload and afterload, or stable heart rate.

Because improving contractility and decreasing cardiac workload are opposing pharmacologic actions, two classifications of medications may be administered in combination: sympathomimetic agents and vasodilators. Sympathomimetic medications increase cardiac output by mimicking the action of the sympathetic nervous system through vasoconstriction, resulting in increased preload, and by increasing myocardial contractility (inotropic action) or increasing the heart rate (chronotropic action). Vasodilators are used to decrease preload and afterload, thus reducing the workload of the heart and the oxygen demand. Medications commonly combined to treat cardiogenic shock include dobutamine, dopamine, and nitroglycerin (see Table 15-1).

Dobutamine. Dobutamine (Dobutrex) produces inotropic effects by stimulating myocardial beta receptors, increasing the strength
of myocardial activity and improving cardiac output. Myocardial alpha-adrenergic receptors are also stimulated, resulting in decreased pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance (decreased afterload). Dobutamine enhances the strength of cardiac contraction, improving stroke volume ejection and overall cardiac output (Jindal et al., 2000; Price et al., 1999).

Nitroglycerin. Intravenous nitroglycerin (Tridil) in low doses acts as a venous vasodilator and therefore reduces preload. At higher doses, nitroglycerin causes arterial vasodilation and therefore reduces afterload as well. These actions, in combination with medium-dose dopamine, increase cardiac output while minimizing cardiac workload. Additionally, vasodilation enhances blood flow to the myocardium, improving oxygen delivery to the weakened heart muscle (Price et al., 1999).

Dopamine. Dopamine (Intropin) is a sympathomimetic agent that has varying vasoactive effects depending on the dosage. It may be used with dobutamine and nitroglycerine to improve tissue perfusion. Low-dose dopamine ( 0.5 to $3.0 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ) increases renal and mesenteric blood flow, thereby preventing ischemia of these organs because shock causes blood to be shunted away from the kidneys and the mesentery. This dosage, however, does not improve cardiac output. Medium-dose dopamine ( 4 to $8 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ) has sympathomimetic properties and improves contractility (inotropic action) and slightly increases the heart rate (chronotropic action). At this dosage, dopamine increases cardiac output and therefore is desirable. High-dose dopamine ( 8 to $10 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ) predominantly causes vasoconstriction, which increases afterload and thus increases cardiac workload. Because this effect is undesirable in patients with cardiogenic shock, dopamine dosages must be carefully titrated. Once the patient's blood pressure stabilizes, low-dose dopamine may be continued for its effect of promoting renal perfusion in particular. In severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs in the later stages of shock, dopamine's effectiveness is diminished. To maximize the effectiveness of any vasoactive agent, metabolic acidosis must first be corrected. The physician may prescribe intravenous sodium bicarbonate to treat the acidosis (Jindal et al., 2000).

Other Vasoactive Medications. Additional vasoactive agents that may be used in managing cardiogenic shock include norepinephrine (Levophed), epinephrine (Adrenalin), milrinone (Primacor), amrinone (Inocor), vasopressin (Pitressin), and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine). Each of these medications stimulates different receptors of the sympathetic nervous system. A combination of these medications may be prescribed, depending on the patient's response to treatment. All vasoactive medications have adverse effects, making specific medications more useful than others at different stages of shock. Diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) may be administered to reduce the workload of the heart by reducing fluid accumulation (see Table 15-1).

Antiarrhythmic Medications. Antiarrhythmic medication is also part of the medication regimen in cardiogenic shock. Multiple factors, such as hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base imbalances, contribute to serious cardiac dysrhythmias in all patients with shock. Additionally, as a compensatory response to decreased cardiac output and blood pressure, the heart rate increases beyond normal limits. This impedes cardiac output further by shortening diastole and thereby decreasing the time for ventricular filling. Consequently, antiarrhythmic medications are required to stabilize the heart rate. For a full discussion of cardiac
dysrhythmias as well as commonly prescribed medications, see Chapter 27. General principles regarding the administration of vasoactive medications are discussed later in this chapter.

Fluid Therapy. In addition to medications, appropriate fluid is necessary in treating cardiogenic shock. Administration of fluids must be monitored closely to detect signs of fluid overload. Incremental intravenous fluid boluses are cautiously administered to determine optimal filling pressures for improving cardiac output. A fluid bolus should never be given quickly because rapid fluid administration in patients with cardiac failure may result in acute pulmonary edema.

\section*{MECHANICAL ASSISTIVE DEVICES}

If cardiac output does not improve despite supplemental oxygen, vasoactive medications, and fluid boluses, mechanical assistive devices are used temporarily to improve the heart's ability to pump. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is one means of providing temporary circulatory assistance (see Chap. 30). A polyurethane balloon catheter is inserted percutaneously through the common femoral artery and advanced into the descending thoracic aorta. The balloon catheter is connected to a console containing a gasfilled pump. The timing of the balloon inflation is synchronized electrocardiographically with the beginning of diastole, and the balloon deflation occurs just before systole. The goals of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation include the following:
- Increased stroke volume
- Improved coronary artery perfusion
- Decreased preload
- Decreased cardiac workload
- Decreased myocardial oxygen demand (Kumar et al., 2000)

Other means of mechanical assistance include left and right ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts. These devices are electrical pumps or pumps driven by air. They assist or replace the ventricular pumping action of the heart. Human heart transplantation may be the only option remaining for a patient who has cardiogenic shock and who cannot be weaned from mechanical assistive devices. (Mechanical assistive devices and heart transplantation are discussed in Chap. 30.)

Another short-term means of providing cardiac or pulmonary support to the patient in cardiogenic shock is through an extracorporeal device similar to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) used in open-heart surgery. The CPB system requires systemic anticoagulation, arterial and venous cannulation of the femoral artery and vein, and connection to a centrifugal, oxygenated pump. The catheter tip is advanced into the right atrium. This system lowers left and right ventricular pressures, reducing the workload and oxygen needs of the heart. Complications of CPB include coagulopathies, myocardial ischemia, infection, and thromboembolism. CPB is used only in emergency situations until definitive treatment, such as heart transplantation, can be initiated.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{PREVENTING CARDIOGENIC SHOCK}

In some circumstances, identifying patients at risk early and promoting adequate oxygenation of the heart muscle and decreasing cardiac workload can prevent cardiogenic shock. This can be accomplished by conserving the patient's energy, promptly relieving angina, and administering supplemental oxygen. Often, however, cardiogenic shock cannot be prevented. In such in-
stances, nursing management includes working with other members of the health care team to prevent shock from progressing and to restore adequate cardiac function and tissue perfusion.

\section*{MONITORING HEMODYNAMIC STATUS}

A major role of the nurse is monitoring the patient's hemodynamic and cardiac status. Arterial lines and electrocardiographic monitoring equipment must be maintained and functioning properly. The nurse anticipates the medications, intravenous fluids, and equipment that might be used and is ready to assist in implementing these measures. Changes in hemodynamic, cardiac, and pulmonary status are documented and reported promptly. Additionally, adventitious breath sounds, changes in cardiac rhythm, and other abnormal physical assessment findings are reported immediately.

\section*{ADMINISTERING MEDICATIONS}

\section*{AND INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS}

The nurse has a critical role in safe and accurate administration of intravenous fluids and medications. Fluid overload and pulmonary edema are risks because of ineffective cardiac function and accumulation of blood and fluid in the pulmonary tissues. The nurse documents and records medications and treatments that are administered as well as the patient's response to treatment.

The nurse needs to be knowledgeable about the desired effects as well as the side effects of medications. For example, it is important to monitor the patient for decreased blood pressure after administering morphine or nitroglycerin. The patient receiving thrombolytic therapy must be monitored for bleeding. Arterial and venous puncture sites must be observed for bleeding and pressure must be applied at the sites if bleeding occurs. Neurologic assessment is essential after the administration of thrombolytic therapy to assess for the potential complication of cerebral hemorrhage associated with the therapy. Intravenous infusions must be observed closely because tissue necrosis and sloughing may occur if vasopressor medications infiltrate the tissues. Urine output, BUN, and serum creatinine levels are monitored to detect decreased renal function secondary to the effects of cardiogenic shock or its treatment.

\section*{MAINTAINING INTRA-AORTIC}

\section*{BALLOON COUNTERPULSATION}

The nurse plays a critical role in caring for the patient receiving intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (see Chap. 30). The nurse makes ongoing timing adjustments of the balloon pump to maximize its effectiveness by synchronizing it with the cardiac cycle. The patient is at great risk for circulatory compromise to the leg on the side where the catheter for the balloon has been placed; therefore, the nurse must frequently check the neurovascular status of the lower extremities.

\section*{ENHANCING SAFETY AND COMFORT}

Throughout care, the nurse must take an active role in safeguarding the patient, enhancing comfort, and reducing anxiety. This includes administering medication to relieve chest pain, preventing infection at the multiple arterial and venous line insertion sites, protecting the skin, and monitoring respiratory function. Proper positioning of the patient promotes effective breathing without decreasing blood pressure and may also increase the patient's comfort while reducing anxiety.

Brief explanations about procedures that are being performed and the use of comforting touch often provide reassurance to the patient and family. Families are usually anxious and benefit from
opportunities to see and talk to the patient. Explanations of treatments and the patient's response to them are often comforting to family members.

\section*{Circulatory Shock}

Circulatory or distributive shock occurs when blood volume is abnormally displaced in the vasculature-for example, when blood volume pools in peripheral blood vessels. The displacement of blood volume causes a relative hypovolemia because not enough blood returns to the heart, which leads to subsequent inadequate tissue perfusion. The ability of the blood vessels to constrict helps return the blood to the heart. Thus, the vascular tone is determined both by central regulatory mechanisms, as in blood pressure regulation, and by local regulatory mechanisms, as in tissue demands for oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, circulatory shock can be caused either by a loss of sympathetic tone or by release of biochemical mediators from cells.

The varied mechanisms leading to the initial vasodilation in circulatory shock further subdivide this classification of shock into three types: (1) septic shock, (2) neurogenic shock, and (3) anaphylactic shock.

The different types of circulatory shock cause variations in the pathophysiologic chain of events and are explained here separately. In all types of circulatory shock, massive arterial and venous dilation allows blood to pool peripherally. Arterial dilation reduces systemic vascular resistance. Initially, cardiac output can be high in circulatory shock, both from the reduction in afterload (systemic vascular resistance) and from the heart muscle's increased effort to maintain perfusion despite the incompetent vasculature secondary to arterial dilation. Pooling of blood in the periphery results in decreased venous return. Decreased venous return results in decreased stroke volume and decreased cardiac output. Decreased cardiac output, in turn, causes decreased blood pressure and ultimately decreased tissue perfusion. Figure 15-6 presents the pathophysiologic sequence of events in circulatory shock.

\section*{SEPTIC SHOCK}

Septic shock is the most common type of circulatory shock and is caused by widespread infection (Chart 15-5). Despite the increased sophistication of antibiotic therapy, the incidence of septic shock has continued to rise during the past 60 years. It is the most common cause of death in noncoronary intensive care units in the United States and the 13th leading cause of death in the U.S. population (Balk, 2000a). Elderly patients are at particular risk for sepsis because of decreased physiologic reserves and an aging immune system (Balk, 2000a; Vincent \& Ferreira, 2000). Toxic shock syndrome, a specific form of septic shock, is described in Chapter 47.

Nosocomial infections (infections occurring in the hospital) in critically ill patients most frequently originate in the bloodstream, lungs, and urinary tract (in decreasing order of frequency) (Richards, Edwards, Culver et al., 1999). The source of infection is an important determinant of the clinical outcome. The greatest risk of sepsis occurs in patients with bacteremia (bloodstream) and pneumonia (Simon \& Trenholme, 2000). Other infections that may progress to septic shock include intra-abdominal infections, wound infections, bacteremia associated with intravascular catheters (Eggimann \& Pittet, 2001), and indwelling urinary catheters. Additional risk factors that contribute to the growing incidence of septic shock are the increased awareness and identi-

fication of septic shock; the increased number of immunocompromised patients (due to malnutrition, alcoholism, malignancy, and diabetes mellitus); the increased incidence of invasive procedures and indwelling medical devices; the increased number of resistant microorganisms; and the increasingly older population (Balk, 2000a). The incidence of septic shock can be reduced by débriding wounds to remove necrotic tissue and carrying out infection control practices, including the use of meticulous aseptic technique, properly cleaning and maintaining equipment, and using thorough hand-hygiene techniques.

The most common causative microorganisms of septic shock are the gram-negative bacteria; however, there is also an increased

incidence of gram-positive bacterial infections. Currently, grampositive bacteria are responsible for $50 \%$ of bacteremic events (Simon \& Trenholme, 2000). Other infectious agents such as viruses and funguses also can cause septic shock.

When a microorganism invades body tissues, the patient exhibits an immune response. This immune response provokes the activation of biochemical mediators associated with an inflammatory response and produces a variety of effects leading to shock. Increased capillary permeability, which leads to fluid seeping from the capillaries, and vasodilation are two such effects that interrupt the ability of the body to provide adequate perfusion, oxygen, and nutrients to the tissues and cells.

Septic shock typically occurs in two phases. The first phase, referred to as the hyperdynamic, progressive phase, is characterized by a high cardiac output with systemic vasodilation. The blood pressure may remain within normal limits. The heart rate increases, progressing to tachycardia. The patient becomes hyperthermic and febrile, with warm, flushed skin and bounding pulses. The respiratory rate is elevated. Urinary output may remain at normal levels or decrease. Gastrointestinal status may be compromised as evidenced by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased bowel sounds. The patient may exhibit subtle changes in mental status, such as confusion or agitation.

The later phase, referred to as the hypodynamic, irreversible phase, is characterized by low cardiac output with vasoconstriction, reflecting the body's effort to compensate for the hypovolemia caused by the loss of intravascular volume through the capillaries. In this phase, the blood pressure drops and the skin is cool and pale. Temperature may be normal or below normal. Heart and respiratory rates remain rapid. The patient no longer produces urine, and multiple organ dysfunction progressing to failure develops.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) presents clinically like sepsis. The only difference between SIRS and sepsis is that there is no identifiable source of infection. SIRS stimulates an overwhelming inflammatory immunologic and hormonal response, similar to that seen in septic patients. Despite an absence of infection, antibiotic agents may still be administered because of the possibility of unrecognized infection. Additional therapies directed to the support of the patient with SIRS are similar to those for sepsis. If the inflammatory process progresses, septic shock may develop.

\section*{Medical Management}

Current treatment of septic shock involves identifying and eliminating the cause of infection. Specimens of blood, sputum, urine, wound drainage, and invasive catheter tips are collected for culture using aseptic technique.

Any potential routes of infection must be eliminated. Intravenous lines are removed and reinserted at other body sites. Antibiotic-coated intravenous central lines may be placed to decrease the risk of invasive line-related bacteremia in high-risk patients, such as the elderly (Eggimann \& Pittet, 2001). If possible, urinary catheters are removed. Any abscesses are drained and necrotic areas débrided.

Fluid replacement must be instituted to correct the hypovolemia that results from the incompetent vasculature and inflammatory response. Crystalloids, colloids, and blood products may be administered to increase the intravascular volume.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}

If the infecting organism is unknown, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents are started until culture and sensitivity reports are received (Simon \& Trenholme, 2000). A third-generation cephalosporin
plus an aminoglycoside may be prescribed initially. This combination works against most gram-negative and some gram-positive organisms. When culture and sensitivity reports are available, the antibiotic agent may be changed to one that is more specific to the infecting organism and less toxic to the patient.

Research efforts show promise for improving the outcomes of septic shock. Although past treatments focused on destroying the infectious organism, emphasis is now on altering the patient's immune response to the organism. The cell walls of gram-negative bacteria contain a lipopolysaccharide, an endotoxin released during phagocytosis (Abraham et al., 2001). Endotoxin and/or gram-positive cell wall products interact with inflammatory biochemical mediators, initiating an intense inflammatory response and systemic effects that lead to shock. Current research focuses on the development of medications that will inhibit or modulate the effects of biochemical mediators, such as endotoxin and procalcitonin (Bernard, Vincent, Laterre, et al., 2001). The focus on immunotherapy in treating septic shock is expected to shed light on how the cellular response to infection leads to shock.

Recombinant human activated protein C (APC), or drotrecogin alfa (Xigris), has recently been demonstrated to reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis (Bernard, Artigas, Dellinger et al., 2001). It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of adults with severe sepsis and resulting acute organ dysfunction who are at high risk of death. It acts as an antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and profibrinolytic agent. Its most common serious side effect is bleeding. Therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with active internal bleeding, recent hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial surgery, or head injury.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL THERAPY}

Aggressive nutritional supplementation is critical in the management of septic shock because malnutrition further impairs the patient's resistance to infection. Nutritional supplementation should be initiated within the first 24 hours of the onset of shock (Mizock, 2000). Enteral feedings are preferred to the parenteral route because of the increased risk of iatrogenic infection associated with intravenous catheters; however, enteral feedings may not be possible if decreased perfusion to the gastrointestinal tract reduces peristalsis and impairs absorption.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse caring for any patient in any setting must keep in mind the risks of sepsis and the high mortality rate associated with septic shock. All invasive procedures must be carried out with aseptic technique after careful hand hygiene. Additionally, intravenous lines, arterial and venous puncture sites, surgical incisions, traumatic wounds, urinary catheters, and pressure ulcers are monitored for signs of infection in all patients. The nurse identifies patients at particular risk for sepsis and septic shock (ie, elderly and immunosuppressed patients or patients with extensive trauma or burns or diabetes), keeping in mind that these high-risk patients may not develop typical or classic signs of infection and sepsis. Confusion, for example, may be the first sign of infection and sepsis in elderly patients.

When caring for the patient with septic shock, the nurse collaborates with other members of the health care team to identify the site and source of sepsis and the specific organisms involved. Appropriate specimens for culture and sensitivity are often obtained by the nurse.

Elevated body temperature (hyperthermia) is common with sepsis and raises the patient's metabolic rate and oxygen consumption. Fever is one of the body's natural mechanisms for
fighting infections. Thus, an elevated temperature may not be treated unless it reaches dangerous levels (more than $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \left[104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right]$ ) or unless the patient is uncomfortable. Efforts may be made to reduce the temperature by administering acetaminophen or applying hypothermia blankets. During these therapies, the nurse monitors the patient closely for shivering, which increases oxygen consumption. Efforts to increase comfort are important if the patient experiences fever, chills, or shivering.

The nurse administers prescribed intravenous fluids and medications, including antibiotic agents and vasoactive medications to restore vascular volume. Because of decreased perfusion to the kidneys and liver, serum concentrations of antibiotic agents that are normally cleared by these organs may increase and produce toxic effects. Therefore, the nurse monitors blood levels (antibiotic agent, BUN, creatinine, white blood count) and reports increased levels to the physician.

As with other types of shock, the nurse monitors the patient's hemodynamic status, fluid intake and output, and nutritional status. Daily weights and close monitoring of serum albumin levels help determine the patient's protein requirements.

\section*{NEUROGENIC SHOCK}

In neurogenic shock, vasodilation occurs as a result of a loss of sympathetic tone. This can be caused by spinal cord injury, spinal anesthesia, or nervous system damage. It can also result from the depressant action of medications or lack of glucose (eg, insulin reaction or shock).

Neurogenic shock may have a prolonged course (spinal cord injury) or a short one (syncope or fainting). It is characterized by dry, warm skin rather than the cool, moist skin seen in hypovolemic shock. Another characteristic is bradycardia, rather than the tachycardia that characterizes other forms of shock.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of neurogenic shock involves restoring sympathetic tone either through the stabilization of a spinal cord injury or, in the instance of spinal anesthesia, by positioning the patient properly. Specific treatment of neurogenic shock depends on its cause. Further discussion of managing the patient with a spinal cord injury is presented in Chapter 63. If hypoglycemia (insulin shock) is the cause, glucose is rapidly administered. Hypoglycemia and the insulin reaction are described further in Chapter 41.

\section*{Nursing Management}

It is important to elevate and maintain the head of the bed at least 30 degrees to prevent neurogenic shock when a patient is receiving spinal or epidural anesthesia. Elevation of the head of the bed helps to prevent the spread of the anesthetic agent up the spinal cord. In suspected spinal cord injury, neurogenic shock may be prevented by carefully immobilizing the patient to prevent further damage to the spinal cord.

Nursing interventions are directed toward supporting cardiovascular and neurologic function until the usually transient episode of neurogenic shock resolves. Applying elastic compression stockings and elevating the foot of the bed may minimize pooling of blood in the legs. Pooled blood increases the risk for thrombus formation. Therefore, the nurse needs to check the patient daily for any redness, tenderness, warmth of the calves, and positive Homans' sign (calf pain on dorsiflexion of the foot). To elicit Homans' sign, the nurse lifts the patient's leg, flexing it at the
knee and dorsiflexing the foot. If the patient complains of pain in the calf, the sign is positive and suggestive of deep vein thrombosis.

Administering heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (Lovenox) as prescribed, applying elastic compression stockings, or initiating pneumatic compression of the legs may prevent thrombus formation. Performing passive range of motion of the immobile extremities helps promote circulation.

Patients who have experienced a spinal cord injury may not report pain caused by internal injuries. Therefore, in the immediate postinjury period, the nurse must monitor the patient closely for signs of internal bleeding that could lead to hypovolemic shock.

\section*{ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK}

Anaphylactic shock is caused by a severe allergic reaction when a patient who has already produced antibodies to a foreign substance (antigen) develops a systemic antigen-antibody reaction. This process requires that the patient has previously been exposed to the substance. An antigen-antibody reaction provokes mast cells to release potent vasoactive substances, such as histamine or bradykinin, that cause widespread vasodilation and capillary permeability. Anaphylactic shock occurs rapidly and is life-threatening. Because anaphylactic shock occurs in patients already exposed to an antigen who have developed antibodies to it, it can often be prevented. Therefore, patients with known allergies need to understand the consequences of subsequent exposure to the antigen and should wear medical identification that lists their sensitivities. This could prevent inadvertent administration of a medication that would lead to anaphylactic shock. Additionally, the patient and family need instruction about emergency use of medications to treat anaphylaxis.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment of anaphylactic shock requires removing the causative antigen (eg, discontinuing an antibiotic agent), administering medications that restore vascular tone, and providing emergency support of basic life functions. Epinephrine is given for its vasoconstrictive action. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is administered to reverse the effects of histamine, thereby reducing capillary permeability. These medications are given intravenously. Nebulized medications, such as albuterol (Proventil), may be given to reverse histamine-induced bronchospasm.

If cardiac arrest and respiratory arrest are imminent or have occurred, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed. Endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy may be necessary to establish an airway. Intravenous lines are inserted to provide access for administering fluids and medications. Anaphylaxis and specific chemical mediators are discussed further in Chapter 53.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The nurse has an important role in preventing anaphylactic shock: assessing all patients for allergies or previous reactions to antigens (eg, medications, blood products, foods, contrast agents, latex) and communicating the existence of these allergies or reactions to others. Additionally, the nurse assesses the patient's understanding of previous reactions and steps taken by the patient and family to prevent further exposure to antigens. When new allergies are identified, the nurse advises the patient to wear or carry identification that names the specific allergen or antigen.

When administering any new medication, the nurse observes the patient for an allergic reaction. This is especially important with intravenous medications. Allergy to penicillin is one of the most common causes of anaphylactic shock. Patients who have a penicillin allergy may also develop an allergy to similar medications. For example, they may react to cefazolin sodium (Ancef) because it has a similar antimicrobial action of attaching to the penicillin-binding proteins found on the walls of infectious organisms. Previous adverse drug reactions increase the risk that an elderly patient will develop an undesirable reaction to a new medication. If the elderly patient reports an allergy to a medication, the nurse must be aware of the risks involved in the administration of similar medications.

In the hospital and outpatient diagnostic testing sites, the nurse must identify patients at risk for anaphylactic reactions to contrast agents (radiopaque, dye-like substances that may contain iodine) used for diagnostic tests. These include patients with a known allergy to iodine or fish or those who have had previous allergic reactions to contrast agents. This information must be conveyed to the staff at the diagnostic testing site, including x-ray personnel.

The nurse must be knowledgeable about the clinical signs of anaphylaxis, must take immediate action if signs and symptoms occur, and must be prepared to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation if cardiorespiratory arrest occurs. In addition to monitoring the patient's response to treatment, the nurse assists with intubation if needed, monitors the hemodynamic status, ensures intravenous access for administration of medications, administers prescribed medications and fluids, and documents treatments and their effects.

Community health and home care nurses whose role includes administering medications, including antibiotic agents, in the patient's home or other settings must be prepared to administer epinephrine subcutaneously or intramuscularly in the event of an anaphylactic reaction.

After recovery from anaphylaxis, the patient and family require an explanation of the event. Further, the nurse provides instruction about avoiding future exposure to antigens and administering emergency medications to treat anaphylaxis (see Chap. 53).

\section*{Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome}

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is altered organ function in an acutely ill patient that requires medical intervention to support continued organ function. The disorder can be further categorized as primary or secondary MODS.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Primary MODS is the result of direct tissue insult, which then leads to impaired perfusion or ischemia. Secondary MODS is most often a complication of septic shock or SIRS. However, MODS may be a complication of any form of shock because of inadequate tissue perfusion. As previously described, in shock all organ systems suffer damage from a lack of adequate perfusion that can result in organ failure. A syndrome of sequential organ failure has been further observed. The exact mechanism that triggers this syndrome is unknown.

Although various causes of MODS have been identified, including dead or injured tissue, infection, and perfusion deficits, it is not yet possible to predict which patients will develop MODS. This is partly because much of the organ damage occurs at the cel-
lular level and therefore cannot be directly observed or measured. The organ failure usually begins in the lungs and is followed by failure of the liver, gastrointestinal system, and kidneys (Balk, 2000b). Advanced age, malnutrition, and coexisting diseases appear to increase the risk of MODS in an acutely ill patient.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The clinical course of MODS follows one of two patterns. In both patterns, there is an initial event that results in low blood pressure. The cause of the drop in blood pressure is treated, and the patient appears to respond. In the first pattern of MODS (primary MODS), which occurs most often when the initiating event is a pulmonary one such as lung injury, the patient experiences respiratory compromise that necessitates intubation. This usually occurs within 72 hours of the initiating event. Respiratory failure leads rapidly to MODS, resulting in a mortality rate of $30 \%$ to 75\% (Fein \& Calalag-Colucci, 2000).

In secondary MODS, the pattern is more insidious. It occurs most often in the patient with septic shock and progressively unfolds over about 1 month. The patient also experiences respiratory failure and requires intubation. The patient remains hemodynamically stable for about 7 to 14 days. Despite this apparent stability, the patient exhibits a hypermetabolic state characterized by hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose level), hyperlacticacidemia (excess of lactic acid in the blood), and polyuria (excessive urinary output). The metabolic rate is 1.5 to 2 times basal metabolic rate. Infection is usually present, and skin breakdown begins to occur. During this stage, there is a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass (autocatabolism). If the hypermetabolic phase can be reversed, patients may survive with some damage to affected organ systems (Mizock, 2000). If the hypermetabolic process cannot be halted and cells do not receive adequate oxygen and nutrients, irreversible organ failure and death occur.

If the hypermetabolic phase cannot be reversed, MODS progresses and is characterized by jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia (liver failure), and oliguria progressing to anuria (renal failure), often requiring dialysis. The patient becomes less hemodynamically stable and begins to require vasoactive medications and fluid support. Because of a lack of consistent definitions to describe organ failure, the exact incidence of MODS is hard to define (Balk, 2000b; Vincent \& Ferreira, 2000). However, it is reasonable to say that the onset of organ dysfunction is an ominous prognostic sign; the more organs that fail, the worse the outcome.

\section*{Medical Management}

Prevention remains the top priority in managing MODS. Elderly patients are at increased risk of MODS because of the lack of physiologic reserve associated with aging and the natural degenerative process, especially immune compromise (Balk, 2000b). Early detection and documentation of initial signs of infection are essential in managing elderly patients with MODS. Subtle changes in mentation and a gradual rise in temperature are early warning signs. Other patients at risk of MODS are those with chronic illness, malnutrition, immunosuppression, and surgical or traumatic wounds.

If preventive measures fail, treatment measures to reverse MODS are aimed at (1) controlling the initiating event, (2) promoting adequate organ perfusion, and (3) providing nutritional support.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The general plan of nursing care for the patient with MODS is the same as that for the patient in septic shock. Primary nursing interventions are aimed at supporting the patient and monitoring organ perfusion until primary organ insults are halted. Providing information and support to family members is a critical role of the nurse in caring for patients with MODS. Addressing end-of-life decisions is an important role of the health care team to ensure that supportive therapies are congruent with the patient's wishes.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The population as a whole is aging: the most rapidly growing population group consists of people over 65 years of age. The physiologic changes associated with aging, coupled with pathologic and chronic disease states, place the older individual at increased risk of developing a state of shock and possibly MODS. Medications such as beta-blocking agents (metoprolol [Lopressor]) used to treat hypertension may mask tachycardia, a primary compensatory mechanism to increase cardiac output, during hypovolemic states. The aging immune system may not mount a truly febrile response (temperature more than $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), but an increasing trend in body temperature should be addressed. The heart does not function well in hypoxemic states, and the aging heart may respond to decreased myocardial oxygenation with dysrhythmias that may be misinterpreted as a normal part of the aging process. Lastly, changes in mentation may be inappropriately misinterpreted as dementia. The older individual with a sudden change in mentation should be aggressively treated for the presence of infection and organ hypoperfusion. The elderly patient can overcome shock states if signs and symptoms are treated early with aggressive and supportive therapies. Nurses play an essential role in assessing and interpreting subtle changes in the older patient's response to illness.

\section*{PROMOTING COMMUNICATION}

The nurse encourages frequent and open communication about treatment modalities and options to ensure that the patient's wishes regarding medical management are met. For patients who survive MODS, communicating the goals of rehabilitation and informing the patient of progress toward those goals are essential, as the massive loss of skeletal muscle mass makes rehabilitation a long, slow process. A strong nurse-patient relationship built on effective communication will provide needed encouragement during this phase of recovery.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. The patient who experiences and survives shock may have been unable to get out of bed for an extended period of time and is likely to have a slow, prolonged recovery. The patient and family are instructed about strategies to prevent further episodes of shock by identifying the factors implicated in the initial episode. In addition, the patient and family require instruction about assessments needed to identify the complications that may occur after the patient is discharged from the hospital. Depending on the type of shock and its management, the patient or family may require instruction about treatment modalities such as emergency administration of medications, intravenous therapy, parenteral nutrition, skin care, exercise, and ambulation. The patient and family are also instructed about the need for gradual increases in ambulation and
other activity. The need for adequate dietary intake is another crucial aspect of teaching.

Continuing Care in the Home and Community. Because of the physical toll associated with recovery from shock, the patient may be cared for in an extended care facility or rehabilitation setting after hospital discharge. Alternatively, a referral may be made for home care. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical status and monitors recovery. The nurse also assesses the adequacy of treatments that are continued at home and the ability of the patient and family to cope with these treatments. The patient is likely to require close medical supervision until complete recovery occurs. The home care nurse reinforces the importance of continuing medical care and assists the patient and family to identify and mobilize community resources.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A new nurse on your medical unit tells you that she believes a patient with a myocardial infarction is going into shock. She does not know if the patient is experiencing anaphylactic shock related to a medication he received or cardiogenic shock due to his cardiac disorder. How would you differentiate between anaphylactic and cardiogenic shock, and what medical treatments would you anticipate?
2. An elderly man is admitted from a nursing home with a recent onset of confusion and combative behavior. You know that sudden changes in mental status may be an early sign of sepsis in the elderly. How would you assess this patient for the possibility of septic shock, and how would the management of the elderly patient differ from that of a younger patient?
3. While driving through a rural area, you see a crash and stop to help. Two passengers who have been removed from the cars by passersby are seriously injured. One is bleeding profusely; the other is clutching his abdomen and chest because of severe pain. Describe the type of shock that is most likely in each of these individuals. What actions would you take at the scene to prevent shock or prevent it from progressing?
4. A patient who has used a wheelchair for the last 10 years because of a spinal cord injury was burned when her clothing caught fire as she prepared dinner. Her burns are extensive but limited to her upper body. What types of shock are possible in this patient? What therapy directed at prevention or treatment of shock would you anticipate? Describe the rationale for the therapies that you have identified. How would this patient's disability affect management?

\section*{Oncology: Nursing Management in Cancer Care}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

10. Describe the concept of hospice in providing care for patients with advanced cancer.
11. Discuss the role of the nurse in assessment and management of common oncologic emergencies.

Cancer nursing practice covers all age groups and nursing specialties and is carried out in a variety of health care settings, including the home, community, acute care institutions, and rehabilitation centers. The scope, responsibilities, and goals of cancer nursing, also called oncology nursing, are as diverse and complex as those of any nursing specialty. Because many people associate cancer with pain and death, nurses need to identify their own reactions to cancer and set realistic goals to meet the challenges inherent in caring for patients with cancer.

In addition, the cancer nurse must be prepared to support the patient and family through a wide range of physical, emotional, social, cultural, and spiritual crises. Chart 16-1 identifies major areas of responsibility for nurses caring for patients with cancer.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Although cancer affects every age group, most cancers occur in people older than 65 years of age. Overall, the incidence of cancer is higher in men than in women and higher in industrialized sectors and nations.

More than 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed each year with a cancer affecting one of various body sites (Fig. 16-1). Cancer is second only to cardiovascular disease as a leading cause of death in the United States. Each year, more than 550,000 Americans die of a malignant process. In order of frequency, the leading causes of cancer deaths in the United States are lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer in men and lung, breast, and colorectal cancer in women (Jemal, Thomas, Murray \& Thun, 2002).

Relative 5-year survival rates for African Americans are lower for every cancer site when compared to whites. In the United States, cancer mortality in African Americans is higher than in
any other racial group. This finding is related to the higher incidence and later stage of diagnosis among African Americans. The increased cancer morbidity and mortality for this group are largely related to economic factors, education, and barriers to health care rather than to racial characteristics (Greenlee et al., 2000).

\section*{Pathophysiology of the Malignant Process}

Cancer is a disease process that begins when an abnormal cell is transformed by the genetic mutation of the cellular DNA. This abnormal cell forms a clone and begins to proliferate abnormally, ignoring growth-regulating signals in the environment surrounding the cell. The cells acquire invasive characteristics, and changes occur in surrounding tissues. The cells infiltrate these tissues and gain access to lymph and blood vessels, which carry the cells to other areas of the body. This phenomenon is called metastasis (cancer spread to other parts of the body).

Cancer is not a single disease with a single cause; rather, it is a group of distinct diseases with different causes, manifestations, treatments, and prognoses.

\section*{PROLIFERATIVE PATTERNS}

During the life span, various body tissues normally experience periods of rapid or proliferative growth that must be distinguished from malignant growth activity. Several patterns of cell growth exist: hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia, anaplasia, and neoplasia (see Glossary).

Cancerous cells are described as malignant neoplasms. They demonstrate uncontrolled cell growth that follows no physiologic
alopecia: hair loss
anaplasia: cells that lack normal cellular characteristics and differ in shape and organization with respect to their cells of origin; usually, anaplastic cells are malignant.
biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy: use of agents or treatment methods that can alter the immunologic relationship between the tumor and the host to provide a therapeutic benefit
biopsy: a diagnostic procedure to remove a small sample of tissue to be examined microscopically to detect malignant cells
brachytherapy: delivery of radiation therapy through internal implants
cancer: a disease process whereby cells proliferate abnormally, ignoring growthregulating signals in the environment surrounding the cells
carcinogenesis: process of transforming normal cells into malignant cells
chemotherapy: use of drugs to kill tumor cells by interfering with cellular functions and reproduction
control: containment of the growth of cancer cells
cure: prolonged survival and disappearance of all evidence of disease so that the pa-
tient has the same life expectancy as anyone else in his or her age group
cytokines: substances produced by cells of the immune system to enhance production and functioning of components of the immune system
dysplasia: bizarre cell growth resulting in cells that differ in size, shape, or arrangement from other cells of the same type of tissue
extravasation: leakage of medication from the veins into the subcutaneous tissues
grading: identification of the type of tissue from which the tumor originated and the degree to which the tumor cells retain the functional and structural characteristics of the tissue of origin
hyperplasia: increase in the number of cells of a tissue; most often associated with periods of rapid body growth
malignant: having cells or processes that are characteristic of cancer
metaplasia: conversion of one type of mature cell into another type of cell
metastasis: spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant sites
myelosuppression: suppression of the blood cell-producing function of the bone marrow
nadir: lowest point of white blood cell depression after therapy that has toxic effects on the bone marrow
neoplasia: uncontrolled cell growth that follows no physiologic demand
neutropenia: abnormally low absolute neutrophil count
oncology: field or study of cancer
palliation: relief of symptoms associated with cancer
radiation therapy: use of ionizing radiation to interrupt the growth of malignant cells
stomatitis: inflammation of the oral tissues, often associated with some chemotherapeutic agents
staging: process of determining the size and spread, or metastasis, of a tumor
thrombocytopenia: decrease in the number of circulating platelets; associated with the potential for bleeding
tumor-specific antigen (TSA): protein on the membrane of cancer cells that distinguishes the malignant cell from a benign cell of the same tissue type
vesicant: substance that can cause tissue necrosis and damage, particularly when extravasated
xerostomia: dry oral cavity resulting from decreased function of salivary glands

\section*{Responsibilities of the Nurse in Cancer Care}
- Support the idea that cancer is a chronic illness that has acute exacerbations rather than one that is synonymous with death and suffering.
- Assess own level of knowledge relative to the pathophysiology of the disease process.
- Make use of current research findings and practices in the care of the patient with cancer and his or her family.
- Identify patients at high risk for cancer.
- Participate in primary and secondary prevention efforts.
- Assess the nursing care needs of the patient with cancer.
- Assess the learning needs, desires, and capabilities of the patient with cancer.
- Identify nursing problems of the patient and the family.
- Assess the social support networks available to the patient.
- Plan appropriate interventions with the patient and the family.
- Assist the patient to identify strengths and limitations.
- Assist the patient to design short-term and long-term goals for care.
- Implement a nursing care plan that interfaces with the medical care regimen and that is consistent with the established goals.
- Collaborate with members of a multidisciplinary team to foster continuity of care.
- Evaluate the goals and resultant outcomes of care with the patient, the family, and members of the multidisciplinary team.
- Reassess and redesign the direction of the care as determined by the evaluation.
demand. Benign and malignant growths are classified and named by tissue of origin, as described in Table 16-1.

Benign and malignant cells differ in many cellular growth characteristics, including the method and rate of growth, ability to metastasize or spread, general effects, destruction of tissue, and ability to cause death. These differences are summarized in Table 16-2. The degree of anaplasia (lack of differentiation of cells) ultimately determines the malignant potential.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF MALIGNANT CELLS}

Despite their individual differences, all cancer cells share some common cellular characteristics in relation to the cell membrane, special proteins, the nuclei, chromosomal abnormalities, and the rate of mitosis and growth. The cell membranes are altered in cancer cells, which affects fluid movement in and out of the cell. The cell membrane of malignant cells also contains proteins called tumor-specific antigens (for example, carcinoembryonic antigen and prostate-specific antigen), which develop as they become less differentiated (mature) over time. These proteins distinguish the malignant cell from a benign cell of the same tissue type. They may be useful in measuring the extent of disease in a person and in tracking the course of illness during treatment or relapse. Malignant cellular membranes also contain less fibronectin, a cellular cement. They are therefore less cohesive and do not adhere to adjacent cells readily.

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Concepts and Challenges in Patient Management}

Cancer is a genetic disease. Every phase of carcinogenesis is affected by multiple genetic mutations. Some of these mutations are inherited (present in germ-line cells), but most ( $90 \%$ ) are somatic mutations that are acquired mutations in specific cells.

\section*{EXAMPLES OF CANCERS INFLUENCED BY GENETIC FACTORS}
- Cowden syndrome
- Familial adenomatous polyposis
- Familial melanoma syndrome
- Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
- Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer
- Neurofibromatosis type 1
- Retinoblastoma

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY}
- Obtain information about both maternal and paternal sides of family.
- Obtain cancer history of at least three generations.
- Look for clustering of cancers that occur at earlier ages, multiple primary cancers in one individual, cancer in paired organs, and two or more close relatives with the same type of cancer suggestive of hereditary cancer syndromes.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- Physical findings that may predispose the patient to cancer, such as multiple colonic polyps, suggestive of a polyposis syndrome
- Skin findings, such as atypical moles, that may be related to familial melanoma syndrome
- Multiple café au lait spots, axillary freckling, and two or more neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis type I
- Facial trichilemmomas, mucosal papillomatosis, multinodular thyroid goiter or thyroid adenomas, macrocephaly, fibrocystic breasts and other fibromas or lipomas related to Cowden syndrome

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Assess patient's understanding of genetic factors related to his or her cancer.
- Refer for cancer risk assessment when a hereditary cancer syndrome is suspected so that patient and family can discuss inheritance, risk with other family members and availability of genetic testing.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to patient and families with known genetic test results for hereditary cancer syndromes.
- Participate in the management and coordination of riskreduction measures for those with known genetic mutations.

Typically, nuclei of cancer cells are large and irregularly shaped (pleomorphism). Nucleoli, structures within the nucleus that house ribonucleic acid (RNA), are larger and more numerous in malignant cells, perhaps because of increased RNA synthesis. Chromosomal abnormalities (translocations, deletions, additions) and fragility of chromosomes are commonly found when cancer cells are analyzed.

Mitosis (cell division) occurs more frequently in malignant cells than in normal cells. As the cells grow and divide, more glucose and oxygen are needed. If glucose and oxygen are unavailable, malignant cells use anaerobic metabolic channels to produce energy, which makes the cells less dependent on the availability of a constant oxygen supply.

\section*{INVASION AND METASTASIS}

Malignant disease processes have the ability to allow the spread or transfer of cancerous cells from one organ or body part to another by invasion and metastasis. Patterns of metastasis can be partially explained by circulatory patterns and by specific affinity for certain malignant cells to bind to molecules in specific body tissue.

Invasion, which refers to the growth of the primary tumor into the surrounding host tissues, occurs in several ways. Mechanical pressure exerted by rapidly proliferating neoplasms may force fingerlike projections of tumor cells into surrounding tissue and interstitial spaces. Malignant cells are less adherent and may break off from the primary tumor and invade adjacent structures. Malignant cells are thought to possess or produce specific destructive enzymes (proteinases), such as collagenases (specific to collagen), plasminogen activators (specific to plasma), and lysosomal hydrolyses. These enzymes are thought to destroy surrounding tissue, including the structural tissues of the vascular basement membrane, facilitating invasion of malignant cells. The mechanical pressure of a rapidly growing tumor may enhance this process.

Metastasis is the dissemination or spread of malignant cells from the primary tumor to distant sites by direct spread of tumor cells to body cavities or through lymphatic and blood circulation. Tumors growing in or penetrating body cavities may shed cells or emboli that travel within the body cavity and seed the surfaces of other organs. This can occur in ovarian cancer when malignant cells enter the peritoneal cavity and seed the peritoneal surfaces of such abdominal organs as the liver or pancreas.

\section*{Metastatic Mechanisms}

Lymph and blood are key mechanisms by which cancer cells spread. Angiogenesis, a mechanism by which the tumor cells are ensured a blood supply, is another important process.

\section*{LYMPHATIC SPREAD}

The most common mechanism of metastasis is lymphatic spread, which is transport of tumor cells through the lymphatic circulation. Tumor emboli enter the lymph channels by way of the interstitial fluid that communicates with lymphatic fluid. Malignant cells also may penetrate lymphatic vessels by invasion. After entering the lymphatic circulation, malignant cells either lodge in the lymph nodes or pass between lymphatic and venous circulation. Tumors arising in areas of the body with rapid and extensive lymphatic circulation are at high risk for metastasis through lymphatic channels. Breast tumors frequently metastasize in this manner through axillary, clavicular, and thoracic lymph channels.

\section*{HEMATOGENOUS SPREAD}

Another metastatic mechanism is hematogenous spread, by which malignant cells are disseminated through the bloodstream. Hematogenous spread is directly related to the vascularity of the tumor. Few malignant cells can survive the turbulence of arterial circulation, insufficient oxygenation, or destruction by the body's immune system. In addition, the structure of most arteries and arterioles is far too secure to permit malignant invasion. Those malignant cells that do survive this hostile environment are able to attach to endothelium and attract fibrin, platelets, and clotting factors to seal themselves from immune system surveillance. The endothelium retracts, allowing the malignant cells to enter the basement membrane and secrete lysosomal enzymes. These enzymes then destroy surrounding body tissues and thereby allow implantation.

\section*{ANGIOGENESIS}

Malignant cells also have the ability to induce the growth of new capillaries from the host tissue to meet their needs for nutrients and oxygen. This process is referred to as angiogenesis. It is through this vascular network that tumor emboli can enter the systemic circulation and travel to distant sites. Large tumor emboli that become trapped in the microcirculation of distant sites may further metastasize to other sites. Research into ways to prevent angiogenesis is ongoing.

\section*{Carcinogenesis}

Malignant transformation, or carcinogenesis, is thought to be at least a three-step cellular process: initiation, promotion, and progression.

In initiation, the first step, initiators (carcinogens), such as chemicals, physical factors, and biologic agents, escape normal enzymatic mechanisms and alter the genetic structure of the cellular DNA. Normally, these alterations are reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, or the changes initiate programmed cellular suicide (apoptosis). Occasionally, cells escape these protective mechanisms, and permanent cellular mutations occur. These mutations usually are not significant to cells until the second step of carcinogenesis.

During promotion, repeated exposure to promoting agents (co-carcinogens) causes the expression of abnormal or mutant ge-
netic information even after long latency periods. Latency periods for the promotion of cellular mutations vary with the type of agent and the dosage of the promoter as well as the innate characteristics of the target cell.

Cellular oncogenes, present in all mammalian systems, are responsible for the vital cellular functions of growth and differentiation. Cellular proto-oncogenes are present in cells and act as an "on switch" for cellular growth. Similarly, cancer suppressor genes "turn off" or regulate unneeded cellular proliferation. When the suppressor genes become mutated, rearranged, or amplified or lose their regulatory capabilities, malignant cells are allowed to reproduce. The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in many human cancers. This gene regulates whether cells will repair or die after DNA damage. Mutant p53 gene is associated with a poor prognosis and may be associated with determining response to treatment. Once this genetic expression occurs in cells, the cells begin to produce mutant cell populations that are different from their original cellular ancestors.

Progression is the third step of cellular carcinogenesis. The cellular changes formed during initiation and promotion now exhibit increased malignant behavior. These cells now show a propensity to invade adjacent tissues and to metastasize. Agents that initiate or promote cellular transformation are referred to as carcinogens.

\section*{ETIOLOGY}

Certain categories of agents or factors implicated in carcinogenesis include viruses and bacteria, physical agents, chemical agents, genetic or familial factors, dietary factors, and hormonal agents.

\section*{Viruses and Bacteria}

Viruses as a cause of human cancers are hard to determine because viruses are difficult to isolate. Infectious causes are considered or suspected, however, when specific cancers appear in clusters. Viruses are thought to incorporate themselves in the genetic structure of cells, thus altering future generations of that cell populationperhaps leading to a cancer. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is highly suspect as a cause in Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal cancers, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease.

Herpes simplex virus type II, cytomegalovirus, and human papillomavirus types $16,18,31$, and 33 are associated with dysplasia and cancer of the cervix. The hepatitis B virus is implicated in cancer of the liver; the human T-cell lymphotropic virus may be a cause of some lymphocytic leukemias and lymphomas; and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori has been associated with an increased incidence of gastric malignancy, perhaps secondary to inflammation and injury of gastric cells.

\section*{Physical Agents}

Physical factors associated with carcinogenesis include exposure to sunlight or radiation, chronic irritation or inflammation, and tobacco use.

Excessive exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun, especially in fair-skinned, blue- or green-eyed people, increases the
risk for skin cancers. Factors such as clothing styles (sleeveless shirts or shorts), use of sunscreens, occupation, recreational habits, and environmental variables, including humidity, altitude, and latitude, all play a role in the amount of exposure to ultraviolet light.

Exposure to ionizing radiation can occur with repeated diagnostic x-ray procedures or with radiation therapy used to treat disease. Fortunately, improved x-ray equipment appropriately minimizes the risk for extensive radiation exposure. Radiation therapy used in disease treatment or exposure to radioactive materials at nuclear weapon manufacturing sites or nuclear power plants is associated with a higher incidence of leukemias, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the lung, bone, breast, thyroid, and other tissues. Background radiation from the natural decay processes that produce radon has also been associated with lung cancer. Homes with high levels of trapped radon should be ventilated to allow the gas to disperse into the atmosphere.

\section*{Chemical Agents}

About $75 \%$ of all cancers are thought to be related to the environment. Tobacco smoke, thought to be the single most lethal chemical carcinogen, accounts for at least $30 \%$ of cancer deaths (Heath \& Fontham, 2001). Smoking is strongly associated with cancers of the lung, head and neck, esophagus, pancreas, cervix, and bladder. Tobacco may also act synergistically with other substances, such as alcohol, asbestos, uranium, and viruses, to promote cancer development.

Chewing tobacco is associated with cancers of the oral cavity and primarily occurs in men younger than 40 years of age. Many chemical substances found in the workplace have proved to be carcinogens or co-carcinogens. The extensive list of suspected chemical substances continues to grow and includes aromatic amines and aniline dyes; pesticides and formaldehydes; arsenic, soot, and tars; asbestos; benzene; betel nut and lime; cadmium; chromium compounds; nickel and zinc ores; wood dust; beryllium compounds; and polyvinyl chloride.

Most hazardous chemicals produce their toxic effects by altering DNA structure in body sites distant from chemical exposure. The liver, lungs, and kidneys are the organ systems most often affected, presumably because of their roles in detoxifying chemicals.

\section*{Genetic and Familial Factors}

Almost every cancer type has been shown to run in families. This may be due to genetics, shared environments, cultural or lifestyle factors, or chance alone. Genetic factors play a role in cancer cell development. Abnormal chromosomal patterns and cancer have been associated with extra chromosomes, too few chromosomes, or translocated chromosomes. Specific cancers with underlying genetic abnormalities include Burkitt's lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, meningiomas, acute leukemias, retinoblastomas, Wilms' tumor, and skin cancers, including malignant melanoma.

Approximately 5\% to 10\% of cancers of adulthood and childhood display a familial predisposition. Inherited cancer syndromes, such as premenopausal breast cancer, tend to occur at an early age and at multiple sites in one organ or pair of organs. In cancers with a familial predisposition, individuals may develop multiple cancers; commonly, two or more first-degree relatives
share the same cancer type. Cancers associated with familial inheritance include retinoblastomas, nephroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, malignant neurofibromatosis, and breast, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, stomach, prostate, and lung cancers. In 1994, the BRCA-1 gene was identified; it is linked to breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. The BRCA-2 gene, which has also been identified, is associated with early-onset breast cancer (Nogueira \& Appling, 2000). Work continues to identify other specific genes related to cancer incidence (Greco, 2000).

\section*{Dietary Factors}

Dietary factors are thought to be related to $35 \%$ of all environmental cancers (Heath \& Fontham, 2001). Dietary substances can be proactive (protective), carcinogenic, or co-carcinogenic. The risk for cancer increases with long-term ingestion of carcinogens or co-carcinogens or chronic absence of proactive substances in the diet.

Dietary substances associated with an increased cancer risk include fats, alcohol, salt-cured or smoked meats, foods containing nitrates and nitrites, and a high caloric dietary intake. Food substances that appear to reduce cancer risk include high-fiber foods, cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi), carotenoids (carrots, tomatoes, spinach, apricots, peaches, dark-green and deep-yellow vegetables), and possibly vitamins E and C, zinc, and selenium.

Obesity is associated with endometrial cancer and possibly postmenopausal breast cancers. Obesity may also increase the risk for cancers of the colon, kidney, and gallbladder.

\section*{Hormonal Agents}

Tumor growth may be promoted by disturbances in hormonal balance either by the body's own (endogenous) hormone production or by administration of exogenous hormones. Cancers of the breast, prostate, and uterus are thought to depend on endogenous hormonal levels for growth. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) has long been recognized as a cause of vaginal carcinomas. Oral contraceptives and prolonged estrogen replacement therapy are associated with increased incidence of hepatocellular, endometrial, and breast cancers, whereas they appear to decrease the risk for ovarian and endometrial cancers. The combination of estrogen and progesterone appears safest in decreasing the risk for endometrial cancers. Hormonal changes with reproduction are also associated with cancer incidence. Increased numbers of pregnancies are associated with a decreased incidence of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers.

\section*{ROLE OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM}

In humans, malignant cells are capable of developing on a regular basis. Some evidence indicates, however, that the immune system can detect the development of malignant cells and destroy them before cell growth becomes uncontrolled. When the immune system fails to identify and stop the growth of malignant cells, clinical cancer develops.

Patients who for various reasons are immunoincompetent have been shown to have an increased incidence of cancer. Organ transplant recipients who receive immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ have an increased
incidence of lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, squamous cell cancer of the skin, and cervical and anogenital cancers. Patients with immunodeficiency diseases, such as AIDS, have an increased incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and rectal and head and neck cancers. Some patients who have received alkylating chemotherapeutic agents to treat Hodgkin's disease have an increased incidence of secondary malignancies. Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, are associated with increased cancer development. Finally, age-related changes, such as declining organ function, increased incidence of chronic diseases, and diminished immunocompetence, may contribute to an increased incidence of cancer in older people.

\section*{Normal Immune Responses}

Normally, an intact immune system has the ability to combat cancer cells in several ways. Usually, the immune system recognizes as foreign certain antigens on the cell membranes of many cancer cells. These antigens are known as tumor-associated antigens (also called tumor cell antigens) and are capable of stimulating both cellular and humoral immune responses.

Along with the macrophages, T lymphocytes, the soldiers of the cellular immune response, are responsible for recognizing tumor-associated antigens. When T lymphocytes recognize tumor antigens, other T lymphocytes that are toxic to the tumor cells are stimulated. These lymphocytes proliferate and are released into the circulation. In addition to possessing cytotoxic (cell-killing) properties, T lymphocytes can stimulate other components of the immune system to rid the body of malignant cells.

Certain lymphokines, which are substances produced by lymphocytes, are capable of killing or damaging various types of malignant cells. Other lymphokines can mobilize other cells, such as macrophages, that disrupt cancer cells. Interferon (IFN), a substance produced by the body in response to viral infection, also possesses some antitumor properties. Antibodies produced by B lymphocytes, associated with the humoral immune response, also defend the body against malignant cells. These antibodies act either alone or in combination with the complement system or the cellular immune system.

Natural killer (NK) cells are a major component of the body's defense against cancer. NK cells are a subpopulation of lymphocytes that act by directly destroying cancer cells or by producing lymphokines and enzymes that assist in cell destruction.

\section*{Immune System Failure}

How is it, then, that malignant cells can survive and proliferate despite the elaborate immune system defense mechanisms? Several theories suggest how tumor cells can evade an apparently intact immune system. If the body fails to recognize the malignant cell as different from "self" (non-self or foreign), the immune response may not be stimulated. When tumors do not possess tumor-associated antigens that label them as foreign, the immune response is not alerted. The failure of the immune system to respond promptly to the malignant cells allows the tumor to grow too large to be managed by normal immune mechanisms.

Tumor antigens may combine with the antibodies produced by the immune system and hide or disguise themselves from normal immune defense mechanisms. These tumor antigen-antibody complexes can suppress further production of antibodies. Tumors are also capable of changing their appearance or producing substances that impair usual immune responses. These substances not only promote tumor growth but also increase the patient's
susceptibility to infection by various pathogenic organisms. As a result of prolonged contact with a tumor antigen, the patient's body may be depleted of the specific lymphocytes and no longer able to mount an appropriate immune response.

Abnormal concentrations of host suppressor T lymphocytes may play a role in developing cancers. Suppressor T lymphocytes normally assist in regulating antibody production and diminishing immune responses when they are no longer required. Low levels of serum antibodies and high levels of suppressor cells have been found in patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer associated with hypogammaglobulinemia (low amounts of serum antibodies). Carcinogens, such as viruses and certain chemicals, including chemotherapeutic agents, may weaken the immune system and ultimately enhance tumor growth.

\section*{Detection and Prevention of Cancer}

Nurses and physicians have traditionally been involved with tertiary prevention, the care and rehabilitation of the patient after cancer diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, however, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, clinicians, and researchers have placed greater emphasis on primary and secondary prevention of cancer. Primary prevention is concerned with reducing the risks of cancer in healthy people. Secondary prevention involves detection and screening to achieve early diagnosis and prompt intervention to halt the cancer process.

\section*{PRIMARY PREVENTION}

By acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to educate the community about cancer risk, nurses in all settings play a key role in cancer prevention. Assisting patients to avoid known carcinogens is one way to reduce the risk for cancer. Another way involves adopting dietary and various lifestyle changes that epidemiologic and laboratory studies show influence the risk for cancer. Several clinical trials have been undertaken to identify medications that may help to reduce the incidence of certain types of cancer. Recently, a breast cancer prevention study supported by the National Cancer Institute was conducted at multiple medical centers throughout the country. The results of this study indicated that the medication tamoxifen can reduce the incidence of breast cancer by $49 \%$ in postmenopausal women identified as at high risk for breast cancer (Fisher et al., 1998). Nurses can use their teaching and counseling skills to encourage patients to participate in cancer prevention programs and to promote healthful lifestyles.

\section*{SECONDARY PREVENTION}

The evolving understanding of the role of genetics in cancer cell development has contributed to prevention and screening efforts. Individuals who have inherited specific genetic mutations have an increased susceptibility to cancer. For example, individuals who have familial adenomatosis polyposis have an increased risk for colon cancer. Women in whom the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes have been identified have an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. To provide individualized education and recommendations for continued surveillance and care in high-risk populations, nurses need to be familiar with ongoing developments in the field of genetics and cancer (Greco, 2000). Many centers across the country are offering innovative cancer risk evaluation programs that provide in-depth screening and follow-up for individuals who are found to be at high risk for cancer.

Numerous factors, such as race, cultural influences, access to care, physician-patient relationship, level of education, income, and age, influence the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs people have about cancer. These factors also influence the type of healthpromoting behaviors they practice. For example, Phillips, Cohen, and Moses (1999) examined beliefs, attitudes, and practices related to breast cancer and breast cancer screening in African American women (Nursing Research Profile 16-1). They found that cultural, spiritual, and socioeconomic factors seen in the women studied could be identified as barriers to breast health screening behaviors. Nurses can use this type of information in planning education, prevention, and screening programs.

Public awareness about health-promoting behaviors can be increased in a variety of ways. Health education and health maintenance programs are sponsored by community organizations such as churches, senior citizen groups, and parent-teacher associations. Although primary prevention programs may focus on the hazards of tobacco use or the importance of nutrition, secondary prevention programs may promote breast and testicular self-examination and Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. Many organizations conduct cancer screening events that focus on cancers with the highest incidence rates or those that have improved survival rates if diagnosed early, such as breast or prostate cancers. These events offer education and examinations such as mammograms, digital rectal examinations, and prostate-specific antigen blood tests for minimal or no cost. Programs of this nature are often targeted to individuals who lack access to health care or cannot afford to participate on their own.

Similarly, nurses in all settings can develop programs that identify risks for patients and families and that incorporate teaching and counseling into all educational efforts, particularly for patients and families with a high incidence of cancer. The American Cancer Society has developed a public education program, "Taking Control," that integrates diet, exercise, and general health habit tips that people can follow to reduce their risk for cancer (Chart 16-2). Nurses and physicians can encourage individuals to comply with detection efforts as suggested by the American Cancer Society (Table 16-3).

\section*{Diagnosis of Cancer and Related Nursing Considerations}

A cancer diagnosis is based on assessment for physiologic and functional changes and results of the diagnostic evaluation. Patients with suspected cancer undergo extensive testing to (1) determine the presence of tumor and its extent, (2) identify possible spread (metastasis) of disease or invasion of other body tissues, (3) evaluate the function of involved and uninvolved body systems and organs, and (4) obtain tissue and cells for analysis, including evaluation of tumor stage and grade. The diagnostic evaluation is guided by information obtained through a complete history and physical examination. Knowledge of suspicious symptoms and of the behavior of particular types of cancer assists in determining which diagnostic tests are most appropriate (Table 16-4).

A patient undergoing extensive testing is usually fearful of the procedures and anxious about the possible test results. The nurse can help relieve fear and anxiety by explaining the tests to be performed, the sensations likely to be experienced, and the patient's role in the test procedures. The nurse encourages the patient and family to voice their fears about the test results, supports the patient and family throughout the test period, and reinforces and clarifies information conveyed by the physician. The nurse also

\section*{Risk Factors: Taking Steps to Reduce Cancer Risk}

> When teaching individual patients or groups, nurses can recommend the following cancer prevention strategies:
> 1. Increase consumption of fresh vegetables (especially those of the cabbage family) because studies indicate that roughage and vitamin-rich foods help to prevent certain kinds of cancer.
> 2. Increase fiber intake because high-fiber diets may reduce the risk for certain cancers (eg, breast, prostate, and colon).
> 3. Increase intake of vitamin A, which reduces the risk for esophageal, laryngeal, and lung cancers.
> 4. Increase intake of foods rich in vitamin C , such as citrus fruits and broccoli, which are thought to protect against stomach and esophageal cancers.
> 5. Practice weight control because obesity is linked to cancers of the uterus, gallbladder, breast, and colon.
> 6. Reduce intake of dietary fat because a high-fat diet increases the risk for breast, colon, and prostate cancers.
> 7. Practice moderation in consumption of salt-cured, smoked, and nitrate-cured foods; these have been linked to esophageal and gastric cancers.
> 8. Stop smoking cigarettes and cigars, which are carcinogens.
> 9. Reduce alcohol intake because drinking large amounts of alcohol increases the risk of liver cancer. (Note: People who drink heavily and smoke are at greater risk for cancers of the mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus.)
> 10. Avoid overexposure to the sun, wear protective clothing, and use a sunscreen to prevent skin damage from ultraviolet rays that increase the risk of skin cancer.

encourages the patient and family members to communicate and share their concerns and to discuss their questions and concerns with each other.

\section*{TUMOR STAGING AND GRADING}

A complete diagnostic evaluation includes identifying the stage and grade of the tumor. This is accomplished before treatment begins to provide baseline data for evaluating outcomes of therapy and to maintain a systematic and consistent approach to ongoing diagnosis and treatment. Treatment options and prognosis are determined on the basis of staging and grading.

Staging determines the size of the tumor and the existence of metastasis. Several systems exist for classifying the anatomic extent of disease. The TNM system is frequently used. In this system, T refers to the extent of the primary tumor, N refers to lymph node involvement, and M refers to the extent of metastasis (Chart 16-3). A variety of other staging systems are used to describe the extent of cancers, such as central nervous system cancers, hematologic cancers, and malignant melanoma, that the TNM system does not describe appropriately. Staging systems also provide a convenient shorthand notation that condenses lengthy descriptions into manageable terms for comparisons of treatments and prognoses.

Grading refers to the classification of the tumor cells. Grading systems seek to define the type of tissue from which the tumor originated and the degree to which the tumor cells retain the

\section*{Breast Cancer Screening in African American Women}

Phillips, J. P., Cohen, M. Z., \& Moses, G. (1999). Breast cancer screening and African American women: Fear, fatalism, and silence. Oncology Nursing Forum, 26(3), 561-571.

\section*{Purpose}

African American women are more likely to develop breast cancer and to be diagnosed later in the disease than Caucasian women. This qualitative study explored beliefs, attitudes, and practices related to breast cancer among African American women.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

Three focus groups were conducted with 26 African American women recruited from three employment groups to represent different socioeconomic groups. The focus group discussions were guided by a semistructured guide developed from the literature on breast cancer screening and the Health Belief Model. Topics included African American women and health, breast health, breast cancer beliefs, breast cancer screening, and health-seeking behavior. Women in the focus groups were also asked their opinions of how best to inform African American women about breast cancer screening. Focus group discussions, lasting 90 minutes, were audiotaped and the tapes of the focus groups were transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were analyzed for themes and for similarities and differences among the three different socioeconomic groups: employed middle-income women, employed low-income women, and unemployed low-income women.

\section*{Findings}

All three groups spoke of panic and fear as the predominant feelings associated with breast cancer, and all groups associated breast cancer with death. Only the middle-income women identified early detection as useful. Fear, pessimism, and belief that breast cancer is inevitable were common feelings and beliefs that can serve as barriers among African American women to participation in cancer screening. Cost of mammography, problems with transportation, and pain were also identified as barriers to screening. Although unemployed women believed that they were likely to develop breast cancer, the employed low-income women and middle-income women felt that they were somewhat likely and not very likely to develop breast cancer, respectively. The belief that breast cancer is inevitable may contribute to failure to seek screening or early treatment. All three groups indicated that there is limited discussion of breast cancer within the African American community.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The results of this study demonstrate the need to consider the beliefs and concerns of African American women when developing education and implementing screening programs. Further, health care providers need to understand the cultural and socioeconomic factors that influence screening in African American women. The findings of the study demonstrate that differences in beliefs and knowledge occur and that stereotyping by culture or ethnic group should be avoided.
functional and histologic characteristics of the tissue of origin. Samples of cells to be used to establish the grade of a tumor may be obtained through cytology (examination of cells from tissue scrapings, body fluids, secretions, or washings), biopsy, or surgical excision.

This information assists the health care team to predict the behavior and prognosis of various tumors. The tumor is assigned a numeric value ranging from I to IV. Grade I tumors, also known as well-differentiated tumors, closely resemble the tissue
of origin in structure and function. Tumors that do not clearly resemble the tissue of origin in structure or function are described as poorly differentiated or undifferentiated and are assigned grade IV. These tumors tend to be more aggressive and less responsive to treatment than well-differentiated tumors.

\section*{Management of Cancer}

Treatment options offered to cancer patients should be based on realistic and achievable goals for each specific type of cancer. The range of possible treatment goals may include complete eradication of malignant disease (cure), prolonged survival and containment of cancer cell growth (control), or relief of symptoms associated with the disease (palliation).

The health care team, the patient, and the patient's family must have a clear understanding of the treatment options and goals. Open communication and support are vital as the patient and family periodically reassess treatment plans and goals when complications of therapy develop or disease progresses.

Multiple modalities are commonly used in cancer treatment. A variety of therapies, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy, may be used at various times throughout treatment. Understanding the principles of each and how they interrelate is important in understanding the rationale and goals of treatment.

\section*{SURGERY}

Surgical removal of the entire cancer remains the ideal and most frequently used treatment method. The specific surgical approach, however, may vary for several reasons. Diagnostic surgery is the definitive method of identifying the cellular characteristics that influence all treatment decisions. Surgery may be the primary method of treatment, or it may be prophylactic, palliative, or reconstructive.

\section*{Diagnostic Surgery}

Diagnostic surgery, such as a biopsy, is usually performed to obtain a tissue sample for analysis of cells suspected to be malignant. In most instances, the biopsy is taken from the actual tumor. The three most common biopsy methods are the excisional, incisional, and needle methods.

Excisional biopsy is most frequently used for easily accessible tumors of the skin, breast, upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, and upper respiratory tract. In many cases, the surgeon can remove the entire tumor and surrounding marginal tissues as well. This removal of normal tissue beyond the tumor area decreases the possibility that residual microscopic disease cells may lead to a recurrence of the tumor. This approach not only provides the pathologist who stages and grades the cells with the entire tissue specimen but also decreases the chance of seeding the tumor (disseminating cancer cells through surrounding tissues).

Incisional biopsy is performed if the tumor mass is too large to be removed. In this case, a wedge of tissue from the tumor is removed for analysis. The cells of the tissue wedge must be representative of the tumor mass so that the pathologist can provide an accurate diagnosis. If the specimen does not contain representative tissue and cells, negative biopsy results do not guarantee the absence of cancer.

Excisional and incisional approaches are often performed through endoscopy. Surgical incision, however, may be required to determine the anatomic extent or stage of the tumor. For example, a diagnostic or staging laparotomy, the surgical opening of the abdomen to assess malignant abdominal disease, may be necessary to assess malignancies such as gastric cancer.

Needle biopsies are performed to sample suspicious masses that are easily accessible, such as some growths in the breasts, thyroid, lung, liver, and kidney. Needle biopsies are fast, relatively inexpensive, and easy to perform and usually require only local anesthesia. In general, the patient experiences slight and temporary physical discomfort. In addition, the surrounding tissues are disturbed only minimally, thus decreasing the likelihood of seeding cancer cells. Needle aspiration biopsy involves aspirating tissue fragments through a needle guided into an area suspected of bearing disease. Occasionally, radiologic imaging or magnetic resonance imaging is used to help locate the suspected area and guide the placement of the needle. In some instances, the aspiration biopsy does not yield enough tissue to permit accurate diagnosis. A needle core biopsy uses a specially designed needle to obtain a small core of tissue. Most often, this specimen is sufficient to permit accurate diagnosis.

In some situations, it is necessary to biopsy lymph nodes that are near the suspicious tumor. It is well known that many cancers can spread (metastasize) from the primary site to other areas of the body through the lymphatic circulation. Knowing whether adjacent lymph nodes contain tumor cells helps physicians plan for systemic therapies instead of, or in addition to, surgery in order to combat tumor cells that have gone beyond the primary tumor site. The use of injectable dyes and nuclear medicine imaging can assist the surgeon in identifying lymph nodes (sentinel nodes) that process lymphatic drainage for the involved area. This procedure is used in patients with melanoma and is being used with increasing frequency in patients with cancers of the breast, colon, and vulva, although it is still considered investigational.

The choice of biopsy method is based on many factors. Of greatest importance is the type of treatment anticipated if the cancer diagnosis is confirmed. Definitive surgical approaches include the original biopsy site so that any cells disseminated dur-
ing the biopsy are excised at the time of surgery. Nutrition and hematologic, respiratory, renal, and hepatic function are considered in determining the method of treatment as well. If the biopsy requires general anesthesia and if subsequent surgery is likely, the effects of prolonged anesthesia on the patient are considered.

The patient and family are given an opportunity to discuss the options before definitive plans are made. The nurse, as the patient's advocate, serves as a liaison between the patient and the physician to facilitate this process. Time should be set aside to minimize interruptions. Time should be provided for the patient to ask questions and for thinking through all that has been discussed.

\section*{Surgery as Primary Treatment}

When surgery is the primary approach in treating cancer, the goal is to remove the entire tumor or as much as is feasible (a procedure sometimes called debulking) and any involved surrounding tissue, including regional lymph nodes.

Two common surgical approaches used for treating primary tumors are local and wide excisions. Local excision is warranted when the mass is small. It includes removal of the mass and a small margin of normal tissue that is easily accessible. Wide or radical excisions (en bloc dissections) include removal of the primary tumor, lymph nodes, adjacent involved structures, and surrounding tissues that may be at high risk for tumor spread. This surgical method can result in disfigurement and altered functioning. Wide excisions are considered, however, if the tumor can be removed completely and the chances of cure or control are good.

In some situations, video-assisted endoscopic surgery is replacing surgeries associated with long incisions and extended recovery periods. In these procedures, an endoscope with intense lighting and an attached multichip minicamera is inserted through a small incision into the body. The surgical instruments are inserted into the surgical field through one or two additional small incisions, each about 3 cm long. The camera transmits the image of the involved area to a monitor so the surgeon can manipulate the instruments to perform the necessary procedure. This type of procedure is now being used for many thoracic and abdominal surgeries.

Salvage surgery is an additional treatment option that uses an extensive surgical approach to treat the local recurrence of the cancer after a less extensive primary approach is used. A mastectomy to treat recurrent breast cancer after primary lumpectomy and radiation is an example of salvage surgery.

In addition to the use of surgical blades or scalpels to excise the mass and surrounding tissues, several other types of surgical interventions are available. Electrosurgery makes use of electrical current to destroy the tumor cells. Cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze tissue to cause cell destruction. Chemosurgery uses combined topical chemotherapy and layer-by-layer surgical removal of abnormal tissue. Laser surgery (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) makes use of light and energy aimed at an exact tissue location and depth to vaporize cancer cells. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a single and highly precise administration of high-dose radiation therapy used in some types of brain and head and neck cancers. This type of radiation has such a dramatic effect on the target area that the changes are considered to be comparable to more traditional surgical approaches (International Radiosurgery Support Association, 2000). (Radiation therapy is discussed later in this chapter.)

A multidisciplinary approach to patient care is essential during and after any type of surgery. The effects of surgery on the patient's body image, self-esteem, and functional abilities are addressed. If
necessary, a plan for postoperative rehabilitation is made before the surgery is performed.

The growth and dissemination of cancer cells may have produced distant micrometastases by the time the patient seeks treatment. Therefore, attempting to remove wide margins of tissue in the hope of "getting all the cancer cells" may not be feasible. This reality substantiates the need for a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to cancer therapy. Once the surgery has been completed, one or more additional (or adjuvant) modalities may be chosen to increase the likelihood of destroying the cancer cells. However, some cancers that are treated surgically in the very early stages are considered to be curable (eg, skin cancers, testicular cancers).

\section*{Prophylactic Surgery}

Prophylactic surgery involves removing nonvital tissues or organs that are likely to develop cancer. The following factors are considered when electing prophylactic surgery:
- Family history and genetic predisposition
- Presence or absence of symptoms
- Potential risks and benefits
- Ability to detect cancer at an early stage
- Patient's acceptance of the postoperative outcome

Colectomy, mastectomy, and oophorectomy are examples of prophylactic operations. Recent developments in the ability to identify genetic markers indicative of a predisposition to develop some types of cancer may play a role in decisions concerning prophylactic surgeries. Some controversy, however, exists about adequate justification for prophylactic surgical procedures. For example, a strong family history of breast cancer, positive BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 findings, an abnormal physical finding on breast examination such as progressive nodularity and cystic disease, a proven history of breast cancer in the opposite breast, abnormal mammography findings, and abnormal biopsy results may be factors considered in making the decision to proceed with a prophylactic mastectomy (Houshmand, Campbell, Briggs, McFadden \& Al-Tweigeri, 2000; Zimmerman, 2002).

Because the long-term physiologic and psychological effects are unknown, prophylactic surgery is offered selectively to patients and discussed thoroughly with the patient and family. Preoperative teaching and counseling, as well as long-term follow-up, are provided.

\section*{Palliative Surgery}

When cure is not possible, the goals of treatment are to make the patient as comfortable as possible and to promote a satisfying and productive life for as long as possible. Whether the period is extremely brief or lengthy, the major goal is a high quality of lifewith quality defined by the patient and family. Honest and informative communication with the patient and family about the goal of surgery is essential to avoid false hope and disappointment.

Palliative surgery is performed in an attempt to relieve complications of cancer, such as ulcerations, obstructions, hemorrhage, pain, and malignant effusions (Table 16-5).

\section*{Reconstructive Surgery}

Reconstructive surgery may follow curative or radical surgery and is carried out in an attempt to improve function or obtain a more desirable cosmetic effect. It may be performed in one operation

or in stages. Patients are instructed about possible reconstructive surgical options before the primary surgery by the surgeon who will perform the reconstruction. Reconstructive surgery may be indicated for breast, head and neck, and skin cancers.

The nurse must recognize the patient's needs and the impact that altered functioning and altered body image may have on quality of life. Providing the patient and family with opportunities to discuss these issues is imperative. The needs of the individual must be accurately assessed and validated in each situation for any type of reconstructive surgery.

\section*{Nursing Management in Cancer Surgery}

The patient undergoing surgery for cancer requires general perioperative nursing care, as described in Unit 4, along with specific care related to the patient's age, organ impairment, nutritional deficits, disorders of coagulation, and altered immunity that may increase the risk for postoperative complications. Combining other treatment methods, such as radiation and chemotherapy, with surgery also contributes to postoperative complications, such as infection, impaired wound healing, altered pulmonary or renal function, and the development of deep vein thrombosis. In these situations, the nurse completes a thorough preoperative assessment for all factors that may affect patients undergoing surgical procedures.

The patient undergoing surgery for the diagnosis or treatment of cancer is often anxious about the surgical procedure, possible findings, postoperative limitations, changes in normal body functions, and prognosis. The patient and family require time and assistance to deal with the possible changes and outcomes resulting from the surgery.

The nurse provides education and emotional support by assessing patient and family needs and exploring with the patient and family their fears and coping mechanisms, encouraging them to take an active role in decision making when possible. When the patient or family asks about the results of diagnostic testing
and surgical procedures, the nurse's response is guided by the information the physician previously conveyed to them. The patient and family may also ask the nurse to explain and clarify information that the physician initially provided but that they did not grasp because they were anxious at the time. It is important for the nurse to communicate frequently with the physician and other health care team members to be certain that the information provided is consistent.

After surgery, the nurse assesses the patient's responses to the surgery and monitors for possible complications, such as infection, bleeding, thrombophlebitis, wound dehiscence, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and organ dysfunction. The nurse also provides for patient comfort. Postoperative teaching addresses wound care, activity, nutrition, and medication information.

Plans for discharge, follow-up and home care, and treatment are initiated as early as possible to ensure continuity of care from hospital to home or from a cancer referral center to the patient's local hospital and health care provider. Patients and families are also encouraged to use community resources such as the American Cancer Society or Make Today Count for support and information.

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}

In radiation therapy, ionizing radiation is used to interrupt cellular growth. More than half of patients with cancer receive a form of radiation therapy at some point during treatment. Radiation may be used to cure the cancer, as in Hodgkin's disease, testicular seminomas, thyroid carcinomas, localized cancers of the head and neck, and cancers of the uterine cervix. Radiation therapy may also be used to control malignant disease when a tumor cannot be removed surgically or when local nodal metastasis is present, or it can be used prophylactically to prevent leukemic infiltration to the brain or spinal cord.

Palliative radiation therapy is used to relieve the symptoms of metastatic disease, especially when the cancer has spread to brain, bone, or soft tissue, or to treat oncologic emergencies, such as superior vena cava syndrome or spinal cord compression.

Two types of ionizing radiation-electromagnetic rays (x-rays and gamma rays) and particles (electrons [beta particles], protons, neutrons, and alpha particles)-can lead to tissue disruption. The most harmful tissue disruption is the alteration of the DNA molecule within the cells of the tissue. Ionizing radiation breaks the strands of the DNA helix, leading to cell death. Ionizing radiation can also ionize constituents of body fluids, especially water, leading to the formation of free radicals and irreversibly damaging DNA. If the DNA is incapable of repair, the cell may die immediately, or it may initiate cellular suicide (apoptosis), a genetically programmed cell death.

Cells are most vulnerable to the disruptive effects of radiation during DNA synthesis and mitosis (early S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle). Therefore, those body tissues that undergo frequent cell division are most sensitive to radiation therapy. These tissues include bone marrow, lymphatic tissue, epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, hair cells, and gonads. Slower-growing tissues or tissues at rest are relatively radioresistant (less sensitive to the effects of radiation). Such tissues include muscle, cartilage, and connective tissues.

A radiosensitive tumor is one that can be destroyed by a dose of radiation that still allows for cell regeneration in the normal tissue. Tumors that are well oxygenated also appear to be more sensitive to radiation. In theory, therefore, radiation therapy may be enhanced if more oxygen can be delivered to tumors. In addition,
if the radiation is delivered when most tumor cells are cycling through the cell cycle, the number of cancer cells destroyed (cellkilling) is maximal.

Certain chemicals, including chemotherapy agents, act as radiosensitizers and sensitize more hypoxic (oxygen-poor) tumors to the effects of radiation therapy. Radiation is delivered to tumor sites by external or internal means.

\section*{External Radiation}

If external radiation therapy is used, one of several delivery methods may be chosen, depending on the depth of the tumor. Depending on the amount of energy they contain, x-rays can be used to destroy cancerous cells at the skin surface or deeper in the body. The higher the energy, the deeper the penetration into the body. Kilovoltage therapy devices deliver the maximal radiation dose to superficial lesions, such as lesions of the skin and breast, whereas linear accelerators and betatron machines produce higher-energy x-rays and deliver their dosage to deeper structures with less harm to the skin and less scattering of radiation within the body tissues. Gamma rays are another form of energy used in radiation therapy. This energy is produced from the spontaneous decay of naturally occurring radioactive elements such as cobalt 60 . The gamma rays also deliver this radiation dose beneath the skin surface, sparing skin tissue from adverse effects.

Some centers nationwide treat more hypoxic, radiation-resistant tumors with particle-beam radiation therapy. This type of therapy accelerates subatomic particles (neutrons, pions, heavy ions) through body tissue. This therapy, which is also known as high linear energy transfer radiation, damages target cells as well as cells in its pathway.

A few centers are using intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), which involves delivering a single dose of high-fraction radiation therapy to the exposed tumor bed while the body cavity is open during surgery. Cancers for which IORT is being used include gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, bladder, and cervical cancers and sarcomas. Toxicity with IORT is minimized because the radiation is precisely targeted to the diseased areas, and exposure to overlying skin and structures is avoided.

\section*{Internal Radiation}

Internal radiation implantation, or brachytherapy, delivers a high dose of radiation to a localized area. The specific radioisotope for implantation is selected on the basis of its half-life, which is the time it takes for half of its radioactivity to decay. This internal radiation can be implanted by means of needles, seeds, beads, or catheters into body cavities (vagina, abdomen, pleura) or interstitial compartments (breast). Brachytherapy may also be administered orally as with the isotope $\mathrm{I}^{131}$, used to treat thyroid carcinomas.

Intracavitary radioisotopes are frequently used to treat gynecologic cancers. In these malignancies, the radioisotopes are inserted into specially positioned applicators after the position is verified by x-ray. These radioisotopes remain in place for a prescribed period and then are removed. Patients are maintained on bed rest and log-rolled to prevent displacement of the intracavitary delivery device. An indwelling urinary catheter is inserted to ensure that the bladder remains empty. Low-residue diets and antidiarrheal agents, such as diphenoxylate (Lomotil), are provided to prevent bowel movement during therapy, to prevent the radioisotopes from being displaced.

Interstitial implants, used in treating such malignancies as prostate, pancreatic, or breast cancer, may be temporary or permanent, depending on the radioisotopes used. These implants usually consist of seeds, needles, wires, or small catheters positioned to provide a local radiation source and are less frequently dislodged. With internal radiation therapy, the farther the tissue is from the radiation source, the lower the dosage. This spares the noncancerous tissue from the radiation dose.

Because patients receiving internal radiation emit radiation while the implant is in place, contacts with the health care team are guided by principles of time, distance, and shielding to minimize exposure of personnel to radiation. Safety precautions used in caring for the patient receiving brachytherapy include assigning the person to a private room, posting appropriate notices about radiation safety precautions, having staff members wear dosimeter badges, making sure that pregnant staff members are not assigned to this patient's care, prohibiting visits by children or pregnant visitors, limiting visits from others to 30 minutes daily, and seeing that visitors maintain a 6 -foot distance from the radiation source.

\section*{Radiation Dosage}

The radiation dosage is dependent on the sensitivity of the target tissues to radiation and on the tumor size. The lethal tumor dose is defined as that dose that will eradicate $95 \%$ of the tumor yet preserve normal tissue. The total radiation dose is delivered over several weeks to allow healthy tissue to repair and to achieve greater cell kill by exposing more cells to the radiation as they begin active cell division. Repeated radiation treatments over time (fractionated doses) also allow for the periphery of the tumor to be reoxygenated repeatedly because tumors shrink from the outside inward. This increases the radiosensitivity of the tumor, thereby increasing tumor cell death.

\section*{Toxicity}

Toxicity of radiation therapy is localized to the region being irradiated. Toxicity may be increased when concomitant chemotherapy is administered. Acute local reactions occur when normal cells in the treatment area are also destroyed and cellular death exceeds cellular regeneration. Body tissues most affected are those that normally proliferate rapidly, such as the skin, the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, including the oral cavity, and the bone marrow. Altered skin integrity is a common effect and can include alopecia (hair loss), erythema, and shedding of skin (desquamation). After treatments have been completed, reepithelialization occurs.

Alterations in oral mucosa secondary to radiation therapy include stomatitis, xerostomia (dryness of the mouth), change and loss of taste, and decreased salivation. The entire gastrointestinal mucosa may be involved, and esophageal irritation with chest pain and dysphagia may result. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur if the stomach or colon is in the irradiated field. Symptoms subside and gastrointestinal reepithelialization occurs after treatments are complete.

Bone marrow cells proliferate rapidly, and if bone marrowproducing sites are included in the radiation field anemia, leukopenia (decreased white blood cells [WBCs]), and thrombocytopenia (a decrease in platelets) may result. Patients are then at increased risk for infection and bleeding until blood cell counts return to normal. Chronic anemia may occur. Research continues to develop radioprotective agents that can protect normal tissue from radiation damage.

Certain systemic side effects are also commonly experienced by patients receiving radiation therapy. These manifestations, which are generalized, include fatigue, malaise, and anorexia. This syndrome may be secondary to substances released when tumor cells break down. The effects are temporary and subside with the cessation of treatment.

Late effects of radiation therapy may also occur in various body tissues. These effects are chronic, usually produce fibrotic changes secondary to a decreased vascular supply, and are irreversible. These late effects can be most severe when they involve vital organs such as the lungs, heart, central nervous system, and bladder. Toxicities may intensify when radiation is combined with other treatment modalities.

\section*{Nursing Management in Radiation Therapy}

The patient receiving radiation therapy and the family often have questions and concerns about its safety. To answer questions and allay fears about the effects of radiation on others, on the tumor, and on the patient's normal tissues and organs, the nurse can explain the procedure for delivering radiation and describe the equipment, the duration of the procedure (often minutes only), the possible need for immobilizing the patient during the procedure, and the absence of new sensations, including pain, during the procedure. If a radioactive implant is used, the nurse informs the patient and family about the restrictions placed on visitors and health care personnel and other radiation precautions. Patients also need to understand their own role before, during, and after the procedure. See Chapter 47 for further discussion of radiation treatment for gynecologic cancers.

\section*{PROTECTING THE SKIN AND ORAL MUCOSA}

The nurse assesses the patient's skin, nutritional status, and general feeling of well-being. The skin and oral mucosa are assessed frequently for changes (particularly if radiation therapy is directed to these areas). The skin is protected from irritation, and the patient is instructed to avoid using ointments, lotions, or powders on the area.

Gentle oral hygiene is essential to remove debris, prevent irritation, and promote healing. If systemic symptoms, such as weakness and fatigue, occur, the patient may need assistance with activities of daily living and personal hygiene. Additionally, the nurse offers reassurance by explaining that these symptoms are a result of the treatment and do not represent deterioration or progression of the disease.

\section*{PROTECTING THE CAREGIVERS}

When a patient has a radioactive implant in place, nurses and other health care providers need to protect themselves as well as the patient from the effects of radiation. Specific instructions are usually provided by the radiation safety officer from the x-ray department. The instructions identify the maximum time that can be spent safely in the patient's room, the shielding equipment to be used, and special precautions and actions to be taken if the implant is dislodged. The nurse should explain the rationale for these precautions to keep the patient from feeling unduly isolated.

\section*{CHEMOTHERAPY}

In chemotherapy, antineoplastic agents are used in an attempt to destroy tumor cells by interfering with cellular functions and reproduction. Chemotherapy is used primarily to treat systemic disease rather than lesions that are localized and amenable to
surgery or radiation. Chemotherapy may be combined with surgery or radiation therapy, or both, to reduce tumor size preoperatively, to destroy any remaining tumor cells postoperatively, or to treat some forms of leukemia. The goals of chemotherapy (cure, control, palliation) must be realistic because they will define the medications to be used and the aggressiveness of the treatment plan.

\section*{Cell Kill and the Cell Cycle}

Each time a tumor is exposed to a chemotherapeutic agent, a percentage of tumor cells ( $20 \%$ to $99 \%$, depending on dosage) is destroyed. Repeated doses of chemotherapy are necessary over a prolonged period to achieve regression of the tumor. Eradication of $100 \%$ of the tumor is nearly impossible, but a goal of treatment is to eradicate enough of the tumor so that the remaining tumor cells can be destroyed by the body's immune system.

Actively proliferating cells within a tumor (growth fraction) are the most sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. Nondividing cells capable of future proliferation are the least sensitive to antineoplastic medications and consequently are potentially dangerous. The nondividing cells must be destroyed, however, to eradicate a cancer completely. Repeated cycles of chemotherapy are used to kill more tumor cells by destroying these nondividing cells as they begin active cell division.

Reproduction of both healthy and malignant cells follows the cell cycle pattern (Fig. 16-2). The cell cycle time is the time required for one tissue cell to divide and reproduce two identical daughter cells. The cell cycle of any cell has four distinct phases, each with a vital underlying function:
1. $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ phase-RNA and protein synthesis occur.
2. S phase-DNA synthesis occurs.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 16-2 Phases of the cell cycle extend over the interval between the midpoint of mitosis to the subsequent end point in mitosis in a daughter cell. $G_{1}$ is the postmitotic phase during which ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein synthesis are increased and cell growth occurs. $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ is the resting, or dormant, phase of the cell cycle. In the $S$ phase, nucleic acids are synthesized and chromosomes replicated in preparation for cell mitosis. During $\mathrm{G}_{2}$, RNA and protein synthesis occurs as in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$.

\end{figure}
3. $\mathrm{G}_{2}$ phase-premitotic phase; DNA synthesis is complete, mitotic spindle forms.
4. Mitosis-cell division occurs.

The $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ phase, the resting or dormant phase of cells, can occur after mitosis and during the $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ phase. In the $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ phase are those dangerous cells that are not actively dividing but have the potential for replicating. The administration of certain chemotherapeutic agents (as well as administration of some other forms of therapy) is coordinated with the cell cycle.

\section*{Classification of Chemotherapeutic Agents}

Certain chemotherapeutic agents (cell cycle-specific drugs) destroy cells actively reproducing by means of the cell cycle. Many of these agents are specific to certain phases of the cell cycle. Most affect cells in the $S$ phase by interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis. Others, such as the vinca or plant alkaloids, are specific to the M phase, where they halt mitotic spindle formation.

Chemotherapeutic agents that act independently of the cell cycle phases are termed cell cycle-nonspecific agents. These agents usually have a prolonged effect on cells, leading to cellular damage or death. Many treatment plans combine cell cycle-specific and cell cycle-nonspecific agents to increase the number of vulnerable tumor cells killed during a treatment period.

Chemotherapeutic agents are also classified according to various chemical groups, each with a different mechanism of action. These include the alkylating agents, nitrosureas, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiotics, plant alkaloids, hormonal agents, and miscellaneous agents. The classification, mechanism of action, common drugs, cell cycle specificity, and common side effects of antineoplastic agents are listed in Table 16-6.

Chemotherapeutic agents from each category may be used to enhance the tumor cell kill during therapy by creating multiple cellular lesions. Combined medication therapy relies on medications of differing toxicities and with synergistic actions. Using combination drug therapy also prevents development of drugresistant mechanisms.

Combining older medications with other agents, such as levamisole, leucovorin, hormones, or interferons (IFN), has shown some benefit in combating resistance of cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Newer investigational agents are being studied for effectiveness in resistant tumor lines. For more information about investigative drugs, see Chart 16-4.

\section*{Administration of Chemotherapeutic Agents}

Chemotherapeutic agents may be administered in the hospital, clinic, or home setting by topical, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, arterial, intracavitary, and intrathecal routes. The administration route usually depends on the type of agent, the required dose, and the type, location, and extent of tumor being treated. Guidelines for the administration of chemotherapy have been developed by the Oncology Nursing Society. Patient education is essential to maximize safety if chemotherapy is administered in the patient's home (Chart 16-5).

\section*{DOSAGE}

Dosage of antineoplastic agents is based primarily on the patient's total body surface area, previous response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and major organ function.

Special care must be taken whenever intravenous vesicant agents are administered. Vesicants are those agents that, if deposited into the subcutaneous tissue (extravasation), cause tissue necrosis and damage to underlying tendons, nerves, and blood vessels. Although the complete mechanism of tissue destruction is unclear,
it is known that the pH of many antineoplastic drugs is responsible for the severe inflammatory reaction as well as the ability of these drugs to bind to tissue DNA. Sloughing and ulceration of the tissue may be so severe that skin grafting may be necessary. The full extent of tissue damage may take several weeks to become apparent. Medications classified as vesicants include dactinomycin,

\section*{Chart 16-4 - PHARMACOLOGY}

\section*{Investigational Antineoplastic Therapies and Clinical Trials}

Evaluation of the effectiveness and toxic potential of promising new modalities for preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer is accomplished through clinical trials. Before new chemotherapy agents are approved for clinical use, they are subjected to rigorous and lengthy evaluations to identify beneficial effects, adverse effects, and safety.
- Phase I clinical trials determine optimal dosing, scheduling, and toxicity.
- Phase II trials determine effectiveness with specific tumor types and further define toxicities. Participants in these early trials are most often those who have not responded to standard forms of treatment. Because phase I and II trials may be viewed as last-chance efforts, patients and families are fully informed about the experimental nature of the trial therapies. Although it is hoped that investigational therapy will effectively treat the disease, the purpose of early phase trials is to gather information concerning maximal tolerated doses, adverse effects, and effects of the antineoplastic agents on tumor growth.
- Phase III clinical trials establish the effectiveness of new medications or procedures as compared with conventional approaches. Nurses may assist in the recruitment, consent, and education processes for patients who participate. In many cases, nurses are instrumental in monitoring adherence, assisting patients to adhere to the parameters of the trial, and documenting data describing patients' responses. The physical and emotional needs of patients in clinical trials are addressed in much the same way as those of patients who receive standard forms of cancer treatment.
- Phase IV testing further investigates medications in terms of new uses, dosing schedule, and toxicities.
daunorubicin, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), nitrogen mustard, mitomycin, vinblastine, vincristine, and vindesine.

Only specially trained physicians and nurses should administer vesicants. Careful selection of peripheral veins, skilled venipuncture, and careful administration of medications are essential. Indications of extravasation during administration of vesicant agents include the following:
- Absence of blood return from the intravenous catheter
- Resistance to flow of intravenous fluid
- Swelling, pain, or redness at the site

If extravasation is suspected, the medication administration is stopped immediately, and ice is applied to the site (unless the extravasated vesicant is a vinca alkaloid). The physician may aspirate any infiltrated medication from the tissues and inject a neutralizing solution into the area to reduce tissue damage. Selection of the neutralizing solution depends on the extravasated agent. Examples of neutralizing solutions include sodium thiosulfate, hyaluronidase, and sodium bicarbonate. Recommendations and guidelines for managing vesicant extravasation have been issued by individual medication manufacturers, pharmacies, and the Oncology Nursing Society, and they differ from one medication to the next.

When frequent, prolonged administration of antineoplastic vesicants is anticipated, right atrial Silastic catheters or venous access devices may be inserted to promote safety during medication administration and reduce problems with access to the circulatory system (Figs. 16-3 and 16-4). Complications associated with their use include infection and thrombosis.

\section*{TOXICITY}

Toxicity associated with chemotherapy can be acute or chronic. Cells with rapid growth rates (eg, epithelium, bone marrow, hair follicles, sperm) are very susceptible to damage, and various body systems may be affected as well.

Gastrointestinal System. Nausea and vomiting are the most common side effects of chemotherapy and may persist for up to 24 hours after its administration. The vomiting centers in the brain are stimulated by (1) activation of the receptors found in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the medulla; (2) stimulation of peripheral autonomic pathways (gastrointestinal tract and pharynx); (3) stimulation of the vestibular pathways (inner ear imbalances, labyrinth input); (4) cognitive stimulation (central nervous system disease, anticipatory nausea and vomiting); and (5) a combination of these factors.

Medications that can decrease nausea and vomiting include serotonin blockers, such as ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron, which block serotonin receptors of the gastrointestinal tract and CTZ, and dopaminergic blockers, such as metoclopramide (Reglan), which block dopamine receptors of the CTZ. Phenothiazines, sedatives, corticosteroids, and histamines are used in combination with serotonin blockers with the more emetogenic chemotherapeutic regimens (Bremerkamp, 2000).

Delayed nausea and vomiting that occur later than 48 to 72 hours after chemotherapy are troublesome for some patients. To minimize discomfort, some antiemetic medications are necessary for the first week at home after chemotherapy. Relaxation techniques and imagery can also help to decrease stimuli contributing to symptoms. Altering the patient's diet to include small frequent meals, bland foods, and comfort foods may reduce the frequency or severity of these symptoms.

Although the epithelium that lines the oral cavity quickly renews itself, its rapid rate of proliferation makes it susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. As a result, stomatitis and anorexia are common. The entire gastrointestinal tract is susceptible to mucositis (inflammation of the mucosal lining), and diarrhea is a common result. Antimetabolites and antitumor antibiotics are the major culprits in mucositis and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Irinotecan is responsible for causing diarrhea, which can be severe in some patients.

Hematopoietic System. Most chemotherapeutic agents cause myelosuppression (depression of bone marrow function), resulting in decreased production of blood cells. Myelosuppression decreases the number of WBCs (leukopenia), red blood cells (anemia), and platelets (thrombocytopenia) and increases the risk for infection and bleeding. Depression of these cells is the usual reason for limiting the dose of the chemotherapeutic agents. Monitoring blood cell counts frequently is essential, as is protecting the patient from infection and injury, particularly while the blood cell counts are depressed.

Other agents, called colony-stimulating factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], and erythropoietin [EPO]), can be administered after chemotherapy. G-CSF and GM-CSF stimulate the bone marrow to produce WBCs, especially neutrophils, at an accelerated rate, thus decreasing the duration of neutropenia. The colony-stimulating factors decrease the episodes of infection and the need for antibiotics and allow for more timely cycling of chemotherapy with less need to reduce the dosage. EPO stimulates red blood cell production, thus decreasing the symptoms of chronic administered anemia.

Renal System. Chemotherapeutic agents can damage the kidneys because of their direct effects during excretion and the accumulation of end products after cell lysis. Cisplatin, methotrexate, and mitomycin are particularly toxic to the kidneys. Rapid tumor cell lysis after chemotherapy results in increased urinary excretion of uric acid, which can cause renal damage. In addition, intracellular contents are released into the circulation, resulting in excessive levels of potassium and phosphates (hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia) and diminished levels of calcium (hypocalcemia). (See later discussion of tumor lysis syndrome.)

Monitoring blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and serum electrolyte levels is essential. Adequate hydration, alkalinization of the urine to prevent formation of uric acid crystals, and the use of allopurinol are frequently indicated to prevent these side effects.

Cardiopulmonary System. Antitumor antibiotics (daunorubicin and doxorubicin) are known to cause irreversible cumulative cardiac toxicities, especially when total dosage reaches $550 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Cardiac ejection fraction (volume of blood ejected from the heart with each beat) and signs of congestive heart failure must be monitored closely. Bleomycin, carmustine (BCNU), and busulfan are known for their cumulative toxic effects on lung function. Pulmonary fibrosis can be a long-term effect of prolonged dosage with
these agents. Therefore, the patient is monitored closely for changes in pulmonary function, including pulmonary function test results. Total cumulative doses of bleomycin are not to exceed 400 units.

Reproductive System. Testicular and ovarian function can be affected by chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in possible sterility. Normal ovulation, early menopause, or permanent sterility may result. In men, temporary or permanent azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa) may develop. Reproductive cells may be damaged during treatment, resulting in chromosomal abnormalities in offspring. Banking of sperm is recommended for men before treatments are initiated to protect against sterility or any mutagenic damage to sperm.

Patients and their partners need to be informed about potential changes in reproductive function resulting from chemotherapy. They are advised to use reliable methods of birth control while receiving chemotherapy and not to assume that sterility has resulted.

Neurologic System. The taxanes and plant alkaloids, especially vincristine, can cause neurologic damage with repeated doses. Peripheral neuropathies, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and paralytic ileus may occur. These side effects are usually reversible and disappear after completion of chemotherapy. Cisplatin is also responsible for peripheral neuropathies; hearing loss due to damage to the acoustic nerve can also occur.

Miscellaneous. Fatigue is a distressing side effect for most patients that greatly affects quality of life. Fatigue can be debilitating and last for months after treatment.

\section*{Nursing Management in Chemotherapy}

The nurse has an important role in assessing and managing many of the problems experienced by the patient undergoing chemotherapy. Because of the systemic effects on normal as well as malignant cells, these problems are often widespread, affecting many body systems.

\section*{ASSESSING FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE STATUS}

Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, altered taste, and diarrhea put the patient at risk for nutritional and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Changes in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract may lead to irritation of the oral cavity and intestinal tract, further threatening the patient's nutritional status. Therefore, it is important for the nurse to assess the patient's nutritional and fluid and electrolyte status frequently and to use creative ways to encourage an adequate fluid and dietary intake.

\section*{MODIFYING RISKS FOR INFECTION AND BLEEDING}

Suppression of the bone marrow and immune system is an expected consequence of chemotherapy and frequently serves as a guide in determining appropriate chemotherapy dosage. However, this effect also increases the risk for anemia, infection, and bleeding disorders. Therefore, nursing assessment and care focus on identifying and modifying factors that further increase the patient's risk. Aseptic technique and gentle handling are indicated to prevent infection and trauma. Laboratory test results, particularly blood cell counts, are monitored closely. Untoward changes in blood test results and signs of infection and bleeding must be reported promptly. The patient and family members are instructed about measures to prevent these problems at home (see Plan of Nursing Care for more information).

\section*{ADMINISTERING CHEMOTHERAPY}

The local effects of the chemotherapeutic agent are also of concern. The patient is observed closely during its administration because of the risk and consequences of extravasation (particularly of vesicant agents, which may produce necrosis if deposited in the subcutaneous tissues). Local difficulties or problems with administration of chemotherapeutic agents are brought to the attention of the physician promptly so that corrective measures can be taken immediately to minimize local tissue damage.

\section*{IMPLEMENTING SAFEGUARDS}

Nurses involved in handling chemotherapeutic agents may be exposed to low doses of the drugs by direct contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Urinalyses of personnel repeatedly exposed to cytotoxic agents demonstrate mutagenic activity. Although not all mutagens are carcinogenic, they can produce permanent inheritable changes in the genetic material of cells.

Although long-term studies of nurses handling chemotherapeutic agents have not been conducted, it is known that chemotherapeutic agents are associated with secondary formation of cancers and chromosome abnormalities. Additionally, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, alopecia, and nasal mucosal ulcerations have been reported in health care personnel who have handled chemotherapeutic agents.

Because of known and potential hazards associated with handling chemotherapeutic agents, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Oncology Nursing Society, hospitals, and other health care agencies have developed specific precautions for those involved in the preparation and administration of chemotherapy (Chart 16-6).

\section*{BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION}

Although surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have resulted in improved survival rates for cancer patients, many cancers that initially respond to therapy recur. This is true of hematologic cancers that affect the bone marrow and solid tumor cancers treated with lower doses of antineoplastics to spare the bone marrow from larger, ablative doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The role of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for malignant as well as some nonmalignant diseases continues to grow. Types of BMT based on the source of donor cells include:
1. Allogeneic (from a donor other than the patient): either a related donor (ie, family member) or a matched unrelated donor (national bone marrow registry, cord blood registry)

\section*{Safety in Administering Chemotherapy}

Safety recommendations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), hospitals, and other health care agencies for the preparation and handling of antineoplastic agents follow:
- Use a biologic safety cabinet for the preparation of all chemotherapy agents.
- Wear surgical gloves when handling antineoplastic agents and the excretions of patients who received chemotherapy.
- Wear disposable, long-sleeved gowns when preparing and administering chemotherapy agents.
- Use Luer-Lok fittings on all intravenous tubing used to deliver chemotherapy.
- Dispose of all equipment used in chemotherapy preparation and administration in appropriate, leak-proof, punctureproof containers.
- Dispose of all chemotherapy wastes as hazardous materials.

When followed, these precautions greatly minimize the risk of exposure to chemotherapy agents.
2. Autologous (from patient)
3. Syngeneic (from an identical twin)

The process of obtaining donor cells has evolved over the years. Donor cells can be obtained by the traditional harvesting of large amounts of bone marrow tissue under general anesthesia in the operating room. A newer method, referred to as peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT), is gaining widespread use. This method of collection uses apheresis of the donor to collect stem cells for reinfusion. It is considered to be a safer and more cost-effective means of collection than the traditional harvesting of marrow.

Allogeneic BMT, used primarily for disease of the bone marrow, depends on the availability of a human leukocyte antigenmatched donor. This greatly limits the number of transplants possible. An advantage to allogeneic BMT is that the transplanted cells should not be immunologically tolerant of the patient's malignancy and should cause a lethal graft-versus-disease effect to the malignant cells. The recipient must undergo ablative doses of chemotherapy and possibly total body irradiation to destroy all existing bone marrow and malignant disease. The harvested donor marrow is infused intravenously into the recipient and travels to sites in the body where it produces bone marrow and establishes itself. This establishment of the new bone marrow is known as engraftment. Once engraftment is complete ( 2 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer), the new bone marrow becomes functional and begins producing red blood cells, WBCs, and platelets.

Before engraftment, patients are at a high risk for infection, sepsis, and bleeding. Side effects of the high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation can be acute and chronic. Acute side effects include alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe stomatitis. Chronic side effects include sterility, pulmonary dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, and liver disease. Patients receive immunosuppressant drugs, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK 506), or azathioprine (Imuran), to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In allogeneic transplant recipients, GVHD occurs when the T lymphocytes from the transplanted donor marrow become activated and mount an immune response against the recipient's tissues (skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver). T lymphocytes respond in this manner because they view the recipient's tissue as "foreign," immunologically differing from what
they recognize as "self" in the donor. GVHD may occur acutely or chronically. The first 100 days or so after allogeneic transplantation are crucial for BMT patients until the immune system and bloodmaking capacity (hematopoiesis) have recovered sufficiently to prevent infection and hemorrhage. Most acute side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and mucositis, also resolve in the initial 100 days after transplantation. Patients are also at risk for development of venous occlusive disease (VOD), a vascular injury to the liver from the high-dose chemotherapy occurring in the first 100 days or so after BMT. VOD can lead to acute liver failure and death.

Autologous BMT is considered for patients with disease of the bone marrow who do not have a suitable donor for allogeneic BMT and for patients who have healthy bone marrow but require bone marrow-ablative doses of chemotherapy to cure an aggressive malignancy. Stem cells are collected from the patient and preserved for reinfusion and, if necessary, treated to kill any malignant cells within the marrow. The patient is treated with ablative chemotherapy and, possibly, total body irradiation to eradicate any remaining tumor. The stem cells are then reinfused and engraft. Until engraftment occurs in the bone marrow sites of the body, the patient is at high risk for infection, sepsis, and bleeding. Acute and chronic toxicities from chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be severe. The risk of VOD is also present after an autologous transplant. No immunosuppressant medications are necessary after autologous BMT because the patient did not receive foreign tissue. A disadvantage of autologous transplantation is the risk that viable tumor cells may remain in the bone marrow despite conditioning regimens (high-dose chemotherapy).

Syngeneic BMT is the least common type of transplantation because it requires an identical sibling for harvest. Syngeneic transplantations result in fewer complications and no marrow rejection because the donor is an identical tissue match to the recipient. The transplantation and collection processes are the same with syngeneic BMT as with allogeneic BMT.

\section*{Nursing Management in Bone Marrow Transplantation}

Nursing care of patients undergoing BMT is complex and demands a high level of skill. Transplantation nursing can be extremely rewarding yet extremely stressful. The success of BMT is greatly influenced by nursing care throughout the transplantation process.

\section*{IMPLEMENTING PRETRANSPLANTATION CARE}

All patients must undergo extensive pretransplantation evaluations to assess the current clinical status of the disease. Nutritional assessments, extensive physical examinations and organ function tests, and psychological evaluations are conducted. Blood work includes assessing past antigen exposure (for example, to hepatitis virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, and syphilis). The patient's social support systems and financial and insurance resources are also evaluated. Informed consent and patient teaching about the procedure and pretransplantation and posttransplantation care are vital.

\section*{PROVIDING CARE DURING TREATMENT}

Skilled nursing care is required during the treatment phase of BMT when high-dose chemotherapy (conditioning regimen) and total body irradiation are administered. The acute toxicities of nausea, diarrhea, mucositis, and hemorrhagic cystitis require close monitoring and constant attention by the nurse.

Nursing management during the bone marrow or stem cell infusions consists of monitoring the patient's vital signs and blood
oxygen saturation; assessing for adverse effects, such as fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, cutaneous reactions, nausea, vomiting, hypotension or hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, and taste changes; and providing ongoing support and patient teaching.

Throughout the period of bone marrow aplasia until engraftment of the new marrow occurs, patients are at high risk for dying of sepsis and bleeding. Patients require support with blood products and hemopoietic growth factors. Potential infection may be bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoan in origin. Renal complications arise from the nephrotoxic chemotherapy agents used in the conditioning regimen or those used to treat infection (amphotericin B, aminoglycosides). Tumor lysis syndrome and acute tubular necrosis are also risks after BMT.

GVHD requires skillful nursing assessment to detect early effects on the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. VOD resulting from the conditioning regimens used in BMT can result in fluid retention, jaundice, abdominal pain, ascites, tender and enlarged liver, and encephalopathy. Pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary edema, interstitial pneumonia, and other pneumonias, often complicate the recovery after BMT.

\section*{Providing Posttransplantation Care}

Ongoing nursing assessment in follow-up visits is essential to detect late effects of therapy in BMT patients. Late complications are those that occur 100 days or more after BMT. Late effects include infections, such as varicella zoster infection, restrictive pulmonary abnormalities, and recurrent pneumonias. Sterility often results. Chronic GVHD involves the skin, liver, intestine, esophagus, eye, lungs, joints, and vaginal mucosa. Cataracts may also develop after total body irradiation.

Psychosocial assessments by nursing staff must be ongoing. In addition to the stressors affecting patients at each phase of the transplantation experience, marrow donors and family members also have psychosocial needs that must be addressed.

\section*{CARING FOR THE DONORS}

Donors commonly experience mood alterations, decreased selfesteem, and guilt from feelings of failure if the transplantation fails. Family members must be educated and supported to reduce anxiety and promote coping during this difficult time. Family members must also be assisted to maintain realistic expectations of themselves as well as of the patient.

As BMT becomes more prevalent, many moral and ethical issues become apparent, including those related to informed consent, allocation of resources, and quality of life.

\section*{HYPERTHERMIA}

Hyperthermia (thermal therapy), the generation of temperatures greater than physiologic fever range (above $41.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left[106.7^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right]$ ), has been used for many years to destroy tumors in human cancers. Malignant cells may be more sensitive than normal cells to the harmful effects of high temperatures for several reasons. Malignant cells lack the repair mechanisms necessary to repair cell damage by elevated temperatures. Most tumor cells lack an adequate blood supply to provide needed oxygen during periods of increased cellular demand, such as during hyperthermia. Cancerous tumors lack blood vessels of adequate size for dissipation of heat. In addition, the body's immune system may be indirectly stimulated when hyperthermia is used.

Hyperthermia is most effective when combined with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy. Hyperthermia and radiation therapy are thought to work well together because hypoxic tumor cells and cells in the $S$ phase of the cell cycle are more
sensitive to heat than radiation; the addition of heat damages tumor cells so that they cannot repair themselves after radiation therapy. Hyperthermia is thought to alter cellular membrane permeability when used with chemotherapy, allowing for an increased uptake of the chemotherapeutic agent. Hyperthermia may enhance function of immune system cells, such as macrophages and T cells, which are stimulated by many biologic agents.

Heat can be produced by using radiowaves, ultrasound, microwaves, magnetic waves, hot-water baths, or even hot-wax immersions. Hyperthermia may be local or regional, or it may include the whole body. Local or regional hyperthermia may be delivered to a cancerous extremity (for malignant melanoma) by regional perfusion, in which the affected extremity is isolated by a tourniquet and an extracorporeal circulator heats the blood flowing through the affected part. Hyperthermia probes may also be inserted around a tumor in a local area and attached to a heat source during treatment. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as melphalan (Alkeran), may also be heated and instilled into the region's circulating blood. Local or regional hyperthermia may also include infusion of heated solutions into cancerous body organs. Wholebody hyperthermia to treat disseminated disease may be achieved by extracorporeal circulation, immersion of patients in heated water or paraffin, or enclosure in heated suits.

Side effects of hyperthermic treatments include skin burns and tissue damage, fatigue, hypotension, peripheral neuropathies, thrombophlebitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and electrolyte imbalances. Resistance to hyperthermia may develop during the treatment because cells adapt to repeated thermal insult. Research into the effectiveness of hyperthermia, methods of delivery, and side effects is ongoing.

\section*{Nursing Management in Hyperthermia}

Although hyperthermia has been used for many years, many patients and their families are unfamiliar with this cancer treatment. Consequently, they need explanations about the procedure, its goals, and its effects. The patient is assessed for adverse effects, and efforts are made to reduce their occurrence and severity. Local skin care at the site of the implanted hyperthermic probes is also required.

\section*{BIOLOGIC RESPONSE MODIFIERS}

Biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy involves the use of naturally occurring or recombinant (reproduced through genetic engineering) agents or treatment methods that can alter the immunologic relationship between the tumor and the cancer patient (host) to provide a therapeutic benefit. Although the mechanisms of action vary with each type of BRM, the goal is to destroy or stop the malignant growth. The basis of BRM treatment lies in the restoration, modification, stimulation, or augmentation of the body's natural immune defenses against cancer.

\section*{Nonspecific Biologic Response Modifiers}

Some of the early investigations of the stimulation of the immune system involved nonspecific agents such as Bacille CalmetteGuérin (BCG) and Corynebacterium parvum. When injected into the patient, these agents serve as antigens that stimulate an immune response. The hope is that the stimulated immune system will then eradicate malignant cells. Extensive animal and human investigations with BCG have shown promising results, especially in treating localized malignant melanoma. Additionally, BCG is considered to be a standard form of treatment for localized bladder cancer. Use of nonspecific agents in advanced cancer remains
limited, however, and research is continuing in an effort to identify other uses and other agents.

\section*{Monoclonal Antibodies}

Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), another type of BRM, became available through technological advances, enabling investigators to grow and produce specific antibodies for specific malignant cells. Theoretically, this type of specificity allows the MoAb to destroy the cancer cells and spare normal cells. The production of MoAbs involves injecting tumor cells that act as antigens into mice. Antibodies made in response to injected antigens can be found in the spleen of the mouse. Antibody-producing spleen cells are combined with a cancer cell that has the ability to grow indefinitely in culture medium and continue producing more antibodies. The combination of spleen cells and the cancer cells is referred to as a hybridoma. From hybridomas that continue to grow in the culture medium, the desired antibodies are harvested, purified, and prepared for diagnostic or therapeutic use (Fig. 16-5). Alternative methods of producing MoAbs using human or genetically engineered sources are under investigation.

MoAbs are being used as aids in diagnostic evaluation. By attaching a radioactive substance to the MoAb , physicians can detect both primary and metastatic tumors through radiologic techniques. This process is referred to as radioimmunodetection. OncoScint (Cytogen Corp., Princeton, NJ) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MoAb that is used to assist in diagnosing ovarian and colorectal cancers. The use of MoAbs in detecting breast, gastric, and prostate cancers and lymphoma is under investigation. MoAbs are also used in purging residual tumor cells from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of patients who are undergoing BMT for peripheral stem cell rescue after high-dose cytotoxic therapy.

Several MoAbs have been approved for treatment in cancer. Rituximab (Rituxan) is used for the treatment of relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Kosits \& Callaghan, 2000). Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is approved as a single agent or given in addition to chemotherapy for the treatment of some types of metastatic breast cancer (Yarbro, 2000). Alemtuzumab (Campath) is used in the treatment of some forms of leukemia (Seeley \& DeMeyer, 2002). Gemtuzumab ozogomicin (Mylotarg) is a combination of a MoAb and the antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin, which is used for the treatment of a specific type of acute myeloid leukemia (Sorokin, 2000). Gemtuzumab ozogomicin is an example of immunoconjugate therapy or a "magic bullet" that transports cancer-killing substances to the cancer cells. Ibritumomab-tiuxetan (Zevalin) is another form of immunoconjugate therapy that combines a monoclonal antibody and a radioactive source for the treatment of specific types of nonHodgkin's lymphoma. The monoclonal antibody delivers the radioactive source to the malignant cells, causing the cells to be destroyed by both radioactivity and normal immune responses (Estes, 2002). Researchers are continuing to explore the development and use of other MoAbs either alone or in combination with other substances such as radioactive materials, chemotherapeutic agents, toxins, hormones, or other BRMs.

\section*{Cytokines}

Cytokines, substances produced by cells of the immune system to enhance the production and functioning of components of the immune system, are also the focus of cancer treatment research. Cytokines are grouped into families, such as interferons, inter-
leukins, colony-stimulating factors, and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs).

\section*{INTERFERON}

Interferons (IFNs) are examples of cytokines with both antiviral and antitumor properties. When stimulated, all nucleated cells are capable of producing these glycoproteins, which are classified according to their biologic and chemical properties: IFN- $\alpha$ is produced by leukocytes, IFN- $\beta$ is produced by fibroblasts, and IFN- $\gamma$ is produced by lymphocytes.

Although the exact antitumor effects of IFNs have not been thoroughly established, it is thought that they either stimulate the immune system or assist in preventing tumor growth. The antitumor effects are dependent on the type of IFN and the disease for which IFN is being used. IFNs enhance both lymphocyte and antibody production. They also facilitate the cytolytic or cell destruction role of macrophages and natural killer cells. Additionally, IFNs can inhibit cell multiplication by increasing the duration of various phases of the cell cycle.

The effects of IFN have been demonstrated in a variety of malignancies. IFN- $\alpha$ has been approved by the FDA for treating hairy-cell leukemia, Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and melanoma. Other positive responses have been seen in hematologic malignancies and renal carcinomas. IFN- $\alpha$, IFN- $\beta$, and IFN- $\gamma$ have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of several nonmalignant diseases. IFN is administered through subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, and intracavitary routes. Efforts are underway to establish the effectiveness of IFN for various malignancies in combination with other treatment regimens.

\section*{INTERLEUKINS}

Interleukins are a subgroup of cytokines known as lymphokines and monokines because they are primarily produced by lymphocytes and monocytes. About 15 different interleukins have been identified. They act by signaling and coordinating other cells of the immune system. The FDA has approved interleukin-2 (IL-2) as a treatment option for renal cell cancer and metastatic melanoma in adults. Originally referred to as T-cell growth factor, IL-2 is known to stimulate the production and activation of several different types of lymphocytes. In addition, IL-2 enhances the production of other types of cytokines and plays a role in influencing both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.

Clinical trials are beng conducted on IL-2 as well as other interleukins, such as IL-1, IL-4, and IL-6, for their roles in treating other cancers. Some early-stage clinical trials are assessing the effects of interleukins in combination with chemotherapy. In addition, interleukins are being investigated for their role as growth factors for treating myelosuppression after the use of some forms of chemotherapy.

\section*{HEMATOPOIETIC GROWTH FACTORS (COLONY-STIMULATING FACTORS)}

Hematopoietic growth factors, also known as colony-stimulating factors, are hormone-like substances naturally produced by cells within the immune system. Hematopoietic growth factors of different types regulate the production of all cells in the blood, including neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, red blood cells, and platelets. FDA approval of GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-11, and EPO (Epogen) has contributed significantly to the supportive care of patients with cancer.

Although these agents do not treat the underlying malignancy, they do target the effects of myelotoxic cancer therapies

\end{figure}
(adversely affecting the bone marrow), such as radiation and chemotherapy. Previously, the myelotoxic or bone marrow suppressive effects of chemotherapy had imposed limits on some chemotherapy agents and contributed to the development of life-threatening infections.

GM-CSF is used to treat the neutropenia (decreased numbers of neutrophils in the blood) associated with BMT. G-CSF is used to treat neutropenia associated with chemotherapy for solid tumor malignancies. IL-11 is used to prevent severe thrombocytopenia and reduce the need for platelet transfusions in patients following myelosuppressive therapy for nonmyeloid cancers. EPO is used to treat anemia in cancer patients as well as in patients with chronic renal disease and in patients with HIV infection with zidovudine-induced anemia. Other growth factors, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-3, are being investigated.

\section*{TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR}

TNF is a cytokine naturally produced by macrophages, lymphocytes, astrocytes, and microglial cells of the brain. The exact role of TNF is still under investigation. In vitro studies have shown TNF to stimulate other cells of the immune response; in animal studies it has been shown to have direct tumor-killing activity. Clinical trials using systemic TNF have been halted because of se-
vere toxicities (Pazadur, Coia, Hoskins \& Wagman, 2001). Current clinical trials are examining local administration of TNF for patients with sarcomas and melanomas of the extremities.

\section*{Retinoids}

Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives (retinol, all-trans-retinoic acid, and 13 -cis-retinoic acid) that play a role in growth, reproduction, epithelial cell differentiation, and immune function. All-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) has been granted FDA approval for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, a rare form of leukemia. Retinoids are being tested for treating both hematologic cancers and solid tumors and for preventing a variety of cancers (Evans \& Kaye, 1999; Kelloff, 2000; Kurie, 1999).

\section*{Nursing Management in Biologic Response Modifier Therapy}

Patients receiving BRM therapy have many of the same needs as cancer patients undergoing other treatment approaches. However, some BRM therapies are still investigational and considered a last-chance effort by many patients who have not responded to standard treatments. Consequently, it is essential that the nurse assess the need for education, support, and guidance for both
the patient and family and assist in planning and evaluating patient care.

\section*{MONITORING THERAPEUTIC AND ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Nurses need to be familiar with each agent given and the potential effects (Table 16-7). Adverse effects, such as fever, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting, as seen with IFN therapy, may not be lifethreatening. However, nurses must be aware of the impact of these side effects on the patient's quality of life. Other lifethreatening adverse effects (eg, capillary leak syndrome, pulmonary edema, and hypotension) may occur with IL-2 therapy. Nurses must work closely with physicians to assess and manage potential toxicities of BRM therapy. Because of the investigational nature of many of these agents, the nurse will be administering them in a research setting. Accurate observations and careful documentation are essential components of patient assessment and data collection.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching Patients Self-Care. Some BRMs, such as IFN, EPO, and G-CSF, can be administered by the patient or family in the home. Nurses teach patients and families, as needed, how to administer these agents through subcutaneous injections. Further, they provide instructions about side effects and assist patients and families to identify strategies to manage many of the common side effects of BRM therapy, such as fatigue, anorexia, and flulike symptoms.

Continuing Care. Referral for home care is usually indicated to monitor the patient's responses to treatment and continue and reinforce teaching. During home visits, the nurse assesses the patient's and family's technique in administering medications. The nurse collaborates with physicians, third-party payors, and pharmaceutical companies to help patients obtain reimbursement for home administration of BRM therapies. The nurse also reminds

\section*{PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY}

Photodynamic therapy, or phototherapy, is an investigational cancer treatment that uses photosensitizing agents, such as porfimer (Photofrin). When administered intravenously, these agents are retained in higher concentrations in malignant tissue than in normal tissue. They are then activated by a light source, usually laser light, which penetrates body tissue. The lightactivated agent then creates activated singlet oxygen molecules that are cytotoxic or harmful to body tissue cells. Because most of the photosensitizing agent has been retained in malignant tissue, a selective cytotoxicity can be achieved with minimal destruction to normal tissues.

Cancers treated with phototherapy include esophageal cancers, endobronchial tumors, skin cancers, breast cancers, intraperitoneal tumors, and malignant central nervous system disease. The major side effect of therapy is photosensitivity for 4 to 6 weeks after treatment. Patients must protect themselves from direct and indirect sunlight to prevent skin burns. In addition, local reactions are observed in the area treated. Liver and renal function should also be monitored for transient abnormalities. As with any investigational treatment, emotional support and education are vital to assist the patient and family.

\section*{GENE THERAPY}

As early as 1914, the somatic mutation theory of cancer suggested that cancer develops as a result of inherited or acquired genetic mutations that lead to a disturbance in the normal chromosomal balance regulating cell growth and reproduction. Technological advances and information gained through intense study of genetics have assisted researchers and clinicians in predicting, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Gene therapy includes approaches that correct genetic defects or manipulate genes to induce tumor cell destruction in the hope of preventing or combating disease. Somatic cell (any cell not contained in an embryo or destined to become an egg or sperm) gene therapy is the only publicly funded form of gene therapy in the United States. This type of therapy involves the insertion of a desired gene into the targeted cells. Human germ cell manipulation is considered by many to be controversial and a potential source of bioethical concerns (Frankel \& Chapman, 2000).

Although gene therapy is currently investigational, researchers predict it will have a profound impact on medical and health care in the 21st century. More than 100 clinical trials for gene therapy in treating cancer have been initiated. An example of one such trial involves inserting the p53 tumor suppressor gene into cancer cells. Normally this gene is responsible for repairing damaged cells or causing cell death when the cell cannot be repaired. Many types of cancer cells have mutated p53 genes that then lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Insertion of normal p53 genes can lead to either cancer cell death or slowing of tumor growth. This approach has been tested in lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (Wasil \& Buchbinder, 2000). In another clinical trial, a "suicide gene" is inserted into tumor cells to facilitate cell death. When the gene for herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase is inserted into malignant cells, those cells become infected with the virus and susceptible to destruction by antiviral drugs, such as ganciclovir. This approach has been tried in treating brain, ovar-
ian, and breast cancers (Fibison, 2000). For more information about investigational therapies, see Chart 16-4.

\section*{UNPROVEN AND UNCONVENTIONAL THERAPIES}

A diagnosis of cancer evokes many emotions in patients and families, including feelings of fear, frustration, and loss of control. Despite increasing 5-year survival rates with the use of traditional methods of treatment, a significant number of patients use or seriously consider using some form of unconventional treatment. Hopelessness, desperation, unmet needs, lack of factual information, and family or social pressures are major factors that motivate patients to seek unconventional methods of treatment and allow them to fall prey to deceptive practices and quackery. Although research is scant and accuracy of reporting may be questionable, it is estimated that $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of patients with cancer may be using a complementary or alternative method of treatment.

Caring for patients who choose unconventional methods may place members of the health care team in difficult situations professionally, legally, and ethically. Nurses must keep in mind those ethical principles that help guide professional practice, such as autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.

Unconventional treatments have not demonstrated scientifically, in an objective, reproducible method, the ability to cure or control cancer. In addition to being ineffective, some unconventional treatments may also be harmful to patients and may cost thousands of dollars. Most unproven cancer treatments can be categorized as machines and devices, drugs and biologicals, metabolic and dietary regimens, or mystical and spiritual approaches.

\section*{Machines and Devices}

Electrical gadgets and devices are commonly reputed to cure cancers. Most are operated by people with questionable training who report unrealistic and unlikely success stories. Such machines are often decorated with elaborate lights and dials and produce vibrations or other sensations.

\section*{Drugs and Biologicals}

Medicinal agents, herbs, proteins (such as shark cartilage), megavitamins (including vitamin C therapy), immune therapy, vaccines, enzymes, hydrogen peroxide, and sera have been frequent components of fraudulent cancer therapy. These agents have included oral, intravenous, and external medications derived from weeds, flowers, and herbs and the blood and urine of patients and animals. Many of these agents, especially in megadoses, can be toxic and can have untoward interactions with concomitant medications. Herbs commonly used by individuals with cancer include echinacea, essiac, ginseng, green tea, pau d'arco, and hoxsey (Montbriand, 1999). Many of these treatments are costly.

\section*{Metabolic and Dietary Regimens}

Metabolic and dietary regimens emphasize the ingestion of only natural substances to purify the body and retard cancerous growth. These regimens include the grape diet, the carrot juice diet, garlic, onions, various teas, coffee enemas, and raw liver intake. Laetrile (vitamin B, amygdalin), one of the best-known forms of cancer quackery, was advocated as an agent to kill
tumor cells by releasing cyanide, which is especially toxic to malignant cells. The National Cancer Institute, in response to public demand, investigated the effects of laetrile and reported no therapeutic benefits with its use; indeed, many toxic effects (cyanide poisoning, fever, rash, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension) were reported. Macrobiotic diets have also been advocated as a cancer treatment to reestablish balance between the major forces in the universe, yin and yang. People who adhere to macrobiotic diets tend to develop vitamin, mineral, and protein deficiencies; experience additional weight loss due to decreased calorie intake; and receive no therapeutic benefits from the diet.

\section*{Mystical and Spiritual Approaches}

Traditional Chinese medicine attempts to balance chi forces in order to heal the body. Mystical or spiritual approaches to cancer therapy include such techniques as psychic surgery, faith healing, "laying on of hands," prayer groups, and invocation of mystical universal powers to kill cancerous growths. These techniques are difficult to disclaim because they are based on faith.

\section*{Nursing Management}

\section*{in Unconventional Therapies}

A trusting relationship, supportive care, and promotion of hope in the patient and family are the most effective means of protecting them from fraudulent therapy and questionable cancer cures. Truthful responses given in a nonjudgmental manner to questions and inquiries about unproven methods of cancer treatments may alleviate the fear and guilt on the part of the patient and family that they are not "doing everything we can" to obtain a cure. The nurse may inform the patient and family of the characteristics common to fraudulent therapy so that they will be informed and cautious when evaluating other forms of "therapy." The nurse should encourage any patient who uses unconventional therapies to inform the physician about such use. Knowing this information can help prevent interactions with medications and other therapies that may be prescribed and avoid attributing the side effects of unconventional therapies to prescribed medications.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT WITH CANCER}

The outlook for patients with cancer has greatly improved because of scientific and technological advances. As a result of the underlying disease or various treatment modalities, however, the patient with cancer may experience a variety of secondary problems, such as infection, reduced WBC counts, bleeding, skin problems, nutritional problems, pain, fatigue, and psychological stress.

\section*{Assessment}

Regardless of the type of cancer treatment or prognosis, many patients with cancer are susceptible to the following problems and complications. An important role of the nurse on the oncology team is to assess the patient for these problems and complications.

\section*{INFECTION}

In all stages of cancer, the nurse assesses factors that can promote infection. Infection is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. Factors predisposing patients to infection are summarized in

Table 16-8. The nurse monitors laboratory studies to detect early changes in WBC counts. Common sites of infection, such as the pharynx, skin, perianal area, urinary tract, and respiratory tract, are assessed frequently. The typical signs of infection (swelling, redness, drainage, and pain), however, may not occur in the immunosuppressed patient due to a diminished local inflammatory response. Fever may be the only sign of infection that the patient exhibits. The nurse also monitors the patient for sepsis, particularly if invasive catheters or infusion lines are in place.

WBC function is often impaired in cancer patients. A decrease in circulating WBCs is referred to as leukopenia or granulocytopenia. There are three types of WBCs: neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. The neutrophils, totaling $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of all the body's WBCs, play a major role in combating infection by engulfing and destroying infective agents in a process called phagocytosis. Both the total WBC count and the concentration of neutrophils are important in determining the patient's ability to fight infection.

A differential WBC count identifies the relative numbers of WBCs and permits tabulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (mature neutrophils, reported as "polys," PMNs, or "segs") and immature forms of neutrophils (reported as bands, metamyelocytes, and "stabs"). These numbers are compiled and reported as the absolute neutrophil count (ANC). The ANC is calculated by the following formula:

ANC $=\frac{(\text { Total WBC count } \times[\% \text { segmented neutrophils }+\% \text { bands }])}{100}$
For example, if the patient's total WBC count is 6,000 , with segmented neutrophils $25 \%$ and bands $25 \%$, the ANC would be 3,000.

Neutropenia, an abnormally low ANC, is associated with an increased risk for infection. The risk for infection rises as the ANC decreases and persists. An ANC of less than 1,000 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ reflects a severe risk for infection. Nadir is the lowest ANC after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Therapies that suppress bone marrow function are called myelosuppressive. Febrile patients who are neutropenic are assessed for infection through cultures of blood, sputum, urine, stool, catheter, or wounds, if appropriate. In addition, a chest x-ray is often included to assess for pulmonary infections.

\section*{BLEEDING}

The nurse assesses cancer patients for factors that may contribute to bleeding. These include bone marrow suppression from radiation, chemotherapy, and other medications that interfere with coagulation and platelet functioning, such as aspirin, dipyridamole (Persantine), heparin, or warfarin (Coumadin). Common bleeding sites include skin and mucous membranes; the intestinal, urinary, and respiratory tracts; and the brain. Gross hemorrhage, as well as blood in the stools, urine, sputum, or vomitus (melena, hematuria, hemoptysis, hematemesis), oozing at injection sites, bruising (ecchymosis), petechiae, and changes in mental status, are monitored and reported.

\section*{SKIN PROBLEMS}

The integrity of skin and tissue is at risk in cancer patients because of the effects of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and invasive procedures carried out for diagnosis and therapy. As part of the assessment, the nurse identifies which of these predisposing factors are present and assesses the patient for other risk factors, including nutritional deficits, bowel and bladder incontinence, immobility, immunosuppression, multiple skin folds,

\section*{Table 16-8 - Factors Predisposing Cancer Patients to Infection}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline FACTORS & UNDERLYING MECHANISMS \\
\hline 1. Impaired skin and mucous membrane integrity & - Loss of body's first line of defense against invading organisms. \\
\hline 3. Radiation therapy & - Radiation involving sites of bone marrow production may result \\
\hline 4. Biologic response modifiers & - Some biologic response modifiers may cause bone marrow suppression and organ dysfunction. \\
\hline 5. Malignancy & - Malignant cells may infiltrate the bone marrow and interfere with production of white blood cells and lymphocytes. Hematologic malignancies (leukemias and lymphomas) are associated with impaired function and production of blood cells. \\
\hline 6. Malnutrition & - Results in impaired function and production of cells of the immune response. May contribute to impaired skin integrity. \\
\hline 7. Medications & - Antibiotics disturb the balance of normal flora, allowing them to become pathogenic. This process occurs most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract. Corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs mask inflammatory responses. \\
\hline & - Creates port and mechanism of entry for organisms. \\
\hline & \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
8. Urinary catheter \\

\hline 11. Contaminated equipment & - Environmental objects such as stagnant water in oxygen equipment are associated with growth of microorganisms. \\
\hline 12. Age & - Increasing age associated with declining organ function. Also associated with decreased production and functioning of the cells of the immune system. \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
and changes related to aging. Skin lesions or ulcerations secondary to the tumor are noted. Alterations in tissue integrity throughout the gastrointestinal tract are particularly bothersome to the patient. Any lesions of the oral mucous membranes are noted, as are their effects on the patient's nutritional status and comfort level.

\section*{HAIR LOSS}

Alopecia (hair loss) is another form of tissue disruption common to cancer patients who receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy. In addition to noting hair loss, the nurse also assesses the psychological impact of this side effect on the patient and the family.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL CONCERNS}

Assessing the patient's nutritional status is an important nursing role. Impaired nutritional status may contribute to disease progression, immune incompetence, increased incidence of infection, delayed tissue repair, diminished functional ability, and decreased capacity to continue antineoplastic therapy. Altered nutritional status, weight loss, and cachexia (muscle wasting, emaciation) may be secondary to decreased protein and caloric intake, metabolic or mechanical effects of the cancer, systemic disease, side effects of the treatment, or the emotional status of the patient.

The patient's weight and caloric intake are monitored on a consistent basis. Other information obtained through assessment includes diet history, any episodes of anorexia, changes in appetite, situations and foods that aggravate or relieve anorexia, and medication history. Difficulty in chewing or swallowing is determined and the occurrence of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea is noted.

Clinical and laboratory data useful in assessing the patient's nutritional status include anthropometric measurements (triceps skin fold and middle-upper arm circumference), serum protein levels (albumin and transferrin), serum electrolytes, lymphocyte count, skin response to intradermal injection of antigens, hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, urinary creatinine levels, and serum iron levels.

\section*{PAIN}

Pain and discomfort in cancer may be related to the underlying disease, pressure exerted by the tumor, diagnostic procedures, or the cancer treatment itself. As in any other situation involving pain, cancer pain is affected by both physical and psychosocial influences.

In addition to assessing the source and site of pain, the nurse also assesses those factors that increase the patient's perception of pain, such as fear and apprehension, fatigue, anger, and social isolation. Pain assessment scales (see Chap. 13) are useful in assess-
ing the patient's pain level before pain-relieving interventions are instituted and in evaluating their effectiveness.

\section*{FATIGUE}

Acute fatigue, which occurs after an energy-demanding experience, serves a protective function; chronic fatigue, however, does not. It is often overwhelming, excessive, and not responsive to rest, and it seriously affects quality of life. Fatigue is the most commonly reported side effect in patients who receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The nurse assesses for feelings of weariness, weakness, lack of energy, inability to carry out necessary and valued daily functions, lack of motivation, and inability to concentrate. Patients may become less verbal and appear pallid, with relaxed facial musculature. The nurse assesses physiologic and psychological stressors that can contribute to fatigue, including pain, nausea, dyspnea, constipation, fear, and anxiety. (See Nursing Research Profile 16-2.)

\section*{PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS}

Nursing assessment also focuses on the patient's psychological and mental status as the patient and the family face this lifethreatening experience, unpleasant diagnostic tests and treatment modalities, and progression of disease. The patient's mood and emotional reaction to the results of diagnostic testing and prognosis are assessed, along with evidence that the patient is progressing through the stages of grief and can talk about the diagnosis and prognosis with the family.

\section*{BODY IMAGE}

Cancer patients are forced to cope with many assaults to body image throughout the course of disease and treatment. Entry into the health care system is often accompanied by depersonalization. Threats to self-concept are enormous as patients face the realization of illness, possible disability, and death. To accommodate treatments or because of the disease, many cancer patients are forced to alter their lifestyles. Priorities and values change when body image is threatened. Disfiguring surgery, hair loss, cachexia, skin changes, altered communication patterns, and sexual dysfunction are some of the devastating results of cancer and its treatment that threaten the patient's selfesteem and body image. The nurse identifies these potential threats and assesses the patient's ability to cope with these changes.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, nursing diagnoses of the patient with cancer may include the following:
- Impaired oral mucous membrane
- Impaired tissue integrity
- Impaired tissue integrity: alopecia
- Impaired tissue integrity: malignant skin lesions
- Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements
- Anorexia
- Malabsorption
- Cachexia
- Chronic pain
- Fatigue
- Disturbed body image
- Anticipatory grieving

\section*{Nursing Research Profile 16-2 Cancer-Related Fatigue}

Berger, A. M., \& Farr, L. (1999). The influence of daytime inactivity and nighttime restlessness on cancer-related fatigue. Oncology Nursing Forum, 26(10), 1663-1671.

\section*{Purpose}

Negative, long-term consequences of chemotherapy, including fatigue, have been reported. Many women report fatigue during and following breast cancer treatment; however, perceptions of fatigue have not been objectively quantified. The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between circadian activity/rest indicators and fatigue experienced by women during the first three chemotherapy cycles for stage I/II breast cancer.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A prospective, descriptive, repeated-measures study was conducted over a 12 -month period. Seventy-two participants were recruited for the study; 12 withdrew, leaving a sample of 60 women. To be eligible for the study, women had to be 33 to 69 years of age, diagnosed for the first time with stage I/II breast cancer, scheduled to begin one of three intravenous chemotherapy regimens following recent modified radical mastectomy or breast-conservation surgery, English-speaking, and able to complete the research instruments.

A wrist actigraph was used for continuous monitoring of body movement over time, providing data for analysis of circadian activity/rest cycles; relative activity within days and across days; and the timing, duration, and disruption of sleep. Data were collected for 96 hours at the start of each treatment and for 72 hours at the midpoint of each chemotherapy cycle. Data from the actigraph were downloaded to a software program. The Piper Fatigue scale was used to measure participants' subjective perception of fatigue shortly after each chemotherapy treatment and on the midpoint days of each cycle coinciding with the actigraph measurements.

\section*{Findings}

Analysis of data revealed that participants who were less active during the day and had more nighttime awakenings consistently reported higher levels of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) at the midpoint of each chemotherapy cycle. The number of night awakenings had the strongest association with CRF. Decreased daytime activity and nighttime restlessness were associated with higher CRF. Participants who were more active maintained more distinctive circadian activity/rest rhythms.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The findings of this study demonstrate that women whose sleep is disrupted at midpoints of chemotherapy cycles are at risk for CRF. Higher CRF levels are associated with the cumulative effects of less daytime activity, more daytime sleep, and night awakenings. Sedentary lifestyles in response to fatigue result, in turn, in increased fatigue. These findings suggest the need to assist women with developing a balance of activity and rest; advising women to "take it easy" during chemotherapy may result in decreased activity and increased fatigue.

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Infection and sepsis
- Hemorrhage
- Superior vena cava syndrome
- Spinal cord compression
- Hypercalcemia
- Pericardial effusion
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone
- Tumor lysis syndrome

See the later section, Oncologic Emergencies, for more information.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient may include management of stomatitis, maintenance of tissue integrity, maintenance of nutrition, relief of pain, relief of fatigue, improved body image, effective progression through the grieving process, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

The patient with cancer is at risk for various adverse effects of therapy and complications. The nurse in all health care settings, including the home, assists the patient and family in managing these problems.

\section*{MANAGING STOMATITIS}

Stomatitis, an inflammatory response of the oral tissues, commonly develops within 5 to 14 days after the patient receives certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, and BRMs, such as IL-2 and IFN. As many as $40 \%$ of patients receiving chemotherapy experience some degree of stomatitis during treatment. Patients receiving dose-intensive chemotherapy (considerably higher doses than conventional dosing), such as those undergoing BMT, are at increased risk for stomatitis. Stomatitis may also occur with radiation to the head and neck. Stomatitis is characterized by mild redness (erythema) and edema or, if severe, by painful ulcerations, bleeding, and secondary infection. In severe cases of stomatitis, cancer therapy may be temporarily halted until the inflammation decreases.

As a result of normal everyday wear and tear, the epithelial cells that line the oral cavity undergo rapid turnover and slough off routinely. Chemotherapy and radiation interfere with the body's ability to replace those cells. An inflammatory response develops as denuded areas appear in the oral cavity. Poor oral hygiene, existing dental disease, use of other medications that dry mucous membranes, and impaired nutritional status contribute to morbidity associated with stomatitis. Radiation-induced xerostomia (dry mouth) associated with decreased function of the salivary glands may contribute to stomatitis in patients who have received radiation to the head and neck.

Myelosuppression (bone marrow depression) resulting from underlying disease or its treatment predisposes the patient to oral bleeding and infection. Pain associated with ulcerated oral tissues can significantly interfere with nutritional intake, speech, and a willingness to maintain oral hygiene.

Although multiple studies on stomatitis have been published, the optimal prevention and treatment approaches have not been identified. However, most clinicians agree that good oral hygiene that includes brushing, flossing, and rinsing is necessary to minimize the risk for oral complications associated with cancer therapies. Soft-bristled toothbrushes and nonabrasive toothpaste prevent or reduce trauma to the oral mucosa. Oral swabs with spongelike applicators may be used in place of a toothbrush for painful oral tissues. Flossing may be performed unless it causes pain or unless platelet levels are below $40,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3} ~(0.04 \times \left.10^{12} / \mathrm{L}\right)$. Oral rinses with saline solution or tap water may be nec-
essary for patients who cannot tolerate a toothbrush. Products that irritate oral tissues or impair healing, such as alcohol-based mouth rinses, are avoided. Foods that are difficult to chew or are hot or spicy are avoided to minimize further trauma. The patient's lips are lubricated to keep them from becoming dry and cracked. Topical anti-inflammatory and anesthetic agents may be prescribed to promote healing and minimize discomfort. Products that coat or protect oral mucosa are used to promote comfort and prevent further trauma. The patient who experiences severe pain and discomfort with stomatitis requires systemic analgesics.

Adequate fluid and food intake is encouraged. In some instances, parenteral hydration and nutrition are needed. Topical or systemic antifungal and antibiotic medications are prescribed to treat local or systemic infections.

\section*{MAINTAINING TISSUE INTEGRITY}

Some of the most frequently encountered disturbances of tissue integrity, in addition to stomatitis, include skin and tissue reactions to radiation therapy, alopecia, and metastatic skin lesions.

The patient who is experiencing skin and tissue reactions to radiation therapy requires careful skin care to prevent further skin irritation, drying, and damage. The skin over the affected area is handled gently; rubbing and use of hot or cold water, soaps, powders, lotions, and cosmetics are avoided. The patient may avoid tissue injury by wearing loose-fitting clothes and avoiding clothes that constrict, irritate, or rub the affected area. If blistering occurs, care is taken not to disrupt the blisters, thus reducing the risk of introducing bacteria. Moisture- and vapor-permeable dressings, such as hydrocolloids and hydrogels, are helpful in promoting healing and reducing pain. Aseptic wound care is indicated to minimize the risk for infection and sepsis. Topical antibiotics, such as $1 \%$ silver sulfadiazine cream (Silvadene), may be prescribed for use on areas of moist desquamation (painful, red, moist skin).

\section*{ASSISTING PATIENTS TO COPE WITH ALOPECIA}

The temporary or permanent thinning or complete loss of hair is a potential adverse effect of various radiation therapies and chemotherapeutic agents. The extent of alopecia depends on the dose and duration of therapy. These treatments cause alopecia by damaging stem cells and hair follicles. As a result, the hair is brittle and may fall out or break off at the surface of the scalp. Loss of other body hair is less frequent. Hair loss usually begins within 2 to 3 weeks after the initiation of treatment; regrowth begins within 8 weeks after the last treatment. Some patients who undergo radiation to the head may sustain permanent hair loss. Many health care providers view hair loss as a minor problem when compared with the potentially life-threatening consequences of cancer. For many patients, however, hair loss is a major assault on body image, resulting in depression, anxiety, anger, rejection, and isolation. To patients and families, hair loss can serve as a constant reminder of the challenges cancer places on their coping abilities, interpersonal relationships, and sexuality.

The nurse's role is to provide information about alopecia and to support the patient and family in coping with disturbing effects of therapy, such as hair loss and changes in body image. Patients are encouraged to acquire a wig or hairpiece before hair loss occurs so that the replacement matches their own hair. Use of attractive scarves and hats may make the patient feel less conspicuous. Nurses can refer patients to supportive programs, such as "Look Good, Feel Better," offered by the American Cancer Soci-
ety. Knowledge that hair usually begins to regrow after completing therapy may comfort some patients, although the color and texture of the new hair may be different.

\section*{MANAGING MALIGNANT SKIN LESIONS}

Skin lesions may occur with local extension of the tumor or embolization of the tumor into the epithelium and its surrounding lymph and blood vessels. Secondary growth of cancer cells into the skin may result in redness (erythematous areas) or can progress to wounds involving tissue necrosis and infection. The most extensive lesions tend to disintegrate and are purulent and malodorous. In addition, these lesions are a source of considerable pain and discomfort. Although this type of lesion is most often associated with breast cancer and head and neck cancers, it can also occur with lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, and cancers of the lung, uterus, kidney, colon, and bladder. The development of severe skin lesions is usually associated with a poor prognosis for extended survival.

Ulcerating skin lesions usually indicate widely disseminated disease unlikely to be eradicated. Managing these lesions becomes a nursing priority. Nursing care includes carefully assessing and cleansing the skin, reducing superficial bacteria, controlling bleeding, reducing odor, and protecting the skin from pain and further trauma. The patient and family require assistance and guidance to care for these skin lesions at home. Referral for home care is indicated.

\section*{PROMOTING NUTRITION}

Most cancer patients experience some weight loss during their illness. Anorexia, malabsorption, and cachexia are examples of nutritional problems that commonly occur in cancer patients; special attention is needed to prevent weight loss and promote nutrition.

\section*{Anorexia}

Among the many causes of anorexia in the cancer patient are alterations in taste, manifested by increased salty, sour, and metallic taste sensations, and altered responses to sweet and bitter flavors, leading to decreased appetite, decreased nutritional intake, and protein-calorie malnutrition. Taste alterations may result from mineral (eg, zinc) deficiencies, increases in circulating amino acids and cellular metabolites, or the administration of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients undergoing radiation therapy to the head and neck may experience "mouth blindness," which is a severe impairment of taste.

Alterations in the sense of smell also alter taste; this is a common experience of patients with head and neck cancers. Anorexia may occur because the person feels full after eating only a small amount of food. This sense of fullness occurs secondary to a decrease in digestive enzymes, abnormalities in the metabolism of glucose and triglycerides, and prolonged stimulation of gastric volume receptors, which convey the feeling of being full. Psychological distress, such as fear, pain, depression, and isolation, throughout illness may also have a negative impact on appetite. The person may develop an aversion to food because of nausea and vomiting after treatment.

\section*{Malabsorption}

Many cancer patients are unable to absorb nutrients from the gastrointestinal system as a result of tumor activity and cancer treatment. Tumors can affect the gastrointestinal activity in several ways. They may impair enzyme production or produce fistulas. They secrete hormones and enzymes, such as gastrin; this leads to
increased gastrointestinal irritation, peptic ulcer disease, and decreased fat digestion. They also interfere with protein digestion.

Chemotherapy and radiation can irritate and damage mucosal cells of the bowel, inhibiting absorption. Radiation therapy can cause sclerosis of the blood vessels in the bowel and fibrotic changes in the gastrointestinal tissue. Surgical intervention may change peristaltic patterns, alter gastrointestinal secretions, and reduce the absorptive surfaces of the gastrointestinal mucosa, all leading to malabsorption.

\section*{Cachexia}

Cachexia is common in patients with cancer, especially in advanced disease. Cancer cachexia is related to inadequate nutritional intake along with increasing metabolic demand, increased energy expenditure due to anaerobic metabolism of the tumor, impaired glucose metabolism, competition of the tumor cells for nutrients, altered lipid metabolism, and a suppressed appetite. It is characterized by loss of body weight, adipose tissue, visceral protein, and skeletal muscle. Patients who are cachectic complain of loss of appetite, early satiety, and fatigue. As a result of protein losses they are often anemic and have peripheral edema.

\section*{General Nutritional Considerations}

Whenever possible, every effort is used to maintain adequate nutrition through the oral route. Food should be prepared in ways that make it appealing. Unpleasant smells and unappetizinglooking foods are avoided. Family members are included in the plan of care to encourage adequate food intake. The patient's preferences, as well as physiologic and metabolic requirements, are considered when selecting foods. Small, frequent meals are provided, with supplements between meals. Patients often tolerate larger amounts of food earlier in the day rather than later, so meals can be planned accordingly. Patients should avoid drinking fluids while eating, to avoid early satiety. Oral hygiene before mealtime often makes meals more pleasant. Pain, nausea, and other symptoms that may interfere with nutrition are assessed and managed. Medications such as corticosteroids or progestational agents such as megestrol acetate have been used successfully as appetite stimulants.

If adequate nutrition cannot be maintained by oral intake, nutritional support via the enteral route may be necessary. Shortterm nutritional supplementation may be provided through a nasogastric tube. However, if nutritional support is needed beyond several weeks, a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube may be inserted. Patients and families are taught to administer enteral nutrition in the home setting.

If malabsorption is a problem, enzyme and vitamin replacement may be instituted. Additional strategies include changing the feeding schedule, using simple diets, and relieving diarrhea. If malabsorption is severe, parenteral nutrition (PN) may be necessary. PN can be administered in several ways: by a long-term venous access device, such as a right atrial catheter, an implanted venous port, or a peripherally inserted central catheter (Fig. 16-6). The nurse teaches the patient and family to care for venous access devices and to administer PN. Home care nurses may assist with or supervise PN in the home.

Interventions to reduce cachexia usually do not prolong survival but may improve the patient's quality of life. Before invasive nutritional strategies are instituted, the nurse should assess the patient carefully and discuss the options with the patient and family. Creative dietary therapies, enteral (tube) feedings, or PN may be necessary to ensure adequate nutrition. Nursing care is

also directed toward preventing trauma, infection, and other complications that increase metabolic demands.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Of all patients with progressive cancer, more than $75 \%$ experience pain (Yarbro, Hansen-Frogge \& Goodman, 1999). Although patients with cancer may have acute pain, their pain is more frequently characterized as chronic. (For more information on cancer-related pain, see Chap. 13.) As in other situations involving pain, the experience of cancer pain is influenced by both physical and psychosocial factors.

Cancer can cause pain in various ways (Table 16-9). Pain is also associated with various cancer treatments. Acute pain is linked with trauma from surgery. Occasionally, chronic pain syndromes, such as postsurgical neuropathies (pain related to nerve tissue injury), occur. Some chemotherapeutic agents cause tissue necrosis, peripheral neuropathies, and stomatitis-all potential sources of pain-whereas radiation therapy can cause pain secondary to skin or organ inflammation. Cancer patients may have other sources of pain, such as arthritis or migraine headaches, that are unrelated to the underlying cancer or its treatment.

In today's society, most people expect pain to disappear or resolve quickly, and in fact it usually does. Although controllable, cancer pain is commonly irreversible and not quickly resolved.

For many patients, pain is a signal that the tumor is growing and that death is approaching. As the patient anticipates the pain and anxiety increases, pain perception heightens, producing fear and further pain. Chronic cancer pain, then, can be best described as a cycle progressing from pain to anxiety to fear and back to pain again.

Pain tolerance, the point past which pain can no longer be tolerated, varies among people. Pain tolerance is decreased by fatigue, anxiety, fear of death, anger, powerlessness, social isolation, changes in role identity, loss of independence, and past experiences. Adequate rest and sleep, diversion, mood elevation, empathy, and medications such as antidepressants, antianxiety agents, and analgesics enhance tolerance to pain.

Inadequate pain management is most often the result of misconceptions and insufficient knowledge about pain assessment and pharmacologic interventions on the part of patients, families, and health care providers. Successful management of cancer pain is based on thorough and objective pain assessment that examines physical, psychosocial, environmental, and spiritual factors. A multidisciplinary team approach is essential to determine optimal management of the patient's pain. Unlike instances of chronic nonmalignant pain, systemic analgesics play a central role in managing cancer pain.

The World Health Organization (Dalton \& Youngblood, 2000) advocates a three-step approach to treating cancer pain (see Chap. 13). Analgesics are administered based on the patient's level of pain. Nonopioid analgesics (eg, acetaminophen) are used for mild pain; weak opioid analgesics (eg, codeine) are used for moderate pain; and strong opioid analgesics (eg, morphine) are used for severe pain. If the patient's pain escalates, the strength of the analgesic medication is increased until the pain is controlled. Adjuvant medications are also administered to enhance the effectiveness of analgesics and to manage other symptoms that may contribute to the pain experience. Examples of adjuvant medications include antiemetics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiseizure agents, stimulants, local anesthetics, radiopharmaceuticals (radioactive agents that may be used to treat painful bone tumors), and corticosteroids.

Preventing and reducing pain help to decrease anxiety and break the pain cycle. This can be accomplished best by administering analgesics on a regularly scheduled basis as prescribed (the preventive approach to pain management), with additional analgesics administered for breakthrough pain as needed and as prescribed.

Various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches offer the best methods of managing cancer pain. No reasonable approaches, even those that may be invasive, should be over-

looked because of a poor or terminal prognosis. Nurses help patients and families to take an active role in managing pain. Nurses provide education and support to correct fears and misconceptions about opioid use. Inadequate pain control leads to suffering, anxiety, fear, immobility, isolation, and depression. Improving a patient's quality of life is as important as preventing a painful death.

\section*{DECREASING FATIGUE}

In recent years, fatigue has been recognized as one of the most significant and frequent symptoms experienced by patients receiving cancer therapy. Nurses help the patient and family to understand that fatigue is usually an expected and temporary side effect of the cancer process and of many treatments used. Fatigue also stems from the stress of coping with cancer. It does not always signify that the cancer is advancing or that the treatment is failing. Potential sources of fatigue are summarized in Chart 16-7.

Nursing strategies are implemented to minimize fatigue or assist the patient to cope with existing fatigue. Helping the patient to identify sources of fatigue aids in selecting appropriate and individualized interventions. Ways to conserve energy are developed to help the patient plan daily activities. Alternating periods of rest and activity are beneficial. Regular, light exercise may decrease fatigue and facilitate coping, whereas lack of physical activity and "too much rest" can actually contribute to deconditioning and associated fatigue.

Patients are encouraged to maintain as normal a lifestyle as possible by continuing with those activities they value and enjoy. Prioritizing necessary and valued activities can assist patients in planning for each day. Both patients and families are encouraged to plan to reallocate responsibilities, such as attending to child care, cleaning, and preparing meals. Patients who are employed full-time may need to reduce the number of hours worked each week. The nurse assists the patient and family in coping with these changing roles and responsibilities.

Nurses also address factors that contribute to fatigue and implement pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies to manage pain. Nutrition counseling is provided to patients who are not eating enough calories or protein. Small, frequent meals require less energy for digestion. Serum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are monitored for deficiencies, and blood products or EPO are administered as prescribed. Patients are monitored for alterations in oxygenation and electrolyte balances. Physical ther-

apy and assistive devices are beneficial for patients with impaired mobility.

\section*{IMPROVING BODY IMAGE AND SELF-ESTEEM}

A positive approach is essential when caring for the patient with an altered body image. To help the patient retain control and positive self-esteem, it is important to encourage independence and continued participation in self-care and decision making. The patient should be assisted to assume those tasks and participate in those activities that are personally of most value. Any negative feelings that the patient has or threats to body image should be identified and discussed. The nurse serves as a listener and counselor to both the patient and the family. Referral to a support group can provide the patient with additional assistance in coping with the changes resulting from cancer or its treatment. In many cases, a cosmetologist can provide ideas about hair or wig styling, make-up, and the use of scarves and turbans to help with body image concerns.

Patients who experience alterations in sexuality and sexual function are encouraged to discuss concerns openly with their partner. Alternative forms of sexual expression are explored with the patient and partner to promote positive self-worth and acceptance. The nurse who identifies serious physiologic, psychological, or communication difficulties related to sexuality or sexual function is in a key position to assist the patient and partner to seek further counseling if necessary.

\section*{ASSISTING IN THE GRIEVING PROCESS}

A cancer diagnosis need not indicate a fatal outcome. Many forms of cancer are curable; others may be cured if treated early. Despite these facts, many patients and their families view cancer as a fatal disease that is inevitably accompanied by pain, suffering, debility, and emaciation. Grieving is a normal response to these fears and to the losses anticipated or experienced by the patient with cancer. These may include loss of health, normal sensations, body image, social interaction, sexuality, and intimacy. The patient, family, and friends may grieve for the loss of quality time to spend with others, the loss of future and unfulfilled plans, and the loss of control over one's own body and emotional reactions.

The patient and family just informed of the cancer diagnosis frequently respond with shock, numbness, and disbelief. It is often during this stage that the patient and family are called on to make important initial decisions about treatment. They require the support of the physician, nurse, and other health care team members to make these decisions. An important role of the nurse is to answer any questions the patient and family have and clarify information provided by the physician.

In addition to assessing the response of the patient and family to the diagnosis and planned treatment, the nurse assists them in framing their questions and concerns, identifying resources and support people (eg, spiritual advisor, counselor), and communicating their concerns with each other. Support groups for patients and families are available through hospitals and various community organizations. These groups provide direct assistance, advice, and emotional support.

As the patient and family progress through the grieving process, they may express anger, frustration, and depression. During this time, the nurse encourages the patient and family to verbalize their feelings in an atmosphere of trust and support. The nurse continues to assess their reactions and provides assistance and support as they confront and learn to deal with new problems.

If the patient enters the terminal phase of disease, the nurse may realize that the patient and family members are at different stages of grief. In such cases, the nurse assists the patient and family to ac-
knowledge and cope with their reactions and feelings. Nurses also assist patients and families to explore preferences for issues related to end-of-life care such as withdrawal of active disease treatment, desire for the use of life support measures, and symptom management. Support, which can be as simple as holding the patient's hand or just being with the patient at home or at the bedside, often contributes to peace of mind. Maintaining contact with the surviving family members after the death of the cancer patient may help them to work through their feelings of loss and grief. See Chapter 17 for further discussion of end-of-life issues.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Despite advances in cancer care, infection remains the leading cause of death. In the cancer patient, defense against infection is compromised in many different ways. The integrity of the skin and mucous membrane, the body's first line of defense, is challenged by multiple invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, by adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy, and by the detrimental effects of immobility.

Impaired nutrition resulting from anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the underlying disease alters the body's ability to combat invading organisms. Medications such as antibiotics disturb the balance of normal flora, allowing the overgrowth of pathogenic organisms. Other medications can also alter the immune response (see Chap. 50). Cancer itself may be immunosuppressive. Cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma are often associated with defects in cellular and humoral immunity. Advanced cancer can lead to obstruction by the tumor of the hollow viscera (such as the intestines), blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, creating a favorable environment for proliferation of pathogenic organisms. In some patients, tumor cells infiltrate bone marrow and prevent normal production of WBCs. Most often, however, a decrease in WBCs is a result of bone marrow suppression after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The use of the hematopoietic growth factors, also called colony-stimulating factors (see the previous discussion of BRM therapy), has reduced the severity and duration of neutropenia associated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The administration of these factors assists in reducing the risk for infection and, possibly, in maintaining treatment schedules, drug dosages, treatment effectiveness, and the quality of life.

\section*{Infection}

Gram-positive organisms, such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species, are the most frequently isolated causes of infection. Gramnegative organisms, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungal organisms, such as Candida albicans, also contribute to the incidence of serious infection.

Fever is probably the most important sign of infection in the immunocompromised patient. Although fever may be related to a variety of noninfectious conditions, including the underlying cancer, any temperature of $38.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ or higher is reported and dealt with promptly.

Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat infections after cultures of wound drainage, exudate, sputum, urine, stool, or blood are obtained. Patients with neutropenia are treated with broadspectrum antibiotics before the infecting organism is identified because of the high incidence of mortality associated with untreated infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage or empiric therapy most often includes a combination of medications to
defend the body against the major pathogenic organisms. An important component of the nurse's role is to administer these medications promptly according to the prescribed schedule to achieve adequate blood levels of the medications.

Strict asepsis is essential when handling intravenous lines, catheters, and other invasive equipment. Exposure of the patient to others with an active infection and to crowds is avoided. Patients with profound immunosuppression, such as BMT recipients, may need to be placed in a protective environment where the room and its contents are sterilized and the air is filtered. These patients may also receive low-bacteria diets, avoiding fresh fruits and vegetables. Hand hygiene and appropriate general hygiene are necessary to reduce exposure to potentially harmful bacteria and to eliminate environmental contaminants. Invasive procedures, such as injections, vaginal or rectal examinations, rectal temperatures, and surgery, are avoided. The patient is encouraged to cough and perform deep-breathing exercises frequently to prevent atelectasis and other respiratory problems. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy may be used for patients who are expected to be profoundly immunosuppressed and at risk for certain infections. The nurse teaches the patient and family to recognize signs and symptoms of infection to report, perform effective hand hygiene, use antipyretics, maintain skin integrity, and administer hematopoietic growth factors when indicated.

\section*{Septic Shock}

The nurse assesses the patient frequently for infection and inflammation throughout the course of the disease. Septicemia and septic shock are life-threatening complications that must be prevented or detected and treated promptly. Patients with signs and symptoms of impending sepsis and septic shock require immediate hospitalization and aggressive treatment.

Signs and symptoms of septic shock (see Chap. 15) include altered mental status, either subnormal or elevated temperature, cool and clammy skin, decreased urine output, hypotension, dysrhythmias, electrolyte imbalances, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. The patient and family members are instructed about signs of septicemia, methods for preventing infection, and actions to take if infection or septicemia occurs.

Septic shock is most often associated with overwhelming gram-negative bacterial infections. The nurse monitors the blood pressure, pulse rate, respirations, and temperature of the patient with shock every 15 to 30 minutes. Neurologic assessments are carried out to detect changes in orientation and responsiveness. Fluid and electrolyte status is monitored by measuring fluid intake and output and serum electrolytes. Arterial blood gas values and pulse oximetry are monitored to determine tissue oxygenation. The nurse administers intravenous fluids, blood products, and vasopressors as prescribed to maintain the patient's blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Supplemental oxygen is often necessary. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered as prescribed to combat the underlying infection (see Chap. 15).

\section*{Bleeding and Hemorrhage}

Thrombocytopenia, a decrease in the circulating platelet count, is the most common cause of bleeding in cancer patients and is usually defined as a count of less than $100,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3} ~(0.1 \times \left.10^{12} / \mathrm{L}\right)$. When the count falls between 20,000 and $50,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ( 0.02 to $0.05 \times 10^{12} / \mathrm{L}$ ), the risk for bleeding increases. Counts under $20,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}\left(0.02 \times 10^{12} / \mathrm{L}\right)$ are associated with an increased risk for spontaneous bleeding, for which the patient requires a platelet transfusion. Platelets are essential for normal blood clotting and coagulation (hemostasis).

Thrombocytopenia often results from bone marrow depression after certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Tumor infiltration of the bone marrow can also impair the normal production of platelets. In some cases, platelet destruction is associated with an enlarged spleen (hypersplenism) and abnormal antibody function that occur with leukemia and lymphoma.

In addition to monitoring laboratory values, the nurse continues to assess the patient for bleeding. The nurse also takes steps to prevent trauma and minimize the risk for bleeding by encouraging the patient to use a soft, not stiff, toothbrush and an electric, not straight-edged, razor. Additionally, the nurse avoids unnecessary invasive procedures (eg, rectal temperatures, intramuscular injections, and catheterization) and assists the patient and family to identify and remove environmental hazards that may lead to falls or other trauma. Soft foods, increased fluid intake, and stool softeners, if prescribed, may be indicated to reduce trauma to the gastrointestinal tract. The joints and extremities are handled and moved gently to minimize the risk for spontaneous bleeding. The nurse may administer IL-11, which has been approved by the FDA (Rust, Wood \& Battiato, 1999) to prevent severe thrombocytopenia and to reduce the need for platelet transfusions following myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies. In some instances, the nurse teaches the patient or family member to administer IL-11 in the home.

Hemorrhage may be related to various underlying abnormalities, such as thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders. These clinical situations are often associated with the cancer itself or the adverse effects of cancer treatments. Sites of hemorrhage may include the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and the brain. Blood pressure and pulse and respiratory rates are monitored every 15 to 30 minutes when hospitalized patients experience bleeding.

Serum hemoglobin and hematocrit are monitored carefully for changes indicating blood loss. The nurse tests all urine, stool, and emesis for occult blood. Neurologic assessments are performed to detect changes in orientation and behavior. The nurse administers fluids and blood products as prescribed to replace any losses. Vasopressor agents are administered as prescribed to maintain blood pressure and ensure tissue oxygenation. Supplemental oxygen is used as necessary.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients with cancer usually return home from acute care facilities or receive treatment in the home or outpatient area rather than acute care facilities. The shift from the acute care setting also shifts the responsibility for care to the patient and family. As a result, families and friends must assume increased involvement in patient care, which requires teaching that enables them to provide care. Teaching initially focuses on providing information needed by the patient and family to address the most immediate care needs likely to be encountered at home.

Side effects of treatments and changes in the patient's status that should be reported are reviewed verbally and reinforced with written information. Strategies to deal with side effects of treatment are discussed with the patient and family. Other learning needs are identified based on the priorities conveyed by the patient and family as well as on the complexity of care provided in the home.

Technological advances allow home administration of chemotherapy, PN, blood products, parenteral antibiotics, and par-
enteral analgesics; management of symptoms; and care of vascular access devices. Although home care nurses provide care and support for patients receiving this advanced technical care, the patient and family need instruction and ongoing support that allow them to feel comfortable and proficient in managing these treatments at home. Follow-up visits and telephone calls from the nurse are often reassuring to the patient and family and increase their comfort in dealing with complex and new aspects of care. Continued contact facilitates evaluation of the patient's progress and ongoing needs.

\section*{Continuing Care}

Referral for home care is often indicated for the patient with cancer. The responsibilities of the home care nurse include assessing the home environment, suggesting modifications in the home or in care to assist the patient and family in addressing the patient's physical needs, providing physical care, and assessing the psychological and emotional impact of the illness on the patient and family.

Assessing changes in the patient's physical status and reporting relevant changes to the physician help to ensure that appropriate and timely modifications in therapy are made. The home care nurse also assesses the adequacy of pain management and the effectiveness of other strategies to prevent or manage the side effects of treatment modalities.

The patient's and family's understanding of the treatment plan and management strategies is assessed, and previous teaching is reinforced. The nurse often facilitates the coordination of patient care by maintaining close communication with all health care providers involved in the patient's care. The nurse may make referrals and coordinate available community resources (eg, local office of the American Cancer Society, home aides, church groups, parish nurses, and support groups) to assist patients and caregivers.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

For specific patient outcomes, see the Plan of Nursing Care. Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Maintains integrity of oral mucous membranes
2. Maintains adequate tissue integrity
3. Maintains adequate nutritional status
4. Achieves relief of pain and discomfort
5. Demonstrates increased activity tolerance and decreased fatigue
6. Exhibits improved body image and self-esteem
7. Progresses through the grieving process
8. Experiences no complications, such as infection, or sepsis, and no episodes of bleeding or hemorrhage

\section*{Cancer Rehabilitation}

Many cancer patients, including those who receive primary surgical treatment and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy, return to work and their usual activities of daily living. These patients may encounter a variety of problems, including changes in their functional abilities and in the attitudes of employers, coworkers, and family members who still view cancer as a terminal, debilitating disease. Nurses play an important role in the re-
habilitation of the cancer patient. Both the patient and family are included as part of any rehabilitation effort because cancer affects not only the patient but also the family members. In addition, with the shift away from inpatient care, many families are caring for patients at home. To maximize beneficial outcomes, evaluation of the patient's needs related to cancer rehabilitation begins early in cancer treatment (Table 16-10).

Assessment for body image changes as a result of disfiguring treatments is necessary to facilitate the patient's adjustment to changes in appearance or functional abilities. The nurse can refer the patient and family to a variety of support groups sponsored by the American Cancer Society, such as those for people who have had laryngectomies or mastectomies. Nurses also collaborate with physical, occupational, and enterostomal therapists in improving the patient's abilities in the use of prosthetic and assistive devices, and in altering the home environment as needed.

Patients often experience distress (eg, pain, nausea) related to the underlying cancer or treatments. These symptoms may interfere with work and quality of life. Nurses assess for these problems and assist the patient in identifying strategies for coping with them. For patients with gastrointestinal disturbances after chemotherapy, altering work hours or receiving treatments in the

evenings may prove helpful. Collaboration with physicians and pharmacists is helpful in identifying appropriate interventions.

Nurses collaborate with dietitians to help patients plan meals that will be acceptable and meet nutritional requirements. Nurses are also involved in the ongoing assessment of patients to detect any long-term consequences of cancer treatment.

Although the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to protect patients with disabling disorders against discrimination, recovering cancer patients have reported instances of unfair practices and discrimination in the workplace. Some employers do not understand that different kinds of cancers have different prognoses and different effects on functional ability. As a result, employers may hesitate to hire or continue to employ people with cancer, especially if ongoing treatment regimens require adjustments in work schedules. Employers, coworkers, and families may continue to view the person as "sick" despite ongoing recovery or completion of treatment. Attitudes of coworkers can be a problem when the patient has a communication impairment, as may occur in some head and neck cancers. The patient may benefit from vocational rehabilitation services of the American Cancer Society or other agencies.

Nurses can participate in efforts to educate employers and the public in general to ensure that the rights of patients with cancer are maintained. Whenever possible, nurses assist patients and families to resume preexisting roles. Psychologists and clergy or spiritual advisors are consulted to assist with psychosocial and spiritual concerns. Rehabilitation shifts the focus from what has been lost to what can be done with existing strengths and abilities. In that spirit, nurses encourage patients to regain the highest level of function and independence possible.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

As a result of an increased life expectancy and an increased risk for cancer with age, nurses are providing cancer-related care for growing numbers of elderly patients. More than $58 \%$ of all cancers occur in people older than 65 years of age, and about two thirds of all cancer deaths occur in people 65 years of age and older. Nursing care of this population addresses special needs, including physical, psychosocial, and financial concerns.

Oncology nurses working with the elderly population need to understand the normal physiologic changes that occur with aging. These changes include decreased skin elasticity; decreased skeletal mass, structure, and strength; decreased organ function and structure; impaired immune system mechanisms; alterations in neurologic and sensory functions; and altered drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. These changes ultimately influence the elderly patient's ability to tolerate cancer treatment. In addition, many elderly patients have other chronic diseases and associated treatments that may limit tolerance to cancer treatments (Table 16-11).

Potential chemotherapy-related toxicities, such as renal impairment, myelosuppression, fatigue, and cardiomyopathy, may increase as a result of declining organ function and diminished physiologic reserves. The recovery of normal tissues after radiation therapy may be delayed, and the patient may experience more severe adverse effects, such as mucositis, nausea and vomiting, and myelosuppression. Because of decreased tissue healing capacity and declining pulmonary and cardiovascular functioning, the older patient is slower to recover from surgery. Elderly patients are also at increased risk for complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and wound infections.

\section*{Table 16-11 - Age-Related Changes and Their Effects on Patients with Cancer}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline AGE-RELATED CHANGES & IMPLICATIONS \\

\hline Potential changes in cognitive and emotional capacity & Provide teaching and support modified for patient's level of functioning. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Access to cancer care for elderly patients may be limited by discriminatory or fatalistic attitudes of health care providers, caregivers, and patients themselves. Issues such as the gradual loss of supportive resources, declining health or loss of a spouse, and unavailability of relatives or friends may result in limited access to care and unmet needs for assistance with activities of daily living. In addition, the economic impact of health care may be difficult for those living on fixed incomes.

The nurse must be aware of the special needs of the aging population. Cancer prevention, detection, and screening efforts are directed toward the elderly as well as the younger population. Nurses carefully monitor elderly patients receiving cancer treatments for signs and symptoms of adverse effects. In addition, the elderly patient is instructed to report all symptoms to the physician. It is not uncommon for the elderly patient to delay reporting symptoms, attributing them to "old age." Many elderly people do not want to report illness for fear of losing their independence or financial security. Sensory losses (eg, hearing and visual losses) and memory deficits are considered when planning patient education because they may affect the patient's ability to process and retain information. In such cases, the nurse needs to act as a patient advocate, encouraging independence and identifying resources for support when indicated.

\section*{Care of the Patient with Advanced Cancer}

The patient with advanced cancer is likely to experience many of the problems previously described, but all to a greater degree. Symptoms of gastrointestinal disturbances, nutritional problems, weight loss, and cachexia make the patient more susceptible to skin breakdown, fluid and electrolyte problems, and infection.

Although not all cancer patients experience pain, those who do commonly fear that it will not be adequately treated. Although treatment at this stage of illness is likely to be palliative rather than curative, prevention and appropriate management of prob-
lems can improve the quality of the patient's life considerably. For example, use of analgesia at set intervals rather than on an "as needed" basis usually breaks the cycle of tension and anxiety associated with waiting until pain becomes so severe that pain relief is inadequate once the analgesic is given. Working with the patient and family, as well as with other health care providers, on a pain-management program based on the patient's requirements frequently increases the patient's comfort and sense of control. In addition, the dose of opioid analgesic required is often reduced as pain becomes more manageable and other medications (eg, sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants) are added to assist in relieving pain.

If the patient is a candidate for radiation therapy or surgical intervention to relieve severe pain, the consequences of these procedures (eg, percutaneous nerve block, cordotomy) are explained to the patient and family, and measures are taken to prevent complications resulting from altered sensation, immobility, and changes in bowel and bladder function.

With the appearance of each new symptom, the patient may experience dread and fear that the disease is progressing. However, one cannot assume that all symptoms are related to the cancer. The new symptoms and problems are evaluated and treated aggressively if possible to increase the patient's comfort and improve quality of life.

Weakness, immobility, fatigue, and inactivity typically occur in the advanced stages of cancer as a result of the tumor, treatment, inadequate nutritional intake, or shortness of breath. The nurse works with the patient to set realistic goals and to provide rest balanced with planned activities and exercise. Other measures include assisting the patient in identifying energy-conserving methods for accomplishing tasks and promoting activities that the patient values the most.

Efforts are made throughout the course of the disease to provide the patient with as much control and independence as desired, but with assurance that support and assistance are available when needed. Additionally, the health care team works with the
patient and family to ascertain and comply with the patient's wishes about treatment methods and care as the terminal phase of illness and death approach.

\section*{HOSPICE}

For many years, society was unable to cope appropriately with patients in the most advanced stages of cancer, and patients died in acute care settings rather than at home or in facilities designed to meet their needs. The needs of patients with terminal illnesses are best met by a comprehensive multidisciplinary program that focuses on quality of life, palliation of symptoms, and provision of psychosocial and spiritual support for the patient and family when cure and control of the disease are no longer possible. The concept of hospice, which originated in Great Britain, best addresses these needs. Most important, the focus of care is on the family, not just the patient. Hospice care can be provided in several settings: freestanding, hospital-based, and community or home-based settings.

Because of the high costs associated with maintaining freestanding hospices, care is often delivered by coordinating services provided by both the hospital and community. Although physi-
cians, social workers, clergy, dietitians, pharmacists, physical therapists, and volunteers are involved in patient care, nurses are most often the coordinators of all hospice activities. It is essential that home care and hospice nurses possess advanced skills in assessing and managing pain, nutrition, dyspnea, bowel dysfunction, and skin impairments.

In addition, hospice programs facilitate clear communication among family members and health care providers. Most patients and families are informed of the prognosis and are encouraged to participate in decisions regarding pursuing or terminating cancer treatment. Through collaboration with other support disciplines, nurses assist patients and families to cope with changes in role identity, family structure, grief, and loss. Hospice nurses are actively involved in bereavement counseling. In many instances, family support for survivors continues for about 1 year. See Chapter 17 for detailed discussion of end-of-life care.

\section*{EMERGENCY}

\section*{Spinal Cord Compression}

Potentially leading to permanent neurologic impairment and associated morbidity and mortality, compression of the cord and its nerve roots may result from tumor, lymphomas, or intervertebral collapse.
The prognosis depends on the severity and rapidity of onset. About $70 \%$ of compressions occur at the thoracic level, $20 \%$ in the lumbosacral level, and $10 \%$ in the cervical region. Metastatic cancers (breast, lung, kidney, prostate, myeloma, lymphoma) and related bone erosion are associated with spinal cord compression.

\section*{Hypercalcemia}

In patients with cancer, hypercalcemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic abnormality resulting when the calcium released from the bones is more than the kidneys can excrete or the bones can reabsorb. It may result from:
- Bone destruction by tumor cells and subsequent release of calcium
- Production of prostaglandins and osteoclast-activating factor, which stimulate bone breakdown and calcium release
- Tumors that produce parathyroid-like substances that promote calcium release
- Excessive use of vitamins and minerals and conditions unrelated to cancer, such as dehydration, renal impairment, primary hyperparathyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, thiazide diuretics, and hormone therapy

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

AND DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS

\section*{Clinical}
- Local inflammation, edema, venous stasis, and impaired blood supply to nervous tissues
- Local or radicular pain along the dermatomal areas innervated by the affected nerve root (eg, thoracic radicular pain extends in a band around the chest or abdomen)
- Pain exacerbated by movement, coughing, sneezing, or the Valsalva maneuver
- Neurologic dysfunction, and related motor and sensory deficits (numbness, tingling, feelings of coldness in the affected area, inability to detect vibration, loss of positional sense)
- Motor loss ranging from subtle weakness to flaccid paralysis
- Bladder and/or bowel dysfunction depending on level of compression (above S2, overflow incontinence; from S3 to S5, flaccid sphincter tone and bowel incontinence)

\section*{Diagnostic}
- Percussion tenderness at the level of compression
- Abnormal reflexes
- Sensory and motor abnormalities
- MRI, myelogram, spinal cord x-rays, bone scans, and CT scan

\section*{Clinical}

Fatigue, weakness, confusion, decreased level of responsiveness, hyporeflexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, polyuria (excessive urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), dehydration, and dysrhythmias

\section*{Diagnostic}

Serum calcium level exceeding $11 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $2.74 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ )

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Medical}
- Radiation therapy to reduce tumor size to halt progression and corticosteroid therapy to decrease inflammation and swelling at the compression site
- Surgery only if symptoms progress despite radiation therapy or if vertebral fracture leads to additional nerve damage
- Chemotherapy as adjuvant to radiation therapy for patients with lymphoma or small cell lung cancer
- Note: Despite treatment, patients with poor neurologic function before treatment are less likely to regain complete motor and sensory function; patients who develop complete paralysis usually do not regain all neurologic function.

\section*{Nursing}
- Perform ongoing assessment of neurologic function to identify existing and progressing dysfunction.
- Control pain with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures.
- Prevent complications of immobility resulting from pain and decreased function (eg, skin breakdown, urinary stasis, thrombophlebitis, and decreased clearance of pulmonary secretions).
- Maintain muscle tone by assisting with range-ofmotion exercises in collaboration with physical and occupational therapists.
- Institute intermittent urinary catheterization and bowel training programs for patients with bladder or bowel dysfunction.
- Provide encouragement and support to patient and family coping with pain and altered functioning, lifestyle, roles, and independence.

\section*{Medical}

See Chapter 14.

\section*{Nursing}
- Identify patients at risk for hypercalcemia and assess for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia.
- Educate patient and family; prevention and early detection can prevent fatality.
- Teach at-risk patients to recognize and report signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia.
- Encourage patients to consume 2 to 3 L of fluid daily unless contraindicated by existing renal or cardiac disease.
- Explain the use of dietary and pharmacologic interventions such as stool softeners and laxatives for constipation.
- Advise patients to maintain nutritional intake without restricting normal calcium intake.
- Discuss antiemetic therapy if nausea and vomiting occur.
- Promote mobility by emphasizing its importance in preventing demineralization and breakdown of bones.

\section*{EMERGENCY}

\section*{Pericardial Effusion and}

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade}

Cardiac tamponade is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. The accumulation compresses the heart and thereby impedes expansion of the ventricles and cardiac filling during diastole. As ventricular volume and cardiac output fall, the heart pump fails, and circulatory collapse develops.
With gradual onset, fluid accumulates gradually, and the outer layer of the pericardial space stretches to compensate for rising pressure. Large amounts of fluid accumulate before symptoms of heart failure occur. With rapid onset, pressures rise too quickly for the pericardial space to compensate.
Cancerous tumors, particularly from adjacent thoracic tumors (lung, esophagus, breast cancers), and cancer treatment are the most common causes of cardiac tamponade. Radiation therapy of $4,000 \mathrm{cGy}$ or more to the mediastinal area has also been implicated in pericardial fibrosis, pericarditis, and resultant cardiac tamponade. Untreated pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade lead to circulatory collapse and cardiac arrest.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

\section*{AND DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS}

\section*{Clinical}
- Neck vein distention during inspiration (Kussmaul's sign)
- Pulsus paradoxus (systolic blood pressure decrease exceeding 10 mm Hg during inspiration; pulse gets stronger on expiration)
- Distant heart sounds, rubs and gallops, cardiac dullness
- Compensatory tachycardia (heart beats faster to compensate for decreased cardiac output)
- Increased venous and vascular pressures

\section*{Diagnostic}
- ECG helps diagnose pericardial effusion.
- In small effusion, chest x-rays show small amounts of fluid in the pericardium; in large effusions, x-ray films disclose "water-bottle" heart (obliteration of vessel contour and cardiac chambers).
-ECG and CT scans help diagnose pleural effusions and evaluate effect of treatment.
- Narrow pulse pressure
- Shortness of breath and tachypnea
- Weakness, chest pain, orthopnea, anxiety, diaphoresis, lethargy, and altered consciousness from decreased cerebral perfusion

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Medical}
- Pericardiocentesis (the aspiration or withdrawal of the pericardial fluid by a large-bore needle inserted into the pericardial space). In malignant effusions, pericardiocentesis provides only temporary relief; fluid usually reaccumulates. Windows or openings in the pericardium can be created surgically as a palliative measure to drain fluid into the pleural space. Catheters may also be placed in the pericardial space and sclerosing agents (such as tetracycline, talc, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, or thiotepa) injected to prevent fluid from reaccumulating.
- Radiation therapy or antineoplastic agents, depending on how sensitive the primary tumor is to these treatments. In mild effusions, prednisone and diuretic medications may be prescribed and the patient's status carefully monitored.

\section*{Nursing}
- Monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation frequently.
- Assess for pulsus paradoxus.
- Monitor ECG tracings.
- Assess heart and lung sounds, neck vein filling, level of consciousness, respiratory status, and skin color and temperature.
- Monitor and record intake and output.
- Review laboratory findings (eg, arterial blood gas and electrolyte levels).
- Elevate the head of the patient's bed to ease breathing.
- Minimize patient's physical activity to reduce oxygen requirements; administer supplemental oxygen as prescribed.
- Provide frequent oral hygiene.
- Reposition and encourage the patient to cough and take deep breaths every 2 hours.
- As needed, maintain patent IV access, reorient the patient, and provide supportive measures and appropriate patient instruction.

\section*{Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC, also called consumption coagulopathy)}

Complex disorder of coagulation or fibrinolysis (destruction of clots), which results in thrombosis or bleeding. DIC is most commonly associated with hematologic cancers (leukemia); cancer of prostate, GI tract, and lungs; chemotherapy (methotrexate, prednisone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, and 6-mercaptopurine), and disease processes, such as sepsis, hepatic failure, and anaphylaxis.
Blood clots form when normal coagulation mechanisms are triggered. Once activated, the clotting cascade continues to consume clotting factors and platelets faster than the body can re-

\section*{Clinical}

Chronic DIC: Few or no observable symptoms or easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from venipuncture and injection sites, bleeding of the gums, and slow GI bleeding Acute DIC: life-threatening hemorrhage and infarction; clinical symptoms of this syndrome are varied and depend on the organ system involved in thrombus and infarction or bleeding episodes

\section*{Diagnostic}
- Prolonged prothrombin time (PT or protime)
- Prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
- Prolonged thrombin time (TT)
- Decreased fibrinogen level
- Decreased platelet level
- Decrease in clotting factors

\section*{Medical}
- Chemotherapy, biologic response modifier therapy, radiation therapy, or surgery is used to treat the underlying cancer.
- Antibiotic therapy is used for sepsis.
- Anticoagulants, such as heparin or antithrombin III, decrease the stimulation of the coagulation pathways.
- Transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma or cryoprecipitates (which contain clotting factors and fibrinogen), packed red blood cells, and platelets may be used as replacement therapy to prevent or control bleeding.
- Although controversial, antifibrinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid (Amicar), which is associated with increased thrombus formation, may be used.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS \\ AND DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS}

EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT
place them. Clots are deposited in the microvasculature, placing the patient at great risk for impaired circulation, tissue hypoxia, and necrosis. In addition, fibrinolysis occurs, breaking down clots and increasing the circulating levels of anticoagulant substances, thereby placing the patient at risk for hemorrhage.

\section*{Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH)}

The continuous, uncontrolled release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), produced by tumor cells or by the abnormal stimulation of the hypothalmic-pituitary network, leads to increased extracellular fluid volume, water intoxication, hyponatremia, and increased excretion of urinary sodium. As fluid volume increases, stretch receptors in the right atrium respond by releasing a second hormone, atrial naturetic factor (ANF). The release of ANF causes increased renal excretion of sodium, which worsens hyponatremia.
The most common cause of SIADH is cancer, especially small cell cancers of the lung. Antineoplasticsvincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide-and morphine also stimulate ADH secretion, which promotes conservation and reabsorption of water by the kidneys. As more fluid is absorbed, the circulatory volume increases, ANF is released, and sodium is actively excreted by the kidneys in compensation.

\section*{Tumor Lysis Syndrome}

Potentially fatal complication associated with radiation- or chemotherapyinduced cell destruction of large or rapidly growing cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and small cell lung cancer. The release of intracellular contents from the tumor cells, leads to electrolyte imbalances-hyperkalemia,
- Decreased hemoglobin
- Decreased hematocrit
- Elevated fibrin split products
- Positive protamine sulfate precipitation test (thrombin activation test)

\section*{Clinical}

Serum sodium levels below $120 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (SI: $120 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ): symptoms of hyponatremia including personality changes, irritability, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, weight gain, fatigue, muscular pain (myalgia), headache, lethargy, and confusion.
Serum sodium levels below $110 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (SI: $110 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ): seizure, abnormal reflexes, papilledema, coma, and death. Edema is rare.
Diagnostic
- Decreased serum sodium level
- Increased urine osmolality
- Increased urinary sodium level
- Decreased BUN, creatinine, and serum albumin levels secondary to dilution
- Abnormal water load test results

\section*{Clinical}

Clinical manifestations depend on the extent of metabolic abnormalities.
- Neurologic: Fatigue, weakness, memory loss, altered mental status, muscle cramps, tetany, paresthesias (numbness and tingling), seizures
- Cardiac: Elevated blood pressure, shortened QT complexes, widened QRS waves, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest

\section*{Nursing}
- Monitor vital signs.
- Measure and document intake and output.
- Assess skin color and temperature; lung, heart, and bowel sounds; level of consciousness, headache, visual disturbances, chest pain, decreased urine output, and abdominal tenderness.
- Inspect all body orifices, tube insertion sites, incisions, and bodily excretions for bleeding.
- Review laboratory test results.
- Minimize physical activity to decrease injury risks and oxygen requirements.
- Prevent bleeding; apply pressure to all venipuncture sites, and avoid nonessential invasive procedures; provide electric rather than straight-edged razors; avoid tape on the skin and advise gentle but adequate oral hygiene.
- Assist the patient to turn, cough, and take deep breaths every 2 hours.
- Reorient the patient, if needed; maintain a safe environment; and provide appropriate patient education and supportive measures.

\section*{Medical}

Fluid intake range limited to 500 to $1,000 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day to increase the serum sodium level and decrease fluid overload. If water restriction alone is not effective in correcting or controlling serum sodium levels, demeclocycline is often prescribed to interfere with the antidiuretic action of ADH and ANF. When neurologic symptoms are severe, parenteral sodium replacement and diuretic therapy are indicated. Electrolyte levels are monitored carefully to detect secondary magnesium, potassium, and calcium imbalances. After the symptoms of SIADH are controlled, the underlying cancer is treated. If water excess continues despite treatment, pharmacologic intervention (urea and furosemide) may be indicated.

\section*{Nursing}
- Maintain intake and output measurements.
- Assess level of consciousness, lung and heart sounds, vital signs, daily weight, and urine specific gravity; also assess for nausea, vomiting, anorexia, edema, fatigue, and lethargy.
- Monitor laboratory test results, including serum electrolyte levels, osmolality, and blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urinary sodium levels.
- Minimize the patient's activity; provide appropriate oral hygiene; maintain environmental safety; and restrict fluid intake if necessary.
- Reorient the patient and provide instruction and encouragement as needed.

\section*{Medical}
- To prevent renal failure and restore electrolyte balance, aggressive fluid hydration is initiated 48 hours before and after the initiation of cytotoxic therapy to increase urine volume and eliminate uric acid and electrolytes. Urine is alkalinized by adding sodium bicarbonate to IV fluid to maintain a urine pH of 7 or more; this prevents renal failure secondary to uric acid precipitation in the kidneys.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. You are seeing a married couple in their 70 s in the clinic for blood pressure checks. What questions regarding cancer screening are appropriate for them? How would you respond if your suggestions for cancer screening are met with the answer that they are too old to worry about cancer? What special considerations are there if the woman has a physical disability that requires her to use a wheelchair?
2. A 54-year-old woman with bone metastases secondary to breast cancer has been admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia. Describe the underlying cause of hypercalcemia and the medical and nursing management strategies that are anticipated. What patient monitoring would be essential before and after treatment of hypercalcemia?
3. One of your home care patients, a 42-year-old executive of a major corporation, has a nonresectable malignant brain tumor for which she is receiving radiation therapy. She is being discharged from the hospital and will continue therapy as an outpatient. She and her husband are concerned about her future and survival and are also concerned about
the impact of the diagnosis on the couple's 10-year-old twins. She is also concerned about her ability to carry out her executive responsibilities. What assessment by the nurse is indicated at this point, and what actions would be warranted by the nurse to help the patient and her husband deal with their concerns?

\section*{Nursing and End-of-Life Care}

One of the most difficult realities that nurses face is that, despite our very best efforts, some patients will die. Although we cannot change this fact, we can have a significant and lasting effect on the way in which patients live until they die, the manner in which the death occurs, and the enduring memories of that death for the families. Nursing has a long history of holistic, person- and familycentered care. Indeed, the definition of nursing offered by the American Nurses Association (ANA) highlights nursing's commitment to the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to illness (ANA, 1995). There is perhaps no setting or circumstance in which care-that is, attention to the human responses-is more important than in caring for the dying patient.

Knowledge about end-of-life decisions and principles of care is essential to supporting patients during decision making and in end-of-life closure in ways that recognize their unique responses to illness and that support their values and goals. Education, clinical practice, and research concerning end-of-life care are evolving, and the need to prepare nurses and other health care professionals to care for the dying has emerged as a priority. The National Institute for Nursing Research has taken the lead in coordinating research related to end-of-life care within the National Institutes of Health (Grady, 1999). At no time in nursing's history has there been a greater opportunity to bring research, education, and practice together to change the culture of dying, bringing much-needed improvement to care that is relevant across practice settings, age groups, cultural backgrounds, and illnesses.

\section*{THE CONTEXT FOR DEATH AND DYING IN AMERICA}

In the past three decades there has been a surge of interest in the care of the dying, with an emphasis on the settings in which death occurs, the technologies used to sustain life, and the challenges of trying to improve end-of-life care. The focus on care of the dying has been motivated by the aging of the population, the prevalence of and publicity surrounding life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and AIDS, and the efforts of health care providers to build a continuum of service that spans the lifetime from birth until death (Lesparre \& Matherlee, 1998). Although there are more
opportunities than ever before to allow a peaceful death, the knowledge and technologies available to health care providers have made the process of dying anything but peaceful. According to Callahan (1993a), Americans view death as what happens when medicine fails, an attitude that often places the study of death and improvement of the dying process outside of the focus of modern medicine and health care. Numerous initiatives aimed at improving end-of-life care have been launched in recent years, spurred by a widespread call for substantive change in the way Americans deal with death.

The Palliative Care Task Force of the Last Acts Campaign (Last Acts, 1997) identified the following as precepts or principles underlying a more comprehensive and humane approach to care of the dying:
- Respecting patients' goals, preferences, and choices
- Attending to the medical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of the dying person
- Using strengths of interdisciplinary resources
- Acknowledging and addressing caregiver concerns
- Building mechanisms and systems of support

\section*{TECHNOLOGY AND END-OF-LIFE CARE}

In the last century, chronic, degenerative diseases replaced communicable diseases as the major causes of death. Although technological advances in health care have extended and improved the quality of life for many, the ability of technologies to prolong life beyond the point that some would consider meaningful has raised troubling ethical issues. In particular, the use of technology to sustain life has raised perplexing issues with regard to quality of life, prolongation of dying, adequacy of pain relief and symptom management, and allocation of scarce resources. The major ethical question that has emerged concerning the use of technology to extend life is: Because we can prolong life through a particular intervention, does it necessarily follow that we must do so? In the latter half of the 20th century a "technological imperative" practice pattern among health care professionals emerged, along with an expectation among patients and families that every available means to extend life must be tried.

Decisions to apply every available technology to extend life have contributed to the shift in the place of death from the home to the hospital or extended care facility. In the earlier part of the last
assisted suicide: use of pharmacological agents to hasten the death of a terminally ill patient; illegal in most states
autonomy: self-determination; in the health care context, the right of the individual to make choices about the use and discontinuation of medical treatment
bereavement: period during which mourning for a loss takes place
euthanasia: Greek for "good death;" has evolved to mean the intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit
grief: the personal feelings that accompany an anticipated or actual loss
hospice: a coordinated program of interdisciplinary care and services provided pri-
marily in the home to terminally ill patients and their families
interdisciplinary collaboration: members of diverse health care disciplines jointly plan, implement, and evaluate care
Medicare Hospice Benefit: a Medicare entitlement that provides for comprehensive, interdisciplinary palliative care and services for eligible beneficiaries who have a terminal illness and a life expectancy of less than 6 months
mourning: individual, family, group, and cultural expressions of grief and associated behaviors
palliative care: comprehensive care for patients whose disease is not responsive to cure; care also extends to patients' families
palliative sedation: use of pharmacological agents, at the request of the terminally ill patient, to induce sedation when symptoms have not responded to other management measures. The purpose is not to hasten the patient's death but to relieve intractable symptoms.
spirituality: personal belief systems that focus on a search for meaning and purpose in life, intangible elements that impart meaning and vitality to life, and a connectedness to a higher or transcendent dimension
terminal illness: progressive, irreversible illness that despite cure-focused medical treatment will result in the patient's death
century, most deaths occurred at home. Because of this, most families had direct experience "being with" death, providing care to family members at the end of life and mourning for the loss of loved ones. As the place of death shifted to the hospital, families became increasingly distanced from the death experience. By the early 1970s, when hospice care was just beginning in this country, technology had become the expected companion of the critically and terminally ill (Wentzel, 1981). The implications of technological intervention at the end of life continue to be profound, affecting a societal view of death that influences how clinicians care for the dying, how family and friends participate in care, how patients and families understand and choose among end-of-life care options, how families prepare for terminal illness and death, and how they heal following the death of a loved one.

\section*{SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT}

Although each individual experiences terminal illness uniquely, such illness is also shaped substantially by the social and cultural contexts in which it occurs. In the United States, life-threatening illness, life-sustaining treatment decisions, dying, and death occur in a social environment where illness is largely considered a foe and where battles are either lost or won (Benoliel, 1993). A care/ cure dichotomy has emerged in which health care providers may view cure as the ultimate good and care as second best, a good only when cure is no longer possible (Benoliel, 1993; Gadow, 1988). In such a model of health or medical care, alleviating suffering is not as valued as curing disease, and patients who cannot be cured feel distanced from the health care team, concluding that when treatment has failed, they too have failed. Patients and families who have internalized the socially constructed meaning of care as second best may fear that any shift from curative goals in the direction of comfort-focused care will result in no care or poorer-quality care, and that the clinicians on whom they have come to rely will abandon them if they withdraw from the battle for cure.

The reduction of patients to their diseases is exemplified in the frequently relayed message in late-stage illness that "nothing more can be done." This all-too-frequently used statement communicates the belief of many clinicians that there is nothing of value to offer patients who are beyond cure. In a care-focused perspective, mind, body, and spirit are inextricable, and treating the body without attending to the other components is considered inadequate to evoke true healing (Upledger, 1989; Wendler, 1996). This expanded notion of healing as care, along with and beyond cure, implies that healing can take place throughout life and outside the boundaries of contemporary medicine. In this expanded definition, healing is transcendent and its boundaries are unlimited, even as body systems begin to fail at the end of life (Byock, 1997).

\section*{Clinicians' Attitudes Toward Death}

Clinicians' attitudes toward the terminally ill and dying remain the greatest barrier to improving care at the end of life. KüblerRoss illuminated the concerns of the seriously ill and dying in her seminal work On Death and Dying, published in 1969. At that time, it was common for patients to be kept uninformed about life-threatening diagnoses, particularly cancer, and for physicians and nurses to avoid open discussion of death and dying with their patients (Krisman-Scott, 2000; Seale, 1991). Kübler-Ross taught the health care community that having open discussion about life and death issues did not harm patients, and that the patients in
fact welcomed such openness. She was openly critical of what she called "a new but depersonalized science in the service of prolonging life rather than diminishing human suffering" (KüblerRoss, 1969, p. 20). She taught the health care community that healing could not take place in a conspiracy of silence, and that as clinicians break the silence and enter the patient's world, they too can be healed by their struggles and strengths. Her work revealed that, given adequate time and some help in working through the process, patients could reach a stage of acceptance where they were neither angry nor depressed about their fate (Kübler-Ross, 1969).

Clinicians' reluctance to discuss disease and death openly with patients stems from their own anxieties about death as well as misconceptions about what and how much patients want to know about their illnesses. In an early study of care of the dying in hospital settings, sociologists Glaser and Strauss (1965) discovered that health care professionals in hospital settings avoided direct communication about dying in hope that the patient would discover it on his or her own. They identified four "awareness contexts," described as the patient's, physician's, family's, and other health care professionals' awareness of the patient's status and their recognition of each other's awareness:
1. Closed awareness: The patient is unaware of his or her terminal state while others are aware. Closed awareness may be characterized by families and health care professionals conspiring to guard the "secret," fearing that the patient would not be able to cope with full disclosure about his or her status, and the patient's acceptance of others' accounts of his or her "future biography" as long as they give him or her no reason to be suspicious.
2. Suspected awareness: The patient suspects what others know and attempts to find out. Suspected awareness may be triggered by inconsistencies in families' and clinicians' communication and behavior, discrepancies between clinicians' accounts of the seriousness of the patient's illness, or a decline in the patient's condition or other environmental cues.
3. Mutual pretense awareness: The patient, the family, and the health care professionals are aware that the patient is dying but all pretend otherwise.
4. Open awareness: All are aware that the patient is dying and are able to openly acknowledge that reality.
Glaser and Strauss (1965) also identified a pattern of clinician behavior in which those who feared or were uncomfortable discussing death developed and substituted "personal mythologies" for appraisals of what level of disclosure patients actually wanted. For example, clinicians avoided direct communication with patients about the seriousness of their illness based on their beliefs that (1) patients already knew the truth or would ask if they wanted to know, or (2) patients would subsequently lose all hope, give up, or be psychologically harmed by disclosure.

Glaser and Strauss' findings were published more than 35 years ago, yet their observations remain valid today. Although a growing number of health care providers are becoming comfortable with assessing patients' and families' information needs and disclosing honest information about the seriousness of illness, many still avoid the topic of death in hopes that the patient will ask or find out on his or her own. Despite progress on many health care fronts, those who work with dying patients have identified the persistence of a "conspiracy of silence" about dying (Stanley, 2000, p. 34).

\section*{Patient and Family Denial}

Denial on the part of the patient and family about the seriousness of terminal illness also has been cited as a barrier to discussion about end-of-life treatment options. Kübler-Ross (1969) was one of the first to examine patient denial and expose it as a useful coping mechanism that enables patients to gain temporary emotional distance from something that is too painful to contemplate fully. Patients who are characterized as being in denial may be using that strategy to preserve important interpersonal relationships, to protect others from the emotional effects of their illness, or to protect themselves because of fears of abandonment.

Connor (1992) studied a small group of terminally ill cancer patients who were characterized by their use of denial as a coping mechanism. Participants in the experimental group were questioned in structured interviews about their perceptions of the most difficult aspects of having cancer and those actions that they or others take that make these difficulties easier or more difficult to bear. They were offered psychosocial intervention that consisted largely of therapeutic communication followed by a postintervention assessment of their use of denial as a defense mechanism. The use of denial by patients in a control group was also assessed, but these patients did not receive the psychosocial intervention. The researcher concluded that terminally ill patients using denial respond favorably to sensitive psychosocial intervention, as indicated by decreased scores on an instrument to measure denial. Connor acknowledged, however, that additional research is needed to gauge the timing of such interventions according to some measure of patient readiness.

In a more recent study, researchers reported that while the majority of a sample of 200 patients with advanced cancer in their final weeks of life were completely aware of their medical prognosis, a combined total of $26.5 \%$ were either unaware or only partially aware (Chochinov, Tataryn, Wilson, Ennis \& Lander, 2000). Depression was nearly three times greater in those patients who were unaware of their prognosis. The researchers concluded that denial of prognosis is more likely in patients with underlying psychological or emotional distress. Similarly, Chow and colleagues (2001) reported that many patients surveyed about their understanding of palliative radiation therapy for advanced cancer believed that their disease was curable, that the radiation therapy would cure their cancer, or that the therapy would prolong their lives. Importantly, most also reported that they were unfamiliar with the concept of radiation therapy, were not given information, or were not satisfied with the information their physicians had provided. Clearly, further research is needed to examine the complex interplay between patients' misconceptions about advanced illness, their underlying psychological states, and clinicians' persistent lack of candor in discussing treatment expectations and prognosis.

The question of how to communicate with patients in a way that acknowledges where they are on the continuum of acceptance, while providing them with unambiguous information, remains a challenge. Zerwekh (1994) analyzed stories from 32 hospice nurses and concluded that nurses in a hospice setting were adept at interventions deemed important in care of the dying, namely truth telling and encouraging patient autonomy. Although she acknowledged that each individual views "truth" differently, she observed that hospice nurses participating in the study used communication skills to assist the patient and family to discuss end-of-life issues. Hospice nurses deliberately spoke about sensitive matters that were usually avoided and gave patients and families truthful representations of their status when patients were in tran-
sition from curative to palliative care. Although timing of the questions takes experience, speaking the truth can be a relief to patients and families, enhancing their autonomy by making way for truly informed consent as the basis for decision making.

\section*{Assisted Suicide}

The assisted suicide debate has aimed a spotlight on the adequacy and quality of end-of-life care in the United States. Assisted suicide refers to providing another person the means to end his or her own life. Physician-assisted suicide involves the prescription by a physician of a lethal dose of medication for the purpose of ending someone's life (not to be confused with the ethically and legally supported practices of withholding or withdrawing medical treatment in accordance with the wishes of the terminally ill individual).

Judeo-Christian beliefs support the view that suicide is a violation of natural law and the law of God (Helm, 1984; Sorenson, 1991). However, there have recently been calls for the legalization of assisted suicide. Although the preference to take one's own life over awaiting death has been evident through the ages, these recent efforts to legalize assisted suicide underscore the need for changes in the ways individuals with terminal illnesses are cared for and treated at the end of their lives. This is further emphasized by the efforts of groups such as the Hemlock Society to have physician-assisted suicide legalized and the Hemlock Society's publication of information to the public describing methods for ending one's own life when such assistance from physicians is not available.

Although assisted suicide is expressly prohibited under statutory or common law in the majority of states, the calls for legalized assisted suicide have highlighted inadequacies in the care of the dying. In 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a retired pathologist, assisted a 54-year-old woman with early Alzheimer's disease to end her life using a device that he had devised to allow a patient to control the infusion of a lethal dose of potassium chloride. In 1999, after 130 deaths and nine trials, Kevorkian was convicted on second-degree murder charges in the death of a 52-year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and is currently serving a 10 - to 25-year prison sentence in Michigan. In a telephone poll conducted the week following the conviction, $55 \%$ of respondents disagreed with the verdict (Langer, 1999).

Meanwhile, public support for physician-assisted suicide has resulted in a number of state ballot initiatives. In 1994, voters approved the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, the first such legislative initiative to pass. This law provides for terminally ill patients' access to physician-assisted suicide under very controlled circumstances. After numerous challenges, a majority of Oregonians voted against an attempted repeal, and the law was implemented in 1997. The most recent challenges to the law included the 1999 federal Pain Relief Promotion Act, a bill designed to derail the implementation of the Oregon law by prohibiting the use of federally controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide, and a 2001 directive from Attorney General John Ashcroft to the Drug Enforcement Agency to track and prosecute physicians who prescribe under the Oregon law. There is an ongoing battle in the courts over this issue, and while Oregon is currently the only state with a statute legalizing physician-assisted suicide, it is likely that the issue will be pursued in the courts and through ballot measures in other states.

Whereas proponents of physician-assisted suicide argue that terminally ill individuals should have a legally sanctioned right to make independent decisions about the value of their lives and the
timing and circumstances of their deaths, its opponents argue for greater access to symptom management and psychosocial support for individuals approaching the end of life. Numerous ethical and legal issues have been raised, including voluntariness and authenticity of requests in relation to the mental competence and decision-making capacity of patients who request physicianassisted suicide, the existence of underlying untreated clinical depression or other suffering, and issues of overt or perceived coercion. Assisted suicide is opposed by nursing and medical organizations as a violation of the ethical traditions of nursing and medicine. The ANA Position Statement on Assisted Suicide acknowledges the complexity of the assisted suicide debate but clearly states that nursing participation in assisted suicide is a violation of the Code for Nurses. The ANA Position Statement further stresses the important role of the nurse in supporting effective symptom management, contributing to the creation of environments for care that honor the patient's and family's wishes, and ascertaining and addressing their concerns and fears (ANA, 1994).

\section*{Settings for End-of-Life Care: Palliative Care Programs and Hospice}

\section*{PALLIATIVE CARE}

As concerns have grown about the poor quality of life patients experience during progressive illness, broadening the concept of palliative care beyond the hospice has begun to take hold in health care settings across the country (Jones, 1997). Palliative care is an approach to care for the seriously ill that has long been a part of cancer care. Both palliative care and hospice have been recognized as important bridges between the compulsion for cure-oriented care and physician-assisted suicide (Saunders \& Kastenbaum, 1997). Advocates for improved care for the dying have stated that acceptance, management, and understanding of death should become fully integrated concepts in mainstream health care (Callahan, 1993a; Morrison, Siu, Leipzig et al., 2000). Increasingly, palliative care is being offered to patients with noncancer chronic illnesses, where comprehensive symptom management and psychosocial and spiritual support can enhance the patient's and family's quality of life.

While hospice care is considered by many to be the "gold standard" for palliative care, the term hospice is generally associated with palliative care that is delivered at home or in special facilities to patients who are approaching the end of life. Palliative care is conceptually broader than hospice care, defined as the active, total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to treatment (World Health Organization, 1990).

Palliative care emphasizes management of psychological, social, and spiritual problems in addition to control of pain and other physical symptoms. As the definition suggests, palliative care is not care that begins when cure-focused treatment ends. The goal of palliative care is to improve the patient's and family's quality of life, and many aspects of this type of comprehensive, comfort-focused approach to care are applicable earlier in the process of life-threatening disease in conjunction with curefocused treatment. However, definitions of palliative care, the services that are part of it, and the clinicians who provide it are evolving steadily.

Some would argue that palliative care is no different from comprehensive nursing, medical, social, and spiritual care and that patients should not have to be labeled as "dying" to receive
person-focused care and symptom management. In addition to a focus on the multiple dimensions of the illness experience for both patients and their families, palliative care emphasizes the interdisciplinary collaboration that is necessary to bring about the desired outcomes for patients and their families. Interdisciplinary collaboration is distinguished from multidisciplinary practice in that the former is based on communication and cooperation among the various disciplines; each member of the team contributes to a single care plan that addresses the needs of the patient and family.

\section*{Palliative Care at the End of Life}

As discussed above, palliative care is broadly conceptualized as comprehensive, person- and family-centered care when disease is not responsive to treatment. The broadening of the concept of palliative care actually followed the development of hospice services in the United States. Hospice care is in fact palliative care. The difference is that hospice care is associated with the end of life, and although it focuses on quality of life, hospice care by necessity usually includes realistic emotional, social, spiritual, and financial preparation for death. In the mid-1970s, when hospice care was introduced in the United States, it was more broadly conceived as care that addressed the whole person-physical, social, emotional, and spiritual - and was available to patients earlier in the process of life-threatening illness. After hospice care was recognized as a distinct program of services under Medicare in the early 1980s, organizations providing hospice care were able to receive Medicare reimbursement if they could demonstrate that the hospice program met the Medicare "conditions of participation," or regulations, for hospice providers.

While Medicare reimbursement resulted in new rules for hospices, it also defined when Medicare beneficiaries are able to use their Medicare Hospice Benefit. In most programs, the Medicare definitions for patient eligibility are used to guide all enrollment decisions. According to Medicare, the patient who wishes to use his or her Medicare Hospice Benefit must be certified by a physician as terminally ill, with a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the disease follows its natural course. Thus, hospice has come to be defined as care provided to terminally ill persons and their families in the last 6 months of the patient's life. Because of additional Medicare rules concerning completion of all cure-focused medical treatment before the Medicare Hospice Benefit may be accessed, many patients delay enrollment in hospice programs until very close to the end of life.

The reasons for late referral to hospice and the underuse of hospice services are complex. They may include values and attitudes of health care providers, the inadequate dissemination of existing knowledge about pain and symptom management, health care providers' difficulties in effectively communicating with terminally ill individuals, and insufficient attention to palliative care concepts in health care providers' education and training.

Hospices care for approximately $29 \%$ of patients who are eligible (National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, 2001). For the most part, the remainder of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and long-term care facilities. It is clear that better care for the dying is urgently needed in hospitals, long-term care facilities, home care agencies, and outpatient settings. At the same time, many chronic diseases do not have a predictable "end stage" that fits hospice eligibility criteria, meaning that many patients die after a long, slow, and often painful decline, without the benefit of the coordinated palliative care that is unique to hospice programs. The palliative approach to care could benefit many
more patients if it were available across settings for care and earlier in the disease process. In an attempt to make this valuable approach to care more widely available, palliative care programs are being developed in other settings for patients who are either not eligible for hospice or are "not ready" to enroll in a formal hospice program. As yet, there is no dedicated reimbursement to providers for palliative care services when they are delivered outside of the hospice setting, making the sustainability of such programs challenging.

\section*{Palliative Care in the Hospital Setting}

Since the advent of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) as the basis for prospective payment for hospital services in the 1980s, there has been a financial incentive for hospitals to transfer patients with terminal illnesses who were no longer in need of acute-level care to other settings, such as long-term care facilities and home, to receive care (Field \& Cassel, 1997). Despite the economic and human costs associated with death in the hospital setting, as many as $50 \%$ of all deaths occur in acute care settings (Hogan et al., 2000). The landmark Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT, 1995) documented troubling deficiencies in the care of the dying in hospital settings:
- Many patients received unwanted care at the end of life.
- Clinicians were not aware of patient preferences for lifesustaining treatment, even when preferences were documented in the clinical record.
- Pain was often poorly controlled at the end of life.
- Efforts to enhance communication were ineffective.

It is clear that many patients will continue to opt for hospital care or by default will find themselves in hospital settings at the end of life. Increasingly, hospitals are conducting system-wide assessments of end-of-life care practices and outcomes and are developing innovative models for delivering high-quality, personcentered care to patients approaching the end of life. Hospitals cite considerable financial barriers to providing high-quality palliative care in an acute care setting (Cassel, Ludden \& Moon, 2000). Public policy changes have been called for that would provide reimbursement to hospitals for care delivered via designated hospitalwide palliative care beds, clustered palliative care units, or palliative care consultation services in acute care settings.

\section*{Palliative Care in Long-Term Care Facilities}

The place of death for a growing number of Americans after the age of 65 is the long-term care facility (Alliance for Aging Research, 1997) As many as one third of all Medicare beneficiaries who die in any given year spend all or part of their last year of life in a long-term care facility (Hogan et al., 2000). The trend favoring care of dying patients in long-term care facilities will continue as the population ages and as managed care payors pressure health care providers to minimize costs (Field \& Cassel, 1997). Yet residents of long-term care facilities reportedly have poor access to high-quality palliative care. Regulations that govern how care in these facilities is organized and reimbursed tend to emphasize restorative measures and fail to reward palliative care (Zerzan, Stearns \& Hanson, 2000). Although home hospice programs have been permitted since 1986 to enroll long-term care facility residents in hospice programs and provide interdisciplinary services to residents who qualify for hospice care, the Office of the Inspector General, an oversight arm of the federal govern-
ment, has questioned whether such services are an unnecessary duplication of services already provided by facility staff (Office of the Inspector General, 1997). While there has been regulatory scrutiny on the one hand, long-term care facilities of all types are under increasing public pressure to improve care of the dying and are beginning to develop palliative care units or services, contract with home hospice programs to provide hospice care in the facilities, and educate staff, residents, and their families about pain and symptom management and end-of-life care.

\section*{HOSPICE CARE}

Hospice in the United States is not a place, but a concept of care in which the end of life is viewed as a developmental stage. The root of the word hospice is hospes, meaning "host." Historically, hospice has referred to a shelter or way station for weary travelers on a pilgrimage (Bennahum, 1996). In the years that followed Kübler-Ross's groundbreaking work, the concept of hospice care as an alternative to depersonalized death in institutions began as a grassroots movement. Her work, and the development of the concept of hospice in England by Dr. Cicely Saunders, resulted in recognition of gaps in the existing system of care for the terminally ill (Amenta, 1986). Hospice care began in response to "noticeable gaps . . . (1) between treating the disease and treating the person, (2) between technological research and psycho-social support, and (3) between the general denial of the fact of death in our society and the acceptance of death by those who face it" (Wentzel, 1981, p. 11). According to Saunders, who founded the world-renowned St. Christopher's Hospice in London (Bennahum, 1996), the principles underlying hospice are as follows:
- Death must be accepted.
- The patient's total care is best managed by an interdisciplinary team whose members communicate regularly with each other.
- Pain and other symptoms of terminal illness must be managed.
- The patient and family should be viewed as a single unit of care.
- Home care of the dying is necessary.
- Bereavement care must be provided to family members.
- Research and education should be ongoing.

\section*{Hospice Care in the United States}

Although the concept dates to ancient times, hospice as a way of caring for those at the end of life did not emerge in the United States until the 1960s (Hospice Association of America, 2001). The hospice movement in the United States is based on the belief that meaningful living is achievable during terminal illness, and that it is best supported in the home, free from technological interventions to prolong physiologic dying (Amenta, 1986). After the first U.S. hospice was founded in Connecticut in 1974, the concept quickly spread and the number of hospice programs in the United States has grown dramatically. In the years between 1984 and 1996, which followed the creation of the Medicare Hospice Benefit, there was a 70 -fold increase in the number of hospices participating in Medicare (Hospice Association of America, 2001).

Despite more than 25 years of existence in the United States, hospice remains an option for end-of-life care that has not been fully integrated into mainstream health care. Although hospice care is available to persons with any life-limiting condition, it has primarily been used by patients with advanced cancer, where the disease staging and trajectory lend themselves to more reliable
prediction about the end of life (Boling \& Lynn, 1998; Christakis \& Lamont, 2000). Many reasons have been proposed for the reluctance of physicians to refer patients to hospice and the reluctance of patients to accept this form of care. These include the difficulties in making a terminal prognosis, the strong association of hospice with death, advances in "curative" treatment options in late-stage illness, and financial pressures on health care providers that may cause them to retain rather than refer hospice-eligible patients. The result is that patients who could benefit from the comprehensive, interdisciplinary support offered by hospice programs frequently do not enter hospice care until their final days (or hours) of life (Christakis \& Lamont, 2000).

Hospice is a coordinated program of interdisciplinary services provided by professional caregivers and trained volunteers to patients with serious, progressive illnesses that are not responsive to cure. In hospice settings, the patient and family together are the unit of care. The goal of hospice care is to enable the patient to remain at home, surrounded by the people and objects that have been important to him or her throughout life. Hospice care does not seek to hasten death, nor does it encourage the prolongation of life through artificial means. Hospice care hinges on the competent patient's full or "open" awareness of dying; it embraces a realism about death, such that the patient and family are assisted to understand the dying process and can live each moment as fully as possible.

Although most hospice care is provided in the patient's own home, some hospice programs have developed inpatient facilities or residences where terminally ill patients without family support or those who desire inpatient care may receive hospice services.

Eligibility criteria for hospice vary depending on the hospice program, but generally patients must have a progressive, irreversible illness and limited life expectancy and have opted for palliative care rather than cure-focused treatment. Although hospices have historically served cancer patients, patients with any lifelimiting illness are eligible.

\section*{Medicare Hospice Benefit}

In 1983, the Medicare Hospice Benefit was implemented to cover hospice care for Medicare beneficiaries. State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) also provides coverage for hospice care, as do most commercial insurers. Federal reimbursement for hospice care ushered in a new era in hospice in which program standards developed and published by the federal government codified what had formerly been a grassroots, loosely organized and defined ideal for care at the end of life. To receive Medicare dollars for hospice services, programs are required to comply with conditions of participation promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Medicare standards have come to largely define hospice philosophy and services. Eligibility criteria for hospice coverage under the Medicare Hospice Benefit are specified in Chart 17-1. Federal rules for hospices require that the patient's continuing eligibility for hospice care is reviewed periodically. There is no limit to the length of time that an eligible patient may continue to receive hospice care. Patients who live longer than 6 months under hospice care are not discharged if their physician and the hospice medical director continue to certify that the patient is terminally ill with a life expectancy of 6 months or less, assuming that the disease continues its expected course. The hospice certification and review process and the open-ended benefit structure are intended to address the difficulty physicians face in predicting how long a patient will live, so that patients are not restricted to a lifetime limit on the number of hospice days they may receive.

\section*{Eligibility Criteria for Hospice Care}

\section*{General}
- Serious, progressive illness
- Limited life expectancy
- Informed choice of palliative care over cure-focused treatment

\section*{Hospice-Specific}
- Presence of a family member or other caregiver continuously in the home when the patient is no longer able to safely care for him/herself (some hospices have created special services within their programs for patients who live alone, but this varies widely)

\section*{Medicare and Medicaid Hospice Benefits}
- Medicare Part A; Medical Assistance eligibility
- Waiver of traditional Medicare/Medicaid benefits for the terminal illness
- Life expectancy of 6 months or less
- Physician certification of terminal illness
- Care must be provided by a Medicare-certified hospice program

To use hospice benefits under Medicare or Medicaid, the patient must meet eligibility criteria and "elect" to use the hospice benefit in place of traditional Medicare or Medicaid benefits for the terminal illness. Once the patient elects the benefit, the Medicare-certified hospice program assumes responsibility for providing and paying for the care and treatment related to the underlying illness for which hospice care was elected. The Medicarecertified hospice is paid a predetermined dollar amount for each day of hospice care each patient receives. Four levels of hospice care are covered under Medicare and Medicaid hospice benefits:
- Routine home care: All services provided are included in the daily rate to the hospice.
- Inpatient respite care: A 5-day inpatient stay, provided on an occasional basis to relieve the family caregivers
- Continuous care: Continuous nursing care provided in the home for management of a medical crisis. Care reverts to the routine home care level when the crisis is resolved. (For example, the patient develops seizure activity and a nurse is placed in the home continuously to monitor the patient and administer medications. After 72 hours the seizure activity is under control, the family has been instructed how to care for the patient, and the continuous nursing care is stopped.)
- General inpatient care: Inpatient stay for symptom management that cannot be provided in the home; not subject to the guidelines for a standard hospital inpatient stay.
Most hospice care is provided at the "routine home care" level and includes the services depicted in Chart 17-2. According to federal guidelines, hospices may provide no more than $20 \%$ of the aggregate annual patient days at the inpatient level. Patients may "revoke" their hospice benefits at any time, resuming traditional coverage under Medicare or Medicaid for the terminal illness. They may also re-elect their hospice benefits at a later time after reassessment for eligibility according to these criteria

\section*{Nursing Care of the Terminally III Patient}

Many patients suffer unnecessarily when they do not receive adequate attention for the symptoms accompanying serious illness. Careful evaluation of the patient should include not only the physical problems but also the psychosocial and spiritual dimen-

sions of the patient's and family's experience of serious illness. This approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how the patient's and family's life has been affected by the illness and will lead to nursing care that addresses the needs in every dimension.

\section*{PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES}

Nurses are responsible for educating patients about the possibilities and probabilities inherent in their illness and their life with the illness, and for supporting them as they conduct life review, values clarification, treatment decision making, and end-of-life closure. The only way to do this effectively is to try to appreciate and understand the illness from the patient's perspective.

Kübler-Ross's (1969) work revealed that patients in the final stages of life can and will talk openly about their experiences, exposing as a myth the view that patients will be harmed by honest discussion with their caregivers about death. Despite the continued reluctance of health care providers to engage in open discussion about end-of-life issues, studies have confirmed that patients want information about their illness and end-of-life choices are not harmed by open discussion about death (McSkimming, Super, Driever et al., 1997; Virmani, Schneiderman \& Kaplan, 1994).

At the same time, nurses need to be both culturally aware and sensitive in their approaches to communication with patients and families about death. Attitudes toward open disclosure about terminal illness vary widely among different cultures, and direct communication to the patient about such matters may be viewed as harmful (Blackhall, Murphy, Frank et al., 1995). To provide effective patient- and family-centered care at the end of life, nurses must be willing to set aside their assumptions so that they can discover what type and amount of disclosure is most meaningful to each patient and family within their unique belief systems.

The social and legal evolution of advance directive documents represents some progress in our willingness to both contemplate and communicate our wishes surrounding the end of life (Chart 17-3). Now legally sanctioned in every state and federally sanctioned through the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) of 1990, advance directives are written documents that allow the individual who is of sound mind to document his or her preferences regarding the use or nonuse of medical treatment at the end of life, specify the preferred setting for care, and communicate other valuable insights into his or her values and beliefs. The addition

17-3 Methods of Stating End-of-Life Preferences
Advance directives-Written documents that allow the individual of sound mind to document preferences regarding end-of-life care that should be followed when the signer is terminally ill and unable to verbally communicate his/her wishes. The documents are generally completed in advance of or during serious illness. The most common types are the living will (also known as a medical directive) and a proxy directive (also known as a durable power of attorney for health care).

Proxy directive-The appointment and authorization of another individual to make medical decisions on behalf of the person who created an advance directive when he/she is no longer able to speak for him/herself. This is also known as a health care power of attorney or durable power of attorney for health care.

Living will-Also known as a medical directive. A type of advance directive in which the individual of sound mind documents treatment preferences. Provides instructions for care in the event that the signer is terminally ill and not able to communicate wishes directly. Often accompanied by a proxy directive (also known as a health care power of attorney).

Durable power of attorney for health care-A legal document that enables the signer to designate another individual to make health care decisions on his/her behalf when he/she is unable to do so.
of a proxy directive (the appointment and authorization of another individual to make medical decisions on behalf of the person who created the advance directive when he or she can no longer speak for himself or herself) is an important addition to the "living will" or medical directive that specifies the signer's preferences. Although these documents are widely available from health care providers, community organizations, bookstores, and the Internet, their underuse reflects society's continued discomfort with openly confronting the subject of death. Further, the existence of a properly executed advance directive does not reduce the complexity of end-of-life decisions. The advance directive should not be considered an adequate substitute for ongoing communication between health care provider, patient, and family as the end of life approaches (Lynn, 1991).

\section*{COMMUNICATION}

As has been discussed, remarkable strides have been made in the ability to prolong life, but attention to care for the dying lags behind (Callahan, 1993b). On one level, this comes as no surprise. Each of us will eventually face death, and most would agree that one's own demise is a subject he or she would prefer not to contemplate. Indeed, Glaser and Strauss (1965) noted that unwillingness in our culture to talk about the process of dying is tied to our discomfort with the notion of particular deaths-those of our patients' and our own-rather than talking about death in the abstract, which is more comfortable. Finucane (1999) observed that our struggle to stay alive is a prerequisite to being human. Confronting death in our patients uncovers our own deeply rooted fears.

To develop a level of comfort and expertise in communicating with seriously and terminally ill patients and their families, nurses and other clinicians need to first consider their own experiences with and values concerning illness and death. Reflection, reading, and talking with family members, friends, and colleagues can assist the nurse to examine beliefs about death and dying. Talking with individuals from differing cultural backgrounds can
assist the nurse to view personally held beliefs through a different lens, and can help to sensitize the nurse to death-related beliefs and practices in other cultures. Discussion with nursing and nonnursing colleagues can also be useful to reveal the values shared by many health care professions and identify diversity in the values of patients in their care. Values clarification and personal death awareness exercises can provide a starting point for selfdiscovery and discussion.

\section*{Skills for Communicating With the Seriously III}

Nurses need to develop skill and comfort in assessing patients' and families' responses to serious illness and planning interventions that will support their values and choices throughout the continuum of care. Patients and families need ongoing assistance: telling a patient something once is not teaching, and hearing the patient's words is not the same as active listening. Throughout the course of a serious illness, patients and their families will encounter complicated treatment decisions, bad news about disease progression, and recurring emotional responses. In addition to the time of initial diagnosis, lack of response to the treatment course, decisions to continue or withdraw particular interventions, and decisions about hospice care are examples of critical points on the treatment continuum that demand patience, empathy, and honesty from the nurse. Discussing sensitive issues such as serious illness, hopes for survival, and fears associated with death is never easy. However, the art of therapeutic communication can be learned and, like other skills, must be practiced to gain expertise. Similar to other skills, communication should be practiced in a "safe" setting, such as a classroom or clinical skills laboratory with other students or clinicians.

Although communication with each patient and family should be tailored to their level of understanding and values concerning disclosure, general guidelines for the nurse include the following (Addington, 1991):
- Deliver and interpret the technical information necessary for making decisions without hiding behind medical terminology.
- Realize that the best time for the patient to talk may be when it is least convenient for you.
- Being fully present during any opportunity for communication is often the most helpful form of communication.
- Allow the patient and family to set the agenda regarding the depth of the conversation.

\section*{Nursing Interventions When the Patient and Family Receive Bad News}

Communicating about a life-threatening diagnosis or about disease progression is best accomplished by the interdisciplinary team in any setting-a physician, nurse, and social worker should be present whenever possible to provide information, facilitate discussion, and address concerns. Most importantly, the presence of the team conveys caring and respect for the patient and family. Creating the right setting is particularly important. If the patient wishes to have family present for the discussion, arrangements should be made to have the discussion at a time that is best for the patient and family. A quiet area with a minimum of disturbances should be used. Each clinician who is present should turn off beepers or other communication devices for the duration of the meeting and should allow sufficient time for the patient and family to
absorb and respond to the news. Finally, the space in which the meeting takes place should be conducive to seating all of the participants at eye level. It is difficult enough for patients and families to be the recipients of bad news without having an array of clinicians standing uncomfortably over them at the foot of the patient's bed.

After an initial discussion of a life-threatening illness or progression of a disease, patients and their families will have many questions and may need to be reminded of factual information. Coping with news about a serious diagnosis or poor prognosis is an ongoing process. The nurse needs to be sensitive to these ongoing needs and may need to repeat previously provided information or simply be present while the patient and family react emotionally. The most important intervention the nurse can provide is listening empathetically. Seriously ill patients and their families need time and support to cope with the changes brought about by serious illness and the prospect of impending death. The nurse who is able to sit comfortably with another's suffering, time and time again, without judgment and without the need to solve the patient's and family's problems provides an intervention that is a gift beyond measure. Keys to effective listening include the following:
- Resist the impulse to fill the "empty space" in communication with talk.
- Allow the patient and family sufficient time to reflect and respond after asking a question.
- Prompt gently: "Do you need more time to think about this?"
- Avoid distractions (noise, interruptions).
- Avoid the impulse to give advice.
- Avoid canned responses: "I know just how you feel."
- Ask questions.
- Assess understanding-your own and the patient's-by restating, summarizing, and reviewing.

\section*{Responding With Sensitivity To Difficult Questions}

Patients will often direct questions or concerns to nurses before they have been able to fully discuss the details of their diagnosis and prognosis with the physician or the entire health care team. Using open-ended questions allows the nurse to elicit the patient's and family's concerns, explore misconceptions and needs for information, and form the basis for collaboration with the physician and other team members. For example, the seriously ill patient may ask the nurse, "Am I dying?" The nurse should avoid making unhelpful responses that dismiss the patient's real concerns or defer the issue to another care provider. Nursing assessment and intervention are always possible, even when a need for further discussion with the physician is clearly indicated. Whenever possible, discussions in response to the patient's concerns should occur when the patient expresses a need, although it may be the least convenient time for the nurse (Addington, 1991). Creating an uninterrupted space of just 5 minutes can do much to identify the source of the concern, allay anxieties, and plan for follow-up. For example, in response to the question, "Am I dying?" the nurse could establish eye contact and follow with a statement acknowledging the patient's fears ("This must be very difficult for you") and an open-ended statement or question ("Tell me more about what is on your mind."). The nurse then needs to listen intently, ask additional questions for clarification, and provide reassurance only when it is realistic. In this example,
the nurse might quickly ascertain that the patient's question emanates from a need for specific information-about diagnosis and prognosis from the physician, about the physiology of the dying process from the nurse, or perhaps about financial implications for the family from the social worker. The chaplain may also be called upon to talk with the patient about existential concerns.

Tilden, V. P., Tolle, S. W., Nelson, C. A., \& Fields, J. (2001). Family decision-making to withdraw life-sustaining treatments from hospitalized patients. Nursing Research, 50(2), 105-115.

\section*{Purpose}

Although participation of family members in end-of-life decision making is increasing, little is known about the stress associated with their participation. Further, it is not known how families' reasoning processes compare to those of clinicians. The purpose of this study was to assess factors that affect family stress associated with withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from their dying, hospitalized relatives. Investigators also compared family members and clinicians on their reasoning about the decision.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A descriptive quantitative study was conducted in four large tertiarycare centers. Family members who had participated in the decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from patients who had been unable to make their own decisions were invited to participate.

Seventy-four family members of 51 patients participated in the study and were interviewed for data collection 1 to 2 months after the death of the patient; 65 family members were interviewed again 7 to 8 months later. Clinician data about the families' decision making were obtained from physicians ( $\mathrm{n}=21$ ) and nurses ( $\mathrm{n}=24$ ) 2 months after patients' deaths.

The Horowitz Impact of Events Scale and the mental/emotional state scale of the Rand 36-item Health Survey 1.0 was used to measure family stress. The researchers measured the importance of each of three factors (quality of life, patient preference, and prolongation of life) to family and clinician reasoning about treatment decisions by single-item indicators scaled on a 0 to $100-\mathrm{mm}$ visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS scores indicated the likelihood that the respective factors would be considered in reaching a decision.

\section*{Findings}

High levels of family stress were found 1 month and 7 to 8 months after the death, although stress levels at 7 to 8 months were lower. Patient/family characteristics that were associated with increased stress included the absence of advance directives (ADs), being an ethnic minority, and having a longer commuting distance to the hospital during the decedent's hospitalization. Families were more likely than clinicians to prioritize life prolongation over quality of life, particularly in the absence of an AD. Family members described their participation in decision making about withdrawing life support as one of the most difficult things they had ever had to do.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

It is important for health care providers to recognize the impact of participation in end-of-life decision making on family members and to support them at this time. The study underscores the importance of assisting families to identify patients' preferences for end-of-life care and the importance of ADs in easing the process for family members. Further research is needed to compare the effect of having a written AD to guide family members versus patients' informal conversations about treatment preferences on family stress levels.

As a member of the interdisciplinary team caring for the patient at the end of life, the nurse fills an important role in facilitating the team's understanding of the patient's values and preferences, the family dynamics concerning decision making, and the patient's and family's response to treatment and changing health status. Many dilemmas in patient care at the end of life are related to poor communication between team members and the patient and family and failure of team members to communicate effectively with each other. Regardless of the care setting, the nurse can ensure a proactive approach to the psychosocial care of the patient and family. Periodic, structured assessments provide an opportunity for all parties to consider their priorities and plan for an uncertain future. The nurse can assist the patient and family to clarify their values and preferences concerning end-oflife care by using a structured approach. Sufficient time must be devoted to each step, so that the patient and family have time to process new information, formulate questions, and consider their options. The nurse may need to plan several meetings to accomplish the four steps described in Table 17-1.

\section*{PROVIDING CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE}

Although death, grief, and mourning are universally accepted aspects of living, values, expectations, and practices during serious illness, as death approaches, and following death are culturally bound and expressed. Health care providers may share very similar values concerning end-of-life care and may find that they are inadequately prepared to assess for and implement care plans that support culturally diverse perspectives. Historical mistrust of the health care system and unequal access to even basic medical care may underlie the beliefs and attitudes among ethnically diverse populations (Crawley, Payne, Bolden et al., 2000; Phipps, True \& Pomerantz, 2000). In addition, lack of education or knowledge concerning end-of-life care treatment options and language barriers influence decisions among many socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.

Much of the formal structure concerning health care decisions in the United States is rooted in the Western notions of autonomy, truth telling, and the acceptability of withdrawing or withholding life-prolonging medical treatment at the end of life. Yet in many cultures, interdependence is valued over autonomy, leading to decision and communication styles that favor relinquishment of decision making to family members or to a perceived authority figure, such as the physician (Blackhall et al., 1995; Ersek, Kagawa-Singer, Barnes et al., 1998). In addition, there is variation in preference regarding the use of life-prolonging medical treatments such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and artificially provided nutrition and hydration at the end of life; some groups are less likely to agree with withholding or withdrawing such life support in terminal illness (Caralis, Davis, Wright et al., 1993).

The nurse's role is to assess the values, preferences, and practices of every patient, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or background. The nurse can share knowledge about the patient's and family's cultural beliefs and practices with the health care team and facilitate the adaptation of the care plan to accommodate these practices. For example, the nurse may find that a patient prefers to have his eldest son make all of his care decisions. Institutional practices and laws governing informed consent are also rooted in the Western notion of autonomous decision making

and informed consent. If a patient who wishes to defer decisions to his son, the nurse can work with the team to negotiate informed consent, respecting the patient's right not to participate in decision making and honoring his family's cultural practices (Ersek et al., 1998).

The nurse should assess and document the patient's and family's specific beliefs, preferences, and practices regarding end-oflife care, preparation for death, and after-death rituals. Chart 17-4 identifies topics that the nurse should cover and questions that the nurse may use to elicit the information. The nurse must use judgment and discretion about the timing and setting for eliciting this information. Some patients may wish to have a family member speak for them or because of advanced illness may be unable to provide information. The nurse should give the patient and family a context for the discussion, such as "It is very important to us to provide care that addresses your needs and the needs
of your family. We want to honor and support your wishes, and want you to feel free to tell us how we are doing, and what we could do to better meet your needs. I'd like to ask you some questions; what you tell me will help me to understand and support what is most important to you at this time. You don't need to answer anything that makes you uncomfortable. Is it all right to ask some questions?" The assessment of end-of-life beliefs, preferences, and practices will probably need to be carried out in short segments over a period of time (for example, across multiple days of an inpatient hospital stay or in conjunction with multiple patient visits to an outpatient setting). The novice nurse's discomfort with asking questions and discussing this type of sensitive content can be reduced by prior practice in a classroom or clinical skills laboratory, observation of interviews conducted by experienced nurses, and partnering with an experienced nurse during the first few assessments.

\section*{GOAL SETTING IN PALLIATIVE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE}

As the treatment goals begin to shift in the direction of comfort care over aggressive disease-focused treatment, symptom relief and patient/family-defined quality of life assume greater prominence in treatment decision making. Patient, family, and clinicians may all be accustomed to an almost automatic tendency to pursue exhaustive diagnostic testing to locate and treat the source of the patient's illness or symptoms. Each decision to withdraw treatment or discontinue diagnostic testing will be an extremely emotional one for the patient and family. They may fear that the support from health care providers on which they have come to rely will be withdrawn along with the treatment.

Throughout the course of the illness, and especially as the patient's functional status and symptoms indicate approaching death, clinicians need to assist the patient and family to weigh the benefits of continued diagnostic testing and disease-focused medical treatment against the burdens of those activities. Patients and their families may be extremely reluctant to forego monitoring that has become routine throughout the illness (such as blood testing, x-rays) but that may contribute little to a primary focus on comfort. Likewise, health care providers from other disciplines may have difficulty discontinuing such diagnostic testing or medical treatment. The nurse should collaborate with other members of the interdisciplinary team to share assessment findings and develop a coordinated plan of care (Fig. 17-1). In addition, the nurse may assist the patient and family to clarify their goals, expected outcomes, and values as they consider treatment options
(Chart 17-5). The nurse needs to work with interdisciplinary colleagues to ensure that the patient and family are referred for continuing psychosocial support, symptom management, and assistance with other care-related challenges (eg, arranging for home care or hospice support, referrals for financial assistance).

\section*{SPIRITUAL CARE}

Attention to the spiritual component of the patient's and family's illness experience is not new within the context of nursing care, yet many nurses lack the comfort or skills to assess and intervene in this dimension. Spirituality contains features of religiosity, but the two concepts are not interchangeable (Highfield, 2000). Spirituality involves the "search for meaning and purpose in life and relatedness to a transcendent dimension" (Hermann, 2001, p. 67). For most people, contemplating their own deaths raises many issues, such as the meaning of existence, the purpose of suffering, and the existence of an afterlife. In a national survey on spiritual beliefs and the dying process conducted by Gallup for the Nathan Cummings Foundation and Fetzer Institute in 1996 and published in 1997, respondents' greatest worries about death included the following:
- The medical matter of greatest worry was the possibility of being vegetable-like for some period of time (73\%).
- The emotional matter of greatest worry was not having the chance to say goodbye to someone (73\%) or the possibility of having great physical pain before death ( $67 \%$ ).
- The practical matter of greatest worry was how family or loved ones will be cared for ( $65 \%$ ) or thinking that death

\end{figure}
will be a cause of inconvenience and stress for those who love them (64\%).
- The spiritual matter of greatest worry was not being forgiven by God (56\%) or dying when removed or cut off from God or a higher power (51\%).

The spiritual assessment is a key component of comprehensive nursing assessment for terminally ill patients and their families. Although the nursing assessment should include religious affiliation, spiritual assessment is conceptually much broader than religion and thus is relevant regardless of the patient's expression of religious
preference or affiliation. In addition to assessment of the role of religious faith and practices, important religious rituals, and connection to a religious community, the nurse should further explore:
- The harmony or discord between the patient's and family's beliefs
- Other sources of meaning, hope, and comfort
- The presence or absence of a sense of peace of mind and purpose in life
- Spiritually or religiously based beliefs about illness, medical treatment, care of the sick

\section*{Chart 17-5 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Nursing Assessment of the Patient and Family Perspective: Goal Setting in Palliative Care}
- Patient and family
- Awareness of diagnosis, illness stage, and prognosis
- "Tell me your understanding of your illness right now."
- Values
- "Tell me what is most important to you as you are thinking about the treatment options available to you/your loved one."
- Preferences
- "You've said that being comfortable and pain-free is most important to you right now. Where would you like to receive
care (home, hospital, long-term care facility, doctor's office), and how can I help?"
- Expected/desired outcomes
- "What are your hopes and expectations for this (diagnostic test [eg, CT scan] or treatment)?"
- Benefits and burdens
- "Is there a point at which you would say that the testing or treatment is outweighed by the burdens it is causing you (eg, getting from home to the hospital, pain, nausea, fatigue, interference with other important activities)?"

Maugans (1996) created the useful mnemonic "SPIRIT" to assist health care professionals to include spiritual assessment in their practice:
- Spiritual belief system
- Personal spirituality
- Integration and involvement with others in a spiritual community
- Ritualized practices and restrictions
- Implications for medical care
- Terminal events planning

\section*{HOPE}

Kübler-Ross maintained that hope persisted across every stage of terminal illness, noting that "even the most accepting, the most realistic patients left the possibility open for some cure, for the discovery of a new drug, or the 'last-minute success in a research project'" (1969, p. 139). Viktor Frankl (1984), a survivor of the Holocaust, described a human capacity for optimism that can be maintained in spite of the possibility or even certainty of pain and death. In terminal illness, hope represents patients' imagined future, forming the basis of a positive, accepting attitude and providing their lives with meaning, direction and optimism (Hickey, 1986). When hope is viewed this way, it is not limited to cure of the disease, and instead focuses on what is achievable in the time remaining. Many patients find hope in working on important relationships and creating legacies. The terminally ill patient can be extremely resilient, reconceptualizing hope repeatedly as he or she approaches the end of life.

The concept of hope has been delineated and studied by numerous nurse researchers, and its presence has been related to concepts such as spirituality, quality of life, and transcendence. Morse and Doberneck (1995) defined hope as a multidimensional construct that provides comfort to the individual as he or she endures life threats and personal challenges. These authors identified seven universal components of hope from their study of patients who had survived serious illness:
- Realistic initial assessment of the threat
- Envisioning alternatives and setting goals
- Bracing for negative outcomes
- Realistic assessment of resources
- Solicitation of mutually supportive relationships
- Continuous evaluation for signs reinforcing the goals
- Determination to endure

The nurse can support the patient and family by using effective listening and communication skills and encouraging realistic hope that is specific to the patient's and family's needs for information, expectations for the future, and values and preferences concerning the end of life. It is important for the nurse to engage in self-reflection and identify her or his own biases and fears concerning illness, life, and death. As nurses become more skilled in working with seriously ill patients, they can become less determined to "fix" and more willing to listen, more comfortable with silence, grief, anger, and sadness, and more fully present with patients and their families.

Nursing interventions for enabling and supporting hope include:
- Listening attentively
- Encouraging sharing of feelings
- Providing accurate information
- Encouraging and supporting patient control over his or her circumstances, choices, and environment whenever possible
- Assisting the patient to explore ways for finding meaning in his or her life
- Encouraging realistic goals
- Facilitating effective communication within the family
- Making referrals for psychosocial and spiritual counseling
- Assisting with the development of supports in the home or community when none exist

\section*{MANAGING PHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSES TO ILLNESS}

Patients approaching the end of life experience many of the same symptoms, regardless of their underlying disease processes. Symptoms in terminal illness may be caused by the disease, either directly (eg, dyspnea due to chronic obstructive lung disease) or indirectly (eg, nausea and vomiting related to pressure in the gastric area), by the treatment for the disease, or by a coexisting disorder that is unrelated to the disease. Chapter 13 presents assessment principles for pain that include identifying the effect of the pain on the patient's life, the importance of believing the patient's report of the pain and its effect, and the importance of systematic assessment of pain. Similarly, symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, weakness, and anxiety should be as carefully and systematically assessed and managed. Questions that guide the assessment of symptoms are listed in Chart 17-6.

The goals of symptom management at the end of life are to completely relieve the symptom when possible, or to decrease the symptom to a level that the patient can tolerate when it cannot be completely relieved. Medical interventions may be aimed at treating the underlying causes of the symptoms. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods for symptom management may be used in combination with medical interventions to modify the physiologic causes of symptoms. For example, some patients who develop pleural effusion secondary to metastatic cancer may experience temporary relief of the associated dyspnea following thoracentesis, an invasive medical procedure in which fluid is drained from the pleural space. In addition, pharmacologic management with low-dose oral morphine is very effective in relieving dyspnea, and guided relaxation may reduce the anxiety associated with the sensation of breathlessness. As with pain, the principles
of pharmacologic symptom management are the smallest dose of the medication to achieve the desired effect, avoidance of polypharmacy, anticipation and management of medication side effects, and creation of a therapeutic regimen that is acceptable to the patient based on his or her goals for maximizing quality of life.

As with pain management, patients may elect to tolerate higher symptom levels in exchange for greater independence, mobility, alertness, or other priorities. Anticipating and planning interventions for symptoms that have not yet occurred is a cornerstone of end-of-life care. Both patients and family members cope more effectively with new symptoms and exacerbations of existing symptoms when they know what to expect and how to manage it. Hospice programs typically provide "emergency kits" containing ready-to-administer doses of a variety of medications that are useful to treat symptoms in advanced illness. Family members can be instructed to administer a prescribed dose from the emergency kit, often avoiding prolonged suffering for the patient as well as rehospitalization for symptom management.

\section*{Pain}

Pain and suffering are among the most feared consequences of cancer (Roth \& Breitbart, 1996). Pain is a significant symptom for many cancer patients throughout their treatment and disease course; it results both from the disease and the modalities used to treat it. Numerous studies have indicated that patients with advanced illness, particularly cancer, experience considerable pain (Field \& Cassel, 1997; Jacox, Carr, \& Payne, 1994). While the means to relieve pain have existed for many years, the continued, pervasive undertreatment of pain has been well documented (American Pain Society, 1999; Jacox et al., 1994). It is estimated that as many of $70 \%$ of patients with advanced cancer experience severe pain (Jacox et al., 1994; World Health Organization, 1990). The impact of poorly managed pain on patients' psychological, emotional, social, and financial well-being has attracted considerable research interest, but practice has been slow to change (Spross, 1992).

Patients who have an established regimen of analgesics should continue to receive those medications as they approach the end of life. Inability to communicate pain should not be equated with the absence of pain. While most pain can be managed effectively using the oral route, as the end of life nears patients may be less able to swallow oral medications due to somnolence or nausea. Patients who have been receiving opioids should continue to receive equianalgesic doses via the rectal or sublingual routes. Concentrated morphine solution can be very effectively delivered by the sublingual route, as the small liquid volume is well tolerated even when the patient cannot swallow. As long as the patient continues to receive opioids, a regimen to combat constipation must be implemented. If the patient cannot swallow laxatives or stool softeners, rectal suppositories or enemas may be necessary.

The nurse should teach the family about continuation of comfort measures as the patient approaches the end of life, how to administer analgesics via alternate routes, and how to assess for pain when the patient cannot verbally report pain intensity. Because the analgesics administered orally or rectally are short-acting, typically scheduled as frequently as every 3 to 4 hours around the clock, there is always a strong possibility that the patient approaching the end of life will die in close proximity to the time of analgesic administration. If the patient is at home, family members administering analgesics need to be prepared for this possibility. They will need reassurance that they did not "cause" the death of the patient by administering a dose of analgesic medication (see Chart 13-3).

\section*{Dyspnea}

Dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of breathing that is common in patients approaching the end of life (Brant, 1998). Dyspnea is a highly subjective symptom that often is not associated with visible signs of distress, such as tachypnea, diaphoresis, or cyanosis. Patients with primary lung tumors, lung metastases, pleural effusion, and restrictive lung disease may experience significant dyspnea. Although the underlying cause of the dyspnea can be identified and treated in some cases, the burdens of additional diagnostic evaluation and treatment aimed at the physiological problem may outweigh the benefits. The treatment of dyspnea varies depending on the patient's general physical condition and imminence of death. For example, a blood transfusion may provide temporary symptom relief for the anemic patient earlier in the disease process; however, as the patient approaches the end of life the benefits are typically short-lived or absent.

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION}

As is true in pain assessment and management, the patient's report of dyspnea must be believed. Also like the experience of physical pain, the meaning of the dyspnea to the patient may increase his or her suffering. For example, the patient may interpret increasing dyspnea as a sign that death is approaching. For some patients, sensations of breathlessness may invoke frightening images of drowning or suffocation, and the resulting cycle of fear and anxiety may create even greater sensations of breathlessness. Therefore, the nurse should conduct a careful assessment of the psychosocial and spiritual components of the symptom (see Chart 17-5). Physical assessment parameters include:
- Symptom intensity, distress, and interference with activities (scale of 0 to 10)
- Auscultation of lung sounds
- Assessment of fluid balance
- Measurement of dependent edema (circumference of lower extremities)
- Measurement of abdominal girth
- Temperature
- Skin color
- Sputum quantity and character
- Cough

To determine the intensity of the symptom and its interference with daily activities, patients can be asked to self-report using a scale of 0 to 10 , where 0 is no dyspnea and 10 is the worst imaginable dyspnea. Measurement of the patient's baseline before treatment and subsequent measures during exacerbation of the symptom, periodically during treatment, and whenever the treatment plan changes will provide ongoing objective evidence for the efficacy of the treatment plan. In addition, physical assessment findings may assist in locating the source of the dyspnea and selecting nursing interventions to relieve the symptom. The components of the assessment will change as the patient's condition changes. For example, when the patient who has been on daily weights can no longer get out of bed, the goal of comfort may outweigh the benefit of continued weights. Like other symptoms at the end of life, dyspnea can be managed effectively in the absence of assessment and diagnostic data (ie, arterial blood gases) that are standard when the patient's illness or symptom is reversible.

Nursing management of dyspnea at the end of life is directed toward administering medical treatment for the underlying pathology, monitoring the patient's response to treatment, assisting the patient and family to manage anxiety (which exacerbates dyspnea),
altering the perception of the symptom, and conserving energy (Chart 17-7). Pharmacologic intervention is aimed at modifying lung physiology and improving performance as well as altering the perception of the symptom. Bronchodilators and corticosteroids are examples of medications used to treat underlying obstructive pathology, thereby improving overall lung function. Low doses of opioids are very effective in relieving dyspnea, although the mechanism of relief is not entirely clear. Although dyspnea in terminal illness is typically not associated with diminished blood oxygen saturation, low-flow oxygen often provides psychological comfort to the patient and the family, particularly in the home setting.

As discussed above, dyspnea may be exacerbated by anxiety, and anxiety may trigger episodes of dyspnea, setting off a respiratory crisis in which patient and family may panic. For patients receiving care at home, patient and family instruction should include anticipation and management of crisis situations and a clearly communicated emergency plan. Patients and families should be instructed about medication administration, condition changes that should be reported to the physician and nurse, and strategies for coping with diminished reserves and increasing symptomatology as the disease progresses. The patient and family need reassurance that the symptom can be effectively managed at home without the need for activation of the emergency medical services or hospitalization and that a nurse will be available at all times via telephone or to conduct a visit.

\section*{Palliative Nursing Interventions for Dyspnea}

\section*{Decrease Anxiety}
- Administer prescribed anxiolytic medications as indicated for anxiety or panic associated with dyspnea.
- Assist with relaxation techniques, guided imagery.
- Provide patient with a means to call for assistance (call bell/light within reach in a hospital or long-term care facility; hand-held bell or other device for home).

\section*{Treat Underlying Pathology}
- Administer prescribed bronchodilators and corticosteroids (obstructive pathology).
- Administer blood products, erythropoietin as prescribed (typically not beneficial in advanced disease).
- Administer prescribed diuretics and monitor fluid balance.

\section*{Alter Perception of Breathlessness}
- Administer prescribed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, if tolerated; masks may not be well tolerated.
- Administer prescribed low-dose opioids via oral route (morphine sulfate is used most commonly).
- Provide air movement in the patient's environment with a portable fan.

\section*{Reduce Respiratory Demand}
- Teach patient and family to implement energy conservation measures.
- Place needed equipment, supplies, and nourishment within reach.
- For home or hospice care, offer bedside commode, electric bed (with head that elevates).
concomitant lack of interest in the socially important rituals of mealtime are particularly disturbing to families. The approach to the problem varies depending on the patient's stage of illness, level of disability associated with the illness, and desires. The anorexia-cachexia syndrome is characterized by disturbances in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism, endocrine dysfunction, and anemia. The syndrome results in severe asthenia (loss of energy). Although causes of anorexia may be controlled for a period of time, progressive anorexia is an expected and natural part of the dying process. Anorexia may be related to or exacerbated by situational variables (eg, the ability to have meals with the family versus eating alone in the "sick room"), progression of the disease, treatment for the disease, or psychological distress. The patient and family should be instructed in strategies to manage the variables associated with anorexia. Table 17-2 summarizes nursing measures and patient and family teaching for managing anorexia.

\section*{USE OF PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS TO STIMULATE APPETITE IN THE TERMINALLY ILL}

A number of pharmacologic agents are commonly used to stimulate appetite in anorectic patients. Commonly used medications for appetite stimulation include dexamethasone (Decadron), cyproheptadine (Periactin), megestrol acetate (Megace), and dronabinol (Marinol). Dexamethasone initially increases appetite and may provide short-term weight gain in some patients. However, therapy may need to be discontinued in the patient with a longer life expectancy, as after 3 to 4 weeks corticosteroids interfere with the synthesis of muscle protein. Cyproheptadine may be used when corticosteroids are contraindicated, such as when the patient is diabetic. It promotes mild appetite increase but no appreciable weight gain. Megestrol acetate produces temporary weight gain of primarily fatty tissue, with little effect on protein balance. Because of the time required to see any effect from this agent, therapy should not be initiated if life expectancy is less than 30 days. Finally, dronabinol is a psychoactive compound found in cannabis that may be helpful in reducing nausea and vomiting, appetite loss, pain, and anxiety, thereby improving intake in some patients. However, dronabinol is not as effective as the other agents for appetite stimulation in most patients. Although the use of these agents may cause temporary weight gain, their use is not associated with an increase in lean body mass in the terminally ill. Therapy should be tapered or discontinued after 4 to 8 weeks if there is no response (Wrede-Seaman, 1999).

\section*{CACHEXIA}

Cachexia refers to severe muscle wasting and weight loss associated with illness. Although anorexia may exacerbate cachexia, it is not the primary cause. Cachexia is associated with changes in metabolism that include hypertriglyceridemia, lipolysis, and accelerated protein turnover, leading to depletion of fat and protein stores (Plata-Salaman, 1997). However, the pathophysiology of cachexia in terminal illness is not well understood. In terminal illness, the severity of tissue wasting is greater than would be expected from reduced food intake alone, and typically increasing appetite or food intake does not reverse cachexia in the terminally ill.

Anorexia and cachexia differ from starvation (simple food deprivation) in several important ways. Appetite is lost early in the process, the body becomes catabolic in a dysfunctional way, and supplementation by gastric feeding (tube feeding) or parenteral nutrition in advanced disease does not replenish lost lean body mass. At one time it was believed that cancer patients with rapidly growing tumors developed cachexia because the

\section*{Table 17-2 - Measures for Managing Anorexia}

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

Initiate measures to ensure adequate dietary intake without adding stress to the patient at mealtimes.
Assess the impact of medications (eg, chemotherapy, antiretrovirals) or other therapies (radiation therapy, dialysis) that are being used to treat the underlying illness.
Administer and monitor effects of prescribed treatment for nausea, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying.
Encourage patient to eat when effects of medications have subsided.
Assess and modify environment to eliminate unpleasant odors and other factors that cause nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
Remove items that may reduce appetite (soiled tissues, bedpans, emesis basins, clutter).
Assess and manage anxiety and depression to the extent possible.

Position to enhance gastric emptying.

Assess for constipation and/or intestinal obstruction.
Prevent and manage constipation on an ongoing basis, even when the patient's intake is minimal.
Provide frequent mouth care, particularly following nourishment.
Ensure that dentures fit properly.
Administer and monitor effects of topical and systemic treatment for oropharyngeal pain.

\section*{PATIENT AND FAMILY TEACHING TIPS}

Reduce the focus on "balanced" meals; offer the same food as often as the patient desires it.
Increase the nutritional value of meals. For example, add dry milk powder to milk, and use this fortified milk to prepare cream soups, milkshakes, and gravies.

Allow and encourage the patient to eat when hungry, regardless of usual meal times.
Eliminate or reduce noxious cooking odors, pet odors, or other odors that may precipitate nausea, vomiting, or anorexia.
Keep patient's environment clean, uncluttered, and comfortable.
Make mealtime a shared experience away from the "sick" room whenever possible.
Reduce stress at mealtimes.
Avoid confrontations about the amount of food consumed.
Reduce or eliminate routine weighing of the patient.
Encourage patient to eat in a sitting position; elevate the head of the patient's bed.
Plan meals (food selection and portion size) that the patient desires. Provide small frequent meals if they are easier for patient to eat.
Ensure that patient and family understand that prevention of constipation is essential, even when the patient's intake is minimal.
Encourage adequate fluid intake, dietary fiber, and use of bowel program to prevent constipation.
Assist the patient to rinse after every meal. Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol or glycerine, which dry mucous membranes.
Weight loss may cause dentures to loosen and cause irritation. Remove them to inspect the gums and to provide oral care.
Patient's comfort may be enhanced if pain medications given on an as-needed basis for breakthrough pain are administered before mealtimes.
tumor created an excessive nutritional demand and diverted nutrients from the rest of the body. Recent research links cytokines produced by the body in response to a tumor to a complex inflammatory-immune response present in patients whose tumors have metastasized, leading to anorexia, weight loss, and altered metabolism. An increase in cytokines occurs not only in cancer but also in AIDS and many other chronic diseases (Plata-Salaman, 1997).

\section*{ARTIFICIAL NUTRITION AND HYDRATION IN TERMINAL ILLNESS}

Along with breathing, eating and drinking are essential to survival throughout one's lifetime. As patients near the end of life, their bodies' nutritional needs change, their desire for food and fluid may diminish, and they may no longer be able to use, eliminate, or store nutrients and fluids adequately. Eating, feeding, and sharing meals are important social activities in families and communities, and food preparation and enjoyment are linked to happy memories, strong emotions, and hopes for survival. For the patient with serious illness, food preparation and mealtimes often become battlegrounds where well-meaning family members argue, plead, and cajole to encourage the ill person to eat. It is not unusual for seriously ill patients to lose their appetites entirely, to develop
strong aversions for foods they have enjoyed in the past, or to crave a particular food to the exclusion of all other foods.

Although nutritional supplementation may be an important part of the treatment plan in early or chronic illness, unintended weight loss and dehydration are expected sequelae of progressive illness. As illness progresses, patients, families, and clinicians may believe that without artificial nutrition and hydration, the terminally ill patient will "starve," causing profound suffering and hastened death. However, starvation should not be viewed as the failure to implant tubes for nutritional supplementation or hydration of terminally ill patients with irreversible progression of disease. Studies have demonstrated that terminally ill patients who were hydrated had neither improved biochemical parameters nor improved states of consciousness (Waller, Hershkowitz \& Adunsky, 1994). Similarly, survival was not increased when terminally ill patients with advanced dementia received enteral feeding (Meier, Ahronheim, Morris et al., 2001). Further, in patients who are close to death there are beneficial effects to withholding or withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration, such as decreased urine output and incontinence, decreased gastric fluids and emesis, decreased pulmonary secretions and respiratory distress, and decreased edema and pressure discomfort (Zerwekh, 1987).

As the patient approaches the end of life, families and health care providers should offer the patient what he or she desires and can most easily tolerate. Nurses should instruct the family how to separate feeding from caring by demonstrating love, sharing, and caring by being with the loved one in other ways. Preoccupation with appetite, feeding, and weight loss diverts energy and time that the patient and family could use in other meaningful activities. The following are tips to promote nutrition for the terminally ill patient:
- Offer small portions of favorite foods.
- Do not be overly concerned about a "balanced" diet.
- Cool foods may be better tolerated than hot foods.
- Offer cheese, eggs, peanut butter, mild fish, chicken, or turkey. Meat (especially beef) may taste bitter and unpleasant.
- Add milkshakes, "Instant Breakfast" drinks, or other liquid supplements.
- Add dry milk powder to milkshakes and cream soups to increase protein and calorie content.
- Place nutritious foods at the bedside (fruit juices, milkshakes in insulated drink containers with straws).
- Schedule meals when family members can be present to provide company and stimulation.
- Avoid arguments at mealtime.
- Assist the patient to maintain a schedule of oral care. Rinse the mouth after each meal or snack. Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol. Use a soft toothbrush. Treat ulcers or lesions. Make sure dentures fit well.
- Treat pain and other symptoms.
- Offer ice chips made from frozen fruit juices.
- Allow the patient to refuse foods and fluids.

\section*{Delirium}

Many patients may remain alert, arousable, and able to communicate until very close to death. Others may sleep for long intervals and awaken only intermittently, with eventual somnolence until death. Delirium refers to concurrent disturbances in level of consciousness, psychomotor behavior, memory, thinking, attention, and sleep-wake cycle (Brant, 1998). In some patients, a period of agitated delirium may precede death, sometimes causing families to be hopeful that the suddenly active patient may be getting better. Confusion may be related to underlying, treatable conditions such as medication side effects or interactions, pain or discomfort, hypoxia or dyspnea, a full bladder or impacted stool. In patients with cancer, confusion may be secondary to brain metastases. Delirium may also be related to metabolic changes, infection, and organ failure.

The patient with delirium may become hypoactive or hyperactive, restless, irritable, and fearful. Sleep deprivation and hallucinations may occur. If treatment of the underlying factors contributing to these symptoms bring no relief, a combination of pharmacologic intervention with neuroleptics or benzodiazepines may be effective in decreasing distressing symptoms. Haloperidol (Haldol) may reduce hallucinations and agitation. Benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam [Ativan]) can reduce anxiety but will not clear the sensorium and may contribute to worsening cognitive impairment if used alone.

Nursing interventions are aimed at identifying the underlying causes of delirium, acknowledging the family's distress over its occurrence, reassuring them about what is normal, teaching the family how to interact with and ensure safety for the patient with delirium, and monitoring the effects of medications used to treat severe agitation, paranoia, or fear. Confusion may mask the pa-
tient's unmet spiritual needs and fears about dying. Spiritual intervention, music therapy, gentle massage, and therapeutic touch may provide some relief. Reducing environmental stimuli, avoiding harsh lighting or very dim lighting (which may produce disturbing shadows), the presence of familiar faces, and gentle reorientation and reassurance are also helpful.

\section*{Depression}

Clinical depression should not be accepted as an inevitable consequence of dying, nor should it be confused with sadness and anticipatory grieving, which are normal reactions to the losses associated with impending death. Emotional and spiritual support and control of disturbing physical symptoms are appropriate interventions for situational depression associated with terminal illness. The psychological sequelae of cancer pain have been linked to suicidal thought and less frequently to carrying out a planned suicide (Ripamonti, Filiberti, Totis et al., 1999). Cancer patients with advanced disease are especially vulnerable to delirium, depression, suicidal ideation, and severe anxiety (Roth \& Breitbart, 1996). Higher levels of debilitation predict higher levels of pain and depressive symptoms, and the presence of pain doubles the likelihood of developing major psychiatric complications of illness (Roth \& Breitbart, 1996). Patients and their families must be given space and time to experience sadness and to grieve, but patients should not have to endure untreated depression at the end of their lives. An effective combined approach to clinical depression includes relief of physical symptoms, attention to emotional and spiritual distress, and pharmacologic intervention with psychostimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (Block, 2000).

\section*{PALLIATIVE SEDATION AT THE END OF LIFE}

Effective control of symptoms can be achieved under most conditions, but some patients may experience distressing, intractable symptoms. Although its use remains controversial, palliative sedation is offered in some settings to patients who are close to death, who have symptoms that do not respond to conventional pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, and as a result are experiencing unrelieved suffering. Palliative sedation is distinguished from euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in that the intent of palliative sedation is to palliate the symptoms, not to hasten the patient's death. Palliative sedation is most commonly used when the patient exhibits intractable pain, dyspnea, seizures, or delirium. It is generally considered appropriate in only the most difficult cases. Before implementing palliative sedation, the care team should assess for the presence of underlying and treatable causes of suffering, such as depression or spiritual pain. Finally, patients and families should be fully informed about the use of this treatment and alternatives.

Palliative sedation is accomplished through infusion of a benzodiazepine or barbiturate in doses adequate to induce sleep and eliminate signs of discomfort (Quill \& Byock, 2000). The nurse acts as a collaborating member of the interdisciplinary team, providing emotional support to the patient and family, facilitating clarification of values and preferences, and providing comfortfocused physical care. Once sedation has been induced, the nurse will need to continue comfort care, monitor the physiologic effects of the sedation, support the family during the final hours or days of the patient's life, and ensure communication within the care team and between the team and family.

\section*{Nursing Care of the Patient Who Is Close to Death}

Providing care to the patient who is close to death and being present at the time of death can be one of the most rewarding experiences a nurse can have. Patients and their families are understandably fearful of the unknown, and the approach of death may prompt new concerns or cause previous fears or issues to resurface. It has often been said that as we age and as we approach death, we do not become different people, just more like ourselves. Families that have always had difficulty communicating or in which there are old resentments and hurts may experience heightened difficulty as their loved one nears death. In contrast, the time at the end of life can also afford the family the opportunity to resolve old hurts and learn new ways of being a family. Regardless of the setting, dying patients can be made comfortable, space can be made for their loved ones to remain present when they wish, and the opportunity to experience growth and healing can be facilitated by skilled practitioners. Likewise, regardless of setting, patients' and families' apprehension surrounding the time of death may be diminished if they know what to expect as death nears and how to respond.

\section*{EXPECTED PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES WHEN THE PATIENT IS CLOSE TO DEATH}

Observable, expected changes in the body take place as the patient approaches death and organ systems begin to fail. Nursing care measures aimed at patient comfort should be continued: pain medications (administered rectally or sublingually), turning, mouth care, eye care, positioning to facilitate draining of secretions, and measures to protect the skin from incontinence should be continued. The nurse should consult with the physician about discontinuing measures that no longer contribute to patient comfort such as drawing blood, administering tube feedings, suctioning (in most cases), and invasive monitoring. The nurse should prepare the family for the normal, expected changes that accompany the period immediately preceding death. Although the exact time of death cannot be predicted, it is often possible to identify when a patient is very close to death. Hospice programs frequently provide written information for families so they know what to expect and what to do as death nears (Chart 17-8).

If they have been prepared for the time of death, families are less likely to panic and will be better able to be with their loved one in a meaningful way. Noisy, gurgling breathing or moaning is generally most distressing to the family. In most cases, the sounds of breathing at the end of life are related to oropharyngeal relaxation and diminished awareness. Family members may have difficulty believing that the patient is not in pain or that his or her breathing could not be improved by suctioning secretions. Patient positioning and family reassurance are the most helpful responses to these symptoms.

\section*{Terminal "Bubbling"}

When death is imminent, the patient may become increasingly somnolent and unable to clear sputum or oral secretions, which may lead to further impairment of breathing from pooled and/or dried and crusted secretions. The sound and appearance of the secretions are often more distressing to the family than is the presence of the secretions to the patient. Family distress over the changes in patient condition may be eased by supportive nursing
care. Continuation of comfort-focused interventions and reassurance that the patient is not in any distress can do much to ease family concerns. Gentle mouth care with a moistened swab or very soft toothbrush will help to maintain the integrity of the patient's mucous membranes. In addition, gentle oral suctioning, positioning to enhance drainage of secretions, and sublingual or transdermal administration of anticholinergic drugs (Table 17-3) to reduce the production of secretions will provide comfort to the patient and support to the family. Deeper suctioning may cause significant discomfort to the dying patient and is rarely of any benefit, as secretions will reaccumulate rapidly.

\section*{THE DEATH VIGIL}

Although every death is unique, it is often possible for the experienced clinician to assess that the patient is "actively" or imminently dying and to prepare the family in the final days or hours leading to death. As death nears, the patient may withdraw, sleep for longer intervals, or become somnolent. The family should be encouraged to be with the patient, to speak and reassure him or her of their presence, to stroke or touch him or her, or to lie alongside him or her (even in the hospital or long-term care facility) if they are comfortable with this degree of closeness and can do so without causing discomfort to the patient.

Family members may have gone to great lengths to ensure that their loved one will not die alone. However, despite the best intentions and efforts of families and clinicians, the patient's death may occur at a time when no one is present. In any setting, it is unrealistic for family members to be at the patient's bedside 24 hours a day, and it is not unusual for patients to die when the family has stepped away from the bedside just briefly. Experienced hospice clinicians have observed and reported that some patients appear to "wait" until family members are away from the bedside to die, perhaps to spare their loved ones the pain of being present at the time of death. The nurse can reassure family members throughout the death vigil by being present intermittently or continuously, modeling behaviors (such as touching and speaking to the patient), providing encouragement in relation to family caregiving, providing reassurance about normal physiologic changes, and encouraging family rest breaks. When the patient dies while the family is away from the bedside, the family may express feelings of guilt and profound grief and will need emotional support.

\section*{AFTER-DEATH CARE}

The time of death is generally preceded by a period of gradual diminishment of bodily functions in which increasing intervals between respirations, a weakened and irregular pulse, diminishing blood pressure, and skin color changes or mottling may be observed. For the patient who has received adequate management of symptoms and for the family who has received adequate preparation and support, the actual time of death is commonly peaceful and occurs without struggle. The nurse may or may not be present at the time of the patient's death. In many states, the certifying physician may authorize the nurse to make the pronouncement of death and sign the death certificate. The determination of death is made through a physical examination that includes auscultation for the absence of breathing and heart sounds. Home care or hospice programs in which the nurse makes the time-of-death visit and pronouncement of death will have polices and procedures to guide the nurse's actions during this visit. Immediately upon cessation of vital functions the body will begin

The person will show less interest in eating and drinking. For many patients, refusal of food is an indication that they are ready to die. Fluid intake may be limited to that which will keep their mouths from feeling too dry.
- What you can do: Offer, but do not force, fluids and medication. Sometimes, pain or other symptoms that have required medication in the past may no longer be present. For most patients, pain medications will still be needed, and can be provided by concentrated oral solutions placed under the tongue or by rectal suppository.
Urinary output may decrease in amount and frequency.
- What you can do: No response is needed unless the patient expresses a desire to urinate and cannot. Call the hospice nurse for advice if you are not sure.
As the body weakens, the patient will sleep more and begin to detach from the environment. He or she may refuse your attempts to provide comfort.
- What you can do: Allow your loved one to sleep. You may wish to sit with him or her, play soft music, or hold hands. Your loved one's withdrawal is normal and is not a rejection of your love.
Mental confusion may become apparent, as less oxygen is available to supply the brain. The patient may report strange dreams or visions.
- What you can do: As he or she awakens from sleep, remind him or her of the day and time, where he or she is, and who is present. This is best done in a casual, conversational way.
Vision and hearing may become somewhat impaired and speech may be difficult to understand.
- What you can do: Speak clearly but no more loudly than necessary. Keep the room as light as the patient wishes, even at night. Carry on all conversations as if they can be heard, since hearing may be the last of the senses to cease functioning. Many patients are able to talk until minutes before death and are reassured by the exchange of a few words with a loved one. Secretions may collect in the back of the throat and rattle or gurgle as the patient breathes though the mouth. He or she may try to cough, and his or her mouth may become dry and encrusted with secretions.
- What you can do: if the patient is trying to cough up secretions and is experiencing choking or vomiting, call the hospice nurse for assistance.
Secretions may drain from the mouth if you place the patient on his/her side and provide support with pillows.

Cleansing the mouth with moistened mouth swabs will help to relieve the dryness that occurs with mouth breathing. Offer water in small amounts to keep the mouth moist. A straw with one finger placed over the end can be used to transfer sips of water to the patient's mouth.
Breathing may become irregular with periods of no breathing (apnea). The patient may be working very hard to breathe and may make a moaning sound with each breath. As the time of death nears, the breathing remains irregular and may become more shallow and mechanical.
- What you can do: Raising the head of the bed may help the patient to breathe more easily. The moaning sound does not mean that the patient is in pain or other distress; it is the sound of air passing over very relaxed vocal cords.
As the oxygen supply to the brain decreases, the patient may become restless. It is not unusual to pull at the bed linens, to have visual hallucinations, or even to try to get out of bed at this point.
- What you can do: Reassure the patient in a calm voice that you are there. Prevent him/her from falling by trying to get out of bed. Soft music or a back rub may be soothing.
The patient may feel hot one moment and cold the next as the body loses its ability to control the temperature. As circulation slows, the arms and legs may become cool and bluish. The underside of the body may darken. It may be difficult to feel a pulse at the wrist.
- What you can do: Provide and remove blankets as needed. Avoid using electric blankets, which may cause burns because the patient cannot tell you if he or she is too warm. Sponge the patient's head with a cool cloth if this provides comfort.
Loss of bladder and bowel control may occur around the time of death.
- What you can do: Protect the mattress with waterproof padding and change the padding as needed to keep the patient comfortable. As people approach death, many times they report seeing gardens, libraries, or family or friends who have died. They may ask you to pack their bags and find tickets or a passport. Sometimes they may become insistent and attempt to do these chores themselves. They may try getting out of bed (even if they have been confined to bed for a long time) so that they can "leave."
- What you can do: Reassure the patient that it is all right; he or she can "go" without getting out of bed. Stay close, share stories, and be present.

to change. The body will become dusky or bluish, waxen-appearing, and cool, blood will darken and pool in dependent areas of the body (such as the back and sacrum if the body is in a supine position), and urine and stool may be evacuated.

Immediately following the death, the family should be allowed and encouraged to spend time with the deceased. Nor-
mal responses of family members at the time of death vary widely and range from quiet expressions of grief to overt expressions that include wailing and prostration. Families' desires for privacy during their time with the deceased should be honored. Family members may wish to independently manage or assist with care of the body after death. If the death occurs in a
long-term care facility, the nurse follows the facility's procedure for preparation of the body and transportation to the facility's morgue. However, the family's needs to remain with the deceased, to wait until other family members arrive before the body is moved, and to perform after-death rituals should be honored. When an expected death occurs in the home setting, the body is often transported directly to the funeral home by the funeral director.

\section*{GRIEF, MOURNING, AND BEREAVEMENT}

A wide range of feelings and behaviors are normal, adaptive, and healthy reactions to the loss of a loved one. Grief refers to the personal feelings that accompany an anticipated or actual loss. Mourning reflects the individual, family, group, and cultural expressions of grief and associated behaviors. Bereavement refers to the period of time during which mourning takes place. Both grief reactions and mourning behaviors change over time as the individual learns to live with the loss. Although the pain of the loss may be tempered by the passage of time, recent conceptualizations of loss as an ongoing developmental process maintain that time does not heal the bereaved individual completely (Silverman, 2001); that is, the bereaved do not get over a loss entirely, nor do they return to who they were before the loss. Rather, they develop a new sense of who they are and where they fit in a world that has changed dramatically and permanently.

\section*{Anticipatory Grief and Mourning}

Denial, sadness, anger, fear, and anxiety are normal grief reactions in the individual with life-threatening illness and those close to him or her. Kübler-Ross (1969) described five common emotional reactions to dying that are applicable to the experience of any loss (Table 17-4). Although useful in understanding the overall experience of the dying process, the stages that Kübler-Ross described have been misinterpreted as following a linear, expected trajectory. Not every patient or family member experiences every stage, many patients never reach a stage of acceptance, and patients and families fluctuate on a sometimes day-to-day basis in their emotional responses. Further, while impending loss stresses the patient, those who are close to him or her, and the functioning of the family unit, awareness of dying also provides a unique opportunity for family members to reminisce, resolve relationships, plan for the future, and say goodbye.

Individual and family coping with the anticipation of death is complicated by the varied and conflicting trajectories that grief and mourning may assume in the family. For example, while the patient may be experiencing sadness while contemplating role changes that have been brought about by the illness, the patient's spouse or partner may be expressing or holding in feelings of anger about the current changes in role and impending loss of the relationship; others in the family may be engaged in denial (eg, "Dad will get better; he just needs to eat more."), fear ("Who will take care of us?" or "Will I get sick too?"), or profound sadness

\section*{Table 17-4 - Kübler-Ross's Five Stages of Dying}

\section*{STAGE}

Denial: "This cannot be true." Feelings of isolation. May search for another health care professional who will give a more favorable opinion. May seek unproven therapies.

Anger: "Why me?" Feelings of rage, resentment or envy directed at God, health care professionals, family, others.
Bargaining: "I just want to see my grandchild's birth, then I'll be ready. . . ."
Patient and/or family plead for more time to reach an important goal. Promises are sometimes made with God.
Depression: "I just don't know how my kids are going to get along after I'm gone."
Sadness, grief, mourning for impending losses.
Acceptance: "I've lived a good life, and I have no regrets."
Patient and/or family are neither angry nor depressed.

\section*{NURSING IMPLICATIONS}

Denial can be an adaptive response, providing a buffer after bad news. It allows time to mobilize defenses, but can be maladaptive when it prevents the patient or family from seeking help and when denial behaviors cause more pain or distress than the illness or interfere with everyday functions. Nurses should assess the patient's and family's coping style, information needs, and understanding of the illness and treatment to establish a basis for empathetic listening, education, and emotional support. Rather than confronting the patient with information he or she is not ready to hear, the nurse can encourage him or her to share fears and concerns. Open-ended questions or statements such as "Tell me more about how you are coping with this new information about your illness" can provide a springboard for expression of concerns.
Anger can be very isolating, and loved ones or clinicians may withdraw. Nurses should allow the patient and family to express anger, treating them with understanding, respect, and knowledge that the root of the anger is grief over impending loss.

Terminally ill patients are sometimes able to outlive prognoses and achieve some future goal. Nurses should be patient, allow expression of feelings, and support realistic and positive hope.

Normal and adaptive response. Clinical depression should be assessed and treated when present. Nurses should encourage the patient and family to express their sadness fully. Insincere reassurance or encouragement of unrealistic hopes should be avoided.

The patient may withdraw as his or her circle of interest diminishes. The family may feel rejected by the patient. Nurses need to support the family's expression of emotions and encourage them to continue to be present for the patient.
and withdrawal. Although each of these behaviors is normal, tension may arise when one or more family members perceive that others are less caring, too emotional, or too detached.

The nurse needs to assess the characteristics of the family system and intervene in a manner that supports and enhances the cohesion of the family unit. Parameters for assessing the family facing life-threatening illness are identified in Chart 17-9. The nurse can patiently guide family members to talk about their feelings and understand them in the broader context of anticipatory grief and mourning. Acknowledging and expressing feelings, continuing to interact with the patient in meaningful ways, and planning for the time of death and bereavement are adaptive family behaviors. Professional support provided by grief counselors in the community, at a local hospital, in the long-term care facility, or associated with a hospice program can help both the patient and family to sort out and acknowledge feelings and make the end of life as meaningful as possible.

\section*{Grief and Mourning After Death}

When a loved one dies, the family members enter a new phase of grief and mourning as they begin to accept the loss, feel the pain of permanent separation, and prepare to live a life without the deceased. Even if the loved one died after a long illness, preparatory grief experienced during the terminal illness will not preclude the

grief and mourning that follow the death. Following the patient's death after a long or difficult illness, family members may experience conflicting feelings of relief that the loved one's suffering has ended, compounded by guilt and grief related to unresolved issues or the circumstances of death. Grief work may be especially difficult if the patient's death was painful, prolonged, accompanied by unwanted interventions, or unattended. Families who had no preparation or support during the period of imminence and death may have a more difficult time finding a place for the painful memories.

Although some family members may experience prolonged or complicated mourning, most grief reactions fall within a "normal" range. The feelings are often profound, but the bereaved individual eventually reconciles the loss and finds a way to re-engage with his or her life. Grief and mourning are affected by individual characteristics, coping skills, and experiences with illness and death; the nature of the relationship to the deceased; factors surrounding the illness and the death; family dynamics; social support; and cultural expectations and norms. After-death rituals, including preparation of the body, funeral practices, and burial rituals, are socially and culturally significant ways that members of a family begin to accept the reality and finality of death. Preplanning of funerals is becoming increasingly common, and hospice professionals in particular assist families to make plans for death, often involving the patient who may wish to take an active planning role. Preplanning the funeral relieves the family of the decision burden in the intensely emotional period following a death. Uncomplicated grief and mourning are characterized by emotional feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, and numbness; physical sensations such as hollowness in the stomach and tightness in the chest, weakness, and lack of energy; cognitions that include preoccupation with the loss and a sense of the deceased as still present; and behaviors such as crying, visiting places that are reminders of the deceased, social withdrawal, and restless overactivity (Worden, 1991).

In general, the period of mourning is an adaptive response to loss during which the mourner comes to accept the loss as real and permanent, acknowledges and experiences the painful emotions that accompany the loss, experiences life without the deceased, overcomes impediments to adjustment, and finds a new way of living in a world without the loved one. Particularly immediately following the death, the mourner begins to recognize the reality and permanence of the loss by talking about the deceased and telling and retelling the story of the illness and death. Societal norms in the United States are frequently at odds with the normal grieving processes of individuals, where time excused from work obligations is typically measured in days and mourners are often expected to get over the loss quickly and get on with life.

In reality, the work of grief and mourning takes time, and avoiding grief work following the death often leads to long-term adjustment difficulties. According to Rando (2000), mourning for a loss involves the "undoing" of psychosocial ties that bind the mourner to the deceased, personal adaptation to the loss, and learning to live in the world without the deceased. Six key processes of mourning allow the individual to accommodate to the loss in a healthy way: recognition of the loss; reaction to the separation, experiencing and expressing the pain of the loss; recollection and re-experiencing the deceased, the relationship, and the associated feelings; relinquishing old attachments to the deceased; readjustment to adapt to the new world without forgetting the old; and reinvestment (Rando, 2000). Similarly, Worden (1991) described four tasks of mourning: acceptance of the reality of the loss, working through the pain of grief, adjusting to the environment in which the deceased is gone, and emotional "relocation" of the deceased in order to move on with life.

Although many individuals complete the work of mourning with the informal support of family and friends, many find that talking with others who have had a similar experience, such as in formal support groups, normalizes the feelings and experiences and provides a framework for learning new skills to cope with the loss and create a new life. Bereavement support groups are often sponsored by hospitals, hospices, and other community organizations. Groups for parents who have lost a child, children who have lost a parent, widows, widowers, and gay men and lesbians who have lost a life partner are some examples of specialized support groups available in many communities. Nursing interventions for those experiencing grief and mourning are identified in Chart 17-10.

\section*{Complicated Grief and Mourning}

Complicated grief and mourning are characterized by prolonged feelings of sadness and feelings of general worthlessness or hopelessness that persist long after the death, prolonged symptoms that interfere with activities of daily living (anorexia, insomnia, fatigue, panic), or self-destructive behaviors such as alcohol or substance abuse and suicidal ideation or attempts. Complicated grief and mourning require professional assessment and can be treated with pharmacologic and psychological interventions.

\section*{Coping With Death and Dying: Professional Caregiver Issues}

Whether practicing in the trauma center, intensive care unit or other acute care setting, home care, hospice, long-term care, or the many locations where patients and their families receive ambulatory services, nurses are closely involved with complex and emotionally laden issues surrounding loss of life. To be most effective and satisfied with the care they provide, nurses need to at-
- Support the expression of feelings.
- Encourage the telling of the story using open-ended statements or questions (eg, "Tell me about your husband").
- Assist the mourner to find an outlet for his/her feelings: talking, attending a support group, keeping a journal, finding a safe outlet for angry feelings (writing letters that will not be mailed, physical activity)
- Assess emotional affect and reinforce the normalcy of feelings.
- Assess for guilt and regrets.
- Are you especially troubled by a certain memory or thought?
- How do you manage those memories?
- Assess for the presence of social support.
- Do you have someone to whom you can talk about your husband?
- Can I help you to find someone you can talk to?
- Assess coping skills.
- How are you managing day to day?
- Have you experienced other losses? How did you manage those?
- Are there things you are having trouble doing?
- Do you have/need help with specific tasks?
- Assess for signs of complicated grief and mourning and offer professional referral.
tend to their own emotional responses to the losses they witness every day. Well before the nurse exhibits symptoms of stress or burnout, he or she should acknowledge the difficulty of coping with others' pain on a daily basis and put healthy practices in place that will guard against emotional exhaustion. In hospice settings, where death, grief, and loss are expected outcomes of patient care, interdisciplinary colleagues rely on each other for support, using meeting time to express frustration, sadness, anger, and other emotions; to learn coping skills from each other; and to speak about how they were affected by the lives of those patients who have died since the last meeting. In many settings, staff members organize or attend memorial services to support families and other caregivers, who find comfort in joining each other to remember and celebrate the lives of patients. Finally, healthy personal habits, including diet, exercise, stress reduction activities (such as dance, yoga, t'ai chi, meditation), and sleep, will help guard against the detrimental effects of stress.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your patient, age 70 , has metastatic prostate cancer and is receiving home hospice care. In the past, he has received transfusions of packed red blood cells to treat anemia associated with bone marrow involvement. He has received only temporary benefit from the transfusions. The patient's wife has asked that her husband's hemoglobin continue to be checked weekly because she is concerned about his increasing weakness and exertional dyspnea. The interdisciplinary team is meeting to discuss the patient's treatment plan. The team consensus is that he is unlikely to live more than a few days or weeks. What additional assessment data are needed to determine the wishes and expectations of the patient? Of the wife? What are the team's options for intervention? What are the pros and cons associated with each option?
2. You are conducting your first home care visit to an 88-year-old woman who has been hospitalized three times in the last 4 months with heart failure. She is short of breath, although she uses oxygen continuously. She is confined to bed and is incontinent and has a stage III pressure ulcer on her coccyx. She is not interested in eating and has lost 30 lb in the last 4 months. She is becoming progressively weaker. Her husband, also 88 , has limited mobility due to arthritis. He has a history of colon cancer and has had a colostomy for the last 10 years. Although he tries to take care of her, it is becoming increasingly difficult for him to do so. They have been married for almost 70 years and are very devoted to each other. What assessments would you carry out and what strategies would you implement to (1) relieve some of the patient's symptoms and discomfort, (2) assist her husband in management of her care, and (3) prepare both of them for her inevitable death?
3. You have been assigned to care for a 34-year-old father of three in the end stages of ALS. He was discharged home from the hospital yesterday and is being admitted to the local visiting nurse association's home palliative care program. During the admission assessment, when you ask him about his religion and beliefs as part of the spiritual assessment that is performed at the time of admission, he says to
you, "I don't go to church anymore and I really don't have time for people who want to talk about religion." Should you respond to his comment? If not, why? If so, what will you say? Should you continue with part or all of a spiritual assessment? Explain your rationale. If you continue with the spiritual assessment, what questions would you use in the assessment? Discuss your plan for follow-up.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Management}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:
1. Define the three phases of the perioperative period.
2. Describe a comprehensive preoperative assessment to identify surgical risk factors.
3. Identify the causes of preoperative anxiety and describe nursing measures to alleviate it.
4. Identify legal and ethical considerations related to informed consent.
5. Describe preoperative nursing measures that decrease the risk for infection and other postoperative complications.
6. Describe the immediate preoperative preparation of the patient.
7. Develop a preoperative teaching plan designed to promote the patient's recovery from anesthesia and surgery, thus preventing postoperative complications.

$S_{u}$urgery, whether elective or emergent, is a stressful, complex event. Today, as a result of advances in surgical techniques and instrumentation as well as in anesthesia, many surgical procedures that were once performed in an inpatient setting now take place in an ambulatory or outpatient setting. Approximately $60 \%$ of elective surgeries are now performed in an ambulatory or outpatient setting (Russell, Williams \& Bulstrode, 2000). This trend has increased the acuity and complexity of surgical patients and procedures. The number of surgical patients admitted for overnight hospital stays is expected to continue to decrease.

In the past, the patient scheduled for elective surgery would be admitted to the hospital at least 1 day before surgery for evaluation and preparation; these activities are now completed before the patient is admitted to the hospital. Today, many patients arrive at the hospital the morning of surgery and go home after recovering in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) from the anesthesia. Often, surgical patients who require hospital stays are trauma patients, acutely ill patients, patients undergoing major surgery, patients who require emergency surgery, and patients with a concurrent medical disorder. Although each setting offers its own unique advantages for the delivery of patient care, all require a comprehensive preoperative nursing assessment and nursing intervention to prepare the patient and family before surgery.

Today's technology has led to more complex procedures, more complicated microsurgical and laser technology, more sophisticated bypass equipment, increased use of laparoscopic surgery, and more sensitive monitoring devices. Surgery might now involve the transplantation of multiple human organs, the implantation of mechanical devices, the reattachment of body parts, and the use of robots and minimally invasive procedures in the operating room (Mack, 2002). Advances in anesthesia have kept pace with these surgical technologies. More sophisticated monitoring and new pharmacologic agents, such as short-acting anesthetics and more effective antiemetics, have improved postoperative pain management, reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting, and shortened procedure and recovery times.

Concurrent with technologic advances have been changes in the delivery of and payment for health care. Pressure to reduce hospital stays and contain costs has resulted in patients undergoing diagnostic preadmission testing (PAT) and preoperative preparation before admission to the hospital. Many facilities have a presurgical services department to facilitate testing and to initiate the nursing assessment process, which may focus on patient demographics, health history, and other information pertinent to the surgical procedure. The increasing use of ambulatory or same-day surgery means that patients leave the hospital sooner, which increases the need for teaching, discharge planning, preparation for self-care, and referral for home care and rehabilitation
services. Competent care of ambulatory or same-day surgical patients requires a sound knowledge of all aspects of perioperative and perianesthesia nursing practice.

\section*{Perioperative and Perianesthesia Nursing}

The special field known as perioperative and perianesthesia nursing includes a wide variety of nursing functions associated with the patient's surgical experience during the perioperative period. Perioperative and perianesthesia nursing addresses the nursing roles relevant to the three phases of the surgical experience: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. As shown in Chart 18-1, each phase begins and ends at a particular point in the sequence of events that constitutes the surgical experience, and each includes a wide range of activities the nurse performs using the nursing process and based on the standards of practice (American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses, 2000; Litwack, 1999; Quinn, 1999).

\section*{PREOPERATIVE PHASE}

The preoperative phase begins when the decision to proceed with surgical intervention is made and ends with the transfer of the patient onto the operating room table. The scope of nursing activities during this time can include establishing a baseline evaluation of the patient before the day of surgery by carrying out a preoperative interview (which includes not only a physical but also an emotional assessment, previous anesthetic history, and identification of known allergies or genetic problems that may affect the surgical outcome), ensuring that necessary tests have been or will be performed (preadmission testing), arranging appropriate consultative services, and providing preparatory education about recovery from anesthesia and postoperative care. On the day of surgery, patient teaching is reviewed, the patient's identity and the surgical site are verified, informed consent is confirmed, and an intravenous infusion is started. If the patient is going home the same day, the availability of safe transport and the presence of an accompanying responsible adult is verified. Depending on when the preadmission evaluation and testing were done, the nursing activities on the day of surgery may be as basic as performing or updating the preoperative patient assessment and addressing questions the patient or family may have.

\section*{INTRAOPERATIVE PHASE}

The intraoperative phase begins when the patient is transferred onto the operating room table and ends when he or she is admitted to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). In this
ambulatory surgery: may include outpatient (or same-day) surgery that does not require an overnight hospital stay or short stay, with admission to an inpatient hospital setting for less than 24 hours
informed consent: the patient's autonomous decision about whether to undergo a surgical procedure; based on the nature of the condition, the treatment options, and the risks and benefits involved
intraoperative phase: period of time from when the patient is transferred to the operating room table to when he or she is admitted to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU)
perioperative phase: period of time that constitutes the surgical experience; includes the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of nursing care postoperative phase: period of time that begins with the admission of the patient
to the PACU and ends after a follow-up evaluation in the clinical setting or home
preadmission testing (PAT): diagnostic testing performed before admission to the hospital
preoperative phase: period of time from when the decision for surgical intervention is made to when the patient is transferred to the operating room table

phase, the scope of nursing activity can include providing for the patient's safety, maintaining an aseptic environment, ensuring proper function of equipment, providing the surgeon with specific instruments and supplies for the surgical field, and completing appropriate documentation. In some instances, the nursing activities can encompass providing emotional support by holding the patient's hand during general anesthesia induction, assisting in positioning the patient on the operating room table using basic principles of body alignment, or acting as scrub nurse, circulating nurse, or registered nurse first assistant (RNFA).

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE PHASE}

The postoperative phase begins with the admission of the patient to the PACU and ends with a follow-up evaluation in the clinical setting or at home. The scope of nursing care covers a wide range of activities during this period. In the immediate postoperative phase, the focus includes maintaining the patient's airway, monitoring vital signs, assessing the effects of the anesthetic agents, assessing the patient for complications, and providing comfort and pain relief. Nursing activities then focus on promoting the patient's recovery and initiating the teaching, follow-up

\section*{GENETICS IN NURSING PRACTICE—Perioperative Nursing}

Nurses who are caring for patients undergoing surgery need to take various genetic considerations into account when assessing patients throughout the perioperative experience. For example, surgical outcomes may be altered by genetic conditions that may cause complications with anesthesia, including the following:
- Malignant hyperthermia
- Central core disease (CCD)
- Duchenne muscular dystrophy
- Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis
- King-Denborough

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{PREOPERATIVE FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Obtain a thorough assessment of personal and family history, inquiring about prior problems with surgery or anesthesia with specific attention to complications such as fever, rigidity, dark urine, unexpected reactions.
- Inquire about any history of musculoskeletal complaints, history of heat intolerance, fevers of unknown origin, or unusual drug reaction.
- Assess for family history of any sudden or unexplained death, especially during participation in athletic events.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT}
- Assess for subclinical muscle weakness.
- Assess for other physical features suggestive of an underlying genetic condition, such as contractures, kyphoscoliosis, and pterygium with progressive weakness.

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether DNA mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on an affected family member.
- If indicated, refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of diagnostic/genetic testing.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to families with newly diagnosed malignant hyperthermia.
- Participate in management and coordination of care of patients with genetic conditions and individuals predisposed to develop or pass on a genetic condition.

Historically, the perioperative nurse's practice environment has been isolated, consisting of the area behind the double doors of the surgical suite. Although the nursing process guided nursing care, the fundamentals of assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation were often misunderstood by practitioners unfamiliar with the delivery of surgical care. In recent years, the acceptance of a conceptual model for patient care, published by the Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses, formerly known as the Association of Operating Room Nurses (still abbreviated AORN), has helped to delineate the relationship of various components of nursing practice and the effect on patient outcomes (Beyea, 2000). The Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS) is a language that describes the practice of perioperative nursing practice in four domains: safety, physiologic responses, behavioral responses, and health care systems (Fig. 18-1). The first three domains reflect phenomena of concern to perioperative nurses and are composed of nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes that surgical patients and their families experience. The fourth domain, the health care system, comprises structural data elements and focuses on clinical processes and outcomes. The model is used to depict the relationship of nursing process components to the achievement of optimal patient outcomes.

\section*{Surgical Classifications}

Surgery may be performed for various reasons. A surgical procedure may be diagnostic (eg, biopsy or exploratory laparotomy). It may be curative (eg, excision of a tumor or an inflamed appendix) or reparative (eg, multiple wound repair). Surgery may be reconstructive or cosmetic (eg, mammoplasty or a facelift), or it may be palliative (eg, to relieve pain or correct a problem; for instance, a gastrostomy tube may be inserted to compensate for the inability to swallow food). Surgery may also be classified according to the degree of urgency involved: emergent, urgent, required, elective, and optional. These terms are defined in Table 18-1.

\section*{Preparation for Surgery}

\section*{INFORMED CONSENT}

Voluntary and written informed consent from the patient is necessary before nonemergent surgery can be performed. Such written consent protects the patient from unsanctioned surgery and protects the surgeon from claims of an unauthorized operation. In the best interests of all parties concerned, sound medical, ethical, and legal principles are followed. The nurse may ask the patient to sign the form and may witness the patient's signature. It is the physician's responsibility to provide appropriate information. Chart 18-2 lists the criteria for a valid informed consent.

Many ethical principles are integral to informed consent (see Chap. 3). Before the patient signs the consent form, the surgeon must provide a clear and simple explanation of what the surgery will entail. The surgeon must also inform the patient of the benefits, alternatives, possible risks, complications, disfigurement, disability, and removal of body parts as well as what to expect in the early and late postoperative periods. If the patient needs additional information to make his or her decision, the nurse notifies the physician about this. Also, the nurse ascertains that the consent form has been signed before administering psychoactive premedication, because the consent may not be valid if it was obtained while the patient was under the influence of medications that can affect judgment and decision-making

Voluntary Consent
Valid consent must be freely given, without coercion.
Incompetent Patient
Legal definition: individual who is not autonomous and cannot give or withhold consent (eg, individuals who are mentally retarded, mentally ill, or comatose)
Informed Subject
Informed consent should be in writing. It should contain the following:
- Explanation of procedure and its risks
- Description of benefits and alternatives
- An offer to answer questions about procedure
- Instructions that the patient may withdraw consent
- A statement informing the patient if the protocol differs from customary procedure
Patient Able to Comprehend
Information must be written and delivered in language understandable to the patient. Questions must be answered to facilitate comprehension if material is confusing.
capacity. Informed consent is necessary in the following circumstances:
- Invasive procedures, such as a surgical incision, a biopsy, a cystoscopy, or paracentesis
- Procedures requiring sedation and/or anesthesia (see Chap. 19 for a discussion of levels of sedation and anesthesia)
- A nonsurgical procedure, such as an arteriography, that carries more than slight risk to the patient
- Procedures involving radiation

The patient personally signs the consent if he or she is of legal age and is mentally capable. When the patient is a minor or unconscious or incompetent, permission must be obtained from a responsible family member (preferably next of kin) or legal guardian. An emancipated minor (married or independently earning his or her own living) may sign his or her own consent form. State regulations and agency policy must be followed. In

an emergency, it may be necessary for the surgeon to operate as a lifesaving measure without the patient's informed consent. Every effort, however, must be made to contact the patient's family. In such a situation, contact can be made by telephone, telegram, fax, or other electronic means.

When the patient has doubts and has not had the opportunity to investigate alternative treatments, a second opinion may be requested. No patient should be urged or coerced to sign an operative permit. Refusing to undergo a surgical procedure is a person's legal right and privilege. However, such information must be documented and relayed to the surgeon so that other arrangements can be made. For example, additional explanations may be provided to the patient and family, or the surgery may be rescheduled.

The consent process can be improved by providing audiovisual materials to supplement discussion, by ensuring that the wording of the consent form is understandable, and by using other strategies and resources as needed to help the patient understand its content.

NURSING ALERT The signed consent form is placed in a prominent place on the patient's chart and accompanies the patient to the operating room.

\section*{ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH FACTORS THAT AFFECT PATIENTS PREOPERATIVELY}

The overall goal in the preoperative period is for the patient to have as many positive health factors as possible. Every attempt is made to stabilize those conditions that otherwise hinder a smooth recovery. When negative factors dominate, the risks of surgery and postoperative complications increase.

Before any surgical treatment is initiated, a health history is obtained, a physical examination is performed during which vital signs are noted, and a database is established for future comparisons (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). During the physical examination, many factors are considered that have the potential to affect the patient undergoing surgery. Health care providers should be alert for signs of abuse that can occur at all ages and to men and women from all socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural groups (Little, 2000; Marshall, Benton \& Brazier, 2000). Findings need to be reported accordingly (see Chap. 5 for further discussion of signs of abuse).

Blood tests, x-rays, and other diagnostic tests are prescribed when specifically indicated by information obtained from a thorough history and physical examination (King, 2000). These preliminary contacts with the health care team provide the patient with opportunities to ask questions and to become acquainted with those who may be providing care during and after surgery.

\section*{Nutritional and Fluid Status}

Optimal nutrition is an essential factor in promoting healing and resisting infection and other surgical complications (Braunschweig, Gomez \& Sheean, 2000). Assessment of a patient's nutritional status provides information on obesity, undernutrition, weight loss, malnutrition, deficiencies in specific nutrients, metabolic abnormalities, the effects of medications on nutrition, and special problems of the hospitalized patient (Quinn, 1999). Nutritional needs may be determined by measurement of body mass index and waist circumference (National Institutes of Health, 2000). See Chapter 5 for further discussion of nutritional assessment.

Any nutritional deficiency, such as malnutrition, should be corrected before surgery so that enough protein is available for tissue repair (King, 2000; Russell, Williams \& Bulstrode, 2000). The nutrients needed for wound healing are summarized in Table 18-2.

Dehydration, hypovolemia, and electrolyte imbalances can lead to significant problems in patients with comorbid medical conditions or in elderly patients. The severity of fluid and electrolyte imbalances is often difficult to determine. Mild volume deficits may be treated during surgery; however, additional time may be needed to correct pronounced fluid and electrolyte deficits to promote the best possible preoperative condition.

\section*{Drug or Alcohol Use}

People who abuse drugs or alcohol frequently deny or attempt to hide it. In such situations, the nurse who is obtaining the patient's health history needs to ask frank questions with patience, care, and a nonjudgmental attitude. See Chapter 5 for an assessment of alcohol and drug use.

Because acutely intoxicated persons are susceptible to injury, surgery is postponed in these patients if possible. If emergency surgery is required, local, spinal, or regional block anesthesia is used for minor surgery. Otherwise, to prevent vomiting and potential aspiration, a nasogastric tube is inserted before administering general anesthesia.

The person with a history of chronic alcoholism often suffers from malnutrition and other systemic problems that increase the surgical risk. Additionally, alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens) may be anticipated up to 72 hours after alcohol withdrawal. Delirium tremens is associated with a significant mortality rate when it occurs postoperatively.

Chart 18-3 gives more information about risk factors that may lead to complications.

\section*{Respiratory Status}

The goal for potential surgical patients is optimal respiratory function. Patients are taught breathing exercises and use of an incentive spirometer if indicated. Because adequate ventilation is potentially compromised during all phases of surgical treatment, surgery is usually postponed when the patient has a respiratory infection. Patients with underlying respiratory disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are assessed carefully for current threats to their pulmonary status. Patients' use of medications that may affect recovery is also assessed (King, 2000; Smetana, 1999).

Patients who smoke are urged to stop 2 months before surgery (King, 2000), although many do not do so. These patients should be counseled to stop smoking at least 24 hours prior to surgery. Research suggests that counseling has a positive effect on the patient's smoking behavior 24 hours preceding surgery, helping reduce the potential for adverse effects associated with smoking such as increased airway reactivity, decreased mucociliary clearance, as well as physiologic changes in the cardiovascular and immune systems (Shannon-Cain, Webster \& Cain, 2002).

\section*{Cardiovascular Status}

The goal in preparing any patient for surgery is to ensure a wellfunctioning cardiovascular system to meet the oxygen, fluid, and nutritional needs of the perioperative period. If the patient has

uncontrolled hypertension, surgery may be postponed until the blood pressure is under control.

Because cardiovascular disease increases the risk for complications, patients with these conditions require greater-than-usual diligence during all phases of nursing management and care (King, 2000). Depending on the severity of the symptoms, surgery may be deferred until medical treatment can be instituted to improve the patient's condition. At times, surgical treatment can be modified to meet the cardiac tolerance of the patient. For example, in a patient with obstruction of the descending colon and coronary artery disease, a temporary simple colostomy may be performed rather than a more extensive colon resection that would require a prolonged period of anesthesia.

\section*{Hepatic and Renal Function}

The presurgical goal is optimal function of the liver and urinary systems so that medications, anesthetic agents, body wastes, and toxins are adequately processed and removed from the body.

The liver is important in the biotransformation of anesthetic compounds. Therefore, any disorder of the liver has an effect on how anesthetic agents are metabolized. Because acute liver disease is associated with high surgical mortality, preoperative improvement in liver function is a goal. Careful assessment is made with the help of various liver function tests (see Chap. 39).

Because the kidneys are involved in excreting anesthetic drugs and their metabolites and because acid-base status and metabolism

The patient with diabetes who is undergoing surgery is at risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Hypoglycemia may develop during anesthesia or postoperatively from inadequate carbohydrates or from excessive administration of insulin. Hyperglycemia, which may increase the risk for surgical wound infection, may result from the stress of surgery, which may trigger increased levels of catecholamine. Other risks are acidosis and glucosuria. Although the surgical risk in the patient with controlled diabetes is no greater than in the nondiabetic patient, the goal is to maintain the blood glucose level at less than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is important before, during, and after surgery (see Chap. 41 for discussion of the patient with diabetes undergoing surgery).

Patients who have received corticosteroids are at risk for adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, the use of corticosteroids for any purpose during the preceding year must be reported to the anesthesiologist or anesthetist and surgeon. Additionally, the patient is monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency.

Patients with uncontrolled thyroid disorders are at risk for thyrotoxicosis (with hyperthyroid disorders) and respiratory failure (with hypothyroid disorders). Therefore, the patient is assessed for a history of these disorders.

\section*{Immune Function}

An important function of the preoperative assessment is to determine the existence of allergies, including the nature of previous allergic reactions. It is especially important to identify and document any sensitivity to medications and past adverse reactions to these agents. The patient is asked to identify any substances that precipitated previous allergic reactions, including medications, blood transfusions, contrast agents, latex, and food products, and to describe the signs and symptoms produced by these substances. A sample latex allergy screening questionnaire is shown in Figure 18-2.

Immunosuppression is common with corticosteroid therapy, renal transplantation, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and disorders affecting the immune system, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and leukemia. The mildest symptoms or slightest temperature elevation must be investigated. Because patients who are immunosuppressed are highly susceptible to infection, great care is taken to ensure strict asepsis.

\section*{Previous Medication Use}

A medication history is obtained from each patient because of the possible effects of medications on the patient's perioperative and perianesthesia course and the possibility of drug interactions (Quinn, 1999). Any medication the patient is using or has used in the past is documented, including over-the-counter (OTC) preparations and herbal agents and the frequency with which they are used. Potent medications have an effect on physiologic functions; interactions of such medications with anesthetic agents can cause serious problems, such as arterial hypotension and circulatory collapse.

The potential effects of prior medication therapy are evaluated by the anesthesiologist or anesthetist, who considers the length of time the patient has used the medications, the physical condition of the patient, and the nature of the proposed surgery. Medications that cause particular concern are listed in Table 18-3.

Many patients take self-prescribed or OTC medications in addition to those listed in Table 18-3. Aspirin is a common OTC medication prescribed by physicians or taken independently by patients to prevent myocardial infarction, stroke, and other disorders (Karch, 2002). Because of the effects of aspirin or other OTC medications and possible interactions with other medications and anesthetic agents, it is important to ask a patient about their use. The information is noted in the patient's chart and conveyed to the anesthesiologist or anesthetist and surgeon.

The use of herbal medications is widespread among patients. Approximately 15 million Americans report their use (Ang-Lee, Moss \& Yuan, 2001; Karch, 2002; Lyons, 2002). Patients with chronic illnesses may be using herbal medications to supplement their prescribed medications or in place of them. Certain herbal medications, such as echinacea, ephedra, garlic (Allium sativum), ginkgo, ginseng, kava kava (Piper methysticum), St. John's wort

(Hypericum perforatum), licorice (Glycyhiza glabra), and valerian (Valeriana officinalis) have been identified as the most commonly used herbal medications that may cause concern during the perioperative period (Ang-Lee, Moss \& Yuan, 2001; Kuhn, 1999; Lyons, 2002). Because of the potential effects of herbal medications on coagulation and potential interactions with other medications, the nurse must ask surgical patients explicitly about the use of these agents, document their use, and inform the surgical team and anesthesiologist or anesthetist (Brumly, 2000).

NURSING ALERT Because of possible adverse interactions, the nurse must assess and document the patient's use of prescription medications, OTC medications (especially aspirin), and herbal medications. The nurse must clearly communicate this information to the anesthesiologist or anesthetist.

\section*{Psychosocial Factors}

All patients have some type of emotional reaction before any surgical procedure, be it obvious or hidden, normal or abnormal. For example, preoperative anxiety may be an anticipatory response to an experience the patient views as a threat to his or her customary role in life, body integrity, or life itself. Psychological distress directly influences body functioning. Therefore, it is imperative to identify any anxiety the patient is experiencing.

By taking a careful health history, the nurse elicits patient concerns that can have a bearing on the course of the surgical experience (Quinn, 1999). Undoubtedly, a patient about to undergo surgery is faced with various fears, including fears of the unknown, of death, of anesthesia, pain, or cancer. Concerns about loss of work time, loss of job, increased responsibilities or burden on family members, and the threat of permanent incapacity further

contribute to the emotional strain created by the prospect of surgery. Less obvious concerns may occur because of previous experiences with the health care system and people the patient has known with the same condition.

People express fear in different ways. For example, one patient may repeatedly ask a lot of questions, even though answers were given previously. Another person may withdraw, deliberately avoiding communication, perhaps by reading or watching television. Still others may talk about trivialities. Consequently, the nurse must be empathetic, listen well, and provide information that helps alleviate concerns.

An important outcome of the psychosocial assessment is the determination of the extent and role of the patient's support network. The value and reliability of all available support systems are assessed. Other information, such as usual level of functioning and typical daily activities, may assist in the patient's care and rehabilitation plans. Assessing the patient's readiness to learn and determining the best approach to maximize comprehension will provide the basis for preoperative patient education.

\section*{Spiritual and Cultural Beliefs}

Spiritual beliefs play an important role in how people cope with fear and anxiety. Regardless of the patient's religious affiliation, spiritual beliefs can be as therapeutic as medication. Every attempt must be made to help the patient obtain the spiritual help that he or she requests. Faith has great sustaining power. Thus, the beliefs of each patient should be respected and supported. Some
nurses avoid the subject of a clergy visit lest the suggestion alarm the patient. Asking if the patient's spiritual advisor knows about the impending surgery is a caring, nonthreatening approach.

Showing respect for a patient's cultural values and beliefs facilitates rapport and trust. Some areas of assessment include identifying the ethnic group to which the patient relates and the customs and beliefs the patient holds about illness and health care providers. For example, patients from some cultural groups are unaccustomed to expressing feelings openly. Nurses need to consider this pattern of communication when assessing pain. As a sign of respect, people from other cultural groups may not make direct eye contact with others. The nurse needs to know that this lack of eye contact is not avoidance or a lack of interest.

Perhaps the most valuable skill at the nurse's disposal is listening carefully to the patient, especially when obtaining the history. Invaluable information and insights may be gained by engaging in conversation and using communication and interviewing skills. An unhurried, understanding, and caring nurse invites confidence on the part of the patient.

\section*{Special Considerations}

In the preoperative period, attention needs to be paid to patients with special considerations. These may include the patient who is undergoing ambulatory surgery, the geriatric patient, the patient who is obese, the patient with a disability, and the patient undergoing emergency surgery.

\section*{THE AMBULATORY SURGERY PATIENT}

The brief time the patient and family spend in the ambulatory setting is an important factor in the preoperative period. The nurse must quickly and comprehensively assess and anticipate the patient's needs and at the same time begin planning for discharge and follow-up home care.

The nurse needs to be sure that the patient and family understand that the patient will go first to the preoperative holding area before going to the operating room for the surgical procedure and then will spend some time in the PACU before being discharged home with the family later that day. Other preoperative teaching content should also be verified (see the section later in this chapter on instructing the ambulatory surgery patient) and reinforced as needed. The nurse should ensure that any plans for follow-up home care are in place if needed (Quinn, 1999).

\section*{ELDERLY PATIENTS}

The older person undergoing surgery may have a combination of chronic illnesses and health problems in addition to the specific one for which surgery is indicated. Elderly people frequently do not report symptoms, perhaps because they fear a serious illness may be diagnosed or because they accept such symptoms as part of the aging process. Subtle clues alert the nurse to underlying problems.

Health care staff must remember that the hazards of surgery for the aged are proportional to the number and severity of coexisting health problems and the nature and duration of the operative procedure. The underlying principle that guides the preoperative assessment, surgical care, and postoperative care is that the aged patient has less physiologic reserve (the ability of an organ to return to normal after a disturbance in its equilibrium) than the younger patient. Cardiac reserves are lower; renal and hepatic functions are depressed; and gastrointestinal activity is likely to be reduced. Dehydration, constipation, and malnutrition may be evident. Sensory limitations, such as impaired vision or hearing and reduced tactile sensitivity, are often the reasons for falls and burns. Therefore, the nurse must be alert to maintaining a safe environment. Arthritis is common in older people and may affect mobility, making it difficult for the patient to turn from one side to the other or ambulate without discomfort. Protective measures include adequate padding for tender areas, moving the patient slowly, protecting bony prominences from prolonged pressure, and providing gentle massage to promote circulation.

The condition of the mouth is important to assess. Dental caries, dentures, and partial plates are particularly significant to the anesthesiologist or anesthetist because decayed teeth or dental prostheses may become dislodged during intubation and occlude the airway.

An additional area to assess in elderly patients is the preoperative level of activity. Research suggests that elderly patients who had hip replacement surgery and who reported performing greater physical activities (including heavy chores) preoperatively can walk greater distances postoperatively than elderly patients who are less physically active prior to surgery (Whitney \& Parkman, 2002).

As the body ages, its ability to perspire decreases. Because decreased perspiration leads to dry, itchy skin, which becomes fragile and is easily abraded, precautions are taken when moving an elderly person. Decreased subcutaneous fat makes older people more susceptible to temperature changes. A lightweight cotton
blanket is an appropriate cover when an elderly patient is moved to and from the operating room.

Most elderly people have experienced personal illnesses and possibly life-threatening illnesses of friends and family. Such experiences may result in fears about the surgery and about the future. Providing the patient with an opportunity to express these fears enables the patient to gain some peace of mind and a sense of being understood.

Preoperative pain assessment and teaching are important with elderly patients. It is important for nurses to incorporate pain management information and pain communication skills when teaching elderly persons how to obtain greater postoperative pain relief (McDonald, Freeland, Thomas \& Moore, 2001).

Because the elderly patient may have greater risks during the perioperative period, the following are critical: (1) skillful preoperative assessment and treatment, (2) skillful anesthesia and surgery, and (3) meticulous and competent postoperative and postanesthesia management.

\section*{OBESE PATIENTS}

Like age, obesity increases the risk and severity of complications associated with surgery (National Institutes of Health, 2000). During surgery, fatty tissues are especially susceptible to infection. Additionally, obesity increases technical and mechanical problems related to surgery. Therefore, dehiscence (wound separation) and wound infections are more common. Moreover, the obese patient may be more difficult to care for because of the added weight; the patient tends to breathe poorly when supine, which increases the risk of hypoventilation and postoperative pulmonary complications. In addition, abdominal distention, phlebitis, and cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and biliary diseases occur more readily in obese patients (Dudek, 2001). It has been estimated that for each 30 pounds of excess weight, about 25 additional miles of blood vessels are needed, and this places increased demands on the heart.

\section*{PATIENTS WITH DISABILITIES}

Special considerations for patients with a mental or physical disability include the need for assistive devices, modifications in preoperative teaching, additional assistance with and attention to positioning or transferring, and the effects of the disability on surgery and anesthesia (Quinn, 1999).

Assistive devices include hearing aids, eyeglasses, braces, prostheses, and other devices. Individuals who are hearing-impaired may need a translator or some alternative communication system perioperatively. If they rely on signing or speech (lip) reading, and if their eyeglasses or contact lenses are removed or if health care staff wear surgical masks, these patients will need an alternative method of communication. These needs must be identified as a factor in the preoperative evaluation and clearly communicated to personnel. Specific strategies for accommodating the patient's needs must be identified ahead of time. Ensuring the safety of assistive devices is important; these devices are expensive and likely to be lost.

Most patients are directed to move from the stretcher to the operating room table and back again. In addition to being unable to see or hear instructions, patients with a disability may be unable to move without special devices or a great deal of assistance. The patient with a disability that affects body position (eg, cerebral
palsy, post-polio syndrome, and other neuromuscular disorders) may need special positioning during surgery to prevent pain and injury. Moreover, these patients may be unable to sense whether their extremities are positioned incorrectly.

Patients with respiratory problems related to a disability (eg, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy) may experience difficulties unless the problems are made known to the anesthesiologist or anesthetist and adjustments are made. These factors need to be clearly identified in the preoperative period and communicated to the appropriate personnel.

\section*{PATIENTS UNDERGOING EMERGENCY SURGERY}

Emergency surgeries are unplanned and occur with little time for preparation (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). The unpredictable nature of trauma and emergency surgery poses unique challenges to the nurse throughout the perioperative period.

All of the previously discussed factors that affect patients preparing to undergo surgery apply to these patients, usually in a very condensed time frame. The preoperative assessment may actually coincide with resuscitation efforts in the emergency department (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). For the unconscious patient, informed consent and essential information, such as pertinent past medical history and allergies, need to be obtained from a family member, if one is available. A quick visual survey of the patient is essential to identify all sites of injury when the emergency surgery is due to trauma (see Chap. 71 for more information).

The psychological status of the patient undergoing emergency surgery should be assessed quickly if the patient is awake (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). The patient may have undergone a very frightening experience and may need extra support and explanation of the surgery.

\section*{Preoperative Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PREOPERATIVE TEACHING}

Nurses have long recognized the value of preoperative instruction (Fitzpatrick, 1998). Each patient is taught as an individual, with consideration for any unique concerns or needs; the program of instruction should be based on the individual's learning needs (Quinn, 1999). Multiple teaching strategies should be used (eg, verbal, written, return demonstration), depending on the patient's needs and abilities. Preoperative teaching is initiated as soon as possible. It should start in the physician's office and continue until the patient arrives in the operating room.

\section*{When and What to Teach}

Ideally, instruction is spaced over a period of time to allow the patient to assimilate information and ask questions as they arise. Frequently, teaching sessions are combined with various preparation procedures to allow for an easy and timely flow of information. The nurse should guide the patient through the experience and allow ample time for questions. Some patients may feel too many descriptive details will increase their anxiety level, and the nurse should respect their wish for less detail.

Teaching should go beyond descriptions of the procedure and should include explanations of the sensations the patient will experience. For example, telling the patient only that preoperative medication will relax him or her before the operation is not as effective as also noting that the medication may result in light-
headedness and drowsiness. Knowing what to expect will help the patient anticipate these reactions and thus attain a higher degree of relaxation than might otherwise be expected.

The ideal timing for preoperative teaching is not on the day of surgery but during the preadmission visit when diagnostic tests are performed. At this time, the nurse or resource person answers questions and provides important patient teaching. During this visit, the patient can meet and ask questions of the perioperative nurse, view audiovisuals, receive written materials, and be given the telephone number to call as questions arise closer to the date of surgery. Most institutions provide written instructions (designed to be copied and given to patients) about many types of surgery (Economou \& Economou, 1999).

\section*{Deep-Breathing, Coughing, and Incentive Spirometers}

One goal of preoperative nursing care is to teach the patient how to promote optimal lung expansion and consequent blood oxygenation after anesthesia. The patient assumes a sitting position to enhance lung expansion. The nurse then demonstrates how to take a deep, slow breath and how to exhale slowly. After practicing deep breathing several times, the patient is instructed to breathe deeply, exhale through the mouth, take a short breath, and cough from deep in the lungs (Chart 18-4). The nurse also demonstrates how to use an incentive spirometer, a device that provides measurement and feedback related to breathing effectiveness. In addition to enhancing respiration, these exercises may help the patient to relax.

If there will be a thoracic or abdominal incision, the nurse demonstrates how the incision line can be splinted to minimize pressure and control pain. The patient should put the palms of both hands together, interlacing the fingers snugly. Placing the hands across the incisional site acts as an effective splint when coughing. Additionally, the patient is informed that medications are available to relieve pain and should be taken regularly for pain relief so that effective deep-breathing and coughing exercises can be performed. The goal in promoting coughing is to mobilize secretions so they can be removed. Deep breathing before coughing stimulates the cough reflex. If the patient does not cough effectively, atelectasis (lung collapse), pneumonia, and other lung complications may occur.

\section*{Mobility and Active Body Movement}

The goals of promoting mobility postoperatively are to improve circulation, prevent venous stasis, and promote optimal respiratory function.

The nurse explains the rationale for frequent position changes after surgery and then shows the patient how to turn from side to side and how to assume the lateral position without causing pain or disrupting intravenous lines, drainage tubes, or other equipment. Any special position the individual patient will need to maintain after surgery (eg, adduction or elevation of an extremity) is discussed, as is the importance of maintaining as much mobility as possible despite restrictions. Reviewing the process before surgery is helpful because the patient may be too uncomfortable after surgery to absorb new information.

Exercises of the extremities include extension and flexion of the knee and hip joints (similar to bicycle riding while lying on the side). The foot is rotated as though tracing the largest possible circle with the great toe (see illustrations in Chart 18-4). The elbow and shoulder are also put through range of motion. At first,

\section*{Chart 18-4 - PATIENT EDUCATION}

\section*{Preoperative Instructions to Prevent Postoperative Complications}

Preoperative teaching for patients undergoing surgery includes instruction in breathing and leg exercises used to prevent postoperative complications, such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis. These exercises may be performed in the hospital or at home.

\section*{Diaphragmatic Breathing}

Diaphragmatic breathing refers to a flattening of the dome of the diaphragm during inspiration, with resultant enlargement of the upper abdomen as air rushes in. During expiration, the abdominal muscles contract.
1. Practice in the same position you would assume in bed after surgery: a semi-Fowler's position, propped in bed with the back and shoulders well supported with pillows.
2. With your hands in a loose-fist position, allow the hands to rest lightly on the front of the lower ribs, with your fingertips against lower chest to feel the movement.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Diaphragmatic breathing}
\end{figure}
3. Breathe out gently and fully as the ribs sink down and inward toward midline.
4. Then take a deep breath through your nose and mouth, letting the abdomen rise as the lungs fill with air.
5. Hold this breath for a count of five.
6. Exhale and let out all the air through your nose and mouth.
7. Repeat this exercise 15 times with a short rest after each group of five.
8. Practice this twice a day preoperatively.

\section*{Coughing}
1. Lean forward slightly from a sitting position in bed, interlace your fingers together, and place your hands across the incisional site to act as a splintlike support when coughing.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-430.jpg?height=546&width=637&top_left_y=1968&top_left_x=229}

2. Breathe with the diaphragm as described under "Diaphragmatic Breathing."
3. With your mouth slightly open, breathe in fully.
4. "Hack" out sharply for three short breaths.
5. Then, keeping your mouth open, take in a quick deep breath and immediately give a strong cough once or twice. This helps clear secretions from your chest. It may cause some discomfort but will not harm your incision.

\section*{Leg Exercises}
1. Lie in a semi-Fowler's position and perform the following simple exercises to improve circulation.
2. Bend your knee and raise your foot-hold it a few seconds, then extend the leg and lower it to the bed.

\begin{figure}

\section*{Turning to the Side}
1. Turn on your side with the uppermost leg flexed most and supported on a pillow.
2. Grasp the side rail as an aid to maneuver to the side.
3. Practice diaphragmatic breathing and coughing while on your side.

\section*{Getting Out of Bed}
1. Turn on your side.
2. Push yourself up with one hand as you swing your legs out of bed.
the patient is assisted and reminded to perform these exercises. Later, the patient is encouraged to do them independently. Muscle tone is maintained so that ambulation will be easier.

The nurse should remember to use proper body mechanics and to instruct the patient to do the same. Whenever the patient is positioned, his or her body needs to be properly aligned.

\section*{Pain Management}

An assessment should include a determination between acute and chronic pain so that the patient may differentiate postoperative pain from a chronic condition. It is at this point that a pain scale should be introduced and its use explained to the patient. Chapter 13 contains several examples of pain scales.

Postoperatively, medications are administered to relieve pain and maintain comfort without increasing the risk for inadequate air exchange. The patient is instructed to take the medication as frequently as prescribed during the initial postoperative period for pain relief. Anticipated methods of administration of analgesic agents for inpatients include patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), epidural catheter bolus or infusion, or patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). A patient who is expected to go home would receive oral analgesic agents. These are discussed with the patient before surgery, and the patient's interest and willingness to use those methods are assessed. The patient is instructed in use of a pain intensity rating scale to promote effective postoperative pain management.

\section*{Cognitive Coping Strategies}

Cognitive strategies may be useful for relieving tension, overcoming anxiety, decreasing fear, and achieving relaxation. Examples of such strategies include the following:
- Imagery-The patient concentrates on a pleasant experience or restful scene.
- Distraction-The patient thinks of an enjoyable story or recites a favorite poem or song.
- Optimistic self-recitation-The patient recites optimistic thoughts ("I know all will go well").

\section*{Instruction for Ambulatory Surgical Patients}

Preoperative education for the same-day or ambulatory surgical patient comprises all the material presented earlier in this chapter as well as collaborative planning with the patient and family for discharge and follow-up home care. The major difference in outpatient preoperative education is the teaching environment (Quinn, 1999).

Preoperative teaching content may be presented in a group meeting, on a videotape, during night classes, at preadmission testing, or by telephone in conjunction with the preoperative interview. In addition to answering questions and describing what to expect, the nurse tells the patient when and where to report, what to bring (insurance card, list of medications and allergies), what to leave at home (jewelry, watch, medications, contact lenses), and what to wear (loose-fitting, comfortable clothes; flat shoes). The nurse in the surgeon's office may initiate teaching before the perioperative telephone contact.

The last preoperative phone call is designed to remind the patient not to eat or drink as directed. A fasting period of 8 hours or more is recommended for a meal that includes fried or fatty foods or meat (Crenshaw, Winslow \& Jacobson, 1999). The anesthesiologist or anesthetist may restrict foods and fluids for
longer periods of time depending on the patient's fluid status, age, and pulmonary status and the nature of the surgical procedure.

The purpose of withholding food before surgery is to prevent aspiration. Aspiration occurs when food or fluid is regurgitated from the stomach and enters the pulmonary system. Such inhaled material, which is a foreign substance, is irritating and causes an inflammatory reaction that interferes with adequate air exchange. Aspiration is a serious problem, and mortality is high ( $60 \%$ to $70 \%)$. If the patient is assessed as being at high risk for aspiration, the anesthesiologist or anesthetist prescribes more stringent food and fluid restrictions. Fluids may be administered intravenously

\section*{Preoperative Easting guidelines}

Crenshaw, J., \& Winslow, E. (2002). Preoperative fasting: Old habits die hard. American Journal of Nursing, 102(5), 36-44.

\section*{Purpose}

In 1999 the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) made the "NPO after Midnight" rule obsolete with revised practice guidelines that support much more liberal preoperative fasting in healthy adults. This study sought to determine if these guidelines had changed preoperative fasting practices.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This was a descriptive study conducted in a 935-bed medical center in the United States. The center did not have a fasting policy. A convenience sample of 155 patients were interviewed about their preoperative fasting, comparing instructed, actual, and ASArecommended fasting durations for liquids and solids. A semistructured interview was used by trained staff nurses to collect the data. Subjects were all over 18 years old, admitted to the hospital from home for an elective, nonobstetric or nongastrointestinal surgery. All were in stable condition, had been without an IV infusion for more than 4 hours prior to surgery, were admitted to a noncritical care unit after surgery, and consented to participate. The patients all spoke and understood English; $87 \%$ were Caucasian, $7 \%$ were African American, and $9.6 \%$ were Hispanic, Asian, or of other ethnic origin.

\section*{Findings}

The patients interviewed fasted from liquids and solids for an average of 12 to 14 hours, with some patients fasting for as long as 20 hours from liquids and 37 hours from solid foods. Ninety-seven percent of the 155 patients fasted from liquids for more than 6 hours. Actual fasting durations were found (using paired t-tests) to be significantly longer than both the instructed fasting durations (mean 10 hours) and the ASA recommendations. Most patients ( $91 \%$ ) were instructed to maintain NPO status after midnight. A nurse participated in the preoperative fasting instruction with $63 \%$ of the patients. Almost half of the patients rated thirst and worry at a 5 on a 0 -to- 10 scale.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses are an important part of the surgical team and are involved in preoperative fasting instruction with the majority of patients. Therefore, they share the responsibility for recommending excessively long and unnecessary fasting for patients and for patients' lack of understanding of instructions demonstrated in this study. Clear and specific instructions must be given to patients about fasting time for liquids and solids. The rationale for the fasting should also be clearly explained. Patients should be warned that they will feel thirsty and should be taught strategies (as permitted) for coping with thirst, such as brushing teeth, rinsing the mouth, and chewing gum.
in some patients to ensure an adequate fluid volume when oral fluids are restricted.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS}

\section*{Reducing Preoperative Anxiety}

Cognitive strategies useful for reducing anxiety were addressed previously in this chapter. In addition to these strategies, music therapy is an easy-to-administer, inexpensive, noninvasive intervention that can reduce anxiety in the perioperative patient. The patient should be allowed to choose his or her own music and be provided with quiet uninterrupted listening time (White, 2000).

The general preoperative teaching addressed earlier in this section will also help decrease anxiety in many patients. Knowing ahead of time about the possible need for a ventilator, drainage tubes, or other types of equipment will help decrease anxiety in the postoperative period.

\section*{Decreasing Fear}

During the preoperative assessment the nurse should assist the patient to identify coping strategies that he or she has previously used to decrease fear. The patient benefits from knowing when family and friends will be able to visit after surgery and that a spiritual advisor will be available if desired. Research suggests that hypnosis may be a useful strategy for reducing fear and overcoming the anxiety associated with surgery (Hernandez \& Tatarunis, 2000).

\section*{Respecting Cultural, Spiritual, and Religious Beliefs}

Psychosocial interventions include identifying and showing respect for cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs. In some cultures, for example, individuals are stoic in regard to pain, whereas others are more expressive. These responses should be recognized as normal for those patients and families and respected by perioperative personnel. When patients decline blood transfusions for religious reasons (Jehovah's Witnesses), this information needs to be clearly identified in the preoperative period, documented, and communicated to the appropriate personnel.

\section*{GENERAL PREOPERATIVE NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

\section*{Managing Nutrition and Fluids}

The major purpose of withholding food and fluid before surgery is to prevent aspiration. However, studies demonstrate that in patients who do not have a compromised airway or coexisting diseases or disorders that affect gastric emptying or fluid volume (eg, pregnancy, obesity, diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux, enteral tube feeding, ileus or bowel obstruction), lengthy restriction of fluid and food is unnecessary (Crenshaw \& Winslow, 2002; Pandit, Loberg \& Pandit, 2000). Until recently, fluid and food were restricted preoperatively overnight and often longer. However, recent review of this practice by the American Society of Anesthesiologists has resulted in new recommendations for persons undergoing elective surgery who are otherwise healthy (ASA Task Force on Preoperative Fasting, 1999). The recommendations depend on the age of the patient and type of food eaten. For ex-
ample, adults are advised to fast for 8 hours after eating fatty food and 4 hours after ingesting milk products (Crenshaw, Winslow \& Jacobson, 1999; Crenshaw \& Winslow, 2002). Most patients are currently allowed clear liquids up to 2 hours before an elective procedure (Crenshaw \& Winslow, 2002).

\section*{Preparing the Bowel for Surgery}

Enemas are not commonly ordered preoperatively unless the patient is undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery. In this case, a cleansing enema or laxative may be prescribed the evening before surgery and may be repeated the morning of surgery. The goals of this preparation are to allow satisfactory visualization of the surgical site and to prevent trauma to the intestine or contamination of the peritoneum by feces. Unless the condition of the patient presents some contraindication, the toilet or bedside commode, rather than the bedpan, is used for evacuating the enema if the patient is hospitalized during this time. Additionally, antibiotics may be prescribed to reduce intestinal flora.

\section*{Preparing the Skin}

The goal of preoperative skin preparation is to decrease bacteria without injuring the skin. If the surgery is not performed as an emergency, the patient may be instructed to use a soap containing a detergent-germicide to cleanse the skin area for several days before surgery to reduce the number of skin organisms; this preparation may be carried out at home.

Generally, hair is not removed preoperatively unless the hair at or around the incision site is likely to interfere with the operation. If hair must be removed, electric clippers are used for safe hair removal immediately before the operation.

\section*{IMMEDIATE PREOPERATIVE NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The patient changes into a hospital gown that is left untied and open in the back. The patient with long hair may braid it, remove hairpins, and cover the head completely with a disposable paper cap.

The mouth is inspected, and dentures or plates are removed. If left in the mouth, these items could easily fall to the back of the throat during induction of anesthesia and cause respiratory obstruction.

Jewelry is not worn to the operating room; wedding rings and jewelry of body piercings should be removed to prevent injury (Fogg, 2001). If a patient objects to removing a ring, some institutions allow the ring to be securely fastened to the finger with tape. All articles of value, including assistive devices, dentures, glasses, and prosthetic devices, are given to family members or are labeled clearly with the patient's name and stored in a safe place according to the institution's policy.

All patients (except those with urologic disorders) should void immediately before going to the operating room to promote continence during low abdominal surgery and to make abdominal organs more accessible. Urinary catheterization is performed in the operating room as necessary.

\section*{Administering Preanesthetic Medication}

The use of preanesthetic medication is minimal with ambulatory or outpatient surgery. If prescribed, it is usually administered in the preoperative holding area. If a preanesthetic medication is
administered, the patient is kept in bed with the side rails raised because the medication can cause lightheadedness or drowsiness. During this time, the nurse observes the patient for any untoward reaction to the medications. The immediate surroundings are kept quiet to promote relaxation.

Often, surgery is delayed or operating room schedules are changed, and it becomes impossible to request that a medication be given at a specific time. In these situations, the preoperative medication is prescribed "on call from operating room." The nurse can have the medication ready to give and administer it as soon as a call is received from the operating room staff. It usually takes 15 to 20 minutes to prepare the patient for the operating room. If the nurse gives the medication before attending to the other details of preoperative preparation, the patient will have at least partial benefit from the preoperative medication and will have a smoother anesthetic and operative course.

\section*{Maintaining the Preoperative Record}

A preoperative checklist contains critical elements that need to be checked preoperatively (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). An example is shown in Figure 18-3. The completed chart accompanies the patient to the operating room with the surgical consent form attached, along with all laboratory reports and nurses' records. Any unusual last-minute observations that may have a bearing on anesthesia or surgery are noted at the front of the chart in a prominent place.

\section*{Transporting the Patient to the Presurgical Area}

The patient is transferred to the holding area or presurgical suite in a bed or on a stretcher about 30 to 60 minutes before the anesthetic is to be given. The stretcher should be as comfortable as possible, with a sufficient number of blankets to prevent
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-433.jpg?height=1500&width=1750&top_left_y=1017&top_left_x=211)
chilling in air-conditioned rooms. A small head pillow is usually provided.

The patient is taken to the preoperative holding area, greeted by name, and positioned comfortably on the stretcher or bed. The surrounding area should be kept quiet if the preoperative medication is to have maximal effect. Unpleasant sounds or conversation should be avoided because a sedated patient who overhears them might misinterpret them.

Patient safety in the preoperative area is a priority. Using a process to verify patient identification, the surgical procedure, and the surgical site maximizes patient safety and allows for early identification and intervention if any discrepancies are identified (Brown, Riippa \& Shaneberger, 2001).

NURSING ALERT It is important for someone to be with the preoperative patient at all times. Someone must be present to provide reassurance as well as to ensure safety. Facial expression, or the warm grasp of a hand can communicate reassurance nonverbally.

\section*{Attending to Family Needs}

Most hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers have a waiting room where the family and significant others can wait while the patient is undergoing surgery. This room may be equipped with comfortable chairs, television, telephones, and facilities for light refreshment. Volunteers may remain with the family, offer them coffee, and keep them informed of the patient's progress. After surgery, the surgeon may meet the family in the waiting room and discuss the outcome.

The family and significant others should never judge the seriousness of an operation by the length of time the patient is in the operating room. A patient may be in surgery much longer than the actual operating time for several reasons:
- Patients are routinely transported well in advance of the actual operating time.
- The anesthesiologist or anesthetist often makes additional preparations that may take 30 to 60 minutes.
- The surgeon may take longer than expected with the preceding case, which delays the start of the next surgical procedure.

After surgery, the patient is taken to the PACU to ensure safe emergence from anesthesia.

Family members and significant others waiting to see the patient after surgery should be informed that the patient may have certain equipment or devices (eg, intravenous lines, indwelling urinary catheter, nasogastric tube, oxygen lines, monitoring equipment, and blood transfusion lines) in place when he or she returns from surgery. When the patient returns to the room, the nurse provides explanations regarding the frequent postoperative observations that will be made. However, it is the responsibility of the surgeon, not the nurse, to relay the surgical findings and the prognosis, even when the findings are favorable.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: CARE OF THE PATIENT IN THE PREOPERATIVE PERIOD}

Preoperative assessment of the surgical patient involves evaluating the elements addressed in the previous section on the factors that affect the patient undergoing surgery. A variety of patient problems or nursing diagnoses can be anticipated or identified on the basis of the assessment data.

\section*{Assessment}

During the preoperative phase of care, nursing assessment usually addresses the following parameters:
- Physical condition, including respiratory, cardiac, and other major body systems as discussed earlier in this chapter
- Results of blood tests, x-ray studies, and other diagnostic tests
- Nutritional and fluid status
- Medication use, as previously described
- Psychological preparedness for surgery (anxiety, fear, spiritual and cultural beliefs)
- Special considerations, including the ambulatory surgery patient, gerontologic considerations, obesity, the patient with a disability, or the patient undergoing emergency surgery, as discussed earlier in this chapter

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major preoperative nursing diagnoses of the surgical patient may include the following:
- Anxiety related to the surgical experience (anesthesia, pain) and the outcome of surgery
- Fear related to perceived threat of the surgical procedure and separation from support system
- Knowledge deficit of preoperative procedures and protocols and postoperative expectations

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Failure to identify and communicate pertinent preoperative risk factors may lead to complications.

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the preoperative surgical patient may include relief of preoperative anxiety, decreased fear, increased knowledge of perioperative expectations, and absence of preoperative complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{REDUCING PREOPERATIVE ANXIETY}

Specific nursing interventions are discussed in detail under psychosocial interventions and preoperative teaching in the previous sections.

\section*{DECREASING FEAR}

Nursing management is discussed under psychosocial interventions in the previous section.

\section*{PROVIDING PATIENT EDUCATION}

Specific nursing interventions pertaining to preoperative patient education are discussed in detail in earlier sections of this chapter.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Nursing interventions to prevent preoperative complications include identification and documentation of factors that affect patients preparing to undergo surgery (discussed earlier in this chapter).

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES}

Expected patient outcomes may include:

\section*{1. Reports relief of anxiety}
a. Discusses with anesthesiologist or anesthetist concerns related to types of anesthesia and induction
b. Verbalizes an understanding of the preanesthetic medication and general anesthesia
c. Discusses last-minute concerns with nurse or physician
d. Discusses financial concerns with social worker, when appropriate
e. Requests visit with member of clergy when appropriate
f. Relaxes quietly after being visited by health care team members
2. Reports that fear is decreased
a. Discusses fears with health care professionals
b. Verbalizes an understanding of the location of family members or significant others during procedure
3. Voices understanding of surgical intervention
a. Participates in preoperative preparation
b. Demonstrates and describes exercises he or she is expected to perform postoperatively
c. Reviews information about postoperative care
d. Accepts preanesthetic medication, if prescribed
e. Remains in bed once premedicated
f. Relaxes during transportation to operating room or unit
g. States rationale for use of side rails
h. Discusses postoperative expectations
4. Shows no evidence of preoperative complications.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. During the preoperative assessment of a man scheduled for hand surgery in an ambulatory setting, you think that the patient's responses indicate that he does not understand the procedure and that he has not made plans for postoperative care. What further assessment and teaching is indicated? What nursing interventions are warranted?
2. A patient with a long history of the use of several herbal supplements is scheduled for major surgery. What effect would this information have on your preoperative care of this patient?
3. Two patients are admitted to the same-day surgery unit for bilateral knee replacements. One patient is a 30 -year-old who ambulates with crutches and the other is a 75-year-old who lives alone. How would your assessments, preoperative teaching, and preparation differ for these two patients?

\section*{Intraoperative Nursing Management}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the interdisciplinary approach to the care of the patient during surgery.
2. Describe the principles of surgical asepsis.
3. Describe various nursing roles as well as the role of the anesthesiologist or anesthetist in the intraoperative phase of care.
4. Identify adverse effects of surgery and anesthesia.
5. Identify the surgical risk factors related to age-specific populations and nursing interventions to reduce those risks.
6. Compare various types of anesthesia with regard to uses, advantages, disadvantages, and nursing responsibilities.
7. Identify the use of the nursing process for optimizing patient outcomes during the intraoperative period.

Anesthesia and surgery place the patient at risk for several complications or adverse events. Consciousness or full awareness, mobility, protective biologic functions, and personal control are totally or partially relinquished by the patient when entering the operating room. Staff from the departments of anesthesia, nursing, and surgery work collaboratively to implement professional standards of care, to control iatrogenic and individual risks, and to promote high-quality patient outcomes.

\section*{The SurgicalTeam}

The surgical team consists of the patient, the anesthesiologist or anesthetist, the surgeon, the intraoperative nurses, and the surgical technologists. The anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist administers the anesthetic agent and monitors the patient's physical status throughout the surgery. The surgeon and assistants scrub and perform the surgery. The individual in the scrub role, either a nurse or surgical technologist, provides sterile instruments and supplies to the surgeon during the procedure. The circulating nurse coordinates the care of the patient in the operating room. Care provided by the circulating nurse includes assisting with patient positioning, preparing the patient's skin for surgery, managing surgical specimens, and documenting intraoperative events.

\section*{THE PATIENT}

As the patient enters the operating room, he or she may feel relaxed and prepared, or fearful and highly stressed. These feelings depend very much on the amount and timing of preoperative sedation and the patient's level of fear and anxiety. Fears about loss of control, the unknown, pain, death, changes in body structure or function, and disruption of lifestyle all may contribute to a generalized anxiety. These fears can increase the amount of anesthetic needed, the level of postoperative pain, and overall recovery time.

The patient is also subject to several risks. Infection, failure of the surgery to relieve symptoms, temporary or permanent complications related to the procedure or the anesthetic, and death are uncommon but potential outcomes of the surgical experience (Chart 19-1). In addition to fears and risks, the patient undergoing sedation and anesthesia temporarily loses both cognitive function and biologic self-protective mechanisms. Loss of pain sense, reflexes, and ability to communicate subjects the intraoperative patient to possible injury.

Potential Adverse Effects of Surgery and Anesthesia

Anesthesia and surgery disrupt all major body systems. Although most patients can compensate for surgical trauma and the effects of anesthesia, all patients are at risk during the operative procedure. These risks include the following:
- Cardiac dysrhythmia from electrolyte imbalance or adverse effect of anesthetic agents
- Myocardial depression, bradycardia, and circulatory collapse from toxic levels of local anesthetics
- Central nervous system agitation, seizures, and respiratory arrest from toxic levels of local anesthetics
- Oversedation or undersedation during moderate sedation
- Agitation or disorientation, especially in elderly patients
- Hypoxemia or hypercarbia from hypoventilation and inadequate respiratory support during anesthesia
- Laryngeal trauma, oral trauma, and broken teeth from difficult intubation
- Hypothermia from cool operating room temperatures, exposure of body cavities, and impaired thermoregulation secondary to anesthetic agents
- Hypotension from blood loss or adverse effect of anesthesia
- Infection
- Thrombosis from compression of blood vessels or stasis
- Malignant hyperthermia secondary to adverse effect of anesthesia
- Nerve damage, skin breakdown from prolonged or inappropriate positioning
- Electrical shock or burns
- Laser burns
- Drug toxicity, faulty equipment, and human error

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Elderly patients face higher risks from anesthesia and surgery than younger adult patients (Polanczyk et al., 2001). Statistically, perioperative risk increases with each decade over 60 years, often because of the increased incidence of coexisting disease. Modifications tailored to the biologic changes of later life and the application of research findings for this population can reduce the risks.
anesthesia: a state of narcosis, analgesia, relaxation, and loss of reflexes
anesthesiologist: physician trained to deliver anesthesia and to monitor the patient's condition during surgery
anesthetic: the substance, such as a chemical or gas, used to induce anesthesia
anesthetist: health care professional, such as a nurse anesthetist, who is trained to deliver anesthesia and to monitor the patient's condition during surgery
circulating nurse (or circulator): registered nurse who coordinates and documents patient care in the operating room
moderate sedation: use of sedation to depress the level of consciousness without altering the patient's ability to maintain a patent airway and to respond to physical stimuli and verbal commands
restricted zone: area in the operating room where scrub attire and surgical masks are required; includes operating room and sterile core areas
scrub role: registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or surgical technologist who scrubs and dons sterile surgical attire, prepares instruments and supplies, and hands
instruments to the surgeon during the procedure
semirestricted zone: area in the operating room where scrub attire is required; may include areas where surgical instruments are processed
surgical asepsis: absence of microorganisms in the surgical environment to reduce the risk for infection
unrestricted zone: area in the operating room that interfaces with other departments; includes patient reception area and holding area

Biologic variations of particular importance include age-related cardiovascular and pulmonary changes (Townsend, 2002). The aging heart and blood vessels have decreased ability to respond to stress. Reduced cardiac output and limited cardiac reserve make the elderly patient vulnerable to changes in circulating volume and blood oxygen levels. Excessive or rapid administration of intravenous solutions may cause pulmonary edema. A sudden or prolonged drop in blood pressure may lead to cerebral ischemia, thrombosis, embolism, infarction, and anoxia. Reduced gas exchange can lead to cerebral hypoxia.

The elderly patient needs fewer anesthetics to produce anesthesia and eliminates the anesthetic agent over a longer time than a younger patient. As people age, the percentage of lean body tissue decreases and fatty tissue steadily increases (from age 20 years to 90 years). Anesthetic agents that have an affinity for fatty tissue concentrate in body fat and the brain (Dudek, 2001). Lower doses of anesthetic are appropriate for another reason. The older patient, particularly when malnourished, may have low plasma protein levels. With decreased plasma proteins, more of the anesthetic agent remains free or unbound, and the result is more potent action.

Also in elderly adults, body tissues made up predominantly of water and those with a rich blood supply, such as skeletal muscle, liver, and kidneys, shrink. Reduced liver size decreases the rate at which the liver can inactivate many anesthetics, whereas decreased kidney function slows elimination of waste products and anesthetics. Other factors affecting the elderly surgical patient in the intraoperative period include the following:
- Impaired ability to increase metabolic rate and impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms increase susceptibility to hypothermia.
- Bone loss ( $25 \%$ in women, $12 \%$ in men) necessitates careful manipulation and positioning during surgery.
- Reduced ability to adjust rapidly to emotional and physical stress influences surgical outcomes and requires meticulous observation of vital functions.

As expected, mortality is higher with emergency surgery (commonly required for traumatic injuries) than with elective surgery, making continuous and careful monitoring and prompt intervention especially important for older surgical patients (Phippen \& Wells, 2000).

\section*{Nursing Care}

Throughout surgery, nursing responsibilities include providing for the safety and well-being of the patient, coordinating the operating room personnel, and performing scrub and circulating activities. Because the patient's emotional state remains a concern, the care begun by preoperative nurses is continued by the intraoperative nursing staff, who provide the patient with information and realistic reassurance. The nurse supports coping strategies and reinforces the patient's ability to influence outcomes by encouraging his or her active participation in the plan of care.

In the role of patient advocate, intraoperative nurses monitor factors that can cause injury, such as patient position, equipment malfunction, and environmental hazards, and they protect patients' dignity and interests while they are anesthetized. Additional responsibilities include maintaining surgical standards of care, identifying existing patient risk factors, and assisting in modifying complicating factors to help reduce operative risk (Phippen \& Wells, 2000).

\section*{THE CIRCULATING NURSE}

The circulating nurse (also known as the circulator) must be a registered nurse. He or she manages the operating room and protects the patient's safety and health by monitoring the activities of the surgical team, checking the operating room conditions, and continually assessing the patient for signs of injury and implementing appropriate interventions. The main responsibilities include verifying consent, coordinating the team, and ensuring cleanliness, proper temperature, humidity, and lighting; the safe functioning of equipment; and the availability of supplies and materials. The circulating nurse monitors aseptic practices to avoid breaks in technique while coordinating the movement of related personnel (medical, radiography, and laboratory) as well as implementing fire safety precautions (Phippen \& Wells, 2000). The circulating nurse monitors the patient and documents specific activities throughout the operation to ensure the patient's safety and well-being. Nursing activities directly relate to preventing complications and achieving optimal patient outcomes.

\section*{THE SCRUB ROLE}

Activities of the scrub role include performing a surgical hand scrub; setting up the sterile tables; preparing sutures, ligatures, and special equipment (such as a laparoscope); and assisting the surgeon and the surgical assistants during the procedure by anticipating the instruments that will be required, such as sponges, drains, and other equipment (Phippen \& Wells, 2000). As the surgical incision is closed, the scrub person and the circulator count all needles, sponges, and instruments to be sure they are accounted for and not retained as a foreign body in the patient. Tissue specimens obtained during surgery must also be labeled by the scrub person and sent to the laboratory by the circulator.

\section*{THE SURGEON}

The surgeon performs the surgical procedure and heads the surgical team. He or she is a licensed physician (MD), osteopath (DO), oral surgeon (DDS or DMD), or podiatrist (DPM) who is specially trained and qualified. Qualifications may include certification by a specialty board, adherence to Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards, and adherence to hospital standards and admitting practices and procedures (Fortunato, 2000).

\section*{THE REGISTERED NURSE FIRST ASSISTANT}

The registered nurse first assistant (RNFA) is another member of the operating room staff. Although the scope of practice of the RNFA depends on each state's nurse practice act, the RNFA practices under the direct supervision of the surgeon. RNFA responsibilities may include handling tissue, providing exposure at the operative field, suturing, and providing hemostasis. The entire process requires a thorough understanding of anatomy and physiology, tissue handling, and the principles of surgical asepsis. The competent RNFA needs to be aware of the objectives of the surgery, needs to have the knowledge and ability to anticipate needs and to work as a skilled member of a team, and needs to be able to handle any emergency situation in the operating room (Fortunato, 2000; Rothrock, 1999).

\section*{THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST AND ANESTHETIST}

An anesthesiologist is a physician specifically trained in the art and science of anesthesiology. An anesthetist is a qualified health care professional who administers anesthetics. Most anesthetists are nurses who have graduated from an accredited nurse anesthesia program and have passed examinations sponsored by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists to become a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA). The anesthesiologist or anesthetist interviews and assesses the patient prior to surgery, selects the anesthesia, administers it, intubates the patient if necessary, manages any technical problems related to the administration of the anesthetic agent, and supervises the patient's condition throughout the surgical procedure. Before the patient enters the operating room, often at preadmission testing, the anesthesiologist or anesthetist visits the patient to provide information and answer questions. The type of anesthetic to be administered, previous reactions to anesthetics, and known anatomic abnormalities that would make airway management difficult are discussed. The anesthesiologist or anesthetist uses the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification System to determine the patient's status (Chart 19-2).

When the patient arrives in the operating room, the anesthesiologist or anesthetist reassesses the patient's physical condition immediately prior to initiating anesthesia. The anesthetic is administered, and the patient's airway is maintained either through a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or an endotracheal tube. During surgery, the anesthesiologist or anesthetist monitors the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and respirations as well as the electrocardiogram (ECG), blood oxygen saturation level, tidal volume, blood gas levels, blood pH, alveolar gas concentrations, and body temperature. Monitoring by electroencephalography is some-

\section*{American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System}

Anesthetists and anesthesiologists use the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical (P) Status Classification System to describe the patient's general status and identify potential risks during surgery. There are five classes of physical status.
- P 1. A normally healthy patient

Example: No systemic abnormality, localized infection without fever, benign tumor, hernia
- P 2. A patient with mild systemic disease

Example: Well-controlled hypertension, well-controlled diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, obesity, age over 80 yr
- P 3. A patient with severe systemic disease that is not incapacitating
Example: Severe disease, compensated heart failure, myocardial infarction more than 6 mo ago, angina pectoris, severe dysrhythmia, cirrhosis, poorly controlled diabetes or hypertension, ileus
- P 4. A patient with an incapacitating systemic disease that is a constant threat to life
Example: Severe heart failure, myocardial infarction less than 6 mo ago, severe respiratory failure, advanced liver or renal failure
- P 5. A moribund patient who is not expected to survive for 24 hours with or without operation
Example: Unconscious patient with traumatic head injury and agonal cardiac rhythm
times required. Levels of anesthetics in the body can also be determined; a mass spectrometer can provide instant readouts of critical concentration levels on display terminals. The device also assesses the patient's ability to breathe unassisted and indicates the need for mechanical assistance when ventilation is poor and the patient is not breathing well independently.

\section*{The Surgical Environment}

The surgical environment is known for its stark appearance and cool temperature. The surgical suite is behind double doors, and access is limited to authorized personnel. External precautions include adhering to principles of surgical asepsis; strict control of the operating room (OR) environment is required, including traffic pattern restrictions. Policies governing this environment address such issues as the health of the staff; the cleanliness of the rooms; the sterility of equipment and surfaces; processes for scrubbing, gowning, and gloving; and OR attire.

To provide the best possible conditions for surgery, the OR is situated in a location that is central to all supporting services (eg, pathology, radiology, laboratory). The OR has special air filtration devices to screen out contaminating particles, dust, and pollutants. The temperature, humidity, and airflow patterns are controlled (Meeker et al., 1999).

Electrical hazards, emergency exit clearances, and storage of equipment and anesthetic gases are monitored periodically by official entities, such as state agencies and JCAHO. To help decrease microbes, the surgical area is divided into three zones: the unrestricted zone, where street clothes are allowed; the semirestricted zone, where attire consists of scrub clothes and caps; and the restricted zone, where scrub clothes, shoe covers, caps, and masks are worn. The surgeons and other surgical team members wear additional sterile clothing and protective devices during the operation.

The Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses, formerly known as the Association of Operating Room Nurses (and still abbreviated as AORN), recommends specific practices for those wearing surgical attire to promote a high level of cleanliness in a particular practice setting (AORN, 2002). OR attire includes close-fitting cotton dresses, pantsuits, jumpsuits, and gowns. Knitted cuffs on sleeves and pant legs prevent organisms shed from the perineum, legs, and arms from being released into the immediate surroundings. Shirts and waist drawstrings should be tucked inside the pants to prevent accidental contact with sterile areas and to contain skin shedding. Wet or soiled garments should be changed.

Masks are worn at all times in the restricted zone of the OR. High-filtration masks decrease the risk for postoperative wound infection by containing and filtering microorganisms from the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Masks should fit tightly, should cover the nose and mouth completely, and should not interfere with breathing, speech, or vision. Masks must be adjusted to prevent venting from the sides. Disposable masks have a filtration efficiency exceeding 95\%. Masks are changed between patients and should not be worn outside the surgical department. The mask must be either on or off; it must not be allowed to hang around the neck.

Headgear should completely cover the hair (head and neckline, including beard) so that single strands of hair, bobby pins, clips, and particles of dandruff or dust do not fall on the sterile field.

Shoes should be comfortable and supportive. Shoes worn in from the outside must be covered with disposable shoe covers for protection from soiling. Shoe covers are worn one time only and are removed upon leaving the restricted area.

Barriers such as scrub attire and masks do not entirely protect the patient from microorganisms. Upper respiratory tract infections, sore throats, and skin infections in staff and patients are sources of pathogens and must be reported.

1NURSING ALERT Good health is essential for any person in the OR, and any perioperative team member with an infectious disease (eg, an upper respiratory tract infection or infected skin lesion) should not have direct patient contact. Until the infectious process has resolved, the perioperative team member should not work in the OR.

Because artificial fingernails harbor microorganisms and may cause nosocomial infections (Winslow \& Jacobson, 2000), a ban on artificial nails by OR personnel is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), AORN, and the Association of Professionals in Infection Control. Short, natural fingernails are encouraged (Winslow \& Jacobson, 2000).

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL ASEPSIS}

Surgical asepsis prevents the contamination of surgical wounds. The patient's natural skin flora or a previously existing infection may cause postoperative wound infection. Rigorous adherence to the principles of surgical asepsis by OR personnel is the foundation of preventing surgical site infections.

All surgical supplies, any instruments, needles, sutures, dressings, gloves, covers, and solutions that may come in contact with the surgical wound and exposed tissues, must be sterilized before use (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999; Townsend, 2002). Traditionally, the surgeon, surgical assistants, and nurses prepared themselves by scrubbing their hands and arms with antiseptic soap and water, but this traditional practice is being challenged by research investigating the optimal length of time to scrub and the best preparation to use (Larsen et al., 2001). (See Nursing Research Profile 19-1.)

Surgical team members wear long-sleeved sterile gowns and gloves. Head and hair are covered with a cap, and a mask is worn
over the nose and mouth to minimize the possibility that bacteria from the upper respiratory tract will enter the wound. During surgery, the personnel who have scrubbed, gloved, and gowned touch only sterilized objects. Nonscrubbed personnel refrain from touching or contaminating anything sterile.

An area of the patient's skin considerably larger than that requiring exposure during the surgery is meticulously cleansed, and an antimicrobial agent is applied. If hair needs to be removed, it is done immediately prior to the procedure to minimize the risk of wound infection (Townsend, 2002). The remainder of the patient's body is covered with sterile drapes.

\section*{Environmental Controls}

In addition to the protocols described previously, surgical asepsis requires meticulous cleaning and maintenance of the OR environment. Floors and horizontal surfaces are cleaned frequently with detergent, soap, and water, or a detergent germicide. Sterilizing equipment is inspected regularly to ensure optimal operation and performance.

All equipment that comes into direct contact with the patient must be sterile (Townsend, 2002). Sterilized linens, drapes, and solutions are used. Instruments are cleaned and sterilized in a unit near the operating room. Individually wrapped sterile items are used when additional individual items are needed.

Airborne bacteria are a concern. To decrease the amount of bacteria in the air, standard OR ventilation provides 15 air exchanges per hour (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Staff members shed skin scales, resulting in about 1,000 bacteria-carrying particles (or colony-forming units [CFUs]) per cubic foot per minute. With the standard air exchanges, air counts of bacteria are reduced to 50 to 150 CFUs per cubic foot per minute. The number of personnel and unnecessary physical movements may be restricted to minimize bacteria in the air and achieve an OR infection rate no greater than $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ in clean, infection-prone surgery.

Larsen, E., Aiello, A., Heilman, J., Lyle, C., Cronquist, A., Stahl, J., \& Dello-Latta, P. (2001). Comparison of different regimens for surgical hand preparation. AORN Journal, 73(2), 412-432.

\section*{Purpose}

Staff members traditionally perform a lengthy regimen of scrubbing with an antiseptic agent before surgery, mostly due to concerns about reducing the risk for infection. The purpose of this study was to compare the traditional scrubbing technique in the operating room to a waterless hand preparation in terms of antimicrobial effectiveness, effect on skin condition, and time requirements.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This was a 6-week, single-center, prospective clinical trial. Twenty surgical staff members used the waterless hand preparation for 3 weeks, had a 1-week hiatus, then used the traditional surgical scrub for 3 consecutive weeks. A reference group of five subjects was also included in the study, which was conducted at a 2,000-bed medical center in three operating suites. The participants were full-time surgical staff members who performed an average of at least 10 scrubs per week and ranged in age from 18 to 65 years of age. The three tools used to measure skin condition consisted of the visual scoring of skin, erythema grading scale, and the hand skin assessment. A total
of 13 microbial skin counts were taken of each subject's hands during the study.

\section*{Findings}

The waterless hand preparation was associated with less skin damage and lower microbial skin counts on days 5 and 19 compared to the traditional scrub. The researchers suggest that a lengthy scrub, as well as the use of a brush or sponge, appears to be counterproductive, causing skin damage and increased skin shedding. The waterless hand preparation protocol had shorter contact time (mean 80.7 seconds) compared to the traditional protocol (mean 145 seconds) and was preferred by the participants. They reported that it was easier, faster, milder on the hands, and conducive to donning gloves.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

The waterless hand preparation performed better compared to the traditional surgical scrub, but nurses should keep in mind that this was a small study. The results of this study warrant evaluation of this new technique in a larger clinical trial before consideration for widespread implementation.

Some ORs have laminar airflow units. These units provide 400 to 500 air exchanges per hour. When used appropriately, laminar airflow units result in less than 10 CFUs per cubic foot per minute during surgery. The goal for a laminar flow-equipped OR is an infection rate under $1 \%$. An OR equipped with this unit is frequently used for total joint replacement or organ transplant surgery.

Despite all these precautions, wound contamination may occur during surgery but may only become apparent days or weeks later in the form of an incisional infection or abscess. Constant surveillance and conscientious technique in carrying out aseptic practices is necessary to reduce the risk for contamination and infection.

\section*{Basic Guidelines for Maintaining Surgical Asepsis}

All practitioners involved in the intraoperative phase have a responsibility to provide and maintain a safe environment. Adherence to aseptic practice is part of this responsibility. The eight basic principles of aseptic technique follow:
- All materials in contact with the surgical wound and used within the sterile field must be sterile. Sterile surfaces or articles may touch other sterile surfaces or articles and remain sterile; contact with unsterile objects at any point renders a sterile area contaminated.
- Gowns of the surgical team are considered sterile in front from the chest to the level of the sterile field. The sleeves are also considered sterile from 2 inches above the elbow to the stockinette cuff.
- Sterile drapes are used to create a sterile field. Only the top surface of a draped table is considered sterile. During draping of a table or patient, the sterile drape is held well above the surface to be covered and is positioned from front to back.
- Items should be dispensed to a sterile field by methods that preserve the sterility of the items and the integrity of the sterile field. After a sterile package is opened, the edges are considered unsterile. Sterile supplies, including solutions, are delivered to a sterile field or handed to a scrubbed person in such a way that the sterility of the object or fluid remains intact.
- The movements of the surgical team are from sterile to sterile areas and from unsterile to unsterile areas. Scrubbed persons and sterile items contact only sterile areas; circulating nurses and unsterile items contact only unsterile areas.
- Movement around a sterile field must not cause contamination of the field. Sterile areas must be kept in view during movement around the area. At least a 1 -foot distance from the sterile field must be maintained to prevent inadvertent contamination.
- Whenever a sterile barrier is breached, the area must be considered contaminated. A tear or puncture of the drape permitting access to an unsterile surface underneath renders the area unsterile. Such a drape must be replaced.
- Every sterile field should be constantly monitored and maintained. Items of doubtful sterility are considered unsterile. Sterile fields should be prepared as close as possible to the time of use.

\section*{HEALTH HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURGICAL ENVIRONMENT}

Safety issues in the OR include exposure to blood and body fluids, hazards associated with laser beams, and exposure to latex, radiation, and toxic agents. Internal monitoring of the OR includes
the analysis of surface swipe samples and air samples for infectious and toxic agents. In addition, policies and procedures for minimizing exposure to body fluids and reducing the dangers associated with lasers and radiation have been established.

\section*{Laser Risks}

The AORN has recommended practices for laser safety (AORN, 2002). While lasers are in use, warning signs should be clearly posted to alert personnel. Among the safety issues are the following: reducing the possibility of exposing the eyes and skin to laser beams, preventing inhalation of the laser plume (smoke and particulate matter), and protecting the patient and personnel from fire and electrical hazards. Because several types of lasers are available for clinical use, perioperative personnel should be familiar with the unique features, specific operation, and safety measures for each type of laser used in the practice setting (Townsend, 2002).

Nurses and other intraoperative personnel working with lasers must have a thorough eye examination before participating in procedures involving lasers. Special protective goggles, specific to the type of laser used in the procedure, are worn. There is controversy about the protection needed to avoid the laser plume and effects of its inhalation. Smoke evacuators are used in some procedures to remove the laser plume from the operative field. In recent years this technology has been applied to protect the surgical team from the hazards associated with the generalized smoke plume generated by standard electrocautery units.

\section*{Exposure to Blood and Body Fluids}

Since the advent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, OR attire has changed dramatically. Double gloving is routine, at least in trauma surgery where sharp bone fragments are present. In addition to the routine scrub suit and double gloves, some surgeons wear rubber boots, a waterproof apron, and sleeve protectors. Goggles, or a wrap-around face shield, are worn to protect against splashing when the surgical wound is irrigated or when bone drilling is performed. In hospitals where numerous total joint procedures are performed, a full bubble mask may be used. This mask provides full barrier protection from bone fragments and splashes. Safe ventilation is accomplished through an accompanying hood with a separate air-filtration system.

\section*{Latex Allergy}

Both the AORN and the American Society of Perianesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) have recommended standards of care for the patient with latex allergy (AORN, 2002; ASPAN, 2000). These recommendations include early identification of the patient with a latex allergy, preparation of a latex allergy supply cart, and maintenance of latex allergy precautions throughout the perioperative period. Due to the increased number of patients with latex allergies, many latex-free products are now available. For safety, manufacturers and hospital material managers need to take responsibility for identifying the latex content in items used by patients and health care personnel. (see Chaps. 18 and 53 for assessment for latex allergy).

NURSING ALERT It is the responsibility of all nurses, and particularly perianesthesia and perioperative nurses, to be aware of latex allergies, necessary precautions, and products that are latex-free (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Hospital staff are also at risk for developing a latex allergy secondary to repeated exposure to latex products.

\section*{The Surgical Experience}

During the surgical procedure, the patient will need sedation, anesthesia, or a combination of these.

\section*{SEDATION AND ANESTHESIA}

Sedation and anesthesia have four levels: minimal sedation, moderate sedation, deep sedation, and anesthesia. Standards of care for each level have been set by JCAHO. A surgical procedure may also be performed using anesthetic agents that suspend sensation in parts of the body (local, regional, epidural, or spinal anesthesia).

For the patient, the anesthesia experience consists of having an intravenous line inserted, if it was not inserted earlier; receiving a sedating agent prior to induction with an anesthetic agent; losing consciousness; being intubated, if indicated; and then receiving a combination of anesthetic agents. Typically the experience is a smooth one and the patient has no recall of the events.

\section*{Minimal Sedation}

The minimal sedation level is a drug-induced state during which the patient can respond normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, but ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are not affected (JCAHO, 2001; Patterson, 2000a, b).

\section*{Moderate Sedation}

Moderate sedation is a form of anesthesia that may be produced intravenously. It is defined as a depressed level of consciousness that does not impair the patient's ability to maintain a patent airway and to respond appropriately to physical stimulation and verbal command. Its goal is a calm, tranquil, amnesic patient who, when sedation is combined with analgesic agents, is relatively pain-free during the procedure but able to maintain protective reflexes (JCAHO, 2001; Patterson, 2000a, b). Sedation can be administered by an anesthesiologist, anesthetist, other physician, or nurse. When administered by an anesthesiologist or anesthetist, moderate sedation is referred to as monitored anesthesia care. The medications permitted for use in moderate sedation vary with the credentials of the person administering the sedative. In addition, state departments of health are very specific about who may administer moderate sedation and about the training required for those individuals. These regulations vary greatly from state to state.

Midazolam (Versed) or diazepam (Valium) is used frequently for intravenous sedation. In some states, the physician must administer the first dose; a nurse with special training can administer subsequent doses. Other medications used include analgesic agents (eg, morphine, fentanyl) and reversal agonists, such as naloxone (Narcan). A nurse who is knowledgeable and skilled in detecting dysrhythmias, administering oxygen, and performing resuscitation must continuously monitor the patient who receives sedation. The patient receiving this form of anesthesia is never left alone and is closely monitored for respiratory, cardiovascular, and central nervous system depression using such methods as pulse oximetry, ECG, and frequent measurement of vital signs (Patterson, 2000a, b). The level of sedation is monitored by the patient's ability to maintain a patent airway and to respond to verbal commands.

Moderate sedation may be used alone or in combination with local, regional, or spinal anesthesia. Its use is increasing as more surgical procedures and diagnostic studies are performed in am-
bulatory and same-day settings with the expectation that the patient will be discharged home a few hours after the procedure.

\section*{Deep Sedation}

Deep sedation is a drug-induced state during which a patient cannot be easily aroused but can respond purposefully after repeated stimulation (JCAHO, 2001). The difference between deep sedation and anesthesia is that the anesthetized patient is not arousable. Deep sedation and anesthesia are achieved when an anesthetic agent is inhaled or administered intravenously. Inhaled anesthetic agents include volatile liquid agents and gases (Aranda \& Hanson, 2000; Townsend, 2002). Volatile liquid anesthetics produce anesthesia when their vapors are inhaled. Included in this group are halothane (Fluothane), enflurane (Ethrane), isoflurane (Forane), sevoflurane (Ultrane), and desflurane (Suprane). All are administered with oxygen, and usually with nitrous oxide as well.

Gas anesthetics are administered by inhalation and are always combined with oxygen. Nitrous oxide is the most commonly used gas anesthetic. When inhaled, the anesthetics enter the blood through the pulmonary capillaries and act on cerebral centers to produce loss of consciousness and sensation. When anesthetic administration is discontinued, the vapor or gas is eliminated through the lungs. Table 19-1 lists the advantages, disadvantages, and implications of the different volatile liquid and gas anesthetics.

\section*{Anesthesia}

General anesthesia consists of four stages, each associated with specific clinical manifestations. When opioid agents (narcotics) and neuromuscular blockers (relaxants) are administered, several of the stages are absent. The anesthesia level consists of general anesthesia and spinal or major regional anesthesia but does not include local anesthesia (JCAHO, 2001). Anesthesia is a state of narcosis (severe central nervous system depression produced by pharmacologic agents), analgesia, relaxation, and reflex loss. Patients under general anesthesia are not arousable, even to painful stimuli. They lose the ability to maintain ventilatory function and require assistance in maintaining a patent airway. Cardiovascular function may be impaired as well (JCAHO, 2001).

\section*{STAGE I: BEGINNING ANESTHESIA}

As the patient breathes in the anesthetic mixture, warmth, dizziness, and a feeling of detachment may be experienced. The patient may have a ringing, roaring, or buzzing in the ears and, though still conscious, may sense an inability to move the extremities easily. During this stage, noises are exaggerated; even low voices or minor sounds seem loud and unreal. For this reason, the nurse avoids making unnecessary noises or motions when anesthesia begins.

\section*{STAGE II: EXCITEMENT}

The excitement stage, characterized variously by struggling, shouting, talking, singing, laughing, or crying, is often avoided if the anesthetic is administered smoothly and quickly. The pupils dilate, but contract if exposed to light; the pulse rate is rapid, and respirations may be irregular.

Because of the possibility of uncontrolled movements of the patient during this stage, the anesthesiologist or anesthetist must always be assisted by someone ready to help restrain the patient. A strap may be in place across the patient's thighs, and the hands may be secured to an armboard. The patient should not be touched except for purposes of restraint, but restraints should not be applied over the operative site. Manipulation increases circulation to the operative site and thereby increases the potential for bleeding.

\section*{STAGE III: SURGICAL ANESTHESIA}

Surgical anesthesia is reached by continued administration of the anesthetic vapor or gas. The patient is unconscious and lies quietly on the table. The pupils are small but contract when exposed to light. Respirations are regular, the pulse rate and volume are normal, and the skin is pink or slightly flushed. With proper administration of the anesthetic, this stage may be maintained for hours in one of several planes, ranging from light (1) to deep (4), depending on the depth of anesthesia needed.

\section*{STAGE IV: MEDULLARY DEPRESSION}

This stage is reached when too much anesthesia has been administered. Respirations become shallow, the pulse is weak and thready, and the pupils become widely dilated and no longer contract when exposed to light. Cyanosis develops and, without prompt intervention, death rapidly follows. If this stage develops, the anesthetic is discontinued immediately and respiratory and circulatory support is initiated to prevent death. Stimulants,
although rarely used, may be administered; narcotic antagonists can be used if overdosage is due to opioids.

During smooth administration of an anesthetic, there is no sharp division between the first three stages, and there is no stage IV. The patient passes gradually from one stage to another, and it is only by close observation of the signs exhibited by the patient that an anesthesiologist or anesthetist can control the situation. The responses of the pupils, the blood pressure, and the respiratory and cardiac rates are probably the most reliable guides to the patient's condition.

\section*{METHODS OF ANESTHESIA ADMINISTRATION}

Anesthetics produce anesthesia because they are delivered to the brain at a high partial pressure that enables them to cross the blood-brain barrier. Relatively large amounts of anesthetic must be administered during induction and the early maintenance
phases because the anesthetic is recirculated and deposited in body tissues. As these sites become saturated, smaller amounts of the anesthetic agent are required to maintain anesthesia because equilibrium or near equilibrium has been achieved between brain, blood, and other tissues.

Anything that diminishes peripheral blood flow, such as vasoconstriction or shock, may reduce the amount of anesthetic required. Conversely, when peripheral blood flow is unusually high, as in the muscularly active or the apprehensive patient, induction is slower and greater quantities of anesthetic are required because the brain receives a smaller quantity of anesthetic.

\section*{Inhalation}

Liquid anesthetics may be administered by mixing the vapors with oxygen or nitrous oxide-oxygen and then having the patient inhale the mixture (Townsend, 2002). The vapor is administered to the patient through a tube or a mask. The inhalation anesthetic may also be administered through a laryngeal mask (Fig. 19-1), a flexible tube with an inflatable silicone ring and cuff that can be inserted into the larynx (Fortunato, 2000). The endotracheal technique for administering anesthetics consists of introducing a soft rubber or plastic endotracheal tube into the trachea, usually by means of a laryngoscope. The endotracheal tube may be inserted through either the nose or mouth. When in place, the tube seals off the lungs from the esophagus so that if the patient vomits, stomach contents do not enter the lungs.

\section*{Intravenous}

General anesthesia can also be produced by the intravenous injection of various substances, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, dissociative agents, and opioid agents (Aranda \& Hanson, 2000; Townsend, 2002). These medications may be administered for induction (initiation) or maintenance of anesthesia. They are often used along with inhalation anesthetics but may be used alone. They can also be used to produce moderate sedation. Intravenous anesthetics are presented in Table 19-2.

An advantage of intravenous anesthesia is that the onset of anesthesia is pleasant; there is none of the buzzing, roaring, or dizziness known to follow administration of an inhalation anes-
thetic. For this reason, induction of anesthesia usually begins with an intravenous agent and is often preferred by patients who have experienced various methods. The duration of action is brief, and the patient awakens with little nausea or vomiting. Thiopental is usually the agent of choice, and it is often administered with other anesthetic agents in prolonged procedures.

Intravenous anesthetic agents are nonexplosive, they require little equipment, and they are easy to administer. The low incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting makes the method useful in eye surgery because vomiting would increase intraocular pressure and endanger vision in the operated eye. Intravenous anesthesia is useful for short procedures but is used less often for the longer procedures of abdominal surgery. It is not indicated for children, who have small veins and require intubation because of their susceptibility to respiratory obstruction.

A disadvantage of an intravenous anesthetic such as thiopental is its powerful respiratory depressant effect. It must be administered by a skilled anesthesiologist or anesthetist and only when some method of oxygen administration is available immediately in case of difficulty. Sneezing, coughing, and laryngospasm are sometimes noted with its use.

Intravenous neuromuscular blockers (muscle relaxants) block the transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles. Muscle relaxants are used to relax muscles in abdominal and thoracic surgery, relax eye muscles in certain types of eye surgery, facilitate endotracheal intubation, treat laryngospasm, and assist in mechanical ventilation.

Purified curare was the first widely used muscle relaxant; tubocurarine was isolated as the active ingredient. Succinylcholine was later introduced because it acts more rapidly than curare. Several other agents are also used (Table 19-3). The ideal muscle relaxant has the following characteristics:
- It is nondepolarizing (noncompetitive agent), with an onset and duration of action similar to succinylcholine but without its problems of bradycardia and cardiac dysrhythmias (Townsend, 2002).
- It has a duration of action between those of succinylcholine and pancuronium.
- It lacks cumulative and cardiovascular effects.
- It can be metabolized and does not depend on the kidneys for its elimination.

\section*{Regional Anesthesia}

Regional anesthesia is a form of local anesthesia in which an anesthetic agent is injected around nerves so that the area supplied by these nerves is anesthetized. The effect depends on the type of nerve involved. Motor fibers are the largest fibers and have the thickest myelin sheath. Sympathetic fibers are the smallest and have a minimal covering. Sensory fibers are intermediate. Thus, a local anesthetic blocks motor nerves least readily and sympathetic nerves most readily. An anesthetic cannot be regarded as having worn off until all three systems (motor, sensory, and autonomic) are no longer affected.

The patient receiving spinal or local anesthesia is awake and aware of his or her surroundings unless medications are given to produce mild sedation or to relieve anxiety. The nurse must avoid careless conversation, unnecessary noise, and unpleasant odors; these may be noticed by the patient in the OR and may contribute to a negative view of the surgical experience. A quiet environment is therapeutic. The diagnosis must not be stated aloud if the patient is not to know it at this time.

\section*{Conduction Blocks and Spinal Anesthesia}

There are many types of conduction blocks, depending on the nerve groups affected by the injection. Epidural anesthesia is achieved by injecting a local anesthetic into the spinal canal in the space surrounding the dura mater (Fig. 19-2). Epidural anesthesia also blocks sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, but it is differentiated from spinal anesthesia by the injection site and the amount of anesthetic used. Epidural doses are much higher because the epidural anesthetic does not make direct contact with the cord or nerve roots.

An advantage of epidural anesthesia is the absence of headache that occasionally results from subarachnoid injection. A dis-
advantage is the greater technical challenge of introducing the anesthetic into the epidural rather than the subarachnoid space. If inadvertent subarachnoid injection occurs during epidural anesthesia and the anesthetic travels toward the head, high spinal anesthesia can result; this can produce severe hypotension and respiratory depression and arrest. Treatment of these complications includes airway support, intravenous fluids, and use of vasopressors. Other types of nerve blocks include:
- Brachial plexus block, which produces anesthesia of the arm
- Paravertebral anesthesia, which produces anesthesia of the nerves supplying the chest, abdominal wall, and extremities
- Transsacral (caudal) block, which produces anesthesia of the perineum and, occasionally, the lower abdomen

Spinal anesthesia is a type of extensive conduction nerve block that is produced when a local anesthetic is introduced into the subarachnoid space at the lumbar level, usually between L4 and L5 (see Fig. 19-2). It produces anesthesia of the lower extremities, perineum, and lower abdomen. For the lumbar puncture procedure, the patient usually lies on the side in a knee-chest position. Sterile technique is used as a spinal puncture is made and the medication is injected through the needle. As soon as the injection has been made, the patient is positioned on his or her back. If a relatively high level of block is sought, the head and shoulders are lowered.

The spread of the anesthetic agent and the level of anesthesia depend on the amount of fluid injected, the speed with which it is injected, the positioning of the patient after the injection, and the specific gravity of the agent. If the specific gravity is greater than that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the agent moves to the dependent position of the subarachnoid space. If the specific gravity is less than that of CSF, the anesthetic moves away from the dependent position. The anesthesiologist or anesthetist controls the spread of the agent. Generally, the agents used are procaine,

tetracaine (Pontocaine), lidocaine (Xylocaine), and bupivacaine (Marcaine) (Table 19-4).

A few minutes after induction of a spinal anesthetic, anesthesia and paralysis affect the toes and perineum and then gradually the legs and abdomen. If the anesthetic reaches the upper thoracic and cervical spinal cord in high concentrations, a temporary partial or complete respiratory paralysis results. Paralysis of the respiratory muscles is managed by mechanical ventilation until the effects of the anesthetic on the respiratory nerves have worn off.

Nausea, vomiting, and pain may occur during surgery when spinal anesthesia is used. As a rule, these reactions result from manipulation of various structures, particularly those within the abdominal cavity. The simultaneous intravenous administration of a weak solution of thiopental and inhalation of nitrous oxide may prevent such reactions.

Headache may be an after-effect of spinal anesthesia. Several factors are involved in the incidence of headache: the size of the spinal needle used, the leakage of fluid from the subarachnoid space through the puncture site, and the patient's hydration status. Measures that increase cerebrospinal pressure are helpful in
relieving headache. These include keeping the patient lying flat, quiet, and well hydrated.

In continuous spinal anesthesia, the tip of a plastic catheter remains in the subarachnoid space during the surgical procedure so that more anesthetics may be injected as needed. This technique allows greater control of the dosage, but there is greater potential for postanesthetic headache because of the large-gauge needle used.

\section*{Local Infiltration Anesthesia}

Infiltration anesthesia is the injection of a solution containing the local anesthetic into the tissues at the planned incision site. Often it is combined with a local regional block by injecting the nerves immediately supplying the area. The advantages of local anesthesia are as follows:
- It is simple, economical, and nonexplosive.
- Equipment needed is minimal.
- Postoperative recovery is brief.
- Undesirable effects of general anesthesia are avoided.
- It is ideal for short and superficial surgical procedures.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 19-2 (A) Injection sites for spinal and epidural anesthesia. (B) Cross-section of injection sites for peripheral nerve, epidural, and spinal blocks.}
\end{figure}

Local anesthesia is often administered in combination with epinephrine. Epinephrine constricts blood vessels, which prevents rapid absorption of the anesthetic agent and thus prolongs its local action. Rapid absorption of the anesthetic agent into the bloodstream, which could cause seizures, is also prevented. Types of local anesthetic agents are listed in Table 19-5.

Local anesthesia is the anesthesia of choice in any surgical procedure in which it can be used. However, contraindications include high preoperative levels of anxiety, because surgery with local anesthesia may increase anxiety. A patient who requests general anesthesia rarely does well under local anesthesia. For some surgical procedures, local anesthesia is impractical because of the number of injections and the amount of anesthetic that would be required (breast reconstruction, for example).

The skin is prepared as for any surgical procedure, and a smallgauge needle is used to inject a modest amount of the anesthetic into the skin layers. This produces blanching or a wheal. Additional anesthetic is then injected in the skin until an area the length of the proposed incision is anesthetized. A larger, longer needle then is used to infiltrate deeper tissues with the anesthetic.

The action of the agent is almost immediate, so surgery may begin as soon as the injection is complete. Anesthesia lasts 45 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the anesthetic and the use of epinephrine.

\section*{Potential Intraoperative Complications}

The surgical patient is subject to several risks. Potential intraoperative complications include nausea and vomiting, anaphylaxis, hypoxia, hypothermia, malignant hyperthermia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

\section*{NAUSEA AND VOMITING}

Nausea and vomiting, or regurgitation, may affect patients during the intraoperative period. If gagging occurs, the patient is turned to the side, the head of the table is lowered, and a basin is provided to collect the vomitus. Suction is used to remove saliva and vomited gastric contents. There is no single way to prevent

nausea and vomiting; an interdisciplinary approach involving the surgeon, anesthesiologist or anesthetist, and nurse is best (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999).

In some cases, the anesthesiologist administers antiemetics preoperatively or intraoperatively to counteract possible aspiration. If the patient aspirates vomitus, an asthma-like attack with severe bronchial spasms and wheezing is triggered. Pneumonitis and pulmonary edema can subsequently develop, leading to extreme hypoxia. Increasing medical attention is being paid to silent regurgitation of gastric contents, which occurs more frequently than previously realized. The importance of pH in the etiology of acid aspiration is being studied, as is the value of perioperative administration of a histamine-2 receptor antagonist, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), and similar medications (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999).

\section*{ANAPHYLAXIS}

Any time a substance foreign to the patient is introduced, there is the potential for an anaphylactic reaction. Because medications are the most common cause of anaphylaxis, intraoperative nurses must be aware of the type and method of anesthesia used as well as the specific agents. An anaphylactic reaction can occur in response to many medications, latex, or other substances. The reaction may be immediate or delayed. Anaphylaxis is a lifethreatening acute allergic reaction that causes vasodilation, hypotension, and bronchial constriction (Fortunato, 2000). See Chapters 15 and 53 for more details about the signs, symptoms, and treatment of anaphylaxis.

Fibrin sealants are used in a variety of surgical procedures, and cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are used to close wounds without the use of sutures (Kassam et al., 2002; Vargas \& Reger, 2000). These sealants have been implicated in allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Although these reactions are rare, the nurse should be alert to the possibility and observe the patient for changes in vital signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis when these products are used.

\section*{HYPOXIA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS}

Inadequate ventilation, occlusion of the airway, inadvertent intubation of the esophagus, and hypoxia are significant potential problems of general anesthesia. Many factors can contribute to inadequate ventilation. Respiratory depression caused by anesthetic agents, aspiration of respiratory tract secretions or vomitus, and the patient's position on the operating table can compromise the exchange of gases. Anatomic variation can make the trachea difficult to visualize and result in the artificial airway being inserted into the esophagus rather than the trachea. In addition to these dangers, asphyxia caused by foreign bodies in the mouth, spasm of the vocal cords, relaxation of the tongue, or aspiration of vomitus, saliva, or blood can occur. Since brain damage from hypoxia occurs within minutes, vigilant assessment of the patient's oxygenation status is a primary function of the anesthesiologist or anesthetist and the circulating nurse. Peripheral perfusion is checked frequently, and pulse oximetry values are monitored continuously.

\section*{HYPOTHERMIA}

During anesthesia, the patient's temperature may fall. Glucose metabolism is reduced, and as a result metabolic acidosis may develop. This condition is called hypothermia and is indicated by a core body temperature below normal ( $36.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left[98.0^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right]$ or lower). Inadvertent hypothermia may occur as a result of a low temperature in the OR, infusion of cold fluids, inhalation of cold gases, open body wounds or cavities, decreased muscle activity, advanced age, or the pharmaceutical agents used (eg, vasodilators, phenothiazines, general anesthetics). Hypothermia may also be intentionally induced in selected surgical procedures (such as cardiac surgeries requiring cardiopulmonary bypass) to reduce the patient's metabolic rate (Finkelmeier, 2000).

Preventing unintentional hypothermia is a major objective. If hypothermia occurs, the goal of intervention is to minimize or reverse the physiologic process. If hypothermia is intentional, the goal is safe return to normal body temperature. Environmental temperature in the OR can temporarily be set at $25^{\circ}$ to $26.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $78^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ). Intravenous and irrigating fluids are warmed to $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. Wet gowns and drapes are removed promptly and replaced with dry materials because wet linens promote heat loss. Whatever methods are used to rewarm the patient, warming must be accomplished gradually, not rapidly. Conscientious monitoring of core temperature, urinary output, ECG, blood pressure, arterial blood gas levels, and serum electrolyte levels is required.

\section*{MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA}

Malignant hyperthermia is an inherited muscle disorder chemically induced by anesthetic agents (Fortunato-Phillips, 2000; Vermette, 1998). With the mortality rate exceeding 50\%, identifying patients at risk for malignant hyperthermia is imperative. Susceptible people include those with strong and bulky muscles, a history of muscle cramps or muscle weakness and unexplained temperature elevation, and an unexplained death of a family member during surgery that was accompanied by a febrile response.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

During anesthesia, potent agents such as inhalation anesthetics (halothane, enflurane) and muscle relaxants (succinylcholine), may trigger the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (FortunatoPhillips, 2000). Stress and some medications, such as sympathomimetics (epinephrine), theophylline, aminophylline, anticholinergics (atropine), and cardiac glycosides (digitalis), can induce or intensify such a reaction as well.

The pathophysiology is related to muscle cell activity. Muscle cells are composed of inner fluid (sarcoplasm) and an outer surrounding membrane. Calcium, an essential factor in muscle contraction, is normally stored in sacs in the sarcoplasm (FortunatoPhillips, 2000). When nerve impulses stimulate the muscle, calcium is released, allowing contraction to occur. A pumping mechanism returns calcium to the sacs so that the muscle can relax. In malignant hyperthermia, this mechanism is disrupted. Calcium ions are not returned and they accumulate, causing clinical symptoms of hypermetabolism, which in turn increases muscle contraction (rigidity), hyperthermia, and damage to the central nervous system.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

The initial symptoms of malignant hyperthermia are related to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal activity. Tachycardia (heart rate above 150 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ ) is often the earliest sign. In addition to
the tachycardia, sympathetic nervous stimulation leads to ventricular dysrhythmia, hypotension, decreased cardiac output, oliguria, and, later, cardiac arrest. With the abnormal transport of calcium, rigidity or tetanus-like movements occur, often in the jaw. The rise in temperature is actually a late sign that develops rapidly; body temperature can increase $1^{\circ}$ to $2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(2^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.4^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ every 5 minutes (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). The temperature can reach or exceed $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ in a very short time (Fortunato-Phillips, 2000).

\section*{Medical Management}

Recognizing symptoms early and discontinuing anesthesia promptly are imperative. Goals of treatment are to decrease metabolism, reverse metabolic and respiratory acidosis, correct dysrhythmias, decrease body temperature, provide oxygen and nutrition to tissues, and correct electrolyte imbalance. The Malignant Hyperthermia Association of North America (MHAUS) publishes a treatment protocol that should be posted in the OR or be readily available on a malignant hyperthermia cart.

Although malignant hyperthermia usually presents about 10 to 20 minutes after induction of anesthesia, it can also occur in the first 24 hours after surgery. As soon as the diagnosis is made, anesthesia and surgery are halted and the patient is hyperventilated with 100\% oxygen. Dantrolene sodium, a skeletal muscle relaxant, and sodium bicarbonate are administered immediately (FortunatoPhillips, 2000; Vermette, 1998). Continued monitoring of all parameters is necessary to evaluate the patient's status.

\section*{Nursing Management}

Although malignant hyperthermia is uncommon, the nurse must identify patients at risk, recognize the signs and symptoms, have the appropriate medication and equipment available, and be knowledgeable about the protocol to follow (Fortunato-Phillips, 2000). This information may be lifesaving.

\section*{DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULOPATHY}

Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is a life-threatening condition characterized by thrombus formation and depletion of select coagulation proteins (Dice, 2000). The exact cause is unknown, but predisposing factors include many conditions that may occur with emergency surgery, such as massive trauma, head injury, massive transfusion, liver or kidney involvement, embolic events, or shock. The signs and symptoms, nursing assessment, and treatment are discussed in Chapter 33.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT DURING SURGERY}

The Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS) is a helpful model used by nurses in the intraoperative phase of care (see Chap. 18, Fig. 18-1). Phenomena of concern to intraoperative nurses are nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes that surgical patients and their families experience. Additional areas of concern include collaborative problems and expected goals.

\section*{Assessment}

Nursing assessment of the intraoperative patient involves obtaining data from the patient and the patient's record to identify variables that can affect care and serve as guidelines for developing an
individualized plan of patient care. The intraoperative nurse uses the focused preoperative nursing assessment documented on the patient record. This includes assessment of physiologic status (eg, health-illness level, level of consciousness), psychosocial status (eg, anxiety level, verbal communication problems, coping mechanisms), physical status (eg, surgical site, skin condition and effectiveness of preparation; immobile joints), and ethical concerns (Chart 19-3).

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, some major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Anxiety related to expressed concerns due to surgery or OR environment
- Risk for perioperative positioning injury related to environmental conditions in the OR
- Risk for injury related to anesthesia and surgery
- Disturbed sensory perception (global) related to general anesthesia or sedation

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/}

\section*{POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Anaphylaxis
- Hypoxia
- Unintentional hypothermia
- Malignant hyperthermia
- Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy
- Infection

\section*{Chart 19-3 - Ethics and Related Issues}

\section*{To Resuscitate or Not?}

\section*{Situation}

Your hospital has developed a policy, authorized through the medical staff, that allows for patients to have a do-not-resuscitate order (DNR) in place during a surgical procedure. This policy follows the American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines for DNR in the operating room. You are getting a patient ready for surgery and the anesthesiologist who will be administering the anesthetic writes an order for the DNR to be rescinded during surgery. The physician is refusing to talk to the patient concerning the DNR.

\section*{Problem}

The patient believes his/her wishes will be followed with regard to resuscitation in the event of a cardiac arrest and the physician does not believe he can administer anesthesia if the DNR is in place.

\section*{Discussion}
- What are the rights of the patient with regard to advance directives?
- What can you do to advocate for the patient?
- Should you contact the ethics committee of the hospital?
- How do you contact the ethics committee?

\section*{Planning and Goals}

Goals for care of the patient during surgery include reducing anxiety, preventing positioning injuries, maintaining safety, maintaining the patient's dignity, and avoiding complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

The OR environment can seem cold, stark, and frightening to the patient, who may be feeling isolated and apprehensive. Introducing yourself, addressing the patient by name warmly and frequently, verifying details, providing explanations, and encouraging and answering questions provide a sense of professionalism and friendliness that can help the patient feel secure. When discussing what the patient can expect in surgery, the nurse uses common, basic communication skills, such as touch and eye contact, to reduce anxiety. Attention to physical comfort (warm blankets, position changes) helps the patient feel more comfortable. Telling the patient who else will be present in the OR, how long the procedure is expected to take, and other details helps the patient prepare for the experience and gain a sense of control.

\section*{PREVENTING INTRAOPERATIVE POSITIONING INJURY}

The patient's position on the operating table depends on the surgical procedure to be performed as well as on his or her physical condition (Fig. 19-3). The potential for transient discomfort or even permanent injury is clear because many positions are awkward. Hyperextending joints, compressing arteries, or pressing on nerves and bony prominences usually results in discomfort simply because the position must be sustained for a long period (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Factors to consider include the following:
- The patient should be in as comfortable a position as possible, whether asleep or awake.
- The operative field must be adequately exposed.
- An awkward position, undue pressure on a body part, or use of stirrups or traction should not obstruct the vascular supply.
- Respiration should not be impeded by pressure of arms on the chest or by a gown that constricts the neck or chest.
- Nerves must be protected from undue pressure. Improper positioning of the arms, hands, legs, or feet may cause serious injury or paralysis. Shoulder braces must be well padded to prevent irreparable nerve injury, especially when the Trendelenburg position is necessary.
- Precautions for patient safety must be observed, particularly with thin, elderly, or obese patients, or those with a physical deformity (Curet, 2000).
- The patient needs gentle restraint before induction in case of excitement.

The usual position for surgery, called the dorsal recumbent position, is flat on the back. One arm is positioned at the side of the table, with the hand placed palm down; the other is carefully positioned on an armboard to facilitate intravenous infusion of fluids, blood, or medications. This position is used for most abdominal surgeries except for surgery of the gallbladder and pelvis (see Fig. 19-3A).

The Trendelenburg position usually is used for surgery on the lower abdomen and pelvis to obtain good exposure by displacing the intestines into the upper abdomen. In this position, the head and body are lowered. The patient is held in position by padded shoulder braces (see Fig. 19-3B).

A Patient in position on the operating table for a laparotomy. Note the strap above the knees.

B Patient in Trendelenburg position on operating table. Note padded shoulder braces in place. Be sure that brace does not press on brachial plexus.

C Patient in lithotomy position. Note that the hips extend over the edge of the table.

D Patient lies on unaffected side for kidney surgery. Table is broken to spread apart space between the lower ribs and the pelvis. The upper leg is extended; the lower leg is flexed at the knee and the hip joints; a pillow is placed between the legs.

The lithotomy position is used for nearly all perineal, rectal, and vaginal surgical procedures (see Fig. 19-3C). The patient is positioned on the back with the legs and thighs flexed. The position is maintained by placing the feet in stirrups.

The Sims or lateral position is used for renal surgery. The patient is placed on the nonoperative side with an air pillow 12.5 to 15 cm (5 to 6 inches) thick under the loin, or on a table with a kidney or back lift (see Fig. 19-3D).

Other procedures, such as neurosurgery or abdominothoracic surgery, may require unique positioning and supplemental apparatus, depending on the operative approach.

\section*{PROTECTING THE PATIENT FROM INJURY}

One way the nurse protects the patient from injury is by providing a safe environment. A variety of activities are used to address the diverse patient safety issues that arise in the OR. Verifying information, checking the chart for completeness, and maintaining surgical asepsis and an optimal environment are critical nursing responsibilities. Verifying that all required documentation is completed is one of the first functions of the intraoperative nurse. The patient is identified, and the planned surgical procedure and type of anesthesia are verified. It is important to review the patient's record for the following:
- Correct informed surgical consent, with patient's signature
- Completed records for health history and physical examination
- Results of diagnostic studies
- Allergies (including latex)

In addition to checking that all necessary patient data are complete, the perioperative nurse obtains the necessary equipment specific to the procedure. The need for nonroutine medications, blood components, instruments, and other equipment and supplies is assessed, and the readiness of the room, completeness of physical setup, and completeness of instrument, suture, and dressing setups are determined. Any aspects of the OR environment that may negatively affect the patient are identified. These include physical features, such as room temperature and humidity; electrical hazards; potential contaminants (dust, blood, and discharge on floor or surfaces, uncovered hair, faulty attire of personnel, jewelry worn by personnel); and unnecessary traffic. The circulating nurse also sets up and maintains suction equipment in working order, sets up invasive monitoring equipment, assists with insertion of vascular access and monitoring devices (arterial, Swan-Ganz, central venous pressure, intravenous lines), and initiates appropriate physical comfort measures for the patient.

Preventing physical injury includes using safety straps and bed rails and not leaving the sedated patient unattended. Transferring the patient from the stretcher to the OR table requires safe transferring practices. Other safety measures include properly positioning the grounding pad under the patient to prevent electrical burns and shock, removing excess povidone-iodine (Betadine) or other surgical germicide from the patient's skin, and promptly and completely draping exposed areas after the sterile field has been created to decrease the risk for hypothermia.

Nursing measures to prevent injury from excessive blood loss include blood conservation using equipment such a cell-saver (a device for recirculating the patient's own blood cells) or the administration of blood products (Finkelmeier, 2000). Few patients undergoing an elective procedure require blood transfusion, but those undergoing higher-risk procedures (such as orthopedic or cardiac surgeries) may require an intraoperative transfusion. The circulating nurse should anticipate this need, check that blood has been cross-matched and held in reserve, and be prepared to administer blood (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999).

\section*{SERVING AS PATIENT ADVOCATE}

Because the patient undergoing general anesthesia or moderate sedation experiences temporary sensory/perceptual alteration or loss, he or she has an increased need for protection and advocacy. Patient advocacy in the OR entails maintaining the patient's physical and emotional comfort, privacy, rights, and dignity. Patients, whether conscious or not, should not be subjected to excess noise, inappropriate conversation, or, most of all, derogatory comments. As surprising as this sounds, banter in the OR occasionally includes jokes about the patient's physical appearance, job, personal history, and so forth. Cases have been reported in which seemingly deeply anesthetized patients recalled the entire surgical experience, including disparaging personal remarks made by OR personnel. As an advocate, the nurse never engages in this conversation and discourages others from doing so. Other advocacy activities include correcting for the clinical, dehumanizing aspects of being a surgical patient by making sure the patient is treated as a person, respecting cultural and spiritual values, providing physical privacy, and maintaining confidentiality.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

It is the responsibility of the surgeon and the anesthetist or anesthesiologist to monitor and manage complications. However, intraoperative nurses also play an important role. Being alert to and reporting changes in vital signs and symptoms of nausea and vomiting, anaphylaxis, hypoxia, hypothermia, malignant hyperthermia, or disseminated vascular coagulation and assisting with their management are important nursing functions (Dice, 2000; Fortunato-Phillips, 2000). Each of these complications was discussed earlier. Maintaining asepsis and preventing infection is the responsibility of all members of the surgical team.

\section*{Evaluation}

Expected patient outcomes may include:
1. Exhibits low level of anxiety
2. Remains free of perioperative positioning injury
3. Experiences no unexpected threats to safety
4. Has dignity preserved throughout OR experience

\section*{(1) critical Thinking Exercises}
1. A patient in the holding area awaiting surgery indicates that he had not received instructions not to take his usual medications (antihypertensive agent, diuretic, digoxin, potassium chloride, and insulin injection); as a result, he took them a few hours ago. What implications does this have for the patient's care and well-being while awaiting surgery, during surgery, and in the immediate postoperative period?
2. What are the differences in responsibility of the operating room nurse for care of patients who receive general anesthesia, conscious sedation, spinal anesthesia, and regional anesthesia?

\section*{Postoperative Nursing Management}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{on completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the responsibilities of the postanesthesia care unit nurse in the prevention of immediate postoperative complications.
2. Compare postoperative care of the ambulatory surgery patient and the hospitalized surgery patient.
3. Identify common postoperative problems and their management.
4. Describe the gerontologic considerations related to postoperative management of patients.
5. Describe variables that affect wound healing.
6. Demonstrate postoperative dressing techniques.
7. Identify assessment parameters appropriate for the early detection of postoperative complications.

$T_{h}$he postoperative period extends from the time the patient leaves the operating room until the last follow-up visit with the surgeon. This period may be as short as 1 week or as long as several months. During the postoperative period, nursing care focuses on reestablishing the patient's physiologic equilibrium, alleviating pain, preventing complications, and teaching the patient self-care. Careful assessment and immediate intervention assist the patient in returning to optimal function quickly, safely, and as comfortably as possible. Ongoing care in the community through home care, clinic visits, office visits, or telephone followup facilitates an uncomplicated recovery.

\section*{The Postanesthesia Care Unit}

The postanesthesia care unit (PACU), also called the postanesthesia recovery room, is located adjacent to the operating rooms. Patients still under anesthesia or recovering from anesthesia are placed in this unit for easy access to experienced, highly skilled nurses, anesthesiologists or anesthetists, surgeons, advanced hemodynamic and pulmonary monitoring and support, special equipment, and medications (Litwack, 1999; Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999).

The PACU is kept quiet, clean, and free of unnecessary equipment. This area is painted in soft, pleasing colors and has indirect lighting, a soundproof ceiling, equipment that controls or eliminates noise (eg, plastic emesis basins, rubber bumpers on beds and tables), and isolated but visible quarters for disruptive patients. The PACU should also be well ventilated. These features benefit the patient by helping to decrease anxiety and promote comfort. The PACU bed provides easy access to the patient, is safe and easily movable, can be readily placed in position to facilitate use of measures to counteract shock, and has features that facilitate care, such as intravenous (IV) poles, side rails, wheel brakes, and a chart storage rack.

\section*{PHASES OF POSTANESTHESIA CARE}

Postanesthesia care in some hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers is divided into two phases (Litwack, 1999; Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). In the phase I PACU, used during the immediate recovery phase, intensive nursing care is provided. The phase II PACU is reserved for patients who require less frequent observation and less nursing care. In the phase II unit, the patient is prepared for discharge. Recliners rather than stretchers or beds are standard in many phase II units, which may also be referred to as step-down, sit-up, or progressive care units. Patients may remain in a phase II PACU unit for as long as 4 to 6 hours, de-
pending on the type of surgery and any preexisting conditions of the patient. In facilities without separate phase I and phase II units, the patient remains in the PACU and may be discharged home directly from this unit.

Both phase I and phase II PACU nurses have special skills. The phase I PACU nurse provides frequent (every 15 minutes) monitoring of the patient's pulse, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximeter value (blood oxygen level). In some cases, end-tidal carbon dioxide ( $\mathrm{ETCO}_{2}$ ) levels are monitored as well. The patient's airway may become obstructed because of the latent effects of recent anesthesia, and the PACU nurse must be prepared to assist in reintubation and in handling other emergencies that may occur. The nurse in the phase II PACU must possess strong clinical assessment and patient teaching skills.

\section*{ADMITTING THE PATIENT TO THE PACU}

Transferring the postoperative patient from the operating room to the PACU is the responsibility of the anesthesiologist or anesthetist. During transport from the operating room to the PACU, the anesthesia provider remains at the head of the stretcher (to maintain the airway), and a surgical team member remains at the opposite end. Transporting the patient involves special consideration of the incision site, potential vascular changes, and exposure. The surgical incision is considered every time the postoperative patient is moved; many wounds are closed under considerable tension, and every effort is made to prevent further strain on the incision. The patient is positioned so that he or she is not lying on and obstructing drains or drainage tubes. Serious orthostatic hypotension may occur when a patient is moved from one position to another (eg, from a lithotomy position to a horizontal position or from a lateral to a supine position), so the patient must be moved slowly and carefully. As soon as the patient is placed on the stretcher or bed, the soiled gown is removed and replaced with a dry gown. The patient is covered with lightweight blankets and warmed. The side rails are raised to guard against falls.

The nurse who admits the patient to the PACU reviews the following information with the anesthesiologist or anesthetist:
- Medical diagnosis and type of surgery performed
- Pertinent past medical history and allergies
- Patient's age and general condition, airway patency, vital signs
- Anesthetics and other medications used during the procedure (eg, opioids and other analgesic agents, muscle relaxants, antibiotic agents)
dehiscence: partial or complete separation of wound edges
evisceration: protrusion of abdominal organs through the surgical incision
first-intention healing: method of healing in which wound edges are surgically approximated and integumentary continuity is restored without granulation
Phase I PACU: area designated for care of surgical patients immediately after surgery
and patients whose condition warrants close monitoring
Phase II PACU: area designated for care of surgical patients who have been transferred from a phase I PACU because their condition no longer requires the close monitoring provided in a phase I PACU
postanesthesia care unit (PACU): area where postoperative patients are monitored as they recover from anesthesia; for-
merly referred to as the recovery room or postanesthesia recovery room
second-intention healing: method of healing in which wound edges are not surgically approximated and integumentary continuity is restored by the process known as granulation
third-intention healing: method of healing in which surgical approximation of wound edges is delayed and integumentary continuity is restored by apposing areas of granulation
- Any problems that occurred in the operating room that might influence postoperative care (eg, extensive hemorrhage, shock, cardiac arrest)
- Pathology encountered (if malignancy is an issue during surgery, the nurse needs to know whether the patient and/or family have been informed)
- Fluid administered, estimated blood loss and replacement fluids
- Any tubing, drains, catheters, or other supportive aids
- Specific information about which the surgeon, anesthesiologist, or anesthetist wishes to be notified (eg, blood pressure or heart rate below or above a specified level)

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT IN THE PACU}

The nursing management objectives for the patient in the PACU are to provide care until the patient has recovered from the effects of anesthesia (eg, until resumption of motor and sensory functions), is oriented, has stable vital signs, and shows no evidence of hemorrhage or other complications.

\section*{Assessing the Patient}

Frequent, skilled assessments of the blood oxygen saturation level, pulse rate and regularity, depth and nature of respirations, skin color, level of consciousness, and ability to respond to commands are the cornerstones of nursing care in the PACU. The nurse performs a baseline assessment, then checks the surgical site for drainage or hemorrhage and makes sure that all drainage tubes and monitoring lines are connected and functioning.

After the initial assessment, vital signs are monitored and the patient's general physical status is assessed at least every 15 minutes. Patency of the airway and respiratory function are always evaluated first, followed by assessment of cardiovascular function, the condition of the surgical site, and function of the central nervous system. The nurse needs to be aware of any pertinent information from the patient's history that may be significant (eg, patient is hard of hearing, has a history of seizures, has diabetes, or is allergic to certain medications or to latex).

\section*{Maintaining a Patent Airway}

The primary objective in the immediate postoperative period is to maintain pulmonary ventilation and thus prevent hypoxemia (reduced oxygen in the blood) and hypercapnia (excess carbon dioxide in the blood). Both can occur if the airway is obstructed and ventilation is reduced (hypoventilation). Besides checking the physician's orders for and administering supplemental oxygen, the nurse assesses respiratory rate and depth, ease of respirations, oxygen saturation, and breath sounds (Litwack, 1999; Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999).

Patients who have experienced prolonged anesthesia usually are unconscious, with all muscles relaxed. This relaxation extends to the muscles of the pharynx. When the patient lies on his or her back, the lower jaw and the tongue fall backward and the air passages become obstructed (Fig. 20-1A). This is called hypopharyngeal obstruction. Signs of occlusion include choking, noisy and irregular respirations, decreased oxygen saturation scores, and within minutes a blue, dusky color (cyanosis) of the skin. Because movement of the thorax and the diaphragm does not necessarily indicate that the patient is breathing, the nurse needs to place the palm of the hand at the patient's nose and mouth to feel the exhaled breath.

NURSING ALERT The treatment of hypopharyngeal obstruction involves tilting the head back and pushing forward on the angle of the lower jaw, as if to push the lower teeth in front of the upper teeth (Figs. 20-1B, C). This maneuver pulls the tongue forward and opens the air passages.

The anesthesiologist or anesthetist may leave a hard rubber or plastic airway in the patient's mouth (Fig. 20-2) to maintain a patent airway. Such a device should not be removed until signs such as gagging indicate that reflex action is returning. Alternatively, the patient may enter the PACU with an endotracheal tube still in place and may require continued mechanical ventilation. The nurse assists in initiating the use of the ventilator and in the weaning and extubation processes. Some patients, particularly those who have had extensive or lengthy surgical procedures, may be transferred from the operating room directly to the intensive care unit or may be transferred from the PACU to the intensive care unit while still intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Respiratory difficulty can also result from excessive secretion of mucus or aspiration of vomitus. Turning the patient to one side allows the collected fluid to escape from the side of the mouth. If the teeth are clenched, the mouth may be opened manually but cautiously with a padded tongue depressor. The head of the bed is elevated 15 to 30 degrees unless contraindicated, and the patient is closely observed to maintain the airway as well as to minimize the risk of aspiration. If vomiting occurs, the patient is turned to the side to prevent aspiration and the vomitus is collected in the emesis basin. Mucus or vomitus obstructing the pharynx or the trachea is suctioned with a pharyngeal suction tip or a nasal catheter introduced into the nasopharynx or oropharynx. The catheter can be passed into the nasopharynx or oropharynx safely to a distance of 15 to 20 cm ( 6 to 8 inches). Caution is necessary in suctioning the throat of a patient who has had a tonsillectomy or other oral or laryngeal surgery because of risk for bleeding and discomfort.

\section*{Maintaining Cardiovascular Stability}

To monitor cardiovascular stability, the nurse assesses the patient's mental status; vital signs; cardiac rhythm; skin temperature, color, and moisture; and urine output. Central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and arterial lines are monitored if the patient's condition requires such assessment. The nurse also assesses the patency of all IV lines. The primary cardiovascular complications seen in the PACU include hypotension and shock, hemorrhage, hypertension, and dysrhythmias.

\section*{HYPOTENSION AND SHOCK}

Hypotension can result from blood loss, hypoventilation, position changes, pooling of blood in the extremities, or side effects of medications and anesthetics; the most common cause is loss of circulating volume through blood and plasma loss. If the amount of blood loss exceeds 500 mL (especially if the loss is rapid), replacement is usually indicated.

Shock, one of the most serious postoperative complications, can result from hypovolemia. Shock may be described as inadequate cellular oxygenation accompanied by the inability to excrete waste products of metabolism. Hypovolemic shock is characterized by a fall in venous pressure, a rise in peripheral resistance, and tachycardia. Neurogenic shock, a less common cause of shock in the surgical patient, occurs as a result of decreased arterial resistance caused by spinal anesthesia. It is characterized by a fall in blood

The airway passes over the base of the tongue and permits air to pass into the pharynx in the region of the epiglottis. Patients often leave the operating room with an airway in place. The airway should remain in place until the patient recovers sufficiently to breathe normally. As the patient regains consciousness, the airway usually causes irritation and should be removed.}

pressure due to pooling of blood in dilated capacitance vessels (those with the ability to change volume capacity). Cardiogenic shock is unlikely in the surgical patient except if the patient has severe preexisting cardiac disease or experienced a myocardial infarction during surgery. See Chapter 15 for a detailed discussion of shock.

The classic signs of shock are:
- Pallor
- Cool, moist skin
- Rapid breathing
- Cyanosis of the lips, gums, and tongue
- Rapid, weak, thready pulse
- Decreasing pulse pressure
- Low blood pressure and concentrated urine

Hypovolemic shock can be avoided largely by the timely administration of IV fluids, blood, blood products, and medications that elevate blood pressure. Other factors may contribute to hemodynamic instability, and the PACU nurse implements multiple measures to manage these factors. Pain is controlled by making the patient as comfortable as possible and by using opioids
judiciously. Exposure is avoided, and normothermia is maintained to prevent vasodilation.

Volume replacement is the primary intervention for shock. An infusion of lactated Ringer's solution or blood component therapy is initiated. Oxygen is administered by nasal cannula, facemask, or mechanical ventilation. Cardiotonic, vasodilator, and corticosteroid medications may be prescribed to improve cardiac function and reduce peripheral vascular resistance. The patient is kept warm while avoiding overheating to prevent cutaneous vessels from dilating and depriving vital organs of blood. The patient is placed flat in bed with the legs elevated. Respiratory and pulse rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen concentration, urinary output, level of consciousness, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac output are monitored to provide information on the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status. Vital signs are monitored continuously until the patient's condition has stabilized.

\section*{HEMORRHAGE}

Hemorrhage is an uncommon yet serious complication of surgery that can result in death (Finkelmeier, 2000). It can present insidiously or emergently at any time in the immediate postoperative period or up to several days after surgery (Table 20-1). When blood loss is extreme, the patient is apprehensive, restless, and thirsty; the skin is cold, moist, and pale. The pulse rate increases, the temperature falls, and respirations are rapid and deep, often of the gasping type spoken of as "air hunger." If hemorrhage progresses untreated, cardiac output decreases, arterial and venous blood pressure and hemoglobin level fall rapidly, the lips and the conjunctivae become pallid, spots appear before the eyes, a ringing is heard in the ears, and the patient grows weaker but remains conscious until near death.

Transfusing blood or blood products and determining the cause of hemorrhage are the initial therapeutic measures. The surgical site and incision should always be inspected for bleeding. If bleeding is evident, a sterile gauze pad and a pressure dressing are

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 20-1 - Classifications of Hemorrhage} \\
\hline CLASSIFICATION & DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Time Frame} \\
\hline Primary Intermediary & Hemorrhage occurs at the time of surgery. Hemorrhage occurs during the first few hours after surgery when the rise of blood pressure to its normal level dislodges insecure clots from untied vessels. \\
\hline Secondary & Hemorrhage may occur some time after surgery if a ligature slips because a blood vessel was insecurely tied, became infected, or was eroded by a drainage tube. \\
\hline Type of Vessel Capillary & Hemorrhage is characterized by a slow, general ooze. \\

\end{tabular}
applied, and the site of the bleeding is elevated to heart level if possible. The patient is placed in the shock position (flat on back; legs elevated at a 20 -degree angle; knees kept straight). If the source of bleeding is concealed, the patient may be taken back to the operating room for emergency exploration of the surgical site.

> NURSING ALERT When IV fluids are given in cases of hemorrhage, it is important to remember that unless the hemorrhage has been well controlled, giving too large a quantity or administering the IV fluid too rapidly may raise the blood pressure enough to start the bleeding again.

Special considerations must be given to patients who decline blood transfusions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and those who identify specific requests on their advance directives or living will.

\section*{HYPERTENSION AND DYSRHYTHMIAS}

Hypertension is common in the immediate postoperative period secondary to sympathetic nervous system stimulation from pain, hypoxia, or bladder distention. Dysrhythmias are associated with electrolyte imbalance, altered respiratory function, pain, hypothermia, stress, and anesthetic medications. Both conditions are managed by treating the underlying causes.

\section*{Relieving Pain and Anxiety}

Opioid analgesics are administered judiciously and often intravenously in the PACU (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Intravenous opioids provide immediate relief and are short-acting, thus minimizing the potential for drug interactions or prolonged respiratory depression while anesthetics are still active in the patient's system. In addition to monitoring the patient's physiologic status and managing pain, the PACU nurse provides psychological support in an effort to relieve the patient's fears and concerns. The nurse checks the medical record for special needs and concerns of the patient. When the patient's condition permits, a close member of the family may visit in the PACU for a few moments. This often decreases the family's anxiety and makes the patient feel more secure.

\section*{Controlling Nausea and Vomiting}

Nausea and vomiting are common problems in the PACU. The nurse should intervene at the patient's first report of nausea to control the problem rather than wait for it to progress to vomiting.

Many medications are available to control nausea and vomiting without oversedating the patient; they are commonly administered during surgery as well as in the PACU (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Intravenous or intramuscular administration of droperidol (Inapsine) is common, especially in the ambulatory setting. Other medications such as metoclopramide (Reglan), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and promethazine (Phenergan) are commonly prescribed (Karch, 2002; Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Although it is costly, ondansetron (Zofran) is a frequently used, effective antiemetic with few side effects.

NURSING ALERT At the slightest indication of nausea, the patient is turned completely to one side to promote mouth drainage and prevent aspiration of vomitus, which can cause asphyxiation and death.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

The elderly patient, like all other patients, is transferred from the operating room table to the bed or stretcher slowly and gently. The effects of this action on blood pressure and ventilation are monitored. Special attention is given to keeping the patient warm because the elderly are more susceptible to hypothermia. The patient's position is changed frequently to stimulate respirations and to promote circulation and comfort.

Immediate postoperative care for the elderly patient is the same as that for any surgical patient, but additional support is given if there is impaired cardiovascular, pulmonary, or renal function. With invasive monitoring, it is possible to detect cardiopulmonary deficits before signs and symptoms are apparent. The elderly patient has less physiologic reserve, and physiologic responses to stress are diminished or slowed. These changes reinforce the need for close monitoring and prompt treatment of hypotension, shock, and hemorrhage. Because of monitoring and improved individualized preoperative preparation, many older adults tolerate surgery well and have an uneventful recovery.

Postoperative confusion is common in older patients. The confusion is aggravated by social isolation, restraints, anesthetics and analgesics, and sensory deprivation. Reorienting the patient to the environment and using smaller amounts of sedatives, anesthetics, and analgesics may help prevent confusion. However, unrelieved pain, particularly pain at rest, may increase the risk for delirium and must be addressed (Lynch, Lazor, Gellis et al., 1998). Hypoxia can present as confusion and restlessness, as can blood loss and electrolyte imbalance. Excluding all other causes of confusion must precede the assumption that confusion is related to age, circumstances, and medications.

\section*{Determining Readiness for Discharge From the PACU}

A patient remains in the PACU until he or she has fully recovered from the anesthetic agent (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Indicators of recovery include stable blood pressure, adequate respiratory function, adequate oxygen saturation level compared with baseline, and spontaneous movement or movement on command. Usually the following measures are used to determine the patient's readiness for discharge from the PACU:
- Stable vital signs
- Orientation to person, place, events, and time
- Uncompromised pulmonary function
- Pulse oximetry readings indicating adequate blood oxygen saturation
- Urine output at least $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$
- Nausea and vomiting absent or under control
- Minimal pain

Many hospitals use a scoring system (eg, Aldrete score) to determine the patient's general condition and readiness for transfer from the PACU (Quinn, 1999). Throughout the recovery period, the patient's physical signs are observed and evaluated by means of a scoring system based on a set of objective criteria. This evaluation guide, a modification of the Apgar scoring system used for evaluating newborns, allows a more objective assessment of the patient's condition in the PACU (Fig. 20-3). The patient is assessed at regular intervals (eg, every 15 or 30 minutes), and the score is totaled on the assessment record. Patients with a score lower than 7 must remain in the PACU until their condition im-
proves or they are transferred to an intensive care area, depending on their preoperative baseline scores.

The patient is discharged from the phase I PACU by the anesthesiologist or anesthetist to the critical care unit, the medicalsurgical unit, the phase II PACU, or home with a responsible family member (Quinn, 1999). Patients being discharged directly to home require verbal and written instructions and information about follow-up care.

\section*{Promoting Home and Community-Based Care}

To ensure patient safety and recovery, expert patient teaching and discharge planning are necessary when a patient undergoes sameday or ambulatory surgery. Because anesthetics cloud memory for concurrent events, instructions should be given to both the patient and the adult who will be accompanying the patient home (Quinn, 1999).

\section*{TEACHING PATIENTS SELF-CARE}

The patient and caregiver (eg, family member or friend) are informed about expected outcomes and immediate postoperative changes anticipated in the patient's capacity for self-care (Fox, 1998; Quinn, 1999). Written instructions about wound care, activity and dietary recommendations, medication, and follow-up visits to the same-day surgery unit or the surgeon are provided. Written instructions (designed to be copied and given to patients) about the postoperative care following many types of surgery are usually provided (Economou \& Economou, 1999). The patient's caregiver at home is provided with verbal and written instructions about what to observe the patient for and about the actions to take if complications occur. Prescriptions are given to the patient. The nurse or surgeon's telephone number is provided, and the patient and caregiver are encouraged to call with questions and to schedule follow-up appointments (Chart 20-1).

Although recovery time varies depending on the type and extent of surgery and the patient's overall condition, instructions usually advise limited activity for 24 to 48 hours. During this time, the patient should not drive a vehicle, drink alcoholic beverages, or perform tasks that require energy or skill. Fluids may be consumed as desired, and smaller-than-normal amounts are eaten at mealtime. The patient is cautioned not to make important decisions at this time because the medications, anesthesia, and surgery may affect his or her decision-making ability.

\section*{CONTINUING CARE}

Although most patients who undergo ambulatory surgery recover quickly and without complications, some patients require referral for home care. These may be elderly or frail patients, those who live alone, and patients with other health care problems that may interfere with self-care or resumption of usual activities. The home care nurse assesses the patient's physical status (eg, respiratory and cardiovascular status, adequacy of pain management, the surgical incision) and the patient's and family's ability to adhere to the recommendations given at the time of discharge. Previous teaching is reinforced as needed. The home care nurse may change surgical dressings, monitor the patency of a drainage system, or administer medications. The patient is assessed for any surgical complications. The patient and family are reminded about the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with the surgeon. Follow-up phone calls from the nurse or surgeon may also be used to assess the patient's progress and to answer any questions (Fox, 1998; Marley \& Swanson, 2001).

\section*{The Hospitalized Postoperative Patient}

The patient admitted to the clinical unit for postoperative care has multiple needs. Seriously ill patients or those who have undergone major cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurologic surgery
are admitted to specialized intensive care units for close monitoring and advanced interventions and support. The care required by these patients in the immediate postoperative period is discussed in specific chapters. Postoperative care for the surgical patient returning to the general medical-surgical unit is discussed below.

\section*{Chart 20-1}

\section*{Home Care Checklist Discharge From Surgery}

At the completion of the home care instruction, the patient or caregiver will be able to:
- Name the procedure that was performed and identify any permanent changes in anatomic structure or function.

Patient Caregiver
- Describe ongoing postoperative therapeutic regimen, including medications, diet, activities to perform (such as walking and breathing exercises) and to avoid (such as driving a car or contact sports), adjuvant therapies, dressing changes and wound care, and any other treatments.
- Describe signs and symptoms of complications.
- State time and date of follow-up appointments.
- Identify interventions and strategies to use in adapting to any permanent changes in structure or function.
- Relate how to reach health care provider with questions or complications.
- State understanding of community resources and referrals (if any).
- Describe pertinent health promotion activities (eg, weight reduction, smoking cessation, stress management).

\section*{RECEIVING THE PATIENT IN THE CLINICAL UNIT}

The patient's room is readied by assembling the necessary equipment and supplies: IV pole, drainage receptacle holder, emesis basin, tissues, disposable pads (Chux), blankets, and postoperative charting forms. When the call comes to the unit about the patient's transfer from the PACU, the need for any additional items that may be needed is communicated. The PACU nurse reports the baseline data about the patient's condition to the receiving nurse. The report includes demographic data, medical diagnosis, procedure performed, comorbid conditions, allergies, unexpected intraoperative events, estimated blood loss, the type and amount of fluids received, medications administered for pain, whether the patient has voided, and information that the patient and family have received about the patient's condition. Usually the surgeon speaks to the family after surgery and relates the general condition of the patient. The receiving nurse reviews the postoperative orders, admits the patient to the unit, performs an initial assessment, and attends to the patient's immediate needs (Chart 20-2).

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT AFTER SURGERY}

During the first 24 hours after surgery, nursing care of the hospitalized patient on the general medical-surgical unit involves continuing to help the patient recover from the effects of anes-
thesia, frequently assessing the patient's physiologic status, monitoring for complications, managing pain, and implementing measures designed to achieve the long-range goals of independence with self-care, successful management of the therapeutic regimen, discharge to home, and full recovery. In the initial hours after admission to the clinical unit, adequate ventilation, hemodynamic stability, incisional pain, surgical site integrity, nausea and vomiting, neurologic status, and spontaneous voiding are primary concerns. The pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate are recorded at least every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours. Thereafter, they are measured less frequently if they remain stable. The temperature is monitored every 4 hours for the first 24 hours.

Patients usually begin to feel better several hours after surgery or after waking up the next morning. Although pain may still be intense, many patients feel more alert, less nauseous, and less anxious. They have begun their breathing and leg exercises, and many will have dangled their legs over the edge of the bed, stood, and ambulated a few feet or been assisted out of bed to the chair at least once. Many will have tolerated a light meal and had IV fluids discontinued. The focus of care shifts from intense physiologic management and symptomatic relief of the adverse effects of anesthesia to regaining independence with self-care and preparing for discharge. Despite these gains, the postoperative patient is still at risk for complications. Atelectasis, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, constipation, paralytic ileus, and wound infection are ongoing threats for the postoperative patient (Fig. 20-4).

\section*{Standard Postoperative Nursing Interventions}

Once the patient leaves the PACU and is admitted to the unit, immediate nursing interventions include the following:
- Assess breathing and administer supplemental oxygen, if prescribed.
- Monitor vital signs and note skin warmth, moisture, and color.
- Assess the surgical site and wound drainage systems.
- Assess level of consciousness, orientation, and ability to move extremities.
- Connect all drainage tubes to gravity or suction as indicated and monitor closed drainage systems.
- Assess pain level, pain characteristics (location, quality) and timing, type, and route of administration of last pain medication.
- Administer analgesics as prescribed and assess their effectiveness in relieving pain.
- Position patient to enhance comfort, safety, and lung expansion.
- Assess IV sites for patency and infusions for correct rate and solution.
- Assess urine output in closed drainage system or the patient's urge to void and bladder distention.
- Reinforce need to begin deep-breathing and leg exercises.
- Place call light, emesis basin, ice chips (if allowed), and bedpan or urinal within reach.
- Provide information to patient and family.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE HOSPITALIZED PATIENT RECOVERING FROM SURGERY}

The Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS) is a helpful model used by nurses in the postoperative phase of care (see Chap. 18, Fig. 18-1). Phenomena of concern to nurses on the clinical unit in the postoperative phase of care include nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes for patients and their families. Additional areas of concern include collaborative problems and expected goals.

\section*{Assessment}

Assessment of the hospitalized postoperative patient includes monitoring vital signs and completing a review of the systems upon arrival of the patient to the clinical unit and thereafter (see Chart 20-2).

Respiratory status is important because pulmonary complications are among the most frequent and serious problems encountered by the surgical patient. The nurse observes for airway patency and the quality of respirations, including depth, rate, and sound. Chest auscultation verifies that breath sounds are normal (or not normal) bilaterally, and the findings are documented as a baseline for later comparisons. Often, because of the effects of pain medications, respirations are slow. Shallow and rapid respirations may be due to pain, constricting dressings, gastric dilation, or obesity. Noisy breathing may be due to obstruction by secretions or the tongue.

The nurse assesses the patient's pain level using a verbal or visual analog scale and assesses the characteristics of the pain. The
patient's appearance, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, skin color (adequate or cyanotic), and skin temperature (cold and clammy, warm and moist, or warm and dry) are clues to cardiovascular function. When the patient arrives in the clinical unit, the surgical site is observed for bleeding, type and integrity of dressing, and drains.

Also assessed when the patient arrives on the clinical unit are the patient's mental status and level of consciousness, speech, and orientation in comparison with preoperative baseline measures. Although a change in mental status or postoperative restlessness may be related to anxiety, pain, or medications, it may also be a symptom of oxygen deficit or hemorrhage. These serious causes must be investigated and excluded before other causes are pursued.

General discomfort resulting from lying in one position on the operating table, the surgeon's handling of tissues, the body's reaction to anesthesia, and anxiety are also common causes of restlessness. These discomforts may be relieved by administering the prescribed analgesics, changing the patient's position frequently, and assessing and alleviating the cause of anxiety. If tight, drainagesoaked bandages are causing discomfort, reinforcing or changing the dressing completely makes the patient more comfortable. The bladder is palpated for distention because urinary retention can also cause restlessness.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the assessment data, major nursing diagnoses may include the following:
- Risk for ineffective airway clearance related to depressed respiratory function, pain, and bed rest
- Acute pain related to surgical incision
- Decreased cardiac output related to shock or hemorrhage
- Activity intolerance related to generalized weakness secondary to surgery
- Impaired skin integrity related to surgical incision and drains
- Risk for imbalanced body temperature related to surgical environment and anesthetic agents
- Risk for imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements related to decreased intake and increased need for nutrients secondary to surgery
- Risk for constipation related to effects of medications, surgery, dietary change, and immobility
- Risk for urinary retention related to anesthetic agents
- Risk for injury related to surgical procedure or anesthetic agents
- Anxiety related to surgical procedure
- Risk for ineffective management of therapeutic regimen related to insufficient knowledge about wound care, dietary restrictions, activity recommendations, medications, follow-up care, or signs and symptoms of complications

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/ POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications may include the following:
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Hematoma
- Infection
- Wound dehiscence or evisceration

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient include optimal respiratory function, relief of pain, optimal cardiovascular function, increased activity tolerance, unimpaired wound healing, maintenance of body temperature, and maintenance of nutritional balance. Further goals include resumption of usual pattern of bowel and bladder elimination, identification of any perioperative positioning injury, acquisition of sufficient knowledge to manage self-care after discharge, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PREVENTING RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS}

Respiratory depressive effects of opioid medications, decreased lung expansion secondary to pain, and decreased mobility combine to put the patient at risk for common respiratory complications, particularly atelectasis (incomplete expansion of the lung), pneumonia, and hypoxemia (Finkelmeier, 2000; Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Atelectasis remains a risk for the patient who is not moving well or ambulating or who is not performing deepbreathing and coughing exercises or using an incentive spirometer. Signs and symptoms include decreased breath sounds over the affected area, crackles, and cough. Pneumonia is characterized by chills and fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Cough may or may not be present and may or may not be productive. Hypostatic pulmonary congestion, caused by a weakened cardiovascular system that permits stagnation of secretions at lung bases, may develop; it occurs most frequently in elderly patients who are not mobilized effectively. The symptoms are often vague, with perhaps a slight elevation of temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate
and a cough. Physical examination reveals dullness and crackles at the base of the lungs. If the condition progresses, the outcome may be fatal.

The types of hypoxemia that can affect postoperative patients are subacute and episodic. Subacute hypoxemia is a constant low level of oxygen saturation, although breathing appears normal. Episodic hypoxemia develops suddenly, and the patient may be at risk for cerebral dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrest. Patients at risk for hypoxemia include those who have undergone major surgery (particularly abdominal), are obese, or have preexisting pulmonary problems. Hypoxemia can be detected by pulse oximetry, which measures blood oxygen saturation. Factors that may affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings include cold extremities, tremors, atrial fibrillation, acrylic nails, and black or blue nail polish (these colors interfere with the functioning of the pulse oximeter; other colors do not).

Preventive measures and timely recognition of signs and symptoms help avert pulmonary complications. Strategies to prevent respiratory complications include use of an incentive spirometer and deep-breathing and coughing exercises. Crackles indicate static pulmonary secretions that need to be mobilized by coughing and deep-breathing exercises. When a mucus plug obstructs one of the bronchi entirely, the pulmonary tissue beyond the plug collapses, and a massive atelectasis results.

To clear secretions and prevent pneumonia, the nurse encourages the patient to turn frequently and take deep breaths at least every 2 hours. Coughing is also encouraged to dislodge mucus plugs. These pulmonary exercises should begin as soon as the patient arrives on the clinical unit and continue until the patient is discharged. Even if he or she is not fully awake from anesthesia, the patient can be asked to take several deep breaths. This helps to expel residual anesthetic agents, mobilize secretions, and prevent alveolar collapse (atelectasis). Careful splinting of abdominal or thoracic incision sites helps the patient overcome the fear that the exertion of coughing might open the incision. Analgesic agents are administered to permit more effective coughing, and oxygen is administered as prescribed to prevent or relieve hypoxia. To encourage lung expansion, the patient is encouraged to yawn or take sustained maximal inspirations to create a negative intrathoracic pressure of -40 mm Hg and expand lung volume to total capacity. Chest physical therapy may be prescribed if indicated.

Coughing is contraindicated in patients who have head injuries or who have undergone intracranial surgery (because of the risk for increasing intracranial pressure), as well as in patients who have undergone eye surgery (risk for increasing intraocular pressure) or plastic surgery (risk for increasing tension on delicate tissues). In patients with an abdominal or thoracic incision, the nurse teaches the patient how to splint the incision while coughing.

Most postoperative patients, especially the elderly and those with an abdominal or thoracic incision, are given an incentive spirometer to use. In incentive spirometry, the patient performs sustained maximal inspirations and can see the results of these efforts as they register on the spirometer. Such feedback encourages the patient to continue to take deep breaths to maximize voluntary lung expansion. A target is established for each patient. The patient first exhales, then places the lips around the mouthpiece and slowly inhales, trying to drive the piston on the device to a marked goal. Using a spirometer has several advantages: it encourages the patient to participate actively in treatment; it ensures that the maneuver is physiologically appropriate and is repeated; and it is a cost-effective way of preventing complications. A common recommendation for use of the incentive spirometer is 10 deep
breaths every hour while awake. Refer to Chapter 25 for additional discussion of incentive spirometry.

Early ambulation increases metabolism and pulmonary aeration and, in general, improves all body functions. The patient is encouraged to be out of bed as soon as possible (ie, on the day of surgery, or no later than the first postoperative day). This practice is especially valuable in preventing pulmonary complications in older patients.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

Most patients experience some pain after a surgical procedure (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Many factors (motivational, affective, cognitive, and emotional) influence the pain experience. Research findings have led to a better understanding of how perception, learning, personality, ethnic and cultural factors, and environment can affect anxiety, depression, and pain response (Schafheutle, Cantrill \& Noyce, 2001; Watt-Watson, Stevens, Garfinkel et al., 2001). The degree and severity of postoperative pain and the patient's tolerance for pain depend on the incision site, the nature of the surgical procedure, the extent of surgical trauma, the type of anesthetic agent, and how the agent was administered. The preoperative preparation received by the patient (including information about what to expect as well as reassurance and psychological support) is a significant factor in decreasing anxiety, apprehension, and even the amount of postoperative pain.

The reasons for controlling pain are compelling. There is a well-known correlation between frequency of complications and localization of pain (Moline, 2001). Intense pain stimulates the stress response, which adversely affects the cardiac and immune systems. When pain impulses are transmitted, muscle tension increases, as does local vasoconstriction. The ischemia in the affected area causes further stimulation of pain receptors. When these noxious impulses travel centrally, sympathetic activity is compounded, which increases myocardial demand and oxygen consumption. Research has shown that cardiovascular insufficiency occurs three times more frequently, and the incidence of infection is five times greater, in people with poor postoperative pain control (Moline, 2001; Schafheutle et al., 2001; Watt-Watson et al., 2001). The hypothalamic stress response is also responsible for an increase in blood viscosity and platelet aggregation. This can lead to phlebothrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Often the physician has prescribed different medications or dosages to cover various levels of pain. The nurse should discuss these options with the patient to determine the best medication. Then the nurse should assess the effectiveness of the medication periodically, beginning 30 minutes after administration or sooner if the medication is being delivered by patient-controlled analgesia.

\section*{Opioid Analgesics}

About one third of patients report severe pain, one third moderate pain, and one third little or no pain. These statistics do not mean that the patients in the last group have no pain; rather, they appear to activate psychodynamic mechanisms that impair the registering of pain ("gate closing" theory and nociceptive transmission). See Chapter 13 for a more detailed discussion of pain and the factors influencing the pain experience.

Opioid analgesics are commonly prescribed for pain and immediate postoperative restlessness. A preventive approach rather than an "as needed" (PRN) approach, is more effective in relieving pain. With a preventive approach, the medication is administered at prescribed intervals rather than when the pain becomes severe or unbearable. Many patients (and some health

\section*{Inadequate Dain Relief Eollowing Cardiac Surgery}

Watt-Watson, J., Stevens, B., Garfinkel, P., Streiner, D., \& Gallup, R. (2001). Relationships between nurses' pain knowledge and pain management outcomes for their postoperative cardiac patients. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 36(4), 535-545.

\section*{Purpose}

Although studies have examined nurses' knowledge and perceived barriers to pain management, few studies have examined the relationship of nurses' knowledge and their actual implementation of pain management strategies. This Canadian study investigated the relationship between nursing pain knowledge and pain management outcomes for postoperative coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

This was a descriptive, correlational, mixed between-within subjects design. A convenience sample of 94 nurses from four cardiovascular units in three university-affiliated hospitals were interviewed, along with 225 of their assigned patients. The nurses included 86 women and 8 men. The patients included 52 women and 173 men. Instruments used with the patients included the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (MPQ-SF), the present pain intensity (PPI) scale, and a visual analog scale (VAS); analgesic prescription and administration data were obtained by chart review. The Toronto Pain Management Inventory (TPMI) was used to measure pain knowledge in the nurses. The social desirability scale (SDS) was also used with the nurses.

\section*{Findings}

The majority of patients reported moderate to severe pain during the previous 24 hours ( $86 \%$ ) and at the time of interview while moving around ( $68 \%$ ). The mean total score on the MPQ-SF, which has a range of possible scores from 0 to 45 , was $11.8 \pm 7$. Chart review data indicated undermedication of patients for pain, with patients receiving only $47 \%$ of their prescribed analgesia. The nurses' scores on the TPMI indicated moderate pain knowledge, with the majority of nurses ( $53 \%$ ) scoring $69 \%$ or less and only $15 \%$ scoring $75 \%$ or greater on the inventory. While hospital policy required documentation of pain as a fifth vital sign, charting of pain was minimal and high pain ratings did not result in an increase in analgesics administered.

\section*{Nursing Implications}

Nurses caring for postoperative CABG patients need further education about pain management. Nurses also need to be aware that patients are undermedicated following CABG surgery and need to be more aware of patients' needs for medication, administer prescribed doses, and advocate for patients when pain medication is not prescribed.
care providers) are overly concerned with the risk of drug addiction in the postoperative patient. This risk, however, is negligible with the use of opioid medications for short-term pain control.

\section*{Patient-Controlled Analgesia}

Given the negative impact of pain on recovery, nurses need to think "pain prevention" rather than sporadic pain control and should encourage the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Patients recover more quickly when adequate pain measures are used, and PCA permits patients to administer their own pain
medication when needed (Quinn, 1999). The amount of medication delivered by the IV or epidural route and the time span during which the opioid medication is released are controlled by the PCA device. Self-administration promotes patient participation in care, eliminates delayed administration of pain medications, and maintains a therapeutic drug level.

Most patients are candidates for PCA. The two requirements for PCA are an understanding of the need to self-dose and the physical ability to self-dose. Upon sensing pain, the patient activates the medication-delivering pump with a hand-held button. PCA enables the patient to move, turn, cough, and take deep breaths with less pain, thus reducing postoperative pulmonary problems.

\section*{Epidural Infusions and Intrapleural Anesthesia}

For thoracic, orthopedic, obstetric, and major abdominal surgery, certain opioid analgesics may be administered by epidural or intrathecal infusion. Epidural infusions produce a more profound analgesia. Epidural infusions are used with caution in chest procedures because the effect of the analgesic may ascend along the spinal cord and affect respiration. Intrapleural anesthesia involves the administration of local anesthetic by a catheter between the parietal and visceral pleura. It provides sensory anesthesia without affecting motor function to the intercostal muscles. This anesthesia allows more effective coughing and deep breathing in conditions such as cholecystectomy, renal surgery, and rib fractures in which pain in the thoracic region would interfere with these functions.

A local opioid or a combination anesthetic (opioid plus local anesthetic agent) is used in the epidural infusion. Other local anesthetic methods may be used to provide analgesia and anesthesia. Intrapleural anesthesia has fewer adverse effects than systemic or spinal opioids and a lower incidence of urinary retention, vomiting, and pruritus when compared with thoracic epidural opioids (Moline, 2001; Quinn, 1999).

\section*{Other Pain Relief Measures}

For pain that is difficult to control, a subcutaneous pain management system may be used. This is a silicone catheter that is inserted at the affected area. The catheter is attached to a pump that delivers a continuous amount of local anesthetic at a specific amount determined and prescribed by the physician (Fig. 20-5).

Complete absence of pain in the area of the surgical incision may not occur for a few weeks, depending on the site and nature of surgery, but the intensity of postoperative pain gradually subsides on subsequent days. However, pain control continues to be an important concern for the patient and the nurse. Effective pain management allows the patient to participate in care, perform deep-breathing and leg exercises, and tolerate activity. As stated previously, poor pain control contributes to postoperative complications and increased length of stay. The nurse continues to assess the pain level, the effectiveness of pain medication, and factors that influence pain tolerance (eg, energy level, stress level, cultural background, meaning of pain to the patient). The nurse explains that taking pain medication before the pain becomes intense is more effective and offers pain medication at intervals rather than waiting for the patient to request medication. Nonpharmacologic pain relief measures, such as imagery, relaxation, massage, application of heat or cold (if prescribed), and distraction, can be used to supplement medications (Seers \& Carroll, 1998). Changing the patient's position, using distraction, applying cool washcloths to the face, and rubbing the back with a soothing lotion may be useful in relieving general discomfort

temporarily and rendering medication more effective when it is administered.

\section*{PROMOTING CARDIAC OUTPUT}

If signs and symptoms of shock or hemorrhage occur, treatment and nursing care are implemented as described in the discussion of care in the PACU.

> NURSING ALERT A systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg is usually considered reportable at once. However, the patient's preoperative or baseline blood pressure is used to make informed postoperative comparisons. A previously stable blood pressure that shows a downward trend of 5 mm Hg at each 15-minute reading should also be reported.

Although most patients do not hemorrhage or go into shock, changes in circulating volume, the stress of surgery, and the effects of medications and preoperative preparations all affect cardiovascular function. Intravenous fluid replacement is standard for up to 24 hours after surgery or until the patient is stable and tolerating oral fluids. Close monitoring is indicated to detect and correct conditions such as fluid volume deficit, altered tissue perfusion, and decreased cardiac output, all of which can increase the patient's discomfort, place him or her at risk for complications, and prolong the hospital stay. Some patients are at risk for fluid
volume excess secondary to existing cardiovascular or renal disease, advanced age, or the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone and antidiuretic hormone as a result of the stress of surgery. Consequently, fluid replacement must be carefully managed, and intake and output records must be accurate.

Nursing management includes assessing the patency of the IV lines and ensuring that the appropriate fluids are administered at the prescribed rate. Intake and output, including emesis and output from wound drainage systems, are recorded separately and totaled to determine fluid balance. If the patient has an indwelling urinary catheter, hourly outputs are monitored and rates of less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ are reported; if the patient is voiding, an output of less than 240 mL per 8-hour shift is reported. Electrolyte levels and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are monitored. Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels can indicate blood loss or dilution of circulating volume by IV fluids. If dilution is contributing to the decreased levels, the hemoglobin and hematocrit rise as the stress response abates and fluids are mobilized and excreted.

Venous stasis from dehydration, immobility, and pressure on leg veins during surgery put the patient at risk for deep vein thrombosis. Leg exercises and frequent position changes are initiated early in the postoperative period to stimulate circulation. Patients should avoid positions that compromise venous return, such as raising the bed's knee gatch or placing a pillow under the knees, sitting for long periods, and dangling the legs with pressure at the back of the knees. Venous return is promoted by elastic compression stockings and early ambulation. Early ambulation has a significant effect on recovery and the prevention of complications and can begin, in many instances, the evening of surgery. Postoperative activity orders are checked before getting the patient out of bed. Sitting up at the edge of the bed for a few minutes may be all the patient can tolerate at first.

\section*{ENCOURAGING ACTIVITY}

Most surgical patients are encouraged to be out of bed as soon as possible. Early ambulation reduces the incidence of postoperative complications, such as atelectasis, hypostatic pneumonia, gastrointestinal discomfort, and circulatory problems (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). Ambulation increases ventilation and reduces the stasis of bronchial secretions in the lung. It also reduces postoperative abdominal distention by increasing gastrointestinal tract and abdominal wall tone and stimulating peristalsis. Thrombophlebitis or phlebothrombosis occurs less frequently because early ambulation prevents stasis of blood by increasing the rate of circulation in the extremities. Pain is often decreased when early ambulation is possible, and the hospital stay is shorter and less costly, a further advantage to the patient and the hospital.

Despite the advantages of early ambulation, patients may be reluctant to get up the evening of surgery. Reminding them of the importance of early mobility in preventing complications may help them overcome their fears. One concern when the patient is to get out of bed for the first time is orthostatic hypotension, also called postural hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension is an abnormal drop in blood pressure that occurs as the patient changes from a supine to a standing position. It is common after surgery because of changes in circulating volume and bed rest. Signs and symptoms include a $20-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ decrease in systolic blood pressure or a $10-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ decrease in diastolic blood pressure, weakness, dizziness, and fainting. Older adults are at increased risk for
orthostatic hypotension secondary to age-related changes in vascular tone. To detect orthostatic hypotension, the nurse assesses the patient's feelings of dizziness and his or her blood pressure first in the supine position, after the patient sits up, again after the patient stands, and 2 to 3 minutes later. Gradual position change gives the circulatory system time to adjust. If the patient becomes dizzy, he or she should be returned to the supine position, and getting out of bed should be delayed for several hours.

To assist the postoperative patient in getting out of bed for the first time after surgery, the nurse performs the following actions:
1. Help the patient to move gradually from the lying position to the sitting position until dizziness passes. This can be achieved by raising the head of the bed.
2. Position the patient completely upright (sitting) and turned so that both legs are hanging over the edge of the bed.
3. Assist the patient to stand beside the bed.

When accustomed to the upright position, the patient may start to walk. The nurse should be at the patient's side to give physical support and encouragement. Care must be taken not to tire the patient; the extent of the first few periods of ambulation varies with the type of surgical procedure and the patient's physical condition and age.

Whether or not the patient can ambulate early in the postoperative period, bed exercises are encouraged to improve circulation. Bed exercises consist of the following:
- Arm exercises (full range of motion, with specific attention to abduction and external rotation of the shoulder)
- Hand and finger exercises
- Foot exercises to prevent deep vein thrombosis, foot drop, and toe deformities and to aid in maintaining good circulation
- Leg flexion and leg-lifting exercises to prepare the patient for ambulation
- Abdominal and gluteal contraction exercises

Hampered by pain, dressings, IV lines, or drains, many patients cannot engage in activity without assistance. Prolonged inactivity may lead to pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, atelectasis, or hypostatic pneumonia. Helping the patient increase his or her activity level on the first postoperative day is an important nursing function. One way to increase the patient's activity is to have the patient perform as much routine hygiene care as possible. Setting up the patient to bathe with a bedside wash basin or, if possible, assisting the patient to the bathroom to sit in a chair at the sink not only gets the patient moving but helps restore a sense of self-control and prepares the patient for discharge.

To be safely discharged to home, patients need to be able to ambulate a functional distance (length of the house or apartment), get in and out of bed unassisted, and be independent with toileting. Patients can be asked to perform as much as they can and then to call for assistance. The patient and the nurse can collaborate on a schedule for progressive activity that includes ambulating in the room and hallway and sitting out of bed in the chair. Assessing the patient's vital signs before, during, and after a scheduled activity helps the nurse and patient determine the rate of progression. By providing physical support, the nurse maintains the patient's safety; by communicating a positive attitude about the patient's ability to perform the activity, the nurse pro-
motes the patient's confidence. The nurse should make sure the patient continues to perform bed exercises, wears pneumatic compression or thigh-high elastic compression stockings when in bed, and rests as needed.

\section*{PROMOTING WOUND HEALING}

Ongoing assessment of the surgical site involves inspection for approximation of wound edges, integrity of sutures or staples, redness, discoloration, warmth, swelling, unusual tenderness, or drainage. The area around the wound should also be inspected for reactions to tape or trauma from tight bandages.

Nursing interventions to promote wound healing also include management of surgical drains and dressings. Wound drains are tubes exiting the peri-incisional area into either a portable wound suction device (closed) or into the dressings (open). The principle involved is to allow the escape of blood and serous fluids that can otherwise serve as a culture medium for bacteria. In portable wound suction, the use of gentle, constant suction enhances drainage of these fluids and collapses the skin flaps against the underlying tissue, thus removing "dead space." Types of wound drains include the Penrose, Hemovac, and Jackson-Pratt drains (Fig. 20-6). Output from wound drainage systems and all new drainage is recorded. The amount of bloody drainage on the surgical dressing is assessed frequently. Spots of drainage on the dressings are outlined with a pen, and the date and time of the outline are recorded on the dressing so that increased drainage can be easily seen. A certain amount of bloody drainage in a wound drainage system or on the dressing is expected, but excessive amounts should be reported to the surgeon. Increasing amounts of fresh blood on the dressing should be reported immediately. Some wounds are irrigated heavily before closure in the operating room, and open drains exiting the wound may be embedded in the dressings. These wounds may drain large amounts of blood-tinged fluid that saturate the dressing. The dressing can be reinforced with sterile gauze bandages; the time that they were reinforced should be documented. If drainage continues, the surgeon should be notified so that the dressing can be changed. Multiple similar drains are numbered or otherwise labeled (eg, left lower quadrant, left upper quadrant) so that output measurements can be reliably and consistently recorded.

Surgical wound healing occurs in three phases: the inflammatory, proliferative, and maturation phases (Table 20-2). Wounds also heal by different mechanisms, depending on the condition
of the wound. These mechanisms include first-, second-, or thirdintention wound healing (Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999).

\section*{First-Intention Healing}

Wounds made aseptically, with a minimum of tissue destruction, and properly closed heal with little tissue reaction by first intention (primary union) (Fig. 20-7). When wounds heal by firstintention healing, granulation tissue is not visible and scar formation is minimal. Postoperatively, many of these wounds are covered with a dry sterile dressing. If a cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive was used to close the incision without the use of sutures, a dressing is contraindicated (Vargas \& Reger, 2000).

\section*{Second-Intention Healing}

Second-intention healing (granulation) occurs in infected wounds (abscess) or in wounds in which the edges have not been approximated. When an abscess is incised, it collapses partly, but the dead and the dying cells forming its walls are still being released into the cavity. For this reason, drainage tubes or gauze packing are inserted into the abscess pocket to allow drainage to escape easily. Gradually, the necrotic material disintegrates and escapes, and the abscess cavity fills with a red, soft, sensitive tissue that bleeds easily. This tissue is composed of minute, thinwalled capillaries and buds that later form connective tissue. These buds, called granulations, enlarge until they fill the area left by the destroyed tissue (see Fig. 20-7). The cells surrounding the capillaries change their round shape to become long, thin, and intertwined to form a scar (cicatrix). Healing is complete when skin cells (epithelium) grow over these granulations. This method of repair is called healing by granulation, and it takes place whenever pus is formed or when loss of tissue has occurred for any reason. When the postoperative wound is allowed to heal by secondary intention, it is usually packed with saline-moistened sterile dressings and covered with a dry sterile dressing.

\section*{Third-Intention Healing}

Third-intention healing (secondary suture) is used for deep wounds that have either not been sutured early or that break down and are resutured later, thus bringing together two apposing granulation surfaces. This results in a deeper and wider scar. These wounds are also packed postoperatively with moist gauze and covered with a dry sterile dressing.

As a wound heals, many factors, such as adequate nutrition, cleanliness, rest, and position, determine how quickly healing occurs. These factors are influenced by nursing interventions. Specific nursing assessments and interventions that address these factors and help to promote wound healing are presented in Table 20-3. Other nursing interventions include assessment and care of the wound.

\section*{CHANGING THE DRESSING}

While the first postoperative dressing is usually changed by a member of the surgical team, subsequent dressing changes in the immediate postoperative period are usually performed by the nurse. A dressing is applied to a wound for one or more of the following reasons: (1) to provide a proper environment for wound

healing; (2) to absorb drainage; (3) to splint or immobilize the wound; (4) to protect the wound and new epithelial tissue from mechanical injury; (5) to protect the wound from bacterial contamination and from soiling by feces, vomitus, and urine; (6) to promote hemostasis, as in a pressure dressing; and (7) to provide mental and physical comfort for the patient.

The patient is told that the dressing is to be changed and that changing the dressing is a simple procedure associated with little discomfort. The dressing change is performed at a suitable time (eg, not at mealtimes or when visitors are present). Privacy is provided, and the patient is not unduly exposed. The nurse should avoid referring to the incision as a scar since the term may have negative connotations for the patient. Assurance is given that the incision will shrink as it heals and the redness will fade.

The nurse carries out hand hygiene before and after the dressing change and wears disposable gloves for the dressing change itself. The tape or adhesive portion of the dressing is removed by pulling it parallel with the skin surface and in the direction of hair growth, rather than at right angles. Alcohol wipes or nonirritating solvents aid in removing adhesive painlessly and quickly. The old dressing is removed and then deposited in a container designated for biomedical waste disposal. In accordance with standard precautions, dressings are never touched by ungloved hands because of the danger of transmitting pathogenic organisms.

If the patient is sensitive to adhesive tape, the dressing may be held in place with hypoallergenic tape. Many tapes are porous to permit ventilation and prevent skin maceration. The correct way to apply tape is to place the tape at the center of the dressing and then press the tape down on both sides, applying tension evenly away from the midline. The wrong method of applying tapefixing one end of the tape to the skin and pulling it tight over the
dressing—often wrinkles and pulls the skin in the process. The resulting continuous and forceful traction produces a shearing effect, causing the epidermal layer to slip sideways and become separated from the deeper dermal layers. Some wounds become edematous after having been dressed, causing considerable tension on the tape. If the tape is not flexible, the stretching bandage will also cause a shear injury to the skin. This can result in denuded areas or large blisters. An elastic adhesive bandage (Elastoplast, Microfoam-3M) may be used to hold dressings in place over mobile areas, such as the neck or the extremities, or where pressure is required.

While changing the dressing, the nurse has an opportunity to teach the patient how to care for the incision and change the dressings at home. The nurse observes for indicators of the patient's readiness to learn, such as looking at the incision, expressing interest, or assisting in the dressing change. Information on self-care activities and possible signs of infection are summarized in Chart 20-3.

\section*{MAINTAINING NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE}

The patient is still at risk for malignant hyperthermia and hypothermia in the postoperative period (Fortunato-Phillips, 2000). Efforts are made to identify malignant hyperthermia and to treat it early and promptly (Redmond, 2001). (See the discussion of malignant hyperthermia in Chap. 19.)

Patients who have been anesthetized are susceptible to chills and drafts. Attention to hypothermia management, begun in the intraoperative period, extends into the postoperative period to prevent significant nitrogen loss and catabolism. Signs of hypothermia are reported to the physician. The room is maintained at a comfortable temperature, and blankets are provided to prevent chilling. Treatment includes oxygen administration, adequate

\section*{Chart 20-3 - PATIENT EDUCATION Wound Care Instructions}

\section*{Until Sutures Are Removed}
1. Keep the wound dry and clean.
- If there is no dressing, ask your nurse or physician if you can bathe or shower.
- If a dressing or splint is in place, do not remove it unless it is wet or soiled.
- If wet or soiled, change dressing yourself if you have been taught to do so; otherwise, call your nurse or physician for guidance.
- If you have been taught, instruction might be as follows: Cleanse area gently with sterile normal saline once or twice daily.
Cover with a sterile Telfa pad or gauze square large enough to cover wound.
Apply hypoallergenic tape (Dermacel or paper). Adhesive is not recommended because it is difficult to remove without possible injury to the incisional site.
2. Immediately report any of these signs of infection:
- Redness, marked swelling exceeding $1 / 2$ inch ( 2.5 cm ) from incision site; tenderness; or increased warmth around wound
- Red streaks in skin near wound
- Pus or discharge, foul odor
- Chills or temperature higher than $37.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$
3. If soreness or pain causes discomfort, apply a dry cool pack (containing ice or cold water) or take prescribed
acetaminophen tablets (2) every 4-6 hours. Avoid using aspirin without direction or instruction because bleeding can occur with its use.
4. Swelling after surgery is common. To help reduce swelling, elevate the affected part to the level of the heart.
- Hand or arm

Sleep-elevate arm on pillow at side
Sitting-place arm on pillow on adjacent table
Standing-rest affected hand on opposite shoulder; support elbow with unaffected hand
- Leg or foot

Sitting-place a pillow on a facing chair; provide support underneath the knee
Lying-place a pillow under affected leg

\section*{After Sutures Are Removed}

Although the wound appears to be healed when sutures are removed, it is still tender and will continue to heal and strengthen for several weeks.
1. Follow recommendations of physician or nurse regarding extent of activity.
2. Keep suture line clean; do not rub vigorously; pat dry. Wound edges may look red and may be slightly raised. This is normal.
3. If the site continues to be red, thick, and painful to pressure after 8 weeks, consult the health care provider. (This may be due to excessive collagen formation and should be checked.)
hydration, and proper nutrition. The patient is also monitored for cardiac dysrhythmias. The risk for hypothermia is greater in the elderly and in patients who were in the cool operating room environment for a prolonged period.

\section*{MANAGING GASTROINTESTINAL FUNCTION AND RESUMING NUTRITION}

Gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting, hiccups) and resumption of oral intake are issues for both the patient and the nurse. Nausea and vomiting are common after anesthesia (Litwack, 1999; Meeker \& Rothrock, 1999). They are more common in women, obese people (fat cells act as reservoirs for the anesthetic), patients prone to motion sickness, and patients who have undergone lengthy surgical procedures. Other causes of postoperative vomiting include an accumulation of fluid in the stomach, inflation of the stomach, and the ingestion of food and fluid before peristalsis resumes.

When vomiting is likely because of the nature of surgery, a nasogastric tube is inserted preoperatively and remains in place throughout the surgery and the immediate postoperative period. In addition, a nasogastric tube may be inserted when a patient who has food in the stomach requires emergency surgery.

Hiccups, produced by intermittent spasms of the diaphragm secondary to irritation of the phrenic nerve, can occur after surgery. The irritation may be direct, such as from stimulation of the nerve by a distended stomach, subdiaphragmatic abscess, or abdominal distention; indirect, such as from toxemia or uremia that stimulates the center; or reflexive, such as irritation from a drainage tube or obstruction of the intestines. Usually these occurrences are mild, transitory attacks that cease spontaneously. When hiccups persist, they may produce considerable distress and serious effects such as vomiting, exhaustion, and wound dehiscence. The physician may prescribe phenothiazine medications for severe, persistent hiccups.

Once nausea and vomiting have subsided and the patient is fully awake and alert, the sooner he or she can tolerate a usual diet, the more quickly normal gastrointestinal function will resume. Taking food by mouth stimulates digestive juices and promotes gastric function and intestinal peristalsis. The return to normal dietary intake should proceed at the pace set by the patient. Of course, the nature of surgery and the type of anesthesia directly affect the rate at which normal gastric activity resumes. Liquids are typically the first substances desired and tolerated by the patient after surgery. Water, fruit juices, and tea may be given in increasing amounts. Cool fluids are tolerated more easily than those that are ice cold or hot. Soft foods (gelatin, custard, milk, and creamed soups) are added gradually after clear fluids have been tolerated. As soon as the patient tolerates soft foods well, solid food may be given.

Assessment and management of gastrointestinal function are important after surgery because the gastrointestinal tract is subject to uncomfortable or potentially life-threatening complications. Any postoperative patient may suffer from distention. Postoperative distention of the abdomen results from the accumulation of gas in the intestinal tract. Manipulation of the abdominal organs during surgery may produce a loss of normal peristalsis for 24 to 48 hours, depending on the type and extent of surgery. Even though nothing is given by mouth, swallowed air and gastrointestinal secretions enter the stomach and the intestines; if not propelled by peristalsis, they collect in the intestines, producing distention and causing the patient to complain of fullness or pain in the abdomen. Most often, the gas collects in the colon.

Abdominal distention is further increased by immobility, anesthetic agents, and the use of opioid medications.

After major abdominal surgery, distention may be avoided by having the patient turn frequently, exercise, and ambulate as early as possible. This also alleviates distention produced by swallowing air, which is common in anxious patients. When postoperative distention is anticipated, a nasogastric tube may be inserted before surgery. The tube may remain in place until full peristaltic activity (indicated by the passage of flatus) has resumed. The nurse can determine when peristaltic bowel sounds return by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope. Bowel sounds are documented so that diet progression can occur.

Paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction are potential postoperative complications that occur more frequently in patients undergoing intestinal or abdominal surgery. Refer to Chapter 37 for discussion of treatment.

\section*{PROMOTING BOWEL FUNCTION}

Constipation is common after surgery and can range from a minor irritation to a serious complication (Fox, 1998). Decreased mobility, decreased oral intake, and opioid analgesics contribute to difficulty having a bowel movement. In addition, irritation and trauma to the bowel during surgery may inhibit intestinal movement for several days. The combined effect of early ambulation, improved dietary intake, and a stool softener (if prescribed) promotes bowel elimination. Until the patient reports return of normal bowel function, the nurse should assess the abdomen for distention and the presence and frequency of bowel sounds. If the abdomen is not distended and bowel sounds are normal, and if the patient does not have a bowel movement by the second or third postoperative day, the physician should be notified so that a laxative can be given that evening.

\section*{MANAGING VOIDING}

Urinary retention after surgery can occur for various reasons. Anesthetics, anticholinergic agents, and opioids interfere with the perception of bladder fullness and the urge to void and inhibit the ability to initiate voiding and completely empty the bladder. Abdominal, pelvic, and hip surgery may increase the likelihood of retention secondary to pain. Additionally, some patients find it difficult to use the bedpan or urinal in the recumbent position.

Bladder distention and the urge to void should be assessed on the patient's arrival on the unit and frequently thereafter. The patient is expected to void within 8 hours of surgery (this includes time spent in the PACU). If the patient has an urge to void and cannot, or if the bladder is distended and no urge is felt or the patient cannot void, catheterization is not delayed solely on the basis of the 8-hour time frame. All methods to encourage the patient to void should be tried (eg, letting water run, applying heat to the perineum). The bedpan should be warm; a cold bedpan causes discomfort and automatic tightening of muscles (including the urethral sphincter). When the patient cannot void on a bedpan, it may be permissible to use a commode rather than resorting to catheterization. Male patients are often permitted to sit up or stand beside the bed to use the urinal, but safeguards should be taken to prevent the patient from falling or fainting due to loss of coordination from medications or orthostatic hypotension. If the patient cannot void in the specified time frame, the patient is catheterized and the catheter removed after the bladder has emptied. Straight intermittent catheterization is preferred over indwelling catheterization because the risk for infection is increased with an indwelling catheter.

Even if the patient voids, the bladder may not necessarily be empty. The nurse notes the amount of urine voided and palpates the suprapubic area for distention or tenderness. A portable ultrasound device may also be used to assess residual volume. Intermittent catheterization continues every 4 to 6 hours until the patient can void spontaneously and the postvoid residual is less than 100 mL .

\section*{MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT}

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient recovering from anesthesia should have all side rails up, and the bed should be in the low position. The nurse assesses the patient's level of consciousness and orientation and determines if the patient needs his or her eyeglasses or hearing aid, because impaired vision, inability to hear postoperative instructions, or inability to communicate verbally place the patient at risk for injury. All objects the patient may need should be within reach, especially the call bell. Any immediate postoperative orders concerning special positioning, equipment, or interventions should be implemented as soon as possible. The patient is instructed to ask for assistance with any activity. Although they are occasionally necessary for the disoriented patient, restraints should not be used if at all possible.

Any surgical procedure has the potential for injury due to disrupted neurovascular integrity resulting from prolonged awkward positioning in the operating room, manipulation of tissues, inadvertent severing of nerves, or tight bandages. Any orthopedic surgery or surgery involving the extremities carries a risk for peripheral nerve damage. Vascular surgeries, such as replacing sections of diseased peripheral arteries or inserting an arteriovenous graft, put the patient at risk for thrombus formation at the surgical site and subsequent ischemia of tissues distal to the thrombus. Assessment includes having the patient move the hand or foot distal to the surgical site through a full range of motion, assessing that all surfaces have intact sensation, and assessing peripheral pulses.

\section*{PROVIDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT}

\section*{TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY}

Although patients and families are undoubtedly relieved that surgery is over, anxiety levels may remain high in the immediate postoperative period. Many factors contribute to this anxiety: pain, being in an unfamiliar environment, feeling unable to control one's circumstances, fear of the long-term effects of surgery, fear of complications, loss of ability to care for self, fatigue, spiritual distress, altered role responsibilities, ineffective coping, and altered body image are all potential reactions to the surgical experience. The nurse helps the patient and family work through their anxieties by providing reassurance and information and by spending time listening to and addressing their concerns. The nurse describes hospital routines and what to expect in the ensuing hours and days until discharge and explains the purpose of nursing assessments and interventions. Informing patients when they will be able to drink fluids or eat, when they will be getting out of bed, and when tubes and drains will be removed helps them gain a sense of control and participation in recovery and engages them in the plan of care. Acknowledging family members' concerns and accepting and encouraging their participation in the patient's care assists them in feeling they are helping their loved one. The nurse can manipulate the environment to enhance rest and relaxation by providing privacy, reducing noise, adjusting the lighting, providing enough seating for family members, and performing any other measures that will produce a supportive atmosphere.

\section*{MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Deep Vein Thrombosis}

Deep vein thrombosis and other complications, such as pulmonary embolism, are serious potential complications of surgery (Chart 20-4). The stress response that is initiated as a result of surgery inhibits the fibrinolytic system, resulting in blood hypercoagulability. Dehydration, low cardiac output, blood pooling in the extremities, and bed rest add to the risk of thrombosis formation. Although all postoperative patients are at some risk, certain surgeries and patient populations carry a greater risk. The first symptom of deep vein thrombosis may be a pain or cramp in the calf. Although not present in all cases, calf pain elicited on ankle dorsiflexion (Homans' sign) suggests thrombosis (Fig. 20-8). Initial pain and tenderness may be followed by a painful swelling of the entire leg, often accompanied by a fever, chills, and diaphoresis.

Prophylactic treatment for postoperative patients at risk is common practice. Low-dose heparin may be prescribed and administered subcutaneously until the patient is ambulatory. Low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose warfarin are other anticoagulants that may be used. External pneumatic compression and thigh-high elastic compression stockings can be used alone or in combination with low-dose heparin.

\section*{Risk Factors for Postoperative Complications}

Patients at increased risk for postoperative complications (eg, deep vein thrombosis) and pulmonary problems include the following:
Deep Vein Thrombosis
- Orthopedic patients having hip surgery, knee reconstruction, and other lower extremity surgery
- Urologic patients having transurethral prostatectomy, and older patients having urologic surgery
- General surgical patients over 40 years of age, those who are obese, those with a malignancy, those who have had prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or those undergoing extensive, complicated surgical procedures
- Gynecology (and obstetric) patients over 40 years of age with added risk factors (varicose veins, previous venous thrombosis, infection, malignancy, obesity)
- Neurosurgical patients, similar to other surgical high-risk groups (in patients with stroke, for instance, the risk of deep vein thrombosis in the paralyzed leg is as high as $75 \%$ )

\section*{Pulmonary Complications}

- Sepsis
- Obesity-weight greater than $110 \%$ of ideal body weight
- Prolonged bed rest
- Duration of surgical procedure-more than 3 hours
- Aspiration
- Dehydration
- Malnutrition
- Hypotension and shock
- Immunosuppression

(B) The affected leg may swell; veins are more prominent and may be palpated easily.}
\end{figure}

The benefits of early ambulation and hourly leg exercises in preventing deep vein thrombosis cannot be overemphasized, and these activities are recommended for all patients, regardless of their risk. It is important to avoid the use of blanket rolls, pillow rolls, or any form of elevation that can constrict vessels under the knees. Even prolonged "dangling" (having the patient sit on the edge of the bed with legs hanging over the side) can be dangerous and is not recommended in susceptible patients because pressure under the knees can impede circulation. Adequate hydration is also encouraged; the patient can be offered juices and water
throughout the day to avoid dehydration. Refer to Chapter 30 for a complete discussion of deep vein thrombosis and to Chapter 23 for discussion of pulmonary embolus.

\section*{Hematoma}

At times, concealed bleeding occurs beneath the skin at the surgical site. This hemorrhage usually stops spontaneously but results in clot (hematoma) formation within the wound. If the clot is small, it will be absorbed and need not be treated. When the clot is large, the wound usually bulges somewhat, and healing will be delayed unless the clot is removed. After several sutures are removed by the physician, the clot is evacuated and the wound is packed lightly with gauze. Healing occurs usually by granulation, or a secondary closure may be performed.

\section*{Infection (Wound Sepsis)}

The creation of a surgical wound disrupts the integrity of the skin and its protective function. Exposure of deep body tissues to pathogens in the environment places the patient at risk for infection of the surgical site, a potentially life-threatening complication. Surgical site infection increases hospital length of stay, costs of care, and risk for further complications. In postoperative patients, surgical site infection is the most common nosocomial infection, with $67 \%$ of these infections occurring within the incision and $33 \%$ occurring in an organ or space around the surgical site (CDC, 1999). Recent research suggests that the administration of supplemental oxygen during colorectal resection and for 2 hours postoperatively reduces the incidence of postoperative infection (Greif, Ozan, Horn et al., 2000).

Multiple factors place the patient at risk for wound infection. One risk factor is the wound classification. Surgical wounds are classified according to the degree of contamination. Table 20-4 defines the terms used to describe surgical wounds and gives the expected rate of wound infection per category. Other risk factors

include both patient-related factors and those associated with the surgical procedure. Patient-related factors include age, nutritional status, diabetes, smoking, obesity, remote infections, endogenous mucosal microorganisms, altered immune response, length of preoperative stay, and severity of illness (Bryant, 2000). Factors related to the surgical procedure include the method of preoperative skin preparation, surgical attire of the team, method of sterile draping, duration of surgery, antimicrobial prophylaxis, aseptic technique, factors related to surgical technique, drains or foreign material, operating room ventilation, and exogenous microorganisms. Efforts to prevent wound infection are directed at reducing these risks. Preoperative and intraoperative risks and interventions are discussed in Chapters 18 and 19. Although the conditions for surgical site infection and serious contamination of the wound occur in the preoperative and intraoperative time frames, postoperative care of the wound centers on assessing the wound, preventing contamination and infection before wound edges have sealed, and enhancing healing.

Wound infection may not present until at least postoperative day 5. Most patients are discharged before that time, and more than half of wound infections are diagnosed after discharge, highlighting the importance of patient education regarding wound care. Risk factors for wound sepsis include wound contamination, foreign body, faulty suturing technique, devitalized tissue, hematoma, debilitation, dehydration, malnutrition, anemia, advanced age, extreme obesity, shock, length of preoperative hospitalization, duration of surgical procedure, and associated disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression). Signs and symptoms of wound infection include pulse rate and temperature elevation; an elevated white blood cell count; wound swelling, warmth, tenderness, or discharge; and incisional pain. Local signs may be absent if the infection is deep. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for many postoperative wound infections. Other infections may result from Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other organisms. Although rare, beta-hemolytic streptococcal or clostridial infections can be rapid and deadly. If wound infection due to beta-hemolytic streptococcus or clostridium occurs, extreme care is needed to prevent spread of infection to others. Intensive medical and nursing care is essential if the patient is to survive.

When a wound infection is diagnosed in a surgical incision, the surgeon may remove one or more sutures or staples and, using aseptic precautions, separate the wound edges with a pair of blunt scissors or a hemostat. Once the incision is opened, a drain is inserted. If the infection is deep, an incision and drainage procedure may be necessary. Antimicrobial therapy and a wound care regimen are also initiated (Byrant, 2000).

\section*{Wound Dehiscence and Evisceration}

Wound dehiscence (disruption of surgical incision or wound) and evisceration (protrusion of wound contents) are serious surgical complications (Fig. 20-9). Dehiscence and evisceration are especially serious when they involve abdominal incisions or wounds. These complications result from sutures giving way, from infection, and, more frequently, after marked distention or strenuous cough. They may also occur because of increasing age, poor nutritional status, and pulmonary or cardiovascular disease in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

When the wound edges separate slowly, the intestines may protrude gradually or not at all, and the earliest sign may be a gush of bloody (serosanguineous) peritoneal fluid from the wound. When a wound ruptures suddenly, coils of intestine may push out of the abdomen. The patient may report that "some-

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 20-9 (A) Wound dehiscence; (B) wound evisceration.}
\end{figure}
thing gave way." The evisceration causes pain and can be associated with vomiting.

NURSING ALERT When disruption of a wound occurs, the patient is placed in low Fowler's position and instructed to lie quietly. These actions minimize protrusion of body tissues. The protruding coils of intestine are covered with sterile dressings moistened with sterile saline solution, and the surgeon is notified at once.

An abdominal binder, properly applied, is an excellent prophylactic measure against an evisceration and often is used along with the primary dressing, especially in patients with weak or pendulous abdominal walls or when rupture of a wound has occurred.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

Older adults recover more slowly, have a longer hospital stay, and are at greater risk for developing postoperative complications (Polancyk et al., 2001). Delirium, pneumonia, decline in functional ability, exacerbation of comorbid conditions, pressure ulcers, decreased oral intake, gastrointestinal disturbance, and falls are all threats to recovery in the older adult. Expert nursing care can help the older adult avoid these complications or minimize their effects.

Postoperative delirium, characterized by confusion, perceptual and cognitive deficits, altered attention levels, disturbed sleep patterns, and impaired psychomotor skills, is a significant problem for older adults. Causes of delirium are multifactorial (Chart 20-5).

\section*{Causes of Postoperative Delirium}
- Fluid and electrolyte imbalance
- Dehydration
- Hypoxia
- Hypercarbia
- Acid-base disturbance
- Infection (urinary tract, wound, respiratory)
- Medications (anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, central nervous system depressants)
- Unrelieved pain
- Blood loss
- Decreased cardiac output
- Cerebral hypoxia
- Heart failure
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Hypothermia or hyperthermia
- Unfamiliar surroundings and sensory deprivation
- Emergent surgery
- Alcohol withdrawal
- Urinary retention
- Fecal impaction

Skilled and frequent assessment of mental status and of all physiologic factors influencing mental status helps the nurse plan care, because in the elderly patient delirium may be the initial or only early indicator of infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, or deterioration of respiratory or hemodynamic status. Factors that determine if the patient is at risk for delirium include age, history of alcohol abuse, preoperative cognitive function, physical function, serum chemistries, and type of surgery.

Recognizing postoperative delirium and identifying and treating its underlying cause are the goals of care. Postoperative delirium is sometimes mistaken for preexisting dementia or is attributed to age. In addition to monitoring and managing identifiable causes, nurses can implement supportive interventions. Keeping the patient in a well-lit room and close to the nurses' station can help with sensory deprivation. At the same time, distracting and unfamiliar noises should be minimized. Because pain can contribute to postoperative delirium, the nurse collaborates with the physician or geriatric nurse specialist and the patient to achieve pain relief without oversedation (Lynch, Lazor, Gellis et al., 1998). The patient is reoriented as often as necessary, and staff should introduce themselves each time they come in contact with the patient. Engaging the patient in conversation and care activities and placing a clock and calender nearby may improve cognitive function. Physical activity should not be neglected while the patient is confused, because physical deterioration can worsen delirium and place the patient at increased risk for other complications. Restraints should be avoided because they can also worsen confusion. If possible, a family member or staff member is asked to sit with the patient instead. Haloperidol (Haldol) or lorazepam (Ativan) may be given during episodes of acute confusion, but these medications should be discontinued as soon as possible to avoid side effects.

Other problems confronting the older postoperative patient, such as pneumonia, altered bowel function, deep vein thrombosis, weakness, and functional decline, often can be prevented by early and progressive ambulation. Ambulation means walking,
not just getting out of bed and sitting in a chair. Prolonged sitting positions that promote venous stasis in the lower extremities should be avoided. Assistance with ambulation may be required to keep the patient from bumping into objects and falling. A physical therapy referral may be indicated to promote safe, regular exercise for the older adult.

Urinary incontinence can be prevented by providing easy access to the call bell and the commode and by prompting voiding. Early ambulation and familiarity with the room help the patient to become self-sufficient sooner.

Optimal nutritional status is important for wound healing, return of normal bowel function, and fluid and electrolyte balance. The nurse and patient can consult with the dietitian to plan appealing, high-protein meals that provide sufficient fiber, calories, and vitamins. Nutritional supplements, such as Ensure or Sustacal, may be recommended. Multivitamins, iron, and vitamin C supplements aid in tissue healing, formation of new red blood cells, and overall nutritional status and are commonly prescribed postoperatively.

In addition to monitoring and managing the older adult's physiologic recovery, the nurse identifies and addresses psychosocial needs. The older adult may require more encouragement and support to resume activities, and the pace may be slower. Sensory deficits may require frequent repetition of instructions, and decreased physiologic reserve may necessitate frequent rest periods. The older adult may require extensive discharge planning to coordinate both professional and family care providers, and the nurse, social worker, or nurse case manager may institute the plan for continuing care.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

\section*{Teaching Patients Self-Care}

Patients have always required detailed discharge instructions to become proficient in special self-care needs after surgery; however, dramatically reduced hospital lengths of stay during the past decade have greatly increased the amount of information that should be provided while reducing the amount of time in which to provide it (Fox, 1998; Quinn, 1999). Although needs are specific to individual patients and the procedures they have undergone, general patient education needs for postoperative care have been identified (see Chart 20-1).

\section*{Continuing Care}

Continuing care provided by community-based services is frequently necessary after surgery. Older patients, patients who live alone, patients without family support, and patients with preexisting disabilities are often in greatest need. Planning for discharge involves arranging for necessary services early in the acute care hospitalization. Wound care, drain management, catheter care, infusion therapy, and physical or occupational therapy are some of the needs addressed by community health care providers. The home care nurse coordinates these activities and services.

During home care visits, the nurse assesses the patient for postoperative complications; the nurse also assesses the surgical incision, respiratory and cardiovascular status, adequacy of pain management, fluid and nutritional status, and the patient's progress in returning to preoperative status. The nurse assesses the patient's and family's ability to manage dressing changes and drainage systems and other devices and to administer prescribed medications. The nurse may change dressings or catheters if needed. The nurse determines if any additional services are
needed and assists the patient and family to arrange for them. Previous teaching is reinforced, and the patient is reminded to keep follow-up appointments. The patient and family are instructed about signs and symptoms to be reported to the surgeon. In addition, the nurse may provide information about how to obtain needed supplies and may suggest resources or support groups the patient may want to contact. In many settings, postoperative telephone calls are made to answer questions, assess recovery, and reassure patients and families.

\section*{Critical Thinking Exercises}
1. Your patient has a history of esophageal cancer and is HIV positive. After undergoing ambulatory surgery to insert a gastric feeding tube, he is to be discharged to home. Indicate which assessment findings would indicate his readiness for discharge. Describe a teaching plan for the patient and his family. How would you modify the plan if the patient lives alone?
2. A patient who has undergone abdominal surgery reports severe pain and as a result is unable to cough and deep breathe. When you listen to the patient's lungs you hear crackles in the bases. Analyze these findings and indicate the interventions you would implement in this situation. How would your care differ if the patient has a musculoskeletal disorder that makes turning and ambulation difficult?
3. You are visiting a 72-year-old woman who had emergency surgery for a broken hip 3 weeks ago and has returned to her home, where she is living alone. How would you direct your assessment to identify the factors that might affect her recovery? How would you modify your assessment and nursing care plan because of her age?

\section*{Assessment of Respiratory Function}

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

\section*{On completion of this chapter, the learner will be able to:}
1. Describe the structures and functions of the upper and lower respiratory tracts.
2. Describe ventilation, perfusion, diffusion, shunting, and the relationship of pulmonary circulation to these processes.
3. Discriminate between normal and abnormal breath sounds.
4. Use assessment parameters appropriate for determining the characteristics and severity of the major symptoms of respiratory dysfunction.
5. Identify the nursing implications of the various procedures used for diagnostic evaluation of respiratory function.

Disorders of the respiratory system are common and are encountered by nurses in every setting from the community to the intensive care unit. To assess the respiratory system, the nurse must be skilled at differentiating normal assessment findings from abnormal ones. Good assessment skills must be developed and used when caring for patients with acute and chronic respiratory problems. In addition, an understanding of respiratory function and the significance of abnormal diagnostic test results is essential.

\section*{Anatomic and Physiologic Overview}

The respiratory system is composed of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Together, the two tracts are responsible for ventilation (movement of air in and out of the airways). The upper tract, known as the upper airway, warms and filters inspired air so that the lower respiratory tract (the lungs) can accomplish gas exchange. Gas exchange involves delivering oxygen to the tissues through the bloodstream and expelling waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, during expiration.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT}

Upper airway structures consist of the nose, sinuses and nasal passages, pharynx, tonsils and adenoids, larynx, and trachea.

\section*{Nose}

The nose is composed of an external and an internal portion. The external portion protrudes from the face and is supported by the nasal bones and cartilage. The anterior nares (nostrils) are the external openings of the nasal cavities.

The internal portion of the nose is a hollow cavity separated into the right and left nasal cavities by a narrow vertical divider, the septum. Each nasal cavity is divided into three passageways by the projection of the turbinates (also called conchae) from the lateral walls. The nasal cavities are lined with highly vascular ciliated mucous membranes called the nasal mucosa. Mucus, secreted continuously by goblet cells, covers the surface of the nasal mucosa and is moved back to the nasopharynx by the action of the cilia (fine hairs).

The nose serves as a passageway for air to pass to and from the lungs. It filters impurities and humidifies and warms the air as it is inhaled. It is responsible for olfaction (smell) because the olfactory receptors are located in the nasal mucosa. This function diminishes with age.

\section*{Paranasal Sinuses}

The paranasal sinuses include four pairs of bony cavities that are lined with nasal mucosa and ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. These air spaces are connected by a series of ducts that drain into the nasal cavity. The sinuses are named by their location: frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary (Fig. 21-1). A prominent function of the sinuses is to serve as a resonating chamber in speech. The sinuses are a common site of infection.

\section*{Turbinate Bones (Conchae)}

The turbinate bones are also called conchae (the name suggested by their shell-like appearance). Because of their curves, these bones increase the mucous membrane surface of the nasal passages and slightly obstruct the air flowing through them (Fig. 21-2).

Air entering the nostrils is deflected upward to the roof of the nose, and it follows a circuitous route before it reaches the nasopharynx. It comes into contact with a large surface of moist, warm mucous membrane that catches practically all the dust and organisms in the inhaled air. The air is moistened, warmed to body temperature, and brought into contact with sensitive nerves. Some of these nerves detect odors; others provoke sneezing to expel irritating dust.

\section*{Pharynx, Tonsils, and Adenoids}

The pharynx, or throat, is a tubelike structure that connects the nasal and oral cavities to the larynx. It is divided into three regions: nasal, oral, and laryngeal. The nasopharynx is located posterior to the nose and above the soft palate. The oropharynx houses the faucial, or palatine, tonsils. The laryngopharynx extends from the hyoid bone to the cricoid cartilage. The epiglottis forms the entrance of the larynx.

The adenoids, or pharyngeal tonsils, are located in the roof of the nasopharynx. The tonsils, the adenoids, and other lymphoid tissue encircle the throat. These structures are important links in the chain of lymph nodes guarding the body from invasion by organisms entering the nose and the throat. The pharynx functions as a passageway for the respiratory and digestive tracts.

\section*{Larynx}

The larynx, or voice organ, is a cartilaginous epithelium-lined structure that connects the pharynx and the trachea. The major function of the larynx is vocalization. It also protects the lower
bronchoscopy: direct examination of larynx, trachea, and bronchi using an endoscope
cilia: short hairs that provide a constant whipping motion that serves to propel mucus and foreign substances away from the lung toward the larynx
crackles: soft, high-pitched, discontinuous popping sounds during inspiration caused by delayed reopening of the airways
diffusion: exchange of gas molecules from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
dyspnea: labored breathing or shortness of breath
hemoptysis: expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract
hypoxemia: decrease in arterial oxygen tension in the blood
hypoxia: decrease in oxygen supply to the tissues and cells
orthopnea: inability to breathe easily except in an upright position
physiologic dead space: portion of the tracheobronchial tree that does not participate in gas exchange
pulmonary perfusion: blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature
respiration: gas exchange between atmospheric air and the blood and between the blood and cells of the body
ventilation: movement of air in and out of airways
wheezes: continuous musical sounds associated with airway narrowing or partial obstruction

airway from foreign substances and facilitates coughing. It is frequently referred to as the voice box and consists of the following:
- Epiglottis-a valve flap of cartilage that covers the opening to the larynx during swallowing
- Glottis-the opening between the vocal cords in the larynx
- Thyroid cartilage-the largest of the cartilage structures; part of it forms the Adam's apple
- Cricoid cartilage-the only complete cartilaginous ring in the larynx (located below the thyroid cartilage)

\section*{Trachea}

The trachea, or windpipe, is composed of smooth muscle with C -shaped rings of cartilage at regular intervals. The cartilaginous rings are incomplete on the posterior surface and give firmness to the wall of the trachea, preventing it from collapsing. The trachea serves as the passage between the larynx and the bronchi.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT: LUNGS}

The lower respiratory tract consists of the lungs, which contain the bronchial and alveolar structures needed for gas exchange.

\section*{Lungs}

The lungs are paired elastic structures enclosed in the thoracic cage, which is an airtight chamber with distensible walls (Fig. 21-3). Ventilation requires movement of the walls of the thoracic cage and of its floor, the diaphragm. The effect of these movements is alternately to increase and decrease the capacity of the chest. When the capacity of the chest is increased, air enters through the trachea (inspiration) because of the lowered pressure within and inflates the lungs. When the chest wall and diaphragm return to their previous positions (expiration), the lungs recoil and force the air out through the bronchi and trachea. The inspiratory phase of respiration normally requires energy; the expiratory phase is normally passive. Inspiration occurs during the first third of the respiratory cycle, expiration during the latter two thirds.

\section*{PLEURA}

The lungs and wall of the thorax are lined with a serous membrane called the pleura. The visceral pleura covers the lungs; the parietal pleura lines the thorax. The visceral and parietal pleura and the small amount of pleural fluid between these two membranes serve to lubricate the thorax and lungs and permit smooth motion of the lungs within the thoracic cavity with each breath.

\section*{MEDIASTINUM}

The mediastinum is in the middle of the thorax, between the pleural sacs that contain the two lungs. It extends from the sternum to the vertebral column and contains all the thoracic tissue outside the lungs.

\end{figure}

\section*{LOBES}

Each lung is divided into lobes. The left lung consists of an upper and lower lobe, whereas the right lung has an upper, middle, and lower lobe (Fig. 21-4). Each lobe is further subdivided into two to five segments separated by fissures, which are extensions of the pleura.

\section*{BRONCHI AND BRONCHIOLES}

There are several divisions of the bronchi within each lobe of the lung. First are the lobar bronchi (three in the right lung and two in the left lung). Lobar bronchi divide into segmental bronchi ( 10 on the right and 8 on the left), which are the structures identified when choosing the most effective postural drainage position for a given patient. Segmental bronchi then divide into subsegmental bronchi. These bronchi are surrounded by connective tissue that contains arteries, lymphatics, and nerves.

The subsegmental bronchi then branch into bronchioles, which have no cartilage in their walls. Their patency depends entirely on the elastic recoil of the surrounding smooth muscle and
on the alveolar pressure. The bronchioles contain submucosal glands, which produce mucus that covers the inside lining of the airways. The bronchi and bronchioles are lined also with cells that have surfaces covered with cilia. These cilia create a constant whipping motion that propels mucus and foreign substances away from the lung toward the larynx.

The bronchioles then branch into terminal bronchioles, which do not have mucous glands or cilia. Terminal bronchioles then become respiratory bronchioles, which are considered to be the transitional passageways between the conducting airways and the gas exchange airways. Up to this point, the conducting airways contain about 150 mL of air in the tracheobronchial tree that does not participate in gas exchange. This is known as physiologic dead space. The respiratory bronchioles then lead into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs and then alveoli. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange takes place in the alveoli.

\section*{ALVEOLI}

The lung is made up of about 300 million alveoli, which are arranged in clusters of 15 to 20 . These alveoli are so numerous

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-484.jpg?height=1091&width=1473&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=264}

that if their surfaces were united to form one sheet, it would cover 70 square meters - the size of a tennis court.

There are three types of alveolar cells. Type I alveolar cells are epithelial cells that form the alveolar walls. Type II alveolar cells are metabolically active. These cells secrete surfactant, a phospholipid that lines the inner surface and prevents alveolar collapse. Type III alveolar cell macrophages are large phagocytic cells that ingest foreign matter (eg, mucus, bacteria) and act as an important defense mechanism.

\section*{FUNCTION OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM}

The cells of the body derive the energy they need from the oxidation of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. As with any type of combustion, this process requires oxygen. Certain vital tissues, such as those of the brain and the heart, cannot survive for long without a continuing supply of oxygen. However, as a result of oxidation in the body tissues, carbon dioxide is produced and must be removed from the cells to prevent the buildup of acid waste products. The respiratory system performs this function by facilitating life-sustaining processes such as oxygen transport, respiration and ventilation, and gas exchange.

\section*{Oxygen Transport}

Oxygen is supplied to, and carbon dioxide is removed from, cells by way of the circulating blood. Cells are in close contact with capillaries, whose thin walls permit easy passage or exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen diffuses from the capillary
through the capillary wall to the interstitial fluid. At this point, it diffuses through the membrane of tissue cells, where it is used by mitochondria for cellular respiration. The movement of carbon dioxide occurs by diffusion in the opposite direction-from cell to blood.

\section*{Respiration}

After these tissue capillary exchanges, blood enters the systemic veins (where it is called venous blood) and travels to the pulmonary circulation. The oxygen concentration in blood within the capillaries of the lungs is lower than in the lungs' air sacs (alveoli). Because of this concentration gradient, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli to the blood. Carbon dioxide, which has a higher concentration in the blood than in the alveoli, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. Movement of air in and out of the airways (ventilation) continually replenishes the oxygen and removes the carbon dioxide from the airways in the lung. This whole process of gas exchange between the atmospheric air and the blood and between the blood and cells of the body is called respiration.

\section*{Ventilation}

During inspiration, air flows from the environment into the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. During expiration, alveolar gas travels the same route in reverse.

Physical factors that govern air flow in and out of the lungs are collectively referred to as the mechanics of ventilation and include air pressure variances, resistance to air flow, and lung compliance.

\section*{AIR PRESSURE VARIANCES}

Air flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure. During inspiration, movement of the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration enlarges the thoracic cavity and thereby lowers the pressure inside the thorax to a level below that of atmospheric pressure. As a result, air is drawn through the trachea and bronchi into the alveoli.

During normal expiration, the diaphragm relaxes and the lungs recoil, resulting in a decrease in the size of the thoracic cavity. The alveolar pressure then exceeds atmospheric pressure, and air flows from the lungs into the atmosphere.

\section*{AIRWAY RESISTANCE}

Resistance is determined chiefly by the radius or size of the airway through which the air is flowing. Any process that changes the bronchial diameter or width affects airway resistance and alters the rate of air flow for a given pressure gradient during respiration (Chart 21-1). With increased resistance, greater-than-normal respiratory effort is required by the patient to achieve normal levels of ventilation.

\section*{COMPLIANCE}

The pressure gradient between the thoracic cavity and the atmosphere causes air to flow in and out of the lungs. When pressure changes are applied in the normal lung, there is a proportional change in the lung volume. A measure of the elasticity, expandability, and distensibility of the lungs and thoracic structures is called compliance. Factors that determine lung compliance are the surface tension of the alveoli (normally low with the presence of surfactant) and the connective tissue (ie, collagen and elastin) of the lungs.

Compliance is determined by examining the volume-pressure relationship in the lungs and the thorax. In normal compliance ( $1.0 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ), the lungs and thorax easily stretch and distend when pressure is applied. High or increased compliance occurs when the lungs have lost their elasticity and the thorax is overdistended (ie, in emphysema). When the lungs and thorax are "stiff," there is low or decreased compliance. Conditions associated with this include pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), all of which are discussed in later chapters in this unit. Measurement of compliance is one method used to assess the progression and improvement in ARDS. Lungs with decreased compliance require greater-than-normal energy expenditure to achieve normal levels of ventilation. Compliance is usually measured under static conditions.

\section*{Lung Volumes and Capacities}

Lung function, which reflects the mechanics of ventilation, is viewed in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities. Lung volumes are categorized as tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, and residual volume. Lung capacity is evaluated in terms of vital capacity, inspiratory capacity, functional residual capacity, and total lung capacity. These terms are described in Table 21-1.

\section*{Diffusion and Perfusion}

Diffusion is the process by which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged at the air-blood interface. The alveolar-capillary membrane is ideal for diffusion because of its large surface area and thin membrane. In the normal healthy adult, oxygen and carbon dioxide travel across the alveolar-capillary membrane without difficulty as a result of differences in gas concentrations in the alveoli and capillaries.

Pulmonary perfusion is the actual blood flow through the pulmonary circulation. The blood is pumped into the lungs by the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery divides into the right and left branches to supply both lungs. These two branches divide further to supply all parts of each lung. Normally about $2 \%$ of the blood pumped by the right ventricle does not perfuse the alveolar capillaries. This shunted blood drains into the left side of the heart without participating in alveolar gas exchange.

The pulmonary circulation is considered a low-pressure system because the systolic blood pressure in the pulmonary artery is 20 to 30 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure is 5 to 15 mm Hg . Because of these low pressures, the pulmonary vasculature normally can vary its capacity to accommodate the blood flow it receives. When a person is in an upright position, however, the pulmonary artery pressure is not great enough to supply blood to the apex of the lung against the force of gravity. Thus, when a person is upright, the lung may be considered to be divided into three sections: an upper part with poor blood supply, a lower part with maximal blood supply, and a section in between the two with an intermediate supply of blood. When a person lying down turns to one side, more blood passes to the dependent lung.

Perfusion also is influenced by alveolar pressure. The pulmonary capillaries are sandwiched between adjacent alveoli. If the alveolar pressure is sufficiently high, the capillaries will be squeezed. Depending on the pressure, some capillaries completely collapse, whereas others narrow.

Pulmonary artery pressure, gravity, and alveolar pressure determine the patterns of perfusion. In lung disease these factors vary, and the perfusion of the lung may become very abnormal.

\section*{Ventilation and Perfusion Balance and Imbalance}

Ventilation is the flow of gas in and out of the lungs, and perfusion is the filling of the pulmonary capillaries with blood. Adequate gas exchange depends on an adequate ventilation-perfusion ratio. In different areas of the lung, the ratio varies.

Alterations in perfusion may occur with a change in the pulmonary artery pressure, alveolar pressure, and gravity. Airway blockages, local changes in compliance, and gravity may alter ventilation.

A ventilation-perfusion $\dot{\mathrm{V}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ imbalance occurs from inadequate ventilation, inadequate perfusion, or both. There are four possible V/Q states in the lung: normal V/Q ratio, low V/Q ratio

(shunt), high $\dot{\mathrm{V}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio (dead space), and absence of ventilation and perfusion (silent unit) (Chart 21-2).

Ventilation and perfusion imbalance causes shunting of blood, resulting in hypoxia (low cellular oxygen level). Shunting appears to be the main cause of hypoxia after thoracic or abdominal surgery and most types of respiratory failure. Severe hypoxia results when the amount of shunting exceeds $20 \%$. Supplemental oxygen may eliminate hypoxia, depending on the type of $\dot{V} / \dot{Q}$ imbalance.

\section*{Gas Exchange}

The air we breathe is a gaseous mixture consisting mainly of nitrogen ( $78.62 \%$ ) and oxygen ( $20.84 \%$ ), with traces of carbon dioxide $(0.04 \%)$, water vapor $(0.05 \%)$, helium, and argon. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 760 mm Hg . Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by each type of gas in a mixture of gases. The partial pressure of a gas is proportional to the concentration of that gas in the mixture. The total pressure exerted by the gaseous mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures.

\section*{PARTIAL PRESSURE OF GASES}

Based on these facts, the partial pressures of nitrogen and oxygen can be calculated. The partial pressure of nitrogen is $79 \%$ of 760 ( $0.79 \times 760$ ), or 600 mm Hg ; that of oxygen is $21 \%$ of 760 ( 0.21 $\times 760$ ), or 160 mm Hg . Chart 21-3 spells out terms and abbreviations related to partial pressure of gases.

Once the air enters the trachea, it becomes fully saturated with water vapor, which displaces some of the gases so that the air pressure within the lung remains equal to the air pressure outside $(760 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$. Water vapor exerts a pressure of 47 mm Hg when
it fully saturates a mixture of gases at the body temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. Nitrogen and oxygen are responsible for the remaining 713 mm Hg (760-47) pressure. Once this mixture enters the alveoli, it is further diluted by carbon dioxide. In the alveoli, the water vapor continues to exert a pressure of 47 mm Hg . The remaining 713 mm Hg pressure is now exerted as follows: nitrogen, 569 mm Hg (74.9\%); oxygen, 104 mm Hg ( $13.6 \%$ ); and carbon dioxide, 40 mm Hg ( $5.3 \%$ ).

\section*{PARTIAL PRESSURE IN GAS EXCHANGE}

When a gas is exposed to a liquid, the gas dissolves in the liquid until an equilibrium is reached. The dissolved gas also exerts a partial pressure. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of the gas in the liquid is the same as the partial pressure of the gas in the gaseous mixture. Oxygenation of venous blood in the lung illustrates this point. In the lung, venous blood and alveolar oxygen are separated by a very thin alveolar membrane. Oxygen diffuses across this membrane to dissolve in the blood until the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is the same as that in the alveoli ( 104 mm Hg ). However, because carbon dioxide is a byproduct of oxidation in the cells, venous blood contains carbon dioxide at a higher partial pressure than that in the alveolar gas. In the lung, carbon dioxide diffuses out of venous blood into the alveolar gas. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and in alveolar gas is the same ( 40 mm Hg ). The changes in partial pressure are shown in Figure 21-5.

\section*{EFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON OXYGEN TRANSPORT}

Oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported simultaneously dissolved in blood or combined with some of the elements of blood. Oxygen is carried in the blood in two forms: first as physically dis-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-487.jpg?height=1545&width=1788&top_left_y=184&top_left_x=202)
solved oxygen in the plasma, and second in combination with the hemoglobin of the red blood cells. Each 100 mL of normal arterial blood carries 0.3 mL of oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma and 20 mL of oxygen in combination with hemoglobin. Large amounts of oxygen can be transported in the blood because it combines easily with hemoglobin to form oxyhemoglobin:

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Cheoret 21-3 \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
$\mathrm{P}=$ pressure \\
$\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ = partial pressure of oxygen \\
$\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ = partial pressure of carbon dioxide \\
$\mathrm{PAO}_{2}$ = partial pressure of alveolar oxygen \\
$\mathrm{PACO}_{2}=$ partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide \\
$\mathrm{PaO}_{2}=$ partial pressure of arterial oxygen \\
$\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}=$ partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide \\
$\mathrm{P} \overline{\mathrm{v}} \mathrm{O}_{2}=$ partial pressure of venous oxygen \\
$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{v}} \mathrm{CO}_{2}=$ partial pressure of venous carbon dioxide \\
$\mathrm{P}_{50}=$ partial pressure of oxygen when the hemoglobin is $50 \%$ saturated
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
$$\mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{Hgb} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{HgbO}_{2}$$

The volume of oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma varies directly with the partial pressure of oxygen in the arteries $\left(\mathrm{PaO}_{2}\right)$. The higher the $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, the greater the amount of oxygen dissolved. For example, at a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of $10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, 0.03 \mathrm{~mL}$ of oxygen is dissolved in 100 mL of plasma. At 20 mm Hg , twice this amount is dissolved in plasma, and at $100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, 10$ times this amount is dissolved. Therefore, the amount of dissolved oxygen is directly proportional to the partial pressure, regardless of how high the oxygen pressure rises.

The amount of oxygen that combines with hemoglobin also depends on $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, but only up to a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of about 150 mm Hg . When the $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is 150 mm Hg , hemoglobin is $100 \%$ saturated and will not combine with any additional oxygen. When hemoglobin is $100 \%$ saturated, 1 g of hemoglobin will combine with 1.34 mL of oxygen. Therefore, in a person with $14 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ of hemoglobin, each 100 mL of blood will contain about 19 mL of oxygen associated with hemoglobin. If the $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is less than 150 mm Hg , the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen is lower. For example, at a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of 100 mm Hg (normal value), saturation is $97 \%$; at a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of 40 mm Hg , saturation is $70 \%$.

\section*{OXYHEMOGLOBIN DISSOCIATION CURVE}

The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (Chart 21-4) shows the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen ( $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) and the percentage of saturation of oxygen ( $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ ). The percentage of saturation can be affected by the following factors: carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion concentration, temperature, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. A rise in these factors shifts the curve to the right so that more oxygen is then released to the tissues at the same $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$. A reduction in these factors causes the curve to shift to the left, making the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin stronger, so that less oxygen is given up to the tissues at the same $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$. The unusual shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is a distinct advantage to the patient for two reasons:
1. If the arterial $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ decreases from 100 to 80 mm Hg as a result of lung disease or heart disease, the hemoglobin of the arterial blood remains almost maximally saturated $(94 \%)$ and the tissues will not suffer from hypoxia.
2. When the arterial blood passes into tissue capillaries and is exposed to the tissue tension of oxygen (about 40 mm Hg ), hemoglobin gives up large quantities of oxygen for use by the tissues.

Clinical Significance. The normal value of $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ is 80 to 100 mm Hg ( $95 \%$ to $98 \%$ saturation). With this level of oxygenation, there is a $15 \%$ margin of excess oxygen available to the tissues. With a normal hemoglobin level of $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ level of 40 mm Hg (oxygen saturation 75\%), there is adequate oxygen available for the tissues but no reserve for physiologic stresses that increase tissue oxygen demand. When a serious incident occurs (eg, bronchospasm, aspiration, hypotension, or cardiac dysrhythmias) that reduces the intake of oxygen from the lungs, tissue hypoxia will result.

An important consideration in the transport of oxygen is cardiac output, which determines the amount of oxygen delivered to the body and which affects lung and tissue perfusion. If the cardiac output is normal ( $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ), the amount of oxygen delivered to the

\section*{Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve}

The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is marked to show three oxygen levels:
1. Normal levels- $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ above 70 mm Hg
2. Relatively safe levels- $\mathrm{PaO}_{2} 45$ to 70 mm Hg
3. Dangerous levels- $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ below 40 mm Hg

The normal (middle) curve ( N ) shows that $75 \%$ saturation occurs at a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of 40 mm Hg . If the curve shifts to the right (R), the same saturation ( $75 \%$ ) occurs at the higher $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of 57 mm Hg . If the curve shifts to the left $(\mathrm{L}), 75 \%$ saturation occurs at a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of 25 mm Hg .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-488.jpg?height=746&width=843&top_left_y=1816&top_left_x=1030)
body per minute is normal. If cardiac output falls, the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues also falls. Under normal conditions, most of the oxygen delivered to the body is not used. In fact, only 250 mL of oxygen is used per minute. Under normal conditions, this is approximately $25 \%$ of available oxygen. The rest of the oxygen returns to the right side of the heart, and the $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ of venous blood drops from 80 to 100 mm Hg to about 40 mm Hg .

\section*{Carbon Dioxide Transport}

At the same time that oxygen diffuses from the blood into the tissues, carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction (ie, from tissue cells to blood) and is transported to the lungs for excretion. The amount of carbon dioxide in transit is one of the major determinants of the acid-base balance of the body. Normally, only $6 \%$ of the venous carbon dioxide is removed, and enough remains in the arterial blood to exert a pressure of 40 mm Hg . Most of the carbon dioxide ( $90 \%$ ) enters the red blood cells; the small portion ( $5 \%$ ) that remains dissolved in the plasma $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ is the critical factor that determines carbon dioxide movement in or out of the blood.

In summary, the many processes involved in respiratory gas transport do not occur in intermittent stages; rather, they are rapid, simultaneous, and continuous.

\section*{Neurologic Control of Ventilation}

Resting respiration is the result of cyclical excitation of the respiratory muscles by the phrenic nerve. The rhythm of breathing is controlled by respiratory centers in the brain. The inspiratory and expiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons control the rate and depth of ventilation to meet the body's metabolic demands.

The apneustic center in the lower pons stimulates the inspiratory medullary center to promote deep, prolonged inspirations. The pneumotaxic center in the upper pons is thought to control the pattern of respirations.

Several groups of receptor sites assist in the brain's control of respiratory function. The central chemoreceptors are located in the medulla and respond to chemical changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, which result from chemical changes in the blood. These receptors respond to an increase or decrease in the pH and convey a message to the lungs to change the depth and then the rate of ventilation to correct the imbalance. The peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the aortic arch and the carotid arteries and respond first to changes in $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, then to $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ and pH . The Hering-Breuer reflex is activated by stretch receptors in the alveoli. When the lungs are distended, inspiration is inhibited; as a result, the lungs do not become overdistended. In addition, proprioceptors in the muscles and joints respond to body movements, such as exercise, causing an increase in ventilation. Thus, range-of-motion exercises in an immobile patient stimulate breathing. Baroreceptors, also located in the aortic and carotid bodies, respond to an increase or decrease in arterial blood pressure and cause reflex hypoventilation or hyperventilation.

\section*{Gerontologic Considerations}

A gradual decline in respiratory function begins in early to middle adulthood and affects the structure and function of the respiratory system. The vital capacity of the lungs and respiratory muscle strength peak between ages 20 and 25 and decrease thereafter. With aging (40 years and older), changes occur in the alveoli that reduce the surface area available for the exchange of oxygen and
carbon dioxide. At approximately age 50, the alveoli begin to lose elasticity. A decrease in vital capacity occurs with loss of chest wall mobility, thus restricting the tidal flow of air. The amount of respiratory dead space increases with age. These changes result in a decreased diffusion capacity for oxygen with age, producing lower oxygen levels in the arterial circulation. Elderly people have a decreased ability to move air rapidly in and out of the lungs. Gerontologic changes in the respiratory system are summarized in Table 21-2. Despite these changes, in the absence of chronic pulmonary disease, elderly people are able to carry out activities of daily living, but they may have decreased tolerance for and require additional rest after prolonged or vigorous activity.

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{HEALTH HISTORY}

The health history focuses on the physical and functional problems of the patient and the effect of these problems on his or her life. The reason the patient is seeking health care often is related to one of the following: dyspnea (shortness of breath), pain, accumulation of mucus, wheezing, hemoptysis (blood spit up from the respiratory tract), edema of the ankles and feet, cough, and general fatigue and weakness.

In addition to identifying the chief reason why the patient is seeking health care, the nurse tries to determine when the health problem or symptom started, how long it lasted, if it was relieved at any time, and how relief was obtained. The nurse collects information about precipitating factors, duration, severity, and associated factors or symptoms and also assesses for risk factors and genetic factors that may contribute to the patient's lung condition (Chart 21-5).

The nurse assesses the impact of signs and symptoms on the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living and to participate in usual work and family activities. In addition, psychosocial factors that may affect the patient are explored (Chart 21-6). These factors include anxiety, role changes, family relationships, financial problems, employment status, and the strategies the patient uses to cope with them.

Many respiratory diseases are chronic and progressively debilitating. Therefore, ongoing assessment of the patient's physical abilities, psychosocial supports, and quality of life is needed to plan appropriate interventions. It is important for the patient with a respiratory disorder to understand the condition and to be familiar with necessary self-care interventions. The nurse evaluates these factors over time and provides education as needed.

\section*{Signs and Symptoms}

The major signs and symptoms of respiratory disease are dyspnea, cough, sputum production, chest pain, wheezing, clubbing of the fingers, hemoptysis, and cyanosis. These clinical manifestations are related to the duration and severity of the disease.

\section*{DYSPNEA}

Dyspnea (difficult or labored breathing, shortness of breath) is a symptom common to many pulmonary and cardiac disorders, particularly when there is decreased lung compliance or increased airway resistance. The right ventricle of the heart will be affected ultimately by lung disease because it must pump blood through the lungs against greater resistance. It may also be associated with neurologic or neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or muscular dystrophy.

Clinical Significance. In general, acute diseases of the lungs produce a more severe grade of dyspnea than do chronic diseases. Sudden dyspnea in a healthy person may indicate pneumothorax (air in the pleural cavity), acute respiratory obstruction, or ARDS. In immobilized patients, sudden dyspnea may denote pulmonary embolism. Orthopnea (inability to breathe easily except in an upright position) may be found in patients with heart disease and occasionally in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); dyspnea with an expiratory wheeze occurs with COPD. Noisy breathing may result from a narrowing of the airway or localized obstruction of a major bronchus by a tumor or foreign body. The presence of both inspiratory and expiratory wheezing usually signifies asthma if the patient does not have heart failure.

The circumstance that produces the dyspnea must be determined. Therefore, it is important to ask the patient the following questions:
- How much exertion triggers shortness of breath?
- Is there an associated cough?
- Is dyspnea related to other symptoms?
- Was the onset of shortness of breath sudden or gradual?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-490.jpg?height=359&width=869&top_left_y=2251&top_left_x=106)
- At what time of day or night does the dyspnea occur?
- Is the shortness of breath worse when the patient is flat in bed?
- Does the shortness of breath occur at rest? With exercise? Running? Climbing stairs?
- Is the shortness of breath worse while walking? If so, when walking how far? How fast?

Relief Measures. The management of dyspnea is aimed at identifying and correcting its cause. Relief of the symptom sometimes is achieved by placing the patient at rest with the head elevated (high Fowler's position) and, in severe cases, by administering oxygen.

\section*{COUGH}

Cough results from irritation of the mucous membranes anywhere in the respiratory tract. The stimulus producing a cough may arise from an infectious process or from an airborne irritant, such as smoke, smog, dust, or a gas. The cough is the patient's chief protection against the accumulation of secretions in the bronchi and bronchioles.

Clinical Significance. Cough may indicate serious pulmonary disease. The nurse needs to evaluate the character of the coughis it dry, hacking, brassy, wheezing, loose, or severe? A dry, irritative cough is characteristic of an upper respiratory tract infection of viral origin or may be a side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Laryngotracheitis causes an irritative, high-pitched cough. Tracheal lesions produce a brassy cough. A severe or changing cough may indicate bronchogenic carcinoma. Pleuritic chest pain accompanying coughing may indicate pleural or chest wall (musculoskeletal) involvement.

Nursing Research Profile 21-1
Dyspnea Self-Management
Nield, M. (2000). Dyspnea self-management in African Americans with chronic lung disease. Heart \& Lung, 29(1), 50-55.

\section*{Purpose}

The purpose of this qualitative analysis, part of a larger study of the relationship between dyspnea and respiratory muscle function in patients with chronic lung disease, was to explore dyspnea selfmanagement in African Americans with COPD or chronic restrictive pulmonary disease resulting from sarcoidosis.

\section*{Study Sample and Design}

A qualitative study approach was used with a convenience sample of 29 patients recruited from the pulmonary clinic at a large medical center in the midwestern United States. Fifteen of the subjects had COPD and 14 had sarcoidosis. All routinely experienced dyspnea. A semistructured interview guide was used to obtain data. The taped interviews were transcribed and content analysis was performed using open coding methods.

\section*{Findings}

The investigators identified the following self-management themes from the data:
- Traditional medical care (formal health care and prescription medications)
- Self-care wisdom (learned insight regarding the impact of dyspnea on quality of life)
- Self-care action (specific strategies for dyspnea relief included exercise, environmental control, cognitive strategies, and controlled breathing, which refers to patient-initiated position and breathing to manage dyspnea). Patients with sarcoidosis used inhalation-focused breathing only, while patients with COPD used both inhalation- and exhalation-focused breathing.
- Self-care resources (internal or external assets that could be used for sustenance of the self-care actions such as spiritual and social support)

\section*{Nursing Implications}

These findings mirror previous research; however, this study extends previous knowledge as it focused on African Americans exclusively. When working with patients with chronic respiratory disorders, nurses should assess all four aspects of dyspnea selfmanagement, which reflect a holistic approach to care. Self-care actions should be encouraged and taught, and self-care resources facilitated. The breathing techniques used by patients with COPD and those with sarcoidosis should be considered during patient and family education. Further research is warranted to determine if the differences in the breathing techniques used by these two populations of patients are also found in a research study with a larger sample size.

The time of coughing is also noted. Coughing at night may herald the onset of left-sided heart failure or bronchial asthma. A cough in the morning with sputum production may indicate bronchitis. A cough that worsens when the patient is supine suggests postnasal drip (sinusitis). Coughing after food intake may indicate aspiration of material into the tracheobronchial tree. A cough of recent onset is usually from an acute infection.

\section*{SPUTUM PRODUCTION}

A patient who coughs long enough almost invariably produces sputum. Violent coughing causes bronchial spasm, obstruction, and further irritation of the bronchi and may result in syncope (fainting). A severe, repeated, or uncontrolled cough that is nonproductive is exhausting and potentially harmful. Sputum pro-

Various conditions that affect gas exchange and respiratory function are influenced by genetic factors, including:
- Asthma
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Cystic fibrosis
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

\section*{NURSING ASSESSMENTS}

\section*{FAMILY HISTORY ASSESSMENT}
- Assess family history for other family members with histories of respiratory impairment.
- Assess family history for individuals with early-onset chronic pulmonary disease, family history of hepatic disease in infants (clinical symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency).
- Inquire about family history of genetic cystic fibrosis.

\section*{MANAGEMENT ISSUES SPECIFIC TO GENETICS}
- Inquire whether DNA mutation or other genetic testing has been performed on affected family members.
- Refer for further genetic counseling and evaluation so that family members can discuss inheritance, risk to other family members, availability of genetic testing and gene-based interventions.
- Offer appropriate genetics information and resources.
- Assess patient's understanding of genetics information.
- Provide support to families with newly diagnosed geneticrelated respiratory disorders.
- Participate in management and coordination of care of patients with genetic conditions, individuals predisposed to develop or pass on a genetic condition.

duction is the reaction of the lungs to any constantly recurring irritant. It also may be associated with a nasal discharge.

Clinical Significance. A profuse amount of purulent sputum (thick and yellow, green, or rust-colored) or a change in color of the sputum probably indicates a bacterial infection. Thin, mucoid sputum frequently results from viral bronchitis. A gradual increase of sputum over time may indicate the presence of chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis. Pink-tinged mucoid sputum suggests

\section*{Chart 21-6 - ASSESSMENT}

\section*{Psychosocial Factors}

Questions to consider when assessing psychosocial factors related to pulmonary disease and respiratory function include:
- What strategies does the patient use to cope with the signs and symptoms and challenges associated with pulmonary disease?
- Does the patient exhibit anxiety, anger, hostility, dependency, withdrawal, isolation, avoidance, noncompliance, acceptance, or denial?
- What support systems does the patient use to cope with the illness?
- Are resources (relatives, friends, or community groups) available? Do the patient and family use them effectively?
a lung tumor. Profuse, frothy, pink material, often welling up into the throat, may indicate pulmonary edema. Foul-smelling sputum and bad breath point to the presence of a lung abscess, bronchiectasis, or an infection caused by fusospirochetal or other anaerobic organisms.

Relief Measures. If the sputum is too thick for the patient to expectorate, it is necessary to decrease its viscosity by increasing its water content through adequate hydration (drinking water) and inhalation of aerosolized solutions, which may be delivered by any type of nebulizer. Strategies to assist the patient to cough productively are discussed later in this chapter.

Smoking is contraindicated with excessive sputum production because it interferes with ciliary action, increases bronchial secretions, causes inflammation and hyperplasia of the mucous membranes, and reduces production of surfactant. Thus, smoking impairs bronchial drainage. When the person stops smoking, sputum volume decreases and resistance to bronchial infections increases.

The patient's appetite may decrease because of the odor of the sputum or the taste it leaves in the mouth. The nurse encourages adequate oral hygiene and wise selection of food, measures that will stimulate appetite. In addition, the nurse encourages the patient and family to remove sputum cups, emesis basins, and soiled tissues before mealtime. Encouraging the patient to drink citrus juices at the beginning of the meal may increase the palatability of the rest of the meal because these juices cleanse the palate of the sputum taste.

\section*{CHEST PAIN}

Chest pain or discomfort may be associated with pulmonary or cardiac disease. Chest pain associated with pulmonary conditions may be sharp, stabbing, and intermittent, or it may be dull, aching, and persistent. The pain usually is felt on the side where the pathologic process is located, but it may be referred elsewhere-for example, to the neck, back, or abdomen.

Clinical Significance. Chest pain may occur with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism with lung infarction, and pleurisy. It also may be a late symptom of bronchogenic carcinoma. In carcinoma the pain may be dull and persistent because the cancer has invaded the chest wall, mediastinum, or spine.

Lung disease does not always produce thoracic pain because the lungs and the visceral pleura lack sensory nerves and are insensitive to pain stimuli. However, the parietal pleura has a rich
supply of sensory nerves that are stimulated by inflammation and stretching of the membrane. Pleuritic pain from irritation of the parietal pleura is sharp and seems to "catch" on inspiration; patients often describe it as "like the stabbing of a knife." Patients are more comfortable when they lie on the affected side as this splints the chest wall, limits expansion and contraction of the lung, and reduces the friction between the injured or diseased pleurae on that side. Pain associated with cough may be reduced manually by splinting the rib cage.

The nurse assesses the quality, intensity, and radiation of pain and identifies and explores precipitating factors, along with their relationship to the patient's position. Also, it is important to assess the relationship of pain to the inspiratory and expiratory phases of respiration.

Relief Measures. Analgesic medications may be effective in relieving chest pain, but care must be taken not to depress the respiratory center or a productive cough, if present. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) achieve this goal and thus are used for pleuritic pain. A regional anesthetic block may be performed to relieve extreme pain.

\section*{WHEEZING}

Wheezing is often the major finding in a patient with bronchoconstriction or airway narrowing. It is heard with or without a stethoscope, depending on its location. Wheezing is a highpitched, musical sound heard mainly on expiration.

Relief Measures. Oral or inhalant bronchodilator medications reverse wheezing in most instances.

\section*{CLUBBING OF THE FINGERS}

Clubbing of the fingers is a sign of lung disease found in patients with chronic hypoxic conditions, chronic lung infections, and malignancies of the lung. This finding may be manifested initially as sponginess of the nailbed and loss of the nailbed angle (Fig. 21-6).

\section*{HEMOPTYSIS}

Hemoptysis (expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract) is a symptom of both pulmonary and cardiac disorders. The onset of hemoptysis is usually sudden, and it may be intermittent or continuous. Signs, which vary from blood-stained sputum to a

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
large, sudden hemorrhage, always merit investigation. The most common causes are:
- Pulmonary infection
- Carcinoma of the lung
- Abnormalities of the heart or blood vessels
- Pulmonary artery or vein abnormalities
- Pulmonary emboli and infarction

Diagnostic evaluation to determine the cause includes several studies: chest x-ray, chest angiography, and bronchoscopy. A careful history and physical examination are necessary to diagnose the underlying disease, irrespective of whether the bleeding involved a very small amount of blood in the sputum or a massive hemorrhage. The amount of blood produced is not always proportional to the seriousness of the cause.

First, it is important to determine the source of the bleedingthe gums, nasopharynx, lungs, or stomach. The nurse may be the only witness to the episode. When documenting the bleeding episode, the nurse considers the following points:
- Bloody sputum from the nose or the nasopharynx is usually preceded by considerable sniffing, with blood possibly appearing in the nose.
- Blood from the lung is usually bright red, frothy, and mixed with sputum. Initial symptoms include a tickling sensation in the throat, a salty taste, a burning or bubbling sensation in the chest, and perhaps chest pain, in which case the patient tends to splint the bleeding side. The term "hemoptysis" is reserved for the coughing up of blood arising from a pulmonary hemorrhage. This blood has an alkaline pH (greater than 7.0).
- If the hemorrhage is in the stomach, the blood is vomited (hematemesis) rather than coughed up. Blood that has been in contact with gastric juice is sometimes so dark that it is referred to as "coffee grounds." This blood has an acid pH (less than 7.0).

\section*{CYANOSIS}

Cyanosis, a bluish coloring of the skin, is a very late indicator of hypoxia. The presence or absence of cyanosis is determined by the amount of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. Cyanosis appears when there is $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ of unoxygenated hemoglobin. A patient with a hemoglobin level of $15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ will not demonstrate cyanosis until $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ of that hemoglobin becomes unoxygenated, reducing the effective circulating hemoglobin to two thirds of the normal level. An anemic patient rarely manifests cyanosis, and a polycythemic patient may appear cyanotic even if adequately oxygenated. Therefore, cyanosis is not a reliable sign of hypoxia.

Assessment of cyanosis is affected by room lighting, the patient's skin color, and the distance of the blood vessels from the surface of the skin. In the presence of a pulmonary condition, central cyanosis is assessed by observing the color of the tongue and lips. This indicates a decrease in oxygen tension in the blood. Peripheral cyanosis results from decreased blood flow to a certain area of the body, as in vasoconstriction of the nailbeds or earlobes from exposure to cold, and does not necessarily indicate a central systemic problem.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY STRUCTURES}

For a routine examination of the upper airway, only a simple light source, such as a penlight, is necessary. A more thorough examination requires the use of a nasal speculum.

\section*{Nose and Sinuses}

The nurse inspects the external nose for lesions, asymmetry, or inflammation and then asks the patient to tilt the head backward. Gently pushing the tip of the nose upward, the nurse examines the internal structures of the nose, inspecting the mucosa for color, swelling, exudate, or bleeding. The nasal mucosa is normally redder than the oral mucosa, but it may appear swollen and hyperemic if the patient has a common cold. In allergic rhinitis, however, the mucosa appears pale and swollen.

Next the nurse inspects the septum for deviation, perforation, or bleeding. Most people have a slight degree of septal deviation, but actual displacement of the cartilage into either the right or left side of the nose may produce nasal obstruction. Such deviation usually causes no symptoms.

While the head is still tilted back, the nurse inspects the inferior and middle turbinates. In chronic rhinitis, nasal polyps may develop between the inferior and middle turbinates; they are distinguished by their gray appearance. Unlike the turbinates, they are gelatinous and freely movable.

Next the nurse may palpate the frontal and maxillary sinuses for tenderness (Fig. 21-7). Using the thumbs, the nurse applies gentle pressure in an upward fashion at the supraorbital ridges (frontal sinuses) and in the cheek area adjacent to the nose (maxillary sinuses). Tenderness in either area suggests inflammation. The frontal and maxillary sinuses can be inspected by transillumination (passing a strong light through a bony area, such as the sinuses, to inspect the cavity; Fig. 21-8). If the light fails to penetrate, the cavity is likely to contain fluid or pus.

\section*{Pharynx and Mouth}

After the nasal inspection, the nurse may assess the mouth and pharynx, instructing the patient to open the mouth wide and take a deep breath. Usually this will flatten the posterior tongue and briefly allow a full view of the anterior and posterior pillars, tonsils, uvula, and posterior pharynx (Fig. 21-9). The nurse inspects these structures for color, symmetry, and evidence of exudate, ulceration, or enlargement. If a tongue blade is needed to depress the tongue to visualize the pharynx, it is pressed firmly beyond the midpoint of the tongue to avoid a gagging response.

\end{figure}

\section*{Trachea}

Next the position and mobility of the trachea are usually noted by direct palpation. This is performed by placing the thumb and index finger of one hand on either side of the trachea just above the sternal notch. The trachea is highly sensitive, and palpating too firmly may trigger a coughing or gagging response. The trachea is normally in the midline as it enters the thoracic inlet behind the sternum, but it may be deviated by masses in the neck or mediastinum. Pleural or pulmonary disorders, such as a pneumothorax, may also displace the trachea.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE LOWER RESPIRATORY STRUCTURES AND BREATHING}

\section*{Thorax}

Inspection of the thorax provides information about the musculoskeletal structure, the patient's nutritional status, and the respiratory system. The nurse observes the skin over the thorax for
color and turgor and for evidence of loss of subcutaneous tissue. It is important to note asymmetry, if present. When findings are recorded or reported, anatomic landmarks are used as points of reference (Chart 21-7).

\section*{CHEST CONFIGURATION}

Normally, the ratio of the anteroposterior diameter to the lateral diameter is $1: 2$. However, there are four main deformities of the chest associated with respiratory disease that alter this relationship: barrel chest, funnel chest (pectus excavatum), pigeon chest (pectus carinatum), and kyphoscoliosis.

Barrel Chest. Barrel chest occurs as a result of overinflation of the lungs. There is an increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax. In a patient with emphysema, the ribs are more widely spaced and the intercostal spaces tend to bulge on expiration. The appearance of the patient with advanced emphysema is thus quite characteristic and often allows the observer to detect its presence easily, even from a distance.

Funnel Chest (Pectus Excavatum). Funnel chest occurs when there is a depression in the lower portion of the sternum. This may compress the heart and great vessels, resulting in murmurs. Funnel chest may occur with rickets or Marfan's syndrome.

Pigeon Chest (Pectus Carinatum). A pigeon chest occurs as a result of displacement of the sternum. There is an increase in the anteroposterior diameter. This may occur with rickets, Marfan's syndrome, or severe kyphoscoliosis.

Kyphoscoliosis. A kyphoscoliosis is characterized by elevation of the scapula and a corresponding S-shaped spine. This deformity limits lung expansion within the thorax. It may occur with osteoporosis and other skeletal disorders that affect the thorax.

\section*{BREATHING PATTERNS AND RESPIRATORY RATES}

Observing the rate and depth of respiration is a simple but important aspect of assessment. The normal adult who is resting comfortably takes 12 to 18 breaths per minute. Except for occasional sighs, respirations are regular in depth and rhythm. This normal pattern is described as eupnea.

Bradypnea, also called slow breathing, is associated with increased intracranial pressure, brain injury, and drug overdose. Tachypnea, or rapid breathing, is commonly seen in patients with pneumonia, pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, septicemia,

Locating Thoracic Landmarks
With respect to the thorax, location is defined both horizontally and vertically. With respect to the lungs, location is defined by lobe.

\section*{Horizontal Reference Points}

Horizontally, thoracic locations are identified according to their proximity to the rib or the intercostal space under the examiner's fingers. On the anterior surface, identification of a specific rib is facilitated by first locating the angle of Louis. This is where the manubrium joins the body of the sternum in the midline. The second rib joins the sternum at this prominent landmark.

Other ribs may be identified by counting down from the second rib. The intercostal spaces are referred to in terms of the rib immediately above the intercostal space; for example, the fifth intercostal space is directly below the fifth rib.

Locating ribs on the posterior surface of the thorax is more difficult. The first step is to identify the spinous process. This is accomplished by finding the seventh cervical vertebra (vertebra prominens), which is the most prominent spinous process. When the neck is slightly flexed, the seventh cervical spinous process stands out. Other vertebrae are then identified by counting downward.

\section*{Vertical Reference Points}

Several imaginary lines are used as vertical referents or landmarks to identify the location of thoracic findings. The midsternal line passes through the center of the sternum. The midclavicular line is an imagi-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-495.jpg?height=517&width=850&top_left_y=1145&top_left_x=224)
nary line that descends from the middle of the clavicle. The point of maximal impulse of the heart normally lies along this line on the left thorax.

When the arm is abducted from the body at $90^{\circ}$, imaginary vertical lines may be drawn from the anterior axillary fold, from the middle of the axilla, and from the posterior axillary fold. These lines are called, respectively, the anterior axillary line, the midaxillary line, and the posterior axillary line. A line drawn vertically through the superior and inferior poles of the scapula is called the scapular line, and a line drawn down the center of the vertebral column is called the vertebral line. Using these landmarks, for example, the examiner communicates findings by referring to an area of dullness extending from the vertebral to the scapular line between the seventh and tenth ribs on the right.

\section*{Lobes of the Lungs}

The lobes of the lung may be mapped on the surface of the chest wall in the following manner. The line between the upper and lower lobes on the left begins at the fourth thoracic spinous process posteriorly, proceeds around to cross the fifth rib in the midaxillary line, and meets the sixth rib at the sternum. This line on the right divides the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe. The line dividing the right upper lobe from the middle lobe is an incomplete one that begins at the fifth rib in the midaxillary line, where it intersects the line between the upper and lower lobes and traverses horizontally to the sternum. Thus, the upper lobes are dominant on the anterior surface of the thorax and the lower lobes are dominant on the posterior surface. There is no presentation of the middle lobe on the posterior surface of the chest.

severe pain, and rib fracture. Shallow, irregular breathing is referred to as hypoventilation.

An increase in depth of respirations is called hyperpnea. An increase in both rate and depth that results in a lowered arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ level is referred to as hyperventilation. With rapid breathing, inspiration and expiration are nearly equal in duration. Hyperventilation that is marked by an increase in rate and depth,
associated with severe acidosis of diabetic or renal origin, is called Kussmaul's respiration.

Apnea describes varying periods of cessation of breathing. If sustained, apnea is life-threatening.

Cheyne-Stokes respiration is characterized by alternating episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) and periods of deep breathing. Deep respirations become increasingly shallow, followed by
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-495.jpg?height=540&width=877&top_left_y=1744&top_left_x=1105)
apnea that may last approximately 20 seconds. The cycle repeats after each apneic period. The duration of the period of apnea may vary and may progressively lengthen; therefore, it is timed and reported. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is usually associated with heart failure and damage to the respiratory center (drug-induced, tumor, trauma).

Biot's respirations, or cluster breathing, are cycles of breaths that vary in depth and have varying periods of apnea. Biot's respirations are seen with some central nervous system disorders.

Certain patterns of respiration are characteristic of specific disease states. Respiratory rhythms and their deviation from normal are important observations that the nurse reports and documents. The rate and depth of different patterns of respiration are presented in Figure 21-10.

In thin people, it is quite normal to note a slight retraction of the intercostal spaces during quiet breathing. Bulging during expiration implies obstruction of expiratory airflow, as in emphysema. Marked retraction on inspiration, particularly if asymmetric, implies blockage of a branch of the respiratory tree. Asymmetric bulging of the intercostal spaces, on one side or the other, is created by an increase in pressure within the hemithorax. This may be a result of air trapped under pressure within the pleural cavity where it does not normally appear (pneumothorax) or the pressure of fluid within the pleural space (pleural effusion).

\section*{Thoracic Palpation}

The nurse palpates the thorax for tenderness, masses, lesions, respiratory excursion, and vocal fremitus. If the patient has reported an area of pain or if lesions are apparent, the nurse performs direct palpation with the fingertips (for skin lesions and subcutaneous masses) or with the ball of the hand (for deeper masses or generalized flank or rib discomfort).

\section*{RESPIRATORY EXCURSION}

Respiratory excursion is an estimation of thoracic expansion and may disclose significant information about thoracic movement during breathing. The nurse assesses the patient for range and symmetry of excursion. The patient is instructed to inhale deeply while the movement of the nurse's thumbs (placed along the costal margin on the anterior chest wall) during inspiration and expiration is observed. This movement is normally symmetric.

Posterior assessment is performed by placing the thumbs adjacent to the spinal column at the level of the tenth rib (Fig. 21-11). The hands lightly grasp the lateral rib cage. Sliding the thumbs medially about 2.5 cm ( 1 inch ) raises a small skinfold between the thumbs. The patient is instructed to take a full inspiration and to exhale fully. The nurse observes for normal flattening of the skinfold and feels the symmetric movement of the thorax.

Decreased chest excursion may be due to chronic fibrotic disease. Asymmetric excursion may be due to splinting secondary to pleurisy, fractured ribs, trauma, or unilateral bronchial obstruction.

\section*{TACTILE FREMITUS}

Sound generated by the larynx travels distally along the bronchial tree to set the chest wall in resonant motion. This is especially
true of consonant sounds. The detection of the resulting vibration on the chest wall by touch is called tactile fremitus.

Normal fremitus is widely varied. It is influenced by the thickness of the chest wall, especially if that thickness is muscular. However, the increase in subcutaneous tissue associated with obesity may also affect fremitus. Lower-pitched sounds travel better through the normal lung and produce greater vibration of the chest wall. Thus, fremitus is more pronounced in men than in women because of the deeper male voice. Normally, fremitus is most pronounced where the large bronchi are closest to the chest wall and least palpable over the distant lung fields. Therefore, it is most palpable in the upper thorax, anteriorly and posteriorly.

The patient is asked to repeat "ninety-nine" or "one, two, three," or "eee, eee, eee" as the nurse's hands move down the patient's thorax. The vibrations are detected with the palmar surfaces of the fingers and hands, or the ulnar aspect of the extended hands, on the thorax. The hand or hands are moved in sequence down the thorax. Corresponding areas of the thorax are compared (Fig. 21-12). Bony areas are not tested.

Air does not conduct sound well but a solid substance such as tissue does, provided that it has elasticity and is not compressed. Thus, an increase in solid tissue per unit volume of lung will enhance fremitus; an increase in air per unit volume of lung will impede sound. Patients with emphysema, which results in the rupture of alveoli and trapping of air, exhibit almost no tactile fremitus. A patient with consolidation of a lobe of the lung from pneumonia will have increased tactile fremitus over that lobe. Air in the pleural space will not conduct sound.

\section*{Thoracic Percussion}

Percussion sets the chest wall and underlying structures in motion, producing audible and tactile vibrations. The nurse uses percussion to determine whether underlying tissues are filled with air, fluid, or solid material. Percussion also is used to estimate the size and location of certain structures within the thorax (eg, diaphragm, heart, liver).

Percussion usually begins with the posterior thorax. Ideally, the patient is in a sitting position with the head flexed forward and the arms crossed on the lap. This position separates the scapulae widely and exposes more lung area for assessment. The nurse percusses across each shoulder top, locating the $5-\mathrm{cm}$ width of resonance overlying the lung apices (Fig. 21-13). Then the nurse proceeds down the posterior thorax, percussing symmetric areas at $5-$ to $6-\mathrm{cm}$ ( $2-$ to $2.5-\mathrm{inch}$ ) intervals. The middle finger is positioned parallel to the ribs in the intercostal space; the finger is placed firmly against the chest wall before striking it with the middle finger of the opposite hand. Bony structures (scapulae or ribs) are not percussed.

Percussion over the anterior chest is performed with the patient in an upright position with shoulders arched backward and arms at the side. The nurse begins in the supraclavicular area and proceeds downward, from one intercostal space to the next. In the female patient, it may be necessary to displace the breasts for an adequate examination. Dullness noted to the left of the sternum between the third and fifth intercostal spaces is a normal finding because it is the location of the heart. Similarly, there is a normal span of liver dullness in the right thorax from the fifth intercostal space to the right costal margin at the midclavicular line.

The anterior and lateral thorax is examined with the patient in a supine position. If the patient cannot sit up, percussion of the posterior thorax is performed with the patient positioned on the side.

Dullness over the lung occurs when air-filled lung tissue is replaced by fluid or solid tissue. Table 21-3 reviews percussion sounds and their characteristics.

\section*{DIAPHRAGMATIC EXCURSION}

The normal resonance of the lung stops at the diaphragm. The position of the diaphragm is different during inspiration than during expiration.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_10_d2f5f2a1909c1208e64dg-498.jpg?height=925&width=861&top_left_y=1522&top_left_x=112}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{EIGURE 21-13 Percussion of the posterior thorax. With the patient in a sitting position, symmetric areas of the lungs are percussed at $5-\mathrm{cm}$ intervals. This progression starts at the apex of each lung and concludes with percussion of each lateral chest wall.}
\end{figure}

To assess the position and motion of the diaphragm, the nurse instructs the patient to take a deep breath and hold it while the maximal descent of the diaphragm is percussed. The point at which the percussion note at the midscapular line changes from resonance to dullness is marked with a pen. The patient is then instructed to exhale fully and hold it while the nurse again percusses downward to the dullness of the diaphragm. This point is also marked. The distance between the two markings indicates the range of motion of the diaphragm.

Maximal excursion of the diaphragm may be as much as 8 to 10 cm ( 3 to 4 inches) in healthy, tall young men, but for most people it is usually 5 to 7 cm ( 2 to 2.75 inches). Normally, the diaphragm is about 2 cm ( 0.75 inches) higher on the right because of the position of the heart and the liver above and below the left and right segments of the diaphragm, respectively. Decreased diaphragmatic excursion may occur with pleural effusion and emphysema. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure, as in pregnancy or ascites, may account for a diaphragm that is positioned high in the thorax.

\section*{Thoracic Auscultation}

Auscultation is useful in assessing the flow of air through the bronchial tree and in evaluating the presence of fluid or solid obstruction in the lung structures. The nurse auscultates for normal breath sounds, adventitious sounds, and voice sounds.

Examination includes auscultation of the anterior, posterior, and lateral thorax and is performed as follows. The nurse places the diaphragm of the stethoscope firmly against the chest wall as the patient breathes slowly and deeply through the mouth. Corresponding areas of the chest are auscultated in a systematic fashion from the apices to the bases and along midaxillary lines. The sequence of auscultation and the positioning of the patient are similar to those used for percussion. It often is necessary to listen to two full inspirations and expirations at each anatomic location for valid interpretation of the sound heard. Repeated deep breaths may result in symptoms of hyperventilation (eg, light-headedness); this is avoided by having the patient rest and breathe normally periodically during the examination.

\section*{BREATH SOUNDS}

Normal breath sounds are distinguished by their location over a specific area of the lung and are identified as vesicular, bronchovesicular, and bronchial (tubular) breath sounds (Table 21-4).

The location, quality, and intensity of breath sounds are determined during auscultation. When airflow is decreased by bronchial obstruction (atelectasis) or when fluid (pleural effusion) or tissue (obesity) separates the air passages from the stethoscope, breath sounds are diminished or absent. For example, the breath sounds of the patient with emphysema are faint or often completely inaudible. When heard, the expiratory phase is prolonged. Bronchial and bronchovesicular sounds that are audible anywhere except over the main bronchus in the lungs signify pathology, usually indicating consolidation in the lung (eg, pneumonia, heart failure). This finding requires further evaluation.

\section*{ADVENTITIOUS SOUNDS}

An abnormal condition that affects the bronchial tree and alveoli may produce adventitious (additional) sounds. Adventitious sounds are divided into two categories: discrete, noncontinuous sounds (crackles) and continuous musical sounds (wheezes). The duration of the sound is the important distinction to make in identifying the sound as noncontinuous or continuous. Pleural friction rubs are specific examples of crackles (Table 21-5).

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
*Distinguished mainly by its musical timbre

Crackles (formerly referred to as rales) are discrete, noncontinuous sounds that result from delayed reopening of deflated airways. Crackles may or may not be cleared by coughing. Crackles reflect underlying inflammation or congestion and are often present in such conditions as pneumonia, bronchitis, heart failure, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis.

Friction rubs result from inflammation of the pleural surfaces that induces a crackling, grating sound usually heard in inspiration and expiration. The sound can be enhanced by applying pressure to the chest wall with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. The sound is imitated by rubbing the thumb and index finger together near the ear. A friction rub is best heard over the lower lateral anterior surface of the thorax.

Wheezes are associated with bronchial wall oscillation and changes in airway diameter. Wheezes are commonly heard in patients with asthma, chronic bronchitis, and bronchiectasis.

\section*{VOICE SOUNDS}

The sound heard through the stethoscope as the patient speaks is known as vocal resonance. The vibrations produced in the larynx are transmitted to the chest wall as they pass through the bronchi and alveolar tissue. During the process, the sounds are dimin-
ished in intensity and altered so that syllables are not distinguishable. Voice sounds are usually assessed by having the patient repeat "ninety-nine" or "eee" while the nurse listens with the stethoscope in corresponding areas of the chest from the apices to the bases.

Bronchophony describes vocal resonance that is more intense and clearer than normal. Egophony describes voice sounds that are distorted. It is best appreciated by having the patient repeat the letter E. The distortion produced by consolidation transforms the sound into a clearly heard A rather than E. Bronchophony and egophony have precisely the same significance as bronchial breathing with an increase in tactile fremitus. When an abnormality is detected, it should be evident using more than one assessment method. A change in tactile fremitus is more subtle and can be missed, but bronchial breathing and bronchophony can be noted loudly and clearly.

Whispered pectoriloquy is a very subtle finding, heard only in the presence of rather dense consolidation of the lungs. Transmission of high-frequency components of sound is so enhanced by the consolidated tissue that even whispered words are heard, a circumstance not noted in normal physiology. The significance is the same as that of bronchophony.

\section*{PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF BREATHING ABILITY IN THE ACUTELY ILL PATIENT}

Tests of the patient's breathing ability are easily performed at the bedside by measuring the respiratory rate (see the previous section "Breathing Patterns and Respiratory Rates"), tidal volume, minute ventilation, vital capacity, inspiratory force, and compliance. These tests are particularly important for patients at risk for developing pulmonary complications, including those who have undergone chest or abdominal surgery, have had prolonged anesthesia, have preexisting pulmonary disease, or are elderly. These tests are also used routinely for mechanically ventilated patients.

Patients whose chest expansion is limited by external restrictions such as obesity or abdominal distention and who cannot breathe deeply because of postoperative pain or sedation will inhale and exhale a low volume of air (referred to as low tidal volumes). Prolonged hypoventilation at low tidal volumes can produce alveolar collapse or atelectasis. The amount of air remaining in the lungs after a normal expiration (functional residual capacity) falls, the ability of the lungs to expand (compliance) is reduced, and the patient must breathe faster to maintain the same degree of tissue oxygenation. These events can be exaggerated in patients who have preexisting pulmonary diseases and in elderly patients whose airways are less compliant, because the small airways may collapse during expiration.

NURSING ALERT One should not rely only on visual inspection of the rate and depth of a patient's respiratory excursions to determine the adequacy of ventilation. Respiratory excursions may appear normal or exaggerated due to an increased work of breathing, but the patient may actually be moving only enough air to ventilate the dead space. If there is any question regarding adequacy of ventilation, auscultation and/or pulse oximetry should be used for additional assessment of respiratory status.

\section*{Tidal Volume}

The volume of each breath is referred to as the tidal volume (see Table 21-1 to review lung capacities and volumes). A spirometer is an instrument that can be used at the bedside to measure volumes. If the patient is breathing through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, the spirometer is directly attached to it and the exhaled volume is obtained from the reading on the gauge. In other patients, the spirometer is attached to a facemask or a mouthpiece positioned so that it is airtight, and the exhaled volume is measured.

The tidal volume may vary from breath to breath. To make the measurement reliable, it is important to measure the volumes of several breaths and to note the range of tidal volumes, together with the average tidal volume.

\section*{Minute Ventilation}

Respiratory rates and tidal volume alone are unreliable indicators of adequate ventilation because both can vary widely from breath to breath. Together, however, the tidal volume and respiratory
