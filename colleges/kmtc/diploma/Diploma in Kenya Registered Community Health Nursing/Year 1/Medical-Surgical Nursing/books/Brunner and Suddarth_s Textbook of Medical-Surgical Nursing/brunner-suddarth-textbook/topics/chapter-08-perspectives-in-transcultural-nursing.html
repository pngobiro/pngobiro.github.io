                        <p>In the health care delivery system, as in society, the nurse interacts with people of similar and diverse cultural backgrounds. People may have similar or different frames of reference and varied preferences regarding their health and health care needs. Acknowledging and adapting to the cultural needs of the patient and significant others is an important component of nursing care. To plan and deliver culturally competent care, the nurse must understand the definitions of culture and cultural competence and the various aspects of culture that should be explored for each patient.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-1" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Definitions of Culture</span></h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The concept of culture and its relationship to the health care beliefs and practices of patients and their families and friends provide the foundation for transcultural nursing. This awareness of culture in the delivery of nursing care has been described in different ways, including respect for cultural diversity, culturally sensitive or comprehensive care, and culturally competent or appropriate nursing care (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 1996; Giger & Davidhizar, 1999; Spector, 2000), or culturally congruent nursing care (Leininger, 2001). Two commonly discussed concepts are cultural diversity and culturally competent care.</p>
                        <p>The term culture was initially defined by the British anthropologist Sir Edward Tylor in 1871 as the knowledge, belief, art, morals, laws, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by humans as members of society. During the past century, and especially during recent decades, hundreds of definitions of culture have been offered that integrate the themes stated by Tylor and the themes of ethnic variations of a population based on race, nationality, religion, language, physical characteristics, and geography (Spector, 2000). To fully appreciate the impact of culture, aspects such as disabilities, gender, social class, physical appearance (eg, weight, height), ideologies (political views), or sexual orientation must be integrated into the definition of culture as well (Gooden, Porter, Gonzalez, & Mims, 2001).</p>
                        <p>Madeleine Leininger, founder of the specialty called transcultural nursing, indicates that culture involves learned and transmitted knowledge about values, beliefs, rules of behavior, and lifestyle practices that guide designated groups in their thinking and actions in patterned ways (2001). Giger and Davidhizar (1999) state that transcultural nursing is a practice based on the differences and similarities between cultures in relation to health, health care, and illness, with consideration of patient values, beliefs, and practices. Further, culture develops over time as a result of "imprinting the mind through social and religious structures and intellectual and artistic manifestations" (p. 3).</p>
                        <p>The concept of ethnic culture has four basic characteristics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is learned from birth through language and socialization.</li>
                            <li>It is shared by members of the same cultural group, and it includes an internal sense and external perception of distinctiveness.</li>
                            <li>It is influenced by specific conditions related to environmental and technical factors and to the availability of resources.</li>
                            <li>It is dynamic and ever-changing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With the exception of the first characteristic, culture related to age, physical appearance, lifestyle, and other less frequently acknowledged aspects also adhere to the above characteristics.</p>
                        <p>Cultural diversity has also been defined in a number of ways. Often, skin color, religion, and geographic area are the only elements used to identify diversity, with ethnic minorities being considered the primary sources of cultural diversity. As stated earlier, however, there are several other possible sources of cultural diversity. In addition, to truly acknowledge the cultural differences that may influence health care delivery, the nurse must recognize the influence of his or her own culture and cultural heritage (Krumberger, 2000).</p>
                        <p>Culturally competent nursing care has been defined as effective, individualized care that considers cultural values, is culturally aware and sensitive, and incorporates cultural skills (Hunt, 2000; Krumberger, 2000; Wilkinson, 2001). Culturally competent care is a dynamic process that requires comprehensive knowledge of culture-specific information and an awareness of, and sensitivity to, the effect that culture has on the care situation. It requires the nurse to integrate cultural knowledge, awareness of his or her own cultural perspective, and the patient's cultural perspectives into the plan of care (Giger & Davidhizar, 1999). Exploring one's own cultural beliefs and how they might conflict with the beliefs of the patients being cared for is a first step toward becoming culturally competent (Krumberger, 2000). Understanding the diversity within cultures, such as subcultures, is also important.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SUBCULTURES AND MINORITIES</h3>
                        <p>Although culture is a universal phenomenon, it takes on specific and distinctive features for a particular group, since it encompasses all of the knowledge, beliefs, customs, and skills acquired by the members of that group. When such groups function within a larger cultural group, they are referred to as subcultures.</p>
                        <p>The term subculture is used for relatively large groups of people who share characteristics that enable them to be identified as a distinct entity. Examples of American subcultures based on ethnicity (ie, subcultures with common traits such as physical characteristics, language, or ancestry) include African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and Native Americans. Each of these subcultures may be further divided; for example, Native Americans consist of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who represent more than 500 federally and state-recognized tribes in addition to an unknown number of tribes that receive no official recognition.</p>
                        <p>Subcultures may also be based on religion (more than 1200 exist in the United States), occupation (eg, nurses, physicians, other members of the health care team), or shared disability or illness (eg, the Deaf community). In addition, subcultures may be based on age (eg, infants, children, adolescents, adults, older adults), gender (eg, male, female); sexual orientation (eg, homosexual or bisexual men and women), or geographic location (eg, Texans, Southerners, Appalachians).</p>
                        <p>The nurse should also be sensitive to the intraracial applications of cultural competence. Tensions between subcultures within a designated group could add to the complexity of planning culturally competent care. Some members of one ethnic subculture may be offended or angered if mistaken for members of a different subculture. Similarly, if the attributes of one subculture are mistakenly generalized to a patient belonging to a different subculture, extreme offense could result, as well as inappropriate care planning and implementation (Fields, 2000). It is crucial that nurses refrain from culturally stereotyping a patient in an attempt to be culturally competent. Instead, the patient or significant others should be consulted regarding personal values, beliefs, preferences and cultural identification. This strategy is also applicable for members of nonethnic subcultures.</p>
                        <p>The term minority refers to a group of people whose physical or cultural characteristics differ from the majority of people in a society. At times, minorities may be singled out or isolated from others in society or treated in different or unequal ways. Although there are four federally identified minority groups—Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans (Andrews & Boyle, 1999)—the concept of "minority" varies widely and must be understood in a cultural context. For example, men may be considered a minority within the nursing profession, but they constitute a majority within the field of medicine. In addition, Caucasians may be in the minority in some communities in the United States, but they are currently the majority group in the country (although it has been projected that by the middle to late 21st century, Caucasians will be in the minority in the United States). Because at times the term minority connotes inferiority, members of many racial and ethnic groups object to being identified as minorities.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Transcultural nursing, a term sometimes used interchangeably with cross-cultural, intercultural, or multicultural nursing, refers to a formal area of study and practice that focuses on the cultural care (caring) values, beliefs, and practices of individuals and groups from a particular culture (Giger & Davidhizar, 1999). The underlying focus of transcultural nursing is to provide culture-specific and culture-universal care that promotes the wellbeing or health of individuals, families, groups, communities, and institutions (Giger & Davidhizar, 1999; Leininger, 2001). When culturally appropriate care is provided, all individuals, and the community or institution at large, benefit. When the care is delivered beyond the nurse's national boundaries, the term international or transnational nursing is often used.</p>
                        <p>Although many nurses, anthropologists, and others have written about the cultural aspects of nursing and health care, Leininger (2001) developed a comprehensive research-based theory called Culture Care Diversity and Universality. The goal of the theory is to provide culturally congruent nursing care to improve care for people of different or similar cultures. This means promoting recovery from illness, preventing conditions that would limit the patient's health or well-being, or facilitating a peaceful death in ways that are culturally meaningful and appropriate. Nursing care needs to be tailored to fit the patient's cultural values, beliefs, and lifestyle.</p>
                        <p>Leininger's theory includes providing culturally congruent nursing care (meaningful, beneficial, and satisfying health care tailored to fit the patient's cultural values) through culture care accommodation and culture care restructuring. Culture care accommodation refers to those professional actions and decisions that a nurse makes in his or her care to help people of a designated culture achieve a beneficial or satisfying health outcome. Culture care restructuring or repatterning refers to those professional actions and decisions that help patients reorder, change, or modify their lifestyles toward new, different, or more beneficial health care patterns. At the same time, the patient's cultural values and beliefs are respected, and a better or healthier lifestyle is provided. Other terms and definitions that provide further insight into culture and health care include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Acculturation</strong> is the process by which members of a cultural group adapt to or learn how to take on the behaviors of another group.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cultural blindness</strong> is the inability of a person to recognize his or her own values, beliefs, and practices and those of others because of strong ethnocentric tendencies (the tendency to view one's own culture as superior to others).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cultural imposition</strong> is the tendency to impose one's cultural beliefs, values, and patterns of behavior on a person or persons from a different culture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cultural taboos</strong> are those activities governed by rules of behavior that are avoided, forbidden, or prohibited by a particular cultural group.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-3" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Culturally Competent Nursing Care</span></h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Culturally competent or congruent nursing care refers to the complex integration of attitudes, knowledge, and skills (including assessment, decision making, judgments, critical thinking, and evaluation) that enables the nurse to provide care in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner. Agency and institutional policies are important to achieve culturally competent care.</p>
                        <p>Policies that promote culturally competent care establish flexible regulations pertaining to visitors (number, frequency, and length of visits), provide translation services for non-Englishspeaking patients, and train staff to provide care for patients with different cultural values (Suro, 2000). Culturally competent policies also recognize the special dietary needs of patients from selected cultural groups and create an environment in which the traditional healing, spiritual, and religious practices of patients are respected and encouraged.</p>
                        <p>Giger and Davidhizar (1999) created an assessment model to guide the nurse in exploring cultural phenomena that might affect nursing care. They identified communication, space, time orientation, social organization, environmental control, and biologic variations as relevant phenomena (Giger & Davidhizar, 1999). This model has been used in various patient care settings to provide data essential to the provision of culturally competent care.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CROSS-CULTURAL COMMUNICATION</h3>
                        <p>Establishing an environment of culturally congruent care and respect begins with effective communication, which occurs not only through words, but also through body language and other cues, such as voice, tone, and loudness. Nurse-patient interactions, as well as communications among members of a multicultural health care team, are dependent on the ability to understand and be understood.</p>
                        <p>Approximately 150 different languages are spoken in the United States, with Spanish accounting for the largest percentage after English. Obviously, nurses cannot become fluent in all languages, but certain strategies for fostering effective cross-cultural communication are necessary when providing care for patients who are not fluent in English. Cultural needs should be considered when choosing an interpreter; fluency in varied dialects, for instance, is beneficial (Suro, 2000). The interpreter's voice quality, pronunciation, use of silence, use of touch, and use of nonverbal communication should also be assessed (Giger & Davidhizar, 1999).</p>
                        <p>During illness, patients of all ages tend to regress, and the regression often involves language skills. Chart 8-1 summarizes suggested strategies for overcoming language barriers. The nurse should also assess how well the patient and family have understood what has been said. The following cues may signal lack of effective communication:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Efforts to change the subject. This could indicate that the patient does not understand what you are saying and is attempting to talk about something more familiar.</li>
                            <li>Absence of questions. Paradoxically, this often means that the listener is not grasping the message and therefore has difficulty formulating questions to ask.</li>
                            <li>Inappropriate laughter. A self-conscious giggle may signal poor comprehension and may be an attempt to disguise embarrassment.</li>
                            <li>Nonverbal cues. Although a blank expression may signal poor understanding, among some Asian Americans it may reflect a desire to avoid overt expression of emotion. Similarly, avoidance of eye contact may be a cultural expression of respect for the speaker; some Native Americans and Asian Americans use this gesture.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Greet the patient using the last or complete name. Avoid being too casual or familiar. Point to yourself and say your name. Smile.</li>
                                <li>Proceed in an unhurried manner. Pay attention to any effort by the patient or family to communicate.</li>
                                <li>Speak in a low, moderate voice. Avoid talking loudly. Remember that there is a tendency to raise the volume and pitch of your voice when the listener appears not to understand. The listener may perceive that you are shouting and/or angry.</li>
                                <li>Organize your thoughts. Repeat and summarize frequently. Use audiovisual aids when feasible.</li>
                                <li>Use short, simple sentence structure and speak in the active voice.</li>
                                <li>Use simple words, such as "pain" rather than "discomfort." Avoid medical jargon, idioms, and slang. Avoid using contractions, such as don't, can't, won't.</li>
                                <li>Use nouns repeatedly instead of pronouns. Example: Do not say: "He has been taking his medicine, hasn't he?" Do say: "Does Juan take medicine?"</li>
                                <li>Pantomime words (use gestures) and simple actions while verbalizing them.</li>
                                <li>Give instructions in the proper sequence. Example: Do not say: "Before you rinse the bottle, sterilize it." Do say: "First, wash the bottle. Second, rinse the bottle."</li>
                                <li>Discuss one topic at a time, and avoid giving too much information in a single conversation. Avoid using conjunctions. Example: Do not say: "Are you cold and in pain?" Do say (while pantomiming/gesturing): "Are you cold?" "Are you in pain?"</li>
                                <li>Validate whether the person understands by having him or her repeat instructions, demonstrate the procedure, or act out the meaning.</li>
                                <li>Use any words you know in the person's language. This indicates that you are aware of and respect the patient's primary means of communicating.</li>
                                <li>Try a third language. Many Indo-Chinese speak French. Europeans often know three or four languages. Try Latin words or phrases, if you are familiar with the language.</li>
                                <li>Ask who among the patient's family and friends could serve as an interpreter. Be aware of culturally based gender and age differences and diverse socioeconomic, educational, and tribal/regional differences when choosing an interpreter.</li>
                                <li>Obtain phrase books from a library or bookstore, make or purchase flash cards, contact hospitals for a list of interpreters, and use both formal and informal networking to locate a suitable interpreter. Although they are costly, some telecommunication companies provide translation services.</li>
