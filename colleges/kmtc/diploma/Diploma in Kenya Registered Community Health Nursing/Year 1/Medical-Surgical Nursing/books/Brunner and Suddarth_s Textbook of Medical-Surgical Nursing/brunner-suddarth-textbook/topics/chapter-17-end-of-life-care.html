                        <p>One of the most difficult realities that nurses face is that, despite our very best efforts, some patients will die. Although we cannot change this fact, we can have a significant and lasting effect on the way in which patients live until they die, the manner in which the death occurs, and the enduring memories of that death for the families. Nursing has a long history of holistic, person- and familycentered care. Indeed, the definition of nursing offered by the American Nurses Association (ANA) highlights nursing's commitment to the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to illness (ANA, 1995). There is perhaps no setting or circumstance in which care—that is, attention to the human responses—is more important than in caring for the dying patient.</p>
                        <p>Knowledge about end-of-life decisions and principles of care is essential to supporting patients during decision making and in end-of-life closure in ways that recognize their unique responses to illness and that support their values and goals. Education, clinical practice, and research concerning end-of-life care are evolving, and the need to prepare nurses and other health care professionals to care for the dying has emerged as a priority. The National Institute for Nursing Research has taken the lead in coordinating research related to end-of-life care within the National Institutes of Health (Grady, 1999). At no time in nursing's history has there been a greater opportunity to bring research, education, and practice together to change the culture of dying, bringing much-needed improvement to care that is relevant across practice settings, age groups, cultural backgrounds, and illnesses.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE CONTEXT FOR DEATH AND DYING IN AMERICA</h3>
                        <p>In the past three decades there has been a surge of interest in the care of the dying, with an emphasis on the settings in which death occurs, the technologies used to sustain life, and the challenges of trying to improve end-of-life care. The focus on care of the dying has been motivated by the aging of the population, the prevalence of and publicity surrounding life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and AIDS, and the efforts of health care providers to build a continuum of service that spans the lifetime from birth until death (Lesparre & Matherlee, 1998). Although there are more opportunities than ever before to allow a peaceful death, the knowledge and technologies available to health care providers have made the process of dying anything but peaceful. According to Callahan (1993a), Americans view death as what happens when medicine fails, an attitude that often places the study of death and improvement of the dying process outside of the focus of modern medicine and health care. Numerous initiatives aimed at improving end-of-life care have been launched in recent years, spurred by a widespread call for substantive change in the way Americans deal with death.</p>
                        <p>The Palliative Care Task Force of the Last Acts Campaign (Last Acts, 1997) identified the following as precepts or principles underlying a more comprehensive and humane approach to care of the dying:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Respecting patients' goals, preferences, and choices</li>
                            <li>Attending to the medical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of the dying person</li>
                            <li>Using strengths of interdisciplinary resources</li>
                            <li>Acknowledging and addressing caregiver concerns</li>
                            <li>Building mechanisms and systems of support</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TECHNOLOGY AND END-OF-LIFE CARE</h3>
                        <p>In the last century, chronic, degenerative diseases replaced communicable diseases as the major causes of death. Although technological advances in health care have extended and improved the quality of life for many, the ability of technologies to prolong life beyond the point that some would consider meaningful has raised troubling ethical issues. In particular, the use of technology to sustain life has raised perplexing issues with regard to quality of life, prolongation of dying, adequacy of pain relief and symptom management, and allocation of scarce resources. The major ethical question that has emerged concerning the use of technology to extend life is: Because we can prolong life through a particular intervention, does it necessarily follow that we must do so? In the latter half of the 20th century a "technological imperative" practice pattern among health care professionals emerged, along with an expectation among patients and families that every available means to extend life must be tried.</p>
                        <p>Decisions to apply every available technology to extend life have contributed to the shift in the place of death from the home to the hospital or extended care facility. In the earlier part of the last century, most deaths occurred at home. Because of this, most families had direct experience "being with" death, providing care to family members at the end of life and mourning for the loss of loved ones. As the place of death shifted to the hospital, families became increasingly distanced from the death experience. By the early 1970s, when hospice care was just beginning in this country, technology had become the expected companion of the critically and terminally ill (Wentzel, 1981). The implications of technological intervention at the end of life continue to be profound, affecting a societal view of death that influences how clinicians care for the dying, how family and friends participate in care, how patients and families understand and choose among end-of-life care options, how families prepare for terminal illness and death, and how they heal following the death of a loved one.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT</h3>
                        <p>Although each individual experiences terminal illness uniquely, such illness is also shaped substantially by the social and cultural contexts in which it occurs. In the United States, life-threatening illness, life-sustaining treatment decisions, dying, and death occur in a social environment where illness is largely considered a foe and where battles are either lost or won (Benoliel, 1993). A care/ cure dichotomy has emerged in which health care providers may view cure as the ultimate good and care as second best, a good only when cure is no longer possible (Benoliel, 1993; Gadow, 1988). In such a model of health or medical care, alleviating suffering is not as valued as curing disease, and patients who cannot be cured feel distanced from the health care team, concluding that when treatment has failed, they too have failed. Patients and families who have internalized the socially constructed meaning of care as second best may fear that any shift from curative goals in the direction of comfort-focused care will result in no care or poorer-quality care, and that the clinicians on whom they have come to rely will abandon them if they withdraw from the battle for cure.</p>
                        <p>The reduction of patients to their diseases is exemplified in the frequently relayed message in late-stage illness that "nothing more can be done." This all-too-frequently used statement communicates the belief of many clinicians that there is nothing of value to offer patients who are beyond cure. In a care-focused perspective, mind, body, and spirit are inextricable, and treating the body without attending to the other components is considered inadequate to evoke true healing (Upledger, 1989; Wendler, 1996). This expanded notion of healing as care, along with and beyond cure, implies that healing can take place throughout life and outside the boundaries of contemporary medicine. In this expanded definition, healing is transcendent and its boundaries are unlimited, even as body systems begin to fail at the end of life (Byock, 1997).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinicians' Attitudes Toward Death</h4>
                        <p>Clinicians' attitudes toward the terminally ill and dying remain the greatest barrier to improving care at the end of life. Kübler-Ross illuminated the concerns of the seriously ill and dying in her seminal work On Death and Dying, published in 1969. At that time, it was common for patients to be kept uninformed about life-threatening diagnoses, particularly cancer, and for physicians and nurses to avoid open discussion of death and dying with their patients (Krisman-Scott, 2000; Seale, 1991). Kübler-Ross taught the health care community that having open discussion about life and death issues did not harm patients, and that the patients in fact welcomed such openness. She was openly critical of what she called "a new but depersonalized science in the service of prolonging life rather than diminishing human suffering" (Kübler-Ross, 1969, p. 20). She taught the health care community that healing could not take place in a conspiracy of silence, and that as clinicians break the silence and enter the patient's world, they too can be healed by their struggles and strengths. Her work revealed that, given adequate time and some help in working through the process, patients could reach a stage of acceptance where they were neither angry nor depressed about their fate (Kübler-Ross, 1969).</p>
                        <p>Clinicians' reluctance to discuss disease and death openly with patients stems from their own anxieties about death as well as misconceptions about what and how much patients want to know about their illnesses. In an early study of care of the dying in hospital settings, sociologists Glaser and Strauss (1965) discovered that health care professionals in hospital settings avoided direct communication about dying in hope that the patient would discover it on his or her own. They identified four "awareness contexts," described as the patient's, physician's, family's, and other health care professionals' awareness of the patient's status and their recognition of each other's awareness:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Closed awareness:</strong> The patient is unaware of his or her terminal state while others are aware. Closed awareness may be characterized by families and health care professionals conspiring to guard the "secret," fearing that the patient would not be able to cope with full disclosure about his or her status, and the patient's acceptance of others' accounts of his or her "future biography" as long as they give him or her no reason to be suspicious.</li>
                            <li><strong>Suspected awareness:</strong> The patient suspects what others know and attempts to find out. Suspected awareness may be triggered by inconsistencies in families' and clinicians' communication and behavior, discrepancies between clinicians' accounts of the seriousness of the patient's illness, or a decline in the patient's condition or other environmental cues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mutual pretense awareness:</strong> The patient, the family, and the health care professionals are aware that the patient is dying but all pretend otherwise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open awareness:</strong> All are aware that the patient is dying and are able to openly acknowledge that reality.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Glaser and Strauss (1965) also identified a pattern of clinician behavior in which those who feared or were uncomfortable discussing death developed and substituted "personal mythologies" for appraisals of what level of disclosure patients actually wanted. For example, clinicians avoided direct communication with patients about the seriousness of their illness based on their beliefs that (1) patients already knew the truth or would ask if they wanted to know, or (2) patients would subsequently lose all hope, give up, or be psychologically harmed by disclosure.</p>
                        <p>Glaser and Strauss' findings were published more than 35 years ago, yet their observations remain valid today. Although a growing number of health care providers are becoming comfortable with assessing patients' and families' information needs and disclosing honest information about the seriousness of illness, many still avoid the topic of death in hopes that the patient will ask or find out on his or her own. Despite progress on many health care fronts, those who work with dying patients have identified the persistence of a "conspiracy of silence" about dying (Stanley, 2000, p. 34).</p>
