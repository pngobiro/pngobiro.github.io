                        <p>Rehabilitation is a dynamic, health-oriented process that assists an ill person or a person with disability (restriction in performance or function in everyday activities) to achieve the greatest possible level of physical, mental, spiritual, social, and economic functioning. The rehabilitation process helps the patient achieve an acceptable quality of life with dignity, self-respect, and independence and is designed for people with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. During rehabilitation—sometimes called habilitation—the patient adjusts to the disability by learning how to use resources and to focus on existing abilities. In habilitation, abilities, not disabilities, are emphasized.</p>
                        <p>Rehabilitation is an integral part of nursing because every major illness or injury carries the threat of disability or impairment, which involves a loss of function or an abnormality. The principles of rehabilitation are basic to the care of all patients, and rehabilitation efforts should begin during the initial contact with a patient. The goal of rehabilitation is to restore the patient's ability to function independently or at a preillness or preinjury level of functioning as quickly as possible. If this is not possible, the aims of rehabilitation are maximal independence and a quality of life acceptable to the patient. Realistic goals based on individual patient assessment are established with the patient to guide the rehabilitation program.</p>
                        <p>Rehabilitation services are required by more people than ever before because of advances in technology that save or prolong the lives of seriously ill, injured, and disabled patients. Increasing numbers of patients who are recovering from serious illnesses or injuries are returning to their homes and communities with ongoing needs. Every patient, regardless of age, gender, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, or diagnosis, has a right to rehabilitation services (Chart 11-1).</p>

                            <p>You work in an area where many illegal aliens and uninsured residents live. Community violence often creates life-threatening and disabling conditions in members of the population. After a victim of violence has been saved and stabilized, the health care team identifies rehabilitation needs. You are concerned about your patient's inability to perform self-care and to demonstrate safe mobility skills.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Dilemma</h5>
                            <p>As a health care provider, you are concerned about the community as a whole; costs to the community, and the values of the community. You are also aware of client fiduciary responsibility; you recognize costs to your patient when treatment is provided or not provided.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Discussion</h5>
                            <p>Who determines the length of stay and level of care? Who will take care of patients who need rehabilitation but who are unable to pay? Is rehabilitation a basic health care need?</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Approximately 1 in 5 Americans has some form of disability, and 1 in 10 has a severe disability (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997). A person is considered to have a disability, such as a restriction in performance or function in everyday activities, if he or she has difficulty talking, hearing, seeing, walking, climbing stairs, lifting or carrying objects, performing activities of daily living, doing school work, or working at a job. A severe disability is present if a person is unable to perform one or more activities, uses an assistive device for mobility, or needs help from another person to accomplish basic activities. Individuals are also considered severely disabled if they receive federal benefits based on an inability to work.</p>
                        <p>Approximately 54 million Americans are affected by some form of disability, and this number is expected to increase in the coming decades due to the aging of the population. More than half of persons with disability are women, and females with disability outnumber males in all age groups except for those 15 to 24 years old (Jans & Stoddard, 1999). One-third of women 75 years of age and older need personal assistance. Currently, more than 10 million people need personal assistance with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), which include bathing, dressing, feeding, and toileting, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which include grocery shopping, meal preparation, housekeeping, transportation, and managing finances. About 5 million persons use a cane, more than 2 million use a wheelchair, and at least 1 million use crutches or a walker. Use of these devices and other types of assistive technology has increased dramatically due to the aging of the population, technological advances, public policy initiatives, and changes in the delivery and financing of health care (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Among all people age 21 to 64 (the prime employable years), approximately 33% of individuals with a severe disability and 77% of those with a nonsevere disability are employed, compared with 82% of nondisabled people. The employed person with disability, however, earns less money than the nondisabled person (U.S. Census, 1997). In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) (PL 101-336), which constitutes civil rights legislation designed to permit those with disabilities access to job opportunities and to the community. As a result of this act, employers must evaluate an applicant's ability to perform the job and not discriminate on the basis of a disability. Employers must also make "reasonable accommodations," such as equipment or access ramps, to facilitate employment of a person with a disability. The ADA stipulates that communities must provide public transportation that is accessible to people with disabilities. Public facilities (eg, stores, restaurants, hotels) must be accessible and accommodate those with disabilities. Telecommunication providers must offer communication devices for the deaf. A higher quality of life for those with disabilities is an objective of the ADA.</p>
                        <p>Although the regulations took effect in July 1992, compliance has been slow because the reasonable accommodation "without undue hardship" provisions in the law permit businesses to continue with inaccessible conditions. All new construction and modifications of public facilities, however, must address access by people with disabilities.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-3" class="section-heading"><span class="heading-text">Right to Access to Health Care and Health Promotion</span></h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>For years, people with disabilities have been discriminated against in employment, public accommodations, and public and private services including health care. The needs of the disabled in health care settings produce many challenges to health care providers: how to communicate effectively if there are communication deficits, the additional physical demands for mobility, and time required to provide assistance with self-care routines during hospitalization. Physicians and nurses may not know the specific needs of individuals with disability and may fail to provide services for them. For example, an obstetrician may advise a woman with a spinal cord injury not to become pregnant because the physician lacks experience and knowledge in this area of care. The physician and nurses caring for an expectant woman with disability may not know specific transfer techniques to help her onto an examining table or how to advise her on bowel, bladder, and skin care issues during pregnancy. Before labor and delivery, the medical team needs to be educated about the special needs of a woman with a cervical spinal cord injury in regard to management of autonomic hyperreflexia. Often, the person with disability must educate the health care professionals.</p>
                        <p>Because of unfavorable interactions with health care providers, including negative attitudes, insensitivity, and lack of knowledge, people with disability may avoid seeking medical intervention or health promotion programs and activities. For this reason, and because the number of individuals with disability is increasing, nurses must acquire knowledge and skills and be accessible to assist these individuals in maintaining a high level of wellness.</p>
                        <p>Nurses are in key positions to influence the architectural design of health care settings and the selection of equipment that promotes ease of access and health. Padded examination tables that can be raised or lowered make transfers easier for the disabled. Birthing chairs benefit women with disability during yearly pelvic examinations and Pap smears and for urologic evaluations. Ramps, grab bars, and raised and padded toilet seats benefit many persons who have orthopedic disabilities and need routine physical examination and monitoring (eg, bone density measurements). Just as people without disability should have regular screening tests, such as mammography or testicular and prostate examinations, so should people with disability. The health care professionals who provide these screening and monitoring procedures are in a position to influence decisions about how equipment and procedures can be adapted to meet the special needs of their patients, whether these needs are cognitive, motor, or communicative.</p>
                        <p>Nurses can provide expert health promotion education classes that are targeted to the disabled. Classes on nutrition and weight management are extremely important to individuals who are wheelchair dependent and need assistance with transfers. Safe sex classes are needed by adolescents and young adults who have spinal cord or traumatic brain injury, because the threats of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and unplanned pregnancy exist for these populations just as they do for the population in general. Other healthy behaviors about which neurologically disabled persons need education include avoiding alcohol and nonprescription medications while taking antispasmodic and antiseizure medications. Nurses should teach all stroke survivors and patients with diabetes how to monitor their own blood pressure or glucose levels. The warning signs and symptoms of stroke, heart attack, and cancer, as well as how to access help, should also be taught to all disabled persons.</p>
                        <p>As active members of society, people with disabilities are no longer an invisible minority. An increased awareness of the needs of people with disabilities will bring about changes to improve their access and accommodate their needs. Modification of the physical environment permits access to public and private facilities and services, including health care, and nurses can serve as advocates for the disabled to eliminate discriminatory practices.</p>
