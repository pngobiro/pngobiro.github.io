\section*{Management cont'}
$\succ$ Teach the what is expected in the active phase of second stagehow to push(encourage spontaneous/involuntary pushing), if there is prolonged second stage and/or non reassuring fetal status then direct /coach the mother on how to push
- Breathing- it should be rhythmic breathing
- Avoid 'purple pushing' i.e holding breath and pushing for as long as possible (damage to pelvic floor and fetal hypoxia )
- Breathing the baby out- breath in deeply, then on exhale, gently push downward with abdominal muscles while visualising the baby moving down and out. Continue through contraction
- Pushing the baby out- hold breath for 5-7 seconds while pushing, then breathe deeply in and out again until the urge to push becomes strong.
- Postural changes- supine position leads to venacava compression hence postural hypotension, mother to on left lateral position when no contraction in passive second stage

\section*{Management cont}
- Assess maternal response to labour-
-tiredness, ability to push
-Pulse-half hourly, T- 2hrly
-BP- frequently if epidural analgesia is insitu (1hrly)
- Assess fetal condition-
-Assess colour of liquor if membranes rupture- report if there is thick fresh meconium
-Take fetal heart rate (every 5 minutes) after every contraction

\section*{Management cont'}
$\succ$ Ensure maternal comfort-
- sponge the face and the neck with cool flannel
-sips of water if lips are dry
-Empty bladder at the beginning of second stage, if unable and there is full bladder, then catherize to empty bladder
Be ready to augument contractions with an intravenous oxytocin infusion if contractions are inadequate and fetal heart rate is normal
Conduct delivery with support of the perineum to avoid tears

\section*{Preparation for delivery}

Should start when active pushing commences

Warm delivery room with spotlight
Clean area for receiving the baby
Water proof to protect the bed and floor
Warm cot and clothes

\section*{Equipment}

Sterile cord clamps
Clean apron
Prepared oxytocin- in an easily accessible fridge
Neonatal resuscitation equipments- suction machine and tubes, oxygen, radiant heat warmer, resuscitation tray

\section*{Set your trolley as in procedure manual}

Top shelf- delivery pack
- 1 gallipot
- 5 draping towels
- A of episiotomy scissors
- 2 pairs of scissors for cutting the cord
- 2 artery forceps
- 2 perineal pads- one for supporting perineum
- 2 cord clamps
- 2 kidney dishes- one for receiving placenta, another for instruments
- 1 bowl for lotion
- Atleast 10 cotton wool swabs
- Atleast 10 gauze swabs

- Syringes, needles
- Cotton swabs
- Sutures
- Fetoscope
- Lignocaine
- Sterile gloves
- K-Y jelly
- Identification band
- Eye ointment
- Antiseptic lotion
- Prepared syntocinon

\section*{Procedure}
- Recognize second stage and move her to the delivery room
- Explain the procedure to the mother clearly explaining her role in second stage and reassure her
- Together with your assistant, wash hands as for sterile procedure
- Ask your assistant to open the delivery
- Gown and double glove yourself methodically
- Instruct your assistant to put the patient in the dorsal position
- Swab the mother starting from furthest majora, nearest majora, similarly with minora and complete with vestibule
- Lubricate your two fingers and perform vaginal examination to confirm second stage
- Instruct your assistant to check the FHR after every contraction, the mother's pulse after every 10 mins , wipe sweat from mothers face and to administer syntocinon after ruling out the second
- When the mother is in expulsive phase, encourage her to push with contractions relax between contractions. Encourage her all the time and explain the progress being made towards the birth of her baby.
- Drape the mother starting with the nearest thigh, abdomen, furthest thigh and buttocks

\section*{Cont'}
- Prepare the baby towel, with the scissors and two forceps for clamping the cord. Prepare two pieces of cotton wool for wiping the newborn's eyes, some gauze for cleaning the airway and for a covering when cutting the cord.
- At this stage the head might start distending the perineum. The anus starts dilating and the head is seen at the vulva. It keeps receding between contractions.

\section*{crowning}
- Place the left hand on the advancing head with fingers spread equally over the vertex towards the bregma to stop any sudden explosive effort during and after crowning of the head and to maintain flexion. Don't push or hold the head back.
- With the right hand guard the perineum, holding it with the pad. Check if the perineum is stretching.
- Flexion and perineal support is maintained until the biparietal diameter is born
- If the perineum is tight, infiltrate lignocaine and give an episiotomy at the height of a contraction when the perineum is thinned out and the head is $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ visible during contraction.
- Support the perineum till the head is born. After crowning the mother should sigh out or gently blow out breath to reduce active pushing

\section*{Cont'}

\section*{Extension of the head}
- Assist the extension by grasping the parietal eminences with your left hand. Let the head come out slowly and naturally.
- Feel for the cord around the baby's neck. If it is there, slip it from the baby's neck over the head OR slacken it to form a long loop through which the shoulders may pass.

If it is too tight, place two artery forceps on the cord 3 cm apart and cut it between them holding a swab over the cord and unwind it.
- When the nose and mouth come out, ask the mother not to push, wipe away the mucus with a sterile swab. By this point the whole head should be out.
- Allow the head will to restitute and rotate spontaneously to face the mother's left or right thigh. And bring the shoulders in the anterior posterior diameter

\section*{Delivering the Shoulders by Lateral Flexion of the Body}

\section*{Anterior shoulder}
- Place one hand above and one below the foetal head over the ears
- Apply gentle traction downwards toward the anus/neck, making sure it is neither twisted nor bent sideways till the anterior shoulder is free/or slip below symphysis pubis

\section*{Posterior shoulder}
- Guide the head upwards in the direction of the mother's abdomen to release posterior shoulder

\section*{Cont'}
- The rest of the body will be born by lateral flexion
- Place the baby on maternal abdomen, dry the baby thoroughly, wipe the eyes and assess the babies breathing. If the baby cries or breathes spontaneously within 30 s , leave it with the mother. If it does not shout for help and begin resuscitation
- Ask your assistant to give oxytocin 10 iu IM on lateral thigh within one minute of delivery after you have palpated the abdomen to rule out second twin
- Ask your assistant for the time and note the time of birth
- Clamp and cut the cord at 3 and 5 cm from umbilicus
- Give the APGAR score to the baby at one minute

\section*{Body}
- Show the baby to the mother to identify the sex of the baby
- Ask your assistant to continue with the immediate care of the baby
- Continue with active management of third stage- the delivery of the placenta by using control cord traction, uterine massage
- Check the placenta for completeness and/or malformation.
- Measure blood loss
- Do the first examination of the baby
- Weigh the baby
- Do a post natal examination and record all the findings
- Let the mother shower
- Give the mother a hot drink and transfer her to the postnatal ward

\section*{Immediate Care of the Baby}
- Clear the airways by gently wipe/suction mucus from the mouth and nostrils respectively. Do not touch nares as it may stimulate inhalation reflex and give oxygen if necessary.
- Ligate the cord and make sure the ligature is very tight before you cut the cord to prevent blood loss 2-3 minutes after birth.
- Keep the baby warm-Wipe/dry the baby's head and the body and wrap in dry towel, remove wet linen, switch off fans, close curtains, skin to skin contact
- Stimulate the baby- finger flick to the sole of foot, gentle back rubbing
- APGAR Score- the baby at 1,5 and 10 minutes
- Label the baby with the mother's name and I.P. number Record the following information about the baby

Name
Date and time of delivery
Sex of the baby
Birth weight

\section*{APGAR SCORE}

An immediate assessment of the general condition after one minute, five minutes and ten minutes.
Five specific signs used: APGAR
- Appearance - Colour
- Pulse - Heart rate
- Grimace - response to stimuli
- Activity - Muscle tone
- Respiratory efforts - vigorous crying/breathing

A score of $0,1,2$ is awarded to each of these signs in accordance with the APGAR Score Chart.

\section*{APGAR SCORE}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline SIGN & SCORE 0 & SCORE 1 & SCORE 2 \\
\hline APPEARANCE & Pale/blue & Body pink, extremities blue & pink all over \\

\section*{Episiotomy}

\section*{Definition}

This is an incision through perineal tissues designed to enlarge vulval outlet during birth. It involves incision of fourchette, superficial muscles and skin of the perineum and posterior vaginal wall

\section*{Rationale -}
- minimize the risk of severe trauma to the vagina and perineum
- Expedite delivery when there is fetal compromise

\section*{Indication}
- Complicated vaginal delivery-breech, shoulder dystocia, forceps and vacuum extraction
- Scarring from FGM and poorly healed third/fourth degrees tear
- Fetal compromise

\section*{Episiotomy cont'}

Timing- during crowning at the peak of contractions Early episiotomy-
- Bleeding from cut vessels may be severe
- Levator ani muscle may be cut because it will not have been displaced laterally
If given late- you may have no time to infiltrate lignocaine, you may not prevent lacerations
Types of incisions-
1. Mediolateral incision- from midpoint of fourchette and directed at 45 degrees celcius from midline towards a point midway between ischial tuberosity and anus. It avoids damage to anal sphincter and Batholin's glands but difficult to repair

\section*{Episiotomy cont'}
2. Median incision
- It is the midline incision which follows natural insertion of perineal muscles
- It has reduced blood loss,less pain and dyspaerunia, easy to repair
- However, leads to damage of anal sphincter

NB- infiltrate with lignocaine;
If $0.5 \%-10 \mathrm{mls}$
If $1 \%-5 \mathrm{mls}$
It takes three to four minutes before it takes effect
