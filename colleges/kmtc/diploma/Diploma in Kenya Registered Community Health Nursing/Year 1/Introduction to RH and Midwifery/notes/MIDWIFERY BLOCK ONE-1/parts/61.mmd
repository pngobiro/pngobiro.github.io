\section*{Assess the following:}

\section*{Vagina}
- Is it firm or lax?
- Is it moist and cool or dry and hot?
In prolonged labour, when the woman is in maternal distress and is dehydrated, the vagina feels hot and dry.
- Is it bruised?

The cervix
- Positionanterior,post, central
- Dilatation-How much is the Os dilated?
- Effacement-Is it taking up, that is effaced? \%- measure the length of the cervix, a long tightly closed cervix means no labour
In primis, cervix may be fully effaced without dilatation- is often confused with full dilatation. You must locate a depression in the centre
- Is it bruised or oedematous?
- Consistency-Is it firm or soft? Applied or not?
The Membranes
- Are they ruptured or intact?
- If intact are they bulging?

\section*{Assess cont.}

\section*{The Cord}
- Is it presenting or prolapsed?
- If prolapsed is it pulsating

\section*{The Presenting Part}
- Is it fitting the pelvis and cervix well?
- If it is the head, can you feel a suture or fontanel? It will help to determine the position of the presenting part
- Is it well flexed?
- Presentation- cephalic, breech, shoulder, compound
- Station

\section*{Assessment cont"}

Position- relationship of presenting part to the pelvic brim. Occiput is used in vertex presentation

Feel the hard head sutures and fontanel. Determine whether it is the anterior or posterior fontanel by its shape(ant-diamond, post- triangular). If it is the posterior fontanel, then the position is occipito-anterior. If it is the anterior fontanel then the position is occipital-posterior.
Position is recorded as anterior or posterior or transverse. It can be right or left

\section*{Assessment cont"}

Station -The level of the presenting part is expressed in relation to the easily palpable ischial spines/ descended into pelvis
- state if it is above the brim, at the brim, in the cavity or at the outlet.
if it is at the brim (floating) then it is at station -5 .
If it is at the ischial spines, it is said to be at 'zero station
By the time it is seen at the perineum(crowning) it is at station $+5 / 5$.

\section*{Assessment cont}

Check for moulding and caput succedaneum
- Moulding is when the diameters of the foetal skull are reduced in size due to overlapping of the skull bones along the sutures
- Run the finger on the head feeling for the sutures
- Judge the degree of moulding by feeling the amount of overlapping of skull bones

\section*{Assessment cont}

Assess the pelvis for adequacy
- Is it roomy?
- Are the sidewalls well spaced?
- Can you touch the promontory of the sacrum easily?
- Is the pubic arch wide enough?

After checking for moulding, direct the fingers behind the head and make an effort to reach the sacropromontory. The palm of the hand should be facing upwards. Promontory of the sacrum should not be reached.
With the palm facing downwards run the two fingers down along the hollow of the sacrum and determine the shape. The hollow of the sacrum should be curved.

\section*{Assessment cont"}

The two fingers are then moved to where the ischial spines are located on either side of the pelvis. Run the finger along this area to determine whether or not the ischial spines are unduly prominent. Or else you can stretc h your fingers to see if the spines are prominent. The ischial spines should not be prominent.
As you move the fingers with the palm facing upward, on reaching the pubic arch check if it can accommodate two fingers. The apex usually should accommodate two fingers.
Make a fist facing downwards then place the fist between the ischial tuberosities. The Intertuberosity should accommodate four knuckles. Check if it does

\section*{Assessment cont"}

The Discharge
Withdraw the fingers and check if there is:
- Any vaginal discharge
- Any smell
- Any liquor or meconium staining
- Any bleeding

Clear off the area and give the pad

\section*{Vaginal assessment cont''}

Carryout the investigation:
- Take a urine sample for albumin and sugar
- Check for acetone, especially if the patient is in prolonged labour
- Take blood for haemoglobin and cross matching if the patient is anaemic or might need an operation
Analyze the findings and make a decision

\section*{Quiz}
1. On abdominal examination during labour, the sinciput is felt, occiput just felt. The descent is;
a) $4 / 5$
b) $3 / 5$
c) $2 / 5$
d) $1 / 5$
2. Following rupture of membranes during labour, drainange of golden amniotic fluid could be due to;
b) Breech presentation
c) Foetal distress
d) Rhesus iso immunization
e) Previous distress which the fetus overcame

\section*{Partograph}

Definition - it is a graphic and visual record of progress of labour and of all observations made concerning maternal and fetal well being during labour
Purpose - to monitor progress of labour
- Requirements

Assorted colours of pens i.e
Red - for cervical dilatation
Blue/black- descent, vital signs,contractions, drugs and IV fluids
Green - FHR

\section*{Partograph}

What to write on a partograph
- Vital signs, FHR
- Details of vaginal examination
- Medication given
- Urinalysis
- Contractions occurring in ten minutes- frequency, strength, duration
- Fluids given

Demographic data
The cervix dilates progressively from 4 cm at a rate of approximately 1.2 cm and 1.5 cm hourly in primigravida and multigravida respectively

\section*{Partograph: contents}

\section*{Clients information}
- Full name, admission number, age, gravidity, parity
- Date and time of admission
- Time of ruptured membranes

Foetal findings
FHR- half hourly, plotted as dot using green pen
Vaginal examination findings - done four hourly
FHR less than 100bpm and more than180bpm is indicative of significant fetal distress. These lines are darker to remind you of the same

\section*{Partograph}
- VE (on adm and then four hourly)

\section*{State of membranes at each VE}

I-intact ()not ruptured
R- ruptured
C- ruptured Clear fluid
M- meconium stained fluid
B- blood stained fluid
A- absent liquor

\section*{Moulding}
‘0’ - bones seperated, sutured felt easily
+ sutures opposed/just touching each other
++ sutures overlapped but reducible(can be seperated easily with pressure from the finger)
+++ sutures overlapped severely not reducible(cannot be separeted by the pressure from the finger)
Listen to the FHR every FIVE minutes if:
Liquour contains thick green or black meconium
Liquor is absent at the time membranes rupture

\section*{Cervical dilatation}
- Marked with 'X'. Start plotting when dialation is 4 cm and above.
- Plot on alert line and plot clock time directly under the $X$ in the space of time. It should always be to the left of alert line, when its to the right then labour is progressing poorly.
- Moving towards action line suggest you take an action i.e rehydration, empty bladder, encourage her to move around, change to upright position
- Alert line starts at 4 cm and ends at expected point full dilatation at the rate of $1 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{hr}$ dilatation
- Action line - parallel 4 hrs to the right of alert line

\section*{Cont'}

\section*{Descent}
- Assessed by abdominal palpation and plotted in fifths as 'O' before VE
5/5- head completely above the brim (5 fingers above brim)
4/5- sinciput high, occiput easily felt(4 fingers above brim)
3/5- sinciput easily felt, occiput felt (3 fingers above brim)
2/5-sinciput felt, occiput just felt, head engaged (2 fingers above brim)
1/5- sinciput felt, occiput not felt(1 finger above the brim)
0/5- non of the head felt

\section*{Contractions- half hourly}
- Frequency- number of contractions felt over ten minutes period
Squares in the section of 'contraction per 10 mins' are numbered 1-5, each square rep one contraction. If there two contractions, two squares will be shaded
- Duration- time contractions lasts in seconds and charted as weak, moderate or strong i.e
Less than 20s=weak
Between 20s-40s = moderate
More than 40s = strong

\section*{cont}

\section*{Maternal Vital signs}
- Pulse- half hourly plotted as a dot
- BP - four hourly plotted using arrows
- Temp -two hourly_plotted as dot

\section*{Drugs and medication-}

Oxytocin- record amount per volume of IV fluid e.g 5 IU in 500 mls NS. Record drops per minute every 30 minutes
Any additional drugs and IV fluids given as appropriately (as per that time)
- Hours -record the time elapsed since the onset of active phase of labour
- Time - record time of admission as zero time, the actual hour of the day is recorded below the hour time
- Encourage the mother to pass urine every two hours and test for protein and acetone, note the volume

\section*{Transitional phase: physiology}

Cervix dilates From 8 cm to 10 cm ,
- Maternal restlessness/ Feeling anxious
- Desire for pain relief
- A sense that the process is never ending and demand to the midwife to end the process immediately/hardest time/makes straining noises
- Contractions become stronger and longer, more frequent
- Membranes may rupture spontaneously, fetal axis pressure increases flexion reducing presenting diameters hence rapid progress/Fetus descends rapidly into the birth canal
- Frequent feeling of hot and cold, involuntary shaking
- Feeling nauseated and/or vomiting
- Confused because of the feeling that you want to empty bowels/rectal pressure

\section*{Second Stage (expulsive phase)}
- This starts with the full dilatation of the cervix, the expulsion of the presenting part and ends with the complete delivery of the baby.
- Resistance offered by the lower uterine segment, the cervix and the pelvic floor has been overcome by uterine contractions, aided by the action of the voluntary muscles of the abdominal wall and the diaphragm. The presenting part can be pushed down onto the pelvic floor.
- Full dilatation of the cervix is accompanied by a bearing down sensation during contractions and women are usually encouraged to push.
As the contraction comes on, the woman takes a deep breath, then holds it and subsequently bears down with all the force of her abdominal muscles.
