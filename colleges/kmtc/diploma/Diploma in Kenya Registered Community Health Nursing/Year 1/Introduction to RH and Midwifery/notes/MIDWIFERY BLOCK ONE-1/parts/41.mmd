\section*{First stage cont'}

Vital signs
- Foetal heart rate half hourly or more often if you suspect distress. Count for complete one minute between contractions
- Uterine contractions- half hourly (strength, type, frequency and duration) - a few seconds at the beginning and at the end they are painless but felt by the midwife. DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE MOTHER FEELS PAIN FOR YOU TO FEEL FOR CONTRACTIONS. Contracting uterus feels harder and it is soft in between contractions
- Maternal pulse (half hourly) if >100bpm, suspect anxiety, pain, infection, ketosis or haemorrhage
- BP (4hrly) and temperature (2hrly). High temperature may indicate infection or ketosis, or associated with epidural analgesia

\section*{Mng cont'}
- Respiratory rate 4hrly
- Check the urine output and check for albumin/protein and acetone if indicated every two hours
- VE-Every four hours check the level of the presenting part and the degree of dilatation of the cervix
- Constantly check the woman's reaction to labour and be aware/sensitive of her needs. If anxious, fearful or in pain, give her praise, reassurance and encouragement and, inform her about the progress of labour. Do not give pethidine if delivery is imminent as it depresses the baby's respiration

\section*{Management of first stage}
- Towards the end ofthe first stage, she can rest on her side, or in any position she finds comfortable, for example, squatting
- Discourage pushing or bearing down before the cervix is fully dilated. Early pushing only exhausts the woman and will cause oedema of the cervix and interfere with normal dilatation. BUT spontaneous pushing when cervix is fully dilated
- Teach the mother on breathing techniques during labour and delivery- breath out slowly as she relaxes with each expiration

\section*{Management of first stage}
- When the membranes rupture, usually at the end of the first stage, check the colour of the liquor for meconium staining, the foetal heart rate and do a vaginal examination to exclude prolapse of the cord
- Meconium is passed when the fetus is hypoxic i.e hypoxia relaxes anal sphincter. The colour of liquor becomes green. Muddy yellow or slightly green may indicate fetus is recovering from hypoxia

\section*{Mng cont'}
- Golden yellow liquor may indicate rhesus isoimmunization- excess bilirubin
- Sudden onset of Bleeding after membrane rupture indicates ruptured vasa praevia (acute emergency)
- Abdominal pressure in breech presentation can make the fetus to pass frank thick meconium
- Pre-labour rupture of membranes- with no signs of labour and no liquor drainage avoid digital examination(risk of infection). May consider inducing labour(active management of the mother)
Pain management

\section*{Foetal compromise}

\section*{Signs of compromise}
- Fetal bradycardia
- Fetal tachycardia

Passage of meconium stained amniotic fluid
Action to take
- Call obstetrician
- Stop oxytocin, place the mother in left lateral position
- Give oxygen to the mother via face mask if indicated eg anaemic, preeclampsia
- Expedite deliveryfirst stage- C/S
*Second stage- forceps/ ventouse extraction.
* Prepare for neonatal resuscitation

\section*{Management of first stage}

\section*{To prepare for clean delivery you should:}
- Encourage the mother to empty bowel in early first. If loaded on VE(not routine) may consider enema or suppositories
- Avoid shaving the pubic hair, given current HIV/AIDS prevalence rates
- Allow the mother to have bath whenever she wishes especially if she didn't shower at home as it is soothing during labour
- Practice aseptic techniques through labour
- Ensure a clean environment within and around the ward

\section*{To ensure comfortability of the mother}
- Allow her to change position and move around,
- Use back massage,
- Have a chosen companion with her during labour,
- Allow her to take fluids as required and return the placenta to parents if so desired and directed by the culture.
- Do not forget to check on the foetus especially if you suspect foetal distress

\section*{Pain Management in labour}
- Pain is felt when nociceptors are stimulated. Substance P and glutamate facilitate information about pain
- However endorphins and enkephalins modulates and reduces transmission of pain by inhibiting release of substance $P$
- Labour pain is that of referred pain i.e pain from the uterus is felt as if it is coming from skin area supplied by the same section of spinal cord i.e labia and the back
- Pain from stretching muscles, viscera and ligaments is transmitted by afferent or visceral sensory neurons which run adjacent to pain fibres from the skin in the spinothalamic tract. Pain is interpreted in the cerebral cortex

\section*{Pain cont'}

Physiological responses to pain in labour
- Increase respiration rate, reduced PaCO2 level with increased PH
- Increased cardiac out put in first and second stages by 20\% and 50\% respectively. Each contraction returns $250-300 \mathrm{mls}$ into maternal circulation
- Release of catecholamine especially adrenaline which reduces uterine blood flow

\section*{Pain cont'}

Pain perception in labour is influenced by:
- Culture
- Anxiety
- Fear
- Fatigue
- Full bladder
- Individual pain tolerance
- Previous experience with pain
- Level of support during labour
- Malpositions, CPD

\section*{Pain mng}

\section*{Non pharmacological methods}

Gate control theory- its based on the concept that the sensory nerve pathways that pain sensation use to travel to the brain will only allow a limited number of sensations to travel any given time. By sending alternate signals through these pathways, the pain signals can be blocked from ascending the neurological pathway and inhibits the brain's perception and sensation of pain. This is the basis of non-pharmacological methods.
- Hydrotherapy/whirlpool/shower- warm water- heat relieves muscle spasms reducing strain in the pelvis
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)stimulates production of natural endorphins and enkephalins, impedes incoming pain stimuli
- Breathing techniques- deep rhythmic breathing
- Imagery and visualization- visualize cervical dilatation, baby moving down, pleasant scene

\section*{Pain cont'}
- Distraction - Music therapy, television
- Back rubs and massage
- Light gentle circular stroking of the client's abdomen with the fingertips in rhythm with breathing during contraction
- Sacral counter pressure using fist or heel of hand at sacral area especially persistent OPP
- Frequent maternal positional changes e.g semi sitting, squatting, kneeling and rocking back and forth, walking. Upright positions are less painful and has minimum tears
- Of great importance is emotional support and encouragement as well as praise for the woman for how well she is coping with the considerable pain of labour

\section*{Pain cont'}

\section*{Pharmacological methods}

Opiates drugs- pethidine, diamoprphine, meptazinol
S/E- nausea, vomiting, drowsiness(mother and baby sleepy hence difficulty to breast feed), depression of baby's respiratory centre at birth, muscle relaxation (inhibit action of calcium ions and release of oxytocin from posterior pituitary gland- slow down the birthing process)
1. Inhalational analgesia- equal mixing of nitrous oxide N 2 O and oxygen via entonox apparatus- Nitrous Oxide inhibits neuronal and synaptic transmission of pain in CNS
2. Epidural analgesia-e.g bupivacaine and fentanyl
- Explain procedure and obtain consent, put up IV fluids to prevent hypotension
- Place the mother in left lateral position and introduce anaesthesia at lumber region-(L1-L2 OR L2-L3 ORL3-L4) and monitor maternal BP and FHR throughout procedure

\section*{Pain mnx cont'}

\section*{After epidural anesthesia}
- Monitor vital signs BP/pulse/ FHR closely every 5 minutes for the first half an hour then halfhourly
- Change position regularly to prevent injury
- Encourage the mother to empty bladder she may not feel it full
- The mother may not feel contractions or desire to bear down so monitor closely, if possible electronically

\section*{Complications}
- Dural puncture headache and backache- hinder her ability to (and interest in) care for her baby
- Respiratory arrest
- Cardiac arrest
- Loss of bladder sensation- catheterize
- Fetal compromise
- Reduced mobility and sensitivity to bear down-Increased need for assisted delivery(vacuum and forceps delivery)

\section*{In summary first stage mnx}
- Mnx on admission
- Communication and emotional support
- Bladder and bowel care
- Cleanliness and infection prevention
- Mobility and
- Feeding in labour
- Vital signspartograph
- Health educationpushing, breathing etc
- Mnx after rupture of membranes

\section*{Vaginal examination procedure}

Trolley
Top shelf-sterile VE pack containing:
- A bowl,
- gallipot,
- cotton wool swabs,
- sterile pads,
- two draping towels,
- two hand towels

Bottom shelf
- Two pairs of sterile gloves
- Lubricant cream-K-Y jelly
- Container with disinfectant
- Extra sterile cotton wool
- Antiseptic solutionHibitane
- Receptacle for used swabs

\section*{Procedure of VE}
- Wash hands, clean trolley and place VE pack on top shelf.
- Ask the mother to empty bladder and test for proteins and sugar
- Place mother in semi-lithotomy position(lowered head of the bed) it should be maintained during the examination to the mother
- Scrub your hands for at least five minutes, dry them and put on sterile gloves.
- Ask the assistant to open the top flap of the sterile pack and Set it with cheatle
- Instruct the assistant to pour solution and lubricant in the bowl and gallipot respectively not contaminating it
- Inspect the perineum and the external parts- for discharge, bleeding, scars, lesions, inflammation, cracks and smell, warts, colour and odour of amniotic fluid(offensive- infection, greencompromise/postmaturity)

\section*{Procedure of Vaginal examination}
- Pick one swab at a time with the dominant hand, deep in antiseptic solution, squeeze and carefully drop it into the other hand until all the five swabs are dropped
- Using DOMINANT hand Swab the labia majora using downward stroke starting with the further then the nearer majora
- Swab the labia minora using the same technique
- Using NON DOMINANT hand swab the vestibule
- Drape the abdomen and buttocks using sterile towels

\section*{Procedure of vaginal examination}
- Lubricate the index and middle finger of the dominant hand
- Ask the mother to breathe in and out slowly while you perform digital examination.
- Insert the fingers obliquely inside the vagina with the thumb tucked in or above the symphysis pubis. Your left hand should be on the mother's abdomen.
- The fingers to be introduced are held on a higher level than the vaginal orifice during insertion to avoid contact with the anus. Fingers should not be withdrawn until the required information has been obtained.

\section*{Vaginal examination cont"}
- The fingers are initially directed along the anterior wall of the vagina with palmar surface downwards then rotated upwards.
- The fingers are then directed upwards to the position of the cervical Os.
- At times the Os is not felt readily, the fingers should then be directed backwards and upwards
