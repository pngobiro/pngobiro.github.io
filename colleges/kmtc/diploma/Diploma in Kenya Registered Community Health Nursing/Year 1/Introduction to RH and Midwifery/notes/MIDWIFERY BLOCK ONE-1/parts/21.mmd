\section*{Physiology cont'}
- Before labour is established, contractions are fairly weak, occuring every $15-20 \mathrm{~min}$ and may last for 30 sec .
- With time, they occur with rhythmic regularity and intervals between them gradually lessens as the length and strength gradually increase. By the end of first stage, they occur at 2-3 min intervals and are very strong
- Contractions are recorded in terms of strength, duration and frequency
- strength - recorded as weak, moderate and strong depending on how long they last. i.e weak take less than 20 seconds, moderate last between 20-40 seconds and strong lasts between 40-60 seconds
- Frequency is recorded as how many contractions occur in 10 minutes

\section*{Cont'}
- As the contraction occurs, the circulation through the uterine wall is reduced and the foetal heart rate is slowed
If the uterus contracts continuously the foetus dies from lack of oxygen (anoxia) and the mother also gets very exhausted because the uterus uses up a lot of energy

\section*{After contraction/Relaxation phase}
- The muscle recovers but shorter and gets ready for the next contraction
- The mother is also able to relax
- The foetal heart rate regains its normal rate

If there is increasing foetal tachycardia between contractions or if the bradycardia is prolonged after each contraction, then foetal distress sets in

\section*{Physiology continued}
6. Effacement. It is the inclusion of the cervical canal into lower uterine segment
- Before labour, the cervix of a primagravida is a thick hard cone which protrudes into the vagina, at least one inch long.
- When labour begins the strongly contracting upper segment of the uterus starts retracting and getting shorter, while the thinner lower segment of the uterus gets pulled away from the presenting part stretching the lower segment.
Two mechanism are proposed
conventional belief- it takes place from above down wards i.e the retracted lower segment pulls the muscle fibres around internal Os and the cervix merges into lower segment, external Os remain unchanged
outward unrolling mechanism- external Os is taken up first. The cervix thin from external Os upwards, internal Os thins last

\section*{Cont'}
- In a primigravida the cervix usually becomes almost fully effaced before any dilation takes place, while in multiparous women the two processes take place together. (might be already effaced and be dilated enough to admit a finger up to the internal Os even before labour is established.) The canal is called 'MULTIPS Os'
7. Dilatation of the cervix- is the enlargement of uterine os to permit passage of fetal head It occurs due to uterine action and counter pressure applied by bag of intact membranes and /or presenting part on the cervix. Well applied part enhances contraction and retraction

\section*{Cont'}
8. Show - cervical dilatation leads to the loss of cervical plug/ operculum through vaginal canal within a few hours after labour starts.
- It is blood stained mucoid discharge. Blood comes from ruptured capillaries in the parietal decidua where chorion detached from dilating cervix. It should not be frank fresh red blood

\section*{Mechanical factors}

\section*{1. Formation of Forewaters}
- The contractions of the uterus dilate the internal Os of the cervix which then separate the chorion from the decidua of the lower uterine segment closest to it.
- A small bag of membranes is formed and is forced into the internal Os by the increased intrauterine pressure. At the beginning of each contraction, a little more amniotic fluid is forced into the bag of membranes (bulging membranes)
- The head of the foetus then comes down like a ball valve (well flexed and fitting) and separates the amniotic fluid above it (hind waters) from that in the bag forming fore waters
- Therefore pressure applied to hindwaters is not applied to forewaters hence keeps membranes intact
- However, if hind waters break, it may be difficult to diagnose rupture of membranes

\section*{Mechanical cont"}

\section*{2. general fluid pressure}
- With intact membranes, pressure exerted is equalized throughout the uterus and over the fetal body. Fluid is incompressible.
- This prevents compression of fetal head, placenta and the cord between the uterine wall and fetus during contraction thus preventing fetal hypoxia
- The physiologic time to rupture membranes is at the end of first stage when the cervix is fully dilated and the mother has expulsive forces

\section*{Mechanical cont'}
- In ill fitting presenting part, the forewaters are not cut off effectively hence membranes may rupture early.
Caul- is a situation where membranes do not rupture and are seen as bulging sac covering the head when it is being born
- Routine Artificial Rupture of Membranes (ARM) reduces the length of labour by 60-120 minutes, and should be reserved for women with slow progress of labour only

\section*{cont}
3. Fetal axis pressure
- Occurs when the membranes have ruptured
- Contractions are transmitted to the upper pole of the foetus, normally the breech, down the long fetal axis and applied by the presenting part to the cervix.
- This facilitate descend and dilatation

\section*{Management of the mother in the first stage}
1. Admission room

Communicate calmly to the mother, reassuring the mother-explain procedures, seek permission and discuss findings
- Assess and decide whether she is in labour or not.
- If you are sure she is NOT in labour send her home to wait.
- If she is in labour, keep her in the ward and continue monitoring her progress
Assessment involves history taking, physical examination and vaginal examination, carryout tests/investigations

\section*{Admission}

Check the woman's antenatal card for any identified risk factors and abnormalities in pregnancy. This involves medical and obstetric risks
If she has not been attending an antenatal clinic, this is the time to take detailed history as covered in the introductory Block

\section*{Find history of present labour-}
- When the labour started /Onset of contractions and their characteristics
- Whether membranes have ruptured /Leakage of fluid
- Last oral intake. In early labour advice to eat light food and drink
- Character of fetal movement
- Presence or absence of vaginal bleeding
- Any presence of show
- Presence or absence of contractions
- Any treatment given

\section*{Admission}

\section*{Review past history}
- Make sure the names are correctly spelled because this can eventually result in problems when registering the baby.
- Review the last day of menstruation to calculate the expected date of delivery.
- Check her age, parity and contraceptive history
- Birth plan
- Gestational age and outcomes of previous babies
- Special clinics attended
- Blood results including rhesus isoimmunization, haemoglobin, HIV status (ANC profile)
- Any known problems

\section*{Admission}

Do physical examination
NB- explain the significance of each examination and consent before proceeding, and ensure privacy, wash hands
a) Assess the general condition (tiredness/exhausted, dehydration and oedema of the face, hands and feet, anaemia, great pain)and progress of labour in the mother, as well as vital signs (TPR BP).
Test urine for protein, glucose and ketones and measure the height : report any abnormalities.
NB-
- presence of ketone- starvations, maternal distress
- glucose- due to IV glucose administration, large quantity of carbohydrates eaten
- Protein- UTI, pre-eclampsia
a) Carry out head to toe examination- emphasize on abdominal and vaginal examination

\section*{Admission}

Conduct an abdominal examination checking for:
Inspection-
- Over-distension of the abdomen, scars or other abnormality
- Over-distension of bladder

Palpation-
- Height of fundus
- Possible presence of twins or multiple pregnancy
- Contractions - frequency, length, type and strength
- Lie of foetus - this is the relation of the long axis of the foetus to the long axis of the uterus (it can be longitudinal, oblique or transverse)
- presentation-Is it a head (cephalic) or the buttocks (breech
- position of the foetal occiput relative to the mother

Auscultation-
- Rate and rhythm of the foetal heart

\section*{Admission}

Vaginal examination
it should not be a routine procedure because it is uncomfortable to the mother and you may introduce infections into uterine cavity especially when the membranes are ruptured
To avoid infections, scrub and put on sterile gloves Then thoroughly swab the perineum of the woman with an antiseptic solution such as Hibitane
While performing a vaginal examination, you should observe the mother's nonverbal communication

\section*{Vaginal examination}

A vaginal examination is necessary to:
- Check if the patient is in labour and what stage of labour,cevical position, presentation, - done on admission
- Assess the progress of labour- done every four hours during the first stage to assess the degree of effacement, consistency, and dilatation of the cervix, and the station of the head relative to the ischial spines, status of membranes
- Rule out prolapsed cord when the membranes rupture
- Confirm full dilatation of cervix/second stage
- Confirm axis of the fetus and presentation of second twin

Do not do a vaginal examination if the mother has an ante-partum haemorrhage, because if there is placenta praevia, severe haemorrhage will occur

\section*{Management cont''}

\section*{KEEP YOUR RECORDS IN A PARTOGRAPH}
- Admit the patient to the waiting room, reassure her and introduce her to other patients,
- Communication- ensure appealing environment, and right attitude to the mother. Explain what is being done at every stage. Ensure privacy and confidentiality
- Emotional support- express caring, advocacy and nonjudgemental attitude towards the mother. Allow birth companion to be with the mother and assist her with massage, encouragement, movement and wiping her brow with a wet towel. Assist the to anticipate labour positively
- Encourage her to empty the bowel in early stage of labour, may give an microenema/suppository (this will reduce the risk of faecal soiling and infection at delivery). However most women have loose stools in early labour

\section*{Mng cont''}
- Cleanliness/Prevent infection- clean the labour ward, encourage personal hygiene(warm birth, hosp gown), wash hands before any procedure, put on gloves, keep membranes intact unless there is positive indication
- Mobility and bladder care- Encourage her to walk about and empty her bladder frequently/ two hourly. If the bladder is full and she cannot empty it on her own, catheterize her using aseptic technique. Sound and feel of water help trigger micturition reflex. Full bladder slows descent and reduces capacity of the uterus to contract (risk of PPH).

\section*{Mnx cont'}
- Feeding in labour

Give her plenty of fluids as she has to work hard and needs the energy
Give easily digestible food especially in latent phase including low fat foods and carbohydrates such as toast, cereal, fruit juice, tea plain biscuits,. High residue solid and/or fatty take a long time to be emptied from stomach in labour .Should she need an operation and anaesthesia, the emptying of the stomach will be difficult and she might vomit and aspirate the vomitus. Aspiration of Undigested food may block airway.

\section*{Management of first stage}

Long fasting woman has strong gastric acid in the stomach which when aspirated can cause chemical pneumonitis (Mendelson's syndrome)
Long hours of starvation also results in gluconeogenesis i.e conversion of protein and fat into glucose to provide energy for contraction. This may results into ketoacidosis
High concentration of intravenous glucose increase fetal blood glucose thereby causing fetal hyperinsulism and later neonatal hypoglycemia
