\section*{Method}

\section*{Infiltration-}
- Insert two fingers into vagina along the proposed incision line to protect the head
- Insert the needle just below the skin up to $4-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ following the same line
- Check if in blood vessel by aspirating, inject about a third slowly as you withdraw the needle.
- Re-directing the needle just before the tip is fully withdrawn, inject the remaining on either side of the line

\section*{Incision- Mayo scissor is used}
- Insert the two fingers as before and position the blades- one in another out
- Make a single deliberate cut $4-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ along the infiltrated line during contraction
- Birth of the head which follows immediately should be controlled to avoid extension of the episiotomy. Incase delivery delays, apply pressure at the incised part
- infiltration

\section*{Perineal tears/trauma}
- Should be assessed immediately after delivery before oedema and bleeding is profuse
- Assessment should be carried out to determine the extent of trauma Classification
a) location
- Trauma can be of labia anteriorly or of perineum posteriorly
b) Classification of posterior trauma/ degrees as per anatomical structures destroyed
1. First degree tear- involves fourchette (vaginal mucosa and connective tissue) only
2. Second degree tear- fourechette and superficial perineal muscles (bulbocavernosus, transverse perineal muscles, pubococcygeus)
3. Third degree tear- partial or complete disruption of anal sphincter muscles. May involve either or both internal and external sphincter muscles
4. Fourth degree tear- anal sphincter muscles with breach of rectal mucosa

Others
Light source

\section*{Tears cont'}
- Nb - third and fourth degree tears repaired by obstetrician

Ensure the mother is warm and comfortable in a lithotomy position with her legs on stirrups
Ensure a good directional light
Ensure you are in a comfortable position
Scrub your hands and put on sterile gloves

Use absorbable synthetic polyglycolic acid (stronger, less allergy and less probability of infections) size 2-0 or polyglactin 910 sutures
Start the repair at the fourchette for proper alignement of vaginal opening
- Clean perineum and place sterile towel under the buttocks
- Infiltrate the tear/episiotomy (mucosa, muscles and skin) with 10 mls $0.5 \%$ lignocaine and allow time to take effect (into the muscle- IV injection causes convulsions and death)
- Insert vaginal pack high up the vagina
- Identify the apex/top of the tear/episiototmy and repair the posterior vaginal wall from apex downwards. Use a continuous suture, starting 1 cm above the top

\section*{Tears Cont'}
- At the opening of the vagina, bring together the cut edges, bring the needle under vaginal opening and out through the perineal tear and tie
- Do not pull the thread too tightly as oedema will develop within the first $24-48 \mathrm{hrs}$
- Repair deeper perineal muscles using interrupted sutures. Ensure proper estimation of tissues. Proper estimation does not need skin repair
- If perineal skin repair is done, start at the fourchette downwards use continous subcuticular suture or interrupted sutures
- Remove vaginal pack,
- Sutures should not penetrate rectal mucosa to prevent rectal vaginal fistula
Inspect the sutured areas to confirm haemostasis before removing vaginal pack
Do vaginal examination to rule out narrowed introitus Perform digital rectal examination to rule out rectal involvement Clean perineum and give the mother sanitary pad

\section*{Care of the}
pain managempisiotomy/Trauma
- Ice pack/cold water at the site- reduce pain and swelling
- Mild pain killers-ibuprofen, paracetamol
- Eat high fiber food and increased fluids- to prevent constipation
- Incase of $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $4^{\text {th }}$ degrees - consider stool softeners

\section*{Cleanliness-}
- Frequent sitz baths in warm salty water- for about 20 minutes- 3-4 times
- After bowel movement, clean perineum from front back
- Avoid use of tampons or douches

Avoid sexual intercourse for four to six weeks- till the wound heals
Tell the mother to report if she has foul discharge, dysuria, vaginal bleeding, severe pelvic pain, high fever, passing suture/gas/stool through vaginal canal
Complications- haemotoma, rectal vaginal fistula, faecal incontinence, infections, episiotomy extension into $3^{\text {rd }}$ or $4^{\text {th }}$ degree tears

\section*{Third Stage (placental}

Starts immediately after the bittas hebolaby. It includes the delivery of the placenta and membranes as well as the control of bleeding.

\section*{Physiology of third stage}
- Lasts for between 5-15 minutes, but within 1 hr is normal
- Characterized by separation, descent and expulsion of placenta and membranes and control of bleeding from placental site
- The uterus reduces in size 2.5 cm below the umbilicus, or 15 cm above the symphysis pubis after the expulsion of the foetus
1. Separation and descent

Brought about by mechanical and haemostatic factors
A) Mechanical factors

Based on the ability of the uterine muscle to retract. By the end of second stage placental site area has diminished by 75\% due to retraction

\section*{Mechanism of the Third Stage of Labour}

\section*{The Mechanical Factors}
a) Retraction of uterine muscles
- Retraction compresses the uterus and inter-villous blood is forced into spongy layer of decidua basalis
- Retraction of oblique muscles exerts pressure on blood vessels preventing blood from draining back into maternal system
With this vessels become congested and tensed, they burst with subsequent contraction, releasing some blood between thin septa of spongy layer and placental surface stripping it from its attachment. Surface area of placental attachment reduces. Since the placenta is inelastic, it does not contract, so it detaches from the shrinking uterine wall

\section*{Cont'}

\section*{b) Formation of retroplacental clot}

Separation begins centrally so that retro placental clot is formed. This clot enhance separation by exerting pressure at the midpoint of placental attachment stripping the lateral borders and peeling the membranes off the uterine wall.

\section*{The clot becomes enclosed in a membranous bag as the placenta descents fetal surface first (Schultze method)}
- It takes shorter duration,
- Less blood loss and
- Complete expulsion of membranes and placenta

\section*{Cont'}

In some cases, placenta begin to detach unevenly at tone of the lateral borders, blood escapes and separation not helped by the weight of the retroplacental clot. Placenta descents slipping side ways, maternal surface first (Mathews Duncan Method) associated with:
- Ragged,incomplete expulsion of membranes
- A higher blood loss.
- It takes longer

With the next contraction the placenta is pushed into the vagina and expelled

\section*{B)Haemostasis- control of bleeding}
- Normal blood flow through placental site is $500-800 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$

\section*{Factors responsible for haemostasis}
1. Retraction of oblique uterine muscles fibres in upper uterine segment.
- Exerts pressure on torn vessels acting as clamps that ligate the vessels. Criss-cross fibres control bleeding by compressing the blood vessels. These fibres are also known as 'living ligatures'
Ruptured placenta praevia bleeds profusely because of lack oblique fibres in lower segments
2. Vigorous uterine contraction after separation that brings walls into opposition
3. Activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems after placental seperation especially at placental site to intensify clot formation

\section*{Signs of uterine separation}
- The signs of descent of the placenta in the uterus are:
* The uterus becomes hard/ fundus becomes round/globular(like a cricket ball), smaller and more mobile.
* The umbilical cord lengthens and does not recede on pressing at the symphysis pubis.
* There is fresh gush of blood/loss

Methods of placental delivery
- Mathews-Duncan method- placenta is expelled with maternal side exposed
- Schultz Method- placenta is expelled with foetal side exposed

\section*{Management of third stage}

\section*{Use of uterotonics}
they stimulate uterine smooth muscle to contract
They may be administered:
- With crowning of the head-ergometrin
- At the birth of anterior shoulder- syntometrine
- After birth of the baby before placental delivery - IM oxytocin
- After delivery of placenta - oxytocin infusion

They include:
-Syntometrine (ergometrine + oxytocin)
-Syntocinon (oxytocin)
- Ergometrine
- prostaglandins

\section*{Uterotonics}

\section*{IV ergometrine- $\mathbf{0 . 2 5 ~ m g}$}

Acts within 45s, used for treatment PPH that is due to hypotonic uterus. Not recommended for PPH prophylaxis because of likely retained placenta
Associated with increased blood pressure nausea and vomiting

\section*{I.M Syntometrine - 5IU oxytocin and 0.5mg ergometrine}

Oxytocin acts within 2.5 min while ergometrine $6-7 \mathrm{~min}$
There is a strong sustained contractions. Given at birth of anterior shoulder
Associated with increased blood pressure,nausea and vomiting
NB- no more than 2 doses of ergometrine 0.5 mg should be given because of S/E
C/I- HTN, Cardiac disease

\section*{IM/IV Oxytocin /syntocinon}

If IV-slowly but not more than 5IU. Causes fatal hypotension and water intoxication
Drug of choice for prophylaxis, safe to use than ergometrine/ when combined Prostaglandins/ misoprostol -uterine irrigation/intramural(uterine muscle) Are expensive and associated with diarhoe and cardiovascular complications Best used to treat PPH not as prophylaxis

\section*{Active management of third stage}

NB- place the mother in dorsal position
-Ensure strict aseptic technique is used
-Start active management of third stage
-Manage the mother after placenta delivery

Active management Involves:
- Routine administration of uterotonics- IV/IM after birth of the baby
- Cord clamping 2-3 minutes after delivery of the baby
- Delivery of the placenta by controlled cord traction (cord traction with counter pressure- push and pull)
- Uterine massage after placenta delivery and after 15 minutes for two hours
Aim-
- To prevent PPH
- To fasten third stage

\section*{1. Uterotonics}
- Within one minute of delivery, palpate abdomen to rule out second twin, then give oxytocin 10 iu IM lateral thigh or ergometrine $\mathbf{0 . 2 ~ m g ~ I M}$ if oxytocin is absent. Do not give ergometrine to mothers with preeclampsia, eclampsia and hypertension because it increases pressure, and risks of convulsions and cerebral vascular accidents

\section*{2. Controlled Cord Traction}

\section*{Before CCT, ensure that}
- Uterotonic drug has been administered and has been given time to act-
- The uterus is well contracted- more round and firm fundus or cord lengthens. Don't wait for the gush of blood
- Counter traction is applied
