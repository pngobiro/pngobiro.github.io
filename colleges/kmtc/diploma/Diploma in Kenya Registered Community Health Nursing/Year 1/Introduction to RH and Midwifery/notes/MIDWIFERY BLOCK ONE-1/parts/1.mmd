\section*{BROAD OBJECTIVES}

By the end of the course you should be able to ;
- Describe Normal labour
- Describes normal Puerperium
- Manage the Neonate after birth
- Use case study to manage a mother up to six weeks

\section*{Lasts few weeks to pregnancy?/pre-labour signs/ premonitory signs of labour}
- Mood swings and surge of energy experienced
- lightening (2-3 wks)- lower uterine segment expand and the fetal head sink lower and may engage in primigravidae. Hence the fundus descends creating more space for lungs and breathing becomes easier, heart and stomach function easily
- Symphysis pubis widens, pelvic floor becomes more relaxed and softened and the uterus descends into pelvisthe head engages
- Walking may be difficult because of mobile symphsis pubis
- Relaxed sacroiliac joints give rise to backache
- Lightening increase pressure in the pelvis causing pelvic venous congestion and lower limb congestion

\section*{Cont"}
- Increased vaginal secretions
- Frequency of micturation (limited capacity of the bladder), urgency (Irritation)and some degree of stress incontinence. The laxity of the pelvic floor muscles gives rise to poor sphincter control causing stress incontinence
- Non progressive Braxton Hicks Contractions (false pains) gradually changes into progressive ones--the uterus contracts intermittently but the contractions are not strong enough to overcome the resistance of a normal cervix and do not lead to its dilation
A multipara may have such 'false pains' for some days before the onset of true labour
- The cervix becomes soft and able to dilate (in pregnancy it is firm and closed)
- Mixed feelings of excited anticipation to fearfull expectancy

\section*{NORMAL LABOUR}

Labour -the process whereby the foetus, placenta and membranes are expelled through the birth canal after 28 weeks of gestation.
Characteristics of Normal labour
- Duration - completed within 18 hours
- Occurs at term between 37 and 42 weeks
- Is spontaneous in onset
- The foetus presents by the vertex
- Low risk throughout the process
- The newborn and the mother are in good condition after birth/ no complications (child requires minimal or no resuscitation)

\section*{Onset of labour}

The presence of the following signs and symptoms will give evidence that the mother is in labour:
- Contractions of the uterus, which are increasingly strong, painful and regular. Contractions are painful due to:
a. Hypoxia because of the duration of the contraction.
b. Compression of the nerve endings in the myometrium.
c. Cervical stretch and dilatation.
d. Perineal stretch
- The cervix is taken up into the lower uterine segment causing dilatation of the cervix (effacement)
- Show -mucoid blood stained discharge
- Sometimes there is rupture of membranes with drainage of liquor amnii (amniotic fluid)

\section*{TRUE VS FALSE CONTRACTIONS}

There can be true and false labour. The contractions of true labour are regular and intense. In false labour, the contractions are sporadic (Braxton-Hicks contractions). False contractions occur during the last weeks of

\end{tabular}

\section*{What initiate labour?}

\section*{Hormonal Factors}
- Close to term progesterone levels in the body fall, while at the same time levels of oestrogen rises. Effects of oestrogen
a. Overcome inhibiting effects of progesterone
b. Cause uterine muscles fibres to display oxytocic receptors (sensitises the uterine muscles) and form gap junctions with each other
c. Stimulate placenta to release prostaglandins that induce production of enzymes that will digest collagen in the cervix thus softening it.
- The decidua releases prostaglandins (PGs), mainly PGE2 and PGF2a. Which cause minor uterine contractions
- An increase in the cytosol-free calcium which causes a joining together of actin and myosin

\section*{What initiate labour?}
- Mechanical Factors This may be due to over stretching of uterus and cervix, as in the case of multiple pregnancy and polyhydromnios, or pressure from the presenting part, when it is well applied to the cervix.
- The release of oxytocin is initiated when the presenting part presses on the pelvic floor. There is a sixfold increase in receptors at 13 to 17 weeks' gestation and an 80-fold increase at term
- It appears that there is a combination of hormonal and mechanical factors that set labour in motion.

\section*{stages of labour}

Labour is divided into four stages
- First stage of labour
- Second stage of labour
- Third stage of labouy
- Fourth stage of labour

\section*{FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR}

This stage has two phases, the latent and the active phase.
1. Latent phase of first stage:
- The cervix dilates from 0 to $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ can take $6-8$ hours in primis, but slower progress may be normal.
- The cervical canal shortens from 3 cm to $<0.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ long
- It is is prolonged if it exceeds 20 hours in a nulliparous mother and 14 hours in a multiparous mother

\section*{stages cont'}
2. Active phase of labour . The cervix undergoes more rapid dilatation. Should be completed within 6-12 hours
- Starts from $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ to full dilatation $(10 \mathrm{~cm})$
- Initiate a partograph when its equal or more than 4 cm dilated
- The rate of cervical dilatation is $1.2 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{hr}$ for nulliparous and 1.5 cm/hr for multiparous
- Mean length is7.7hrs in primis (but up to 17.5 hours) and 5.6 hours in multiparous mothers (up to 13.8 hrs )
- .Towards the end of this phase, contractions are often very distressing, constituting the most painful part of labour. Vomiting and reflex shivering may occur.
- This phase is subdivided into three phases:
- Acceleration Phase. A gradual increase in rate of dilation initiates the active phase.
- The phase of maximum slope is defined as the period of active labor when the rate of cervical dilation is greatest.
- Deceleration Phase. Rate of dilation sometimes slows, with termination at full cervical dilation.

\section*{Stages of labour cont'}
- If the membranes remain intact when the cervix is fully dilated, the onset of the expulsive stage may be delayed because the cervix does not receive the pressure of the head, which helps to stimulate the uterus to increase its activity.
- Transitional phase- starts from 8 cm dilatation to 10 cm dilatation SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR
- Begins when the cervix is fully dilated, the mother feels the urge to expel the fetus, and completed when the baby is born

\section*{THIRD STAGE OF LABOUR-}
- it lasts from birth of the baby until the palcenta and membranes have been expelled, including control of bleeding

\section*{FOURTH STAGE OF LABOUR/ RECOVERY STAGE-}

The period from delivery of the placenta and membranes until the uterus remains firm on its own. 1 hour after delivery of placenta and membranes

\section*{The physiological changes that take place during the first stage are:}
uterine activity resulting in:
- contraction and retraction of the uterine muscle
- effacement of the cervix and dilatation of the os uteri
- fundal dominance
- polarity of the uterus
- an active upper uterine segment and a passive lower uterine segment
- formation of the retraction ring. mechanical factors:
- formation of the forewaters
- general fluid pressure
- rupture of the membranes
- fetal axis pressure.

\section*{Physiology of first stage/stage of cervical dilatation}

\section*{A. Duration -}

On average, it lasts 8-12 hours in a primigravida and 6-8 in a multipara.
Active phase should last between $6-12 \mathrm{hrs}$ with a mean length of 7.7 hrs in primis (but up to 17.5 hours) and 5.6 hours in multiparous mothers (up to 13.8 hrs )

\section*{Length of labour is influenced by:}
- Parity- longer in primis
- Birth interval
- Psychological state
- Presentation and position of the fetus
- Maternal pelvic shape and size
- Character of contractions

\section*{B. Uterine action}
1. Formation of upper and lower segments
- By the end of pregnancy, the uterus is divided into two segments i.e the upper and the lower segments.
- The upper uterine segment is formed from the body of the fundus - thick muscular, contractile area from where the contractions begin. The longitudinal fibres retract, pulling on the lower segment and causing it to stretch, pushing the head down. Its concerned with contraction and retraction

\section*{Cont'}
- The lower uterine segment formed from isthmus and cervix - thinner and $8-10 \mathrm{~cm}$ long. Concerned with distention and/or dilatation. It stretches when being pulled by the longitudinal fibres or force of presenting part
2. The retraction ring (an imaginary ridge), forms between the upper and the lower uterine segment. It is normal as long as it is not marked enough to be visible above the symphysis pubis. When its marked it is called Bandl's ring which indicates obstructed labour. It rises above with contraction and retraction until the cervix is fully dilated

\section*{Uterine action}
3. Fundal Dominance-The contraction starts at the upper part of fundus (the region of the cornua, located where the fallopian tubes join the uterine body), spreading across to the fundus and downwards,
- The contraction last longest and are very intense in the fundus.
- The peak of the contraction is reached simultaneously over the whole uterus and fades from all parts together.
- This pattern allows the cervix to dilate and the contracting fundus to expel the foetus.
4. Polarity - refers to the neuromuscular harmony between the two poles /segments of the uterus throughout labour.
The upper pole contracts strongly and retracts to expel the foetus. The lower pole contracts slightly and dilates to allow expulsion of the foetus to take place.

\section*{Physiology cont'}

\section*{5. Contraction and Retraction}
- Contraction does not pass off entirely but muscle fibres retain some of the shortening instead of becoming completely relaxed (retraction)
- The contracted muscle does not return to its original length when the contraction passes off.
- With progressive shortening of the muscle, the upper segment becomes gradually shorter and thicker and the cavity reduces leading to progressive cervical dilatation and expulsion of the fetus.

\section*{Cont"}

In summary:
As the uterus contracts and retracts more and more,
a. The upper muscular part becomes progressively thicker.
b. The less muscular lower segment is pulled upwards over the presenting part and becomes thinner.
c. The cervix becomes effaced.
d. The effacement is followed or accompanied by progressive dilation of the cervix until full dilatation ( 10 cm ) aided by presenting part
During this stage the woman should not use her voluntary efforts to bear down as this will exhaust her unnecessarily and may cause oedema of the cervix and/or foetal distress
