\section*{BROAD OBJECTIVES}

By the end of the course you should be able to ;
- Describe Normal labour
- Describes normal Puerperium
- Manage the Neonate after birth
- Use case study to manage a mother up to six weeks

\section*{Lasts few weeks to pregnancy?/pre-labour signs/ premonitory signs of labour}
- Mood swings and surge of energy experienced
- lightening (2-3 wks)- lower uterine segment expand and the fetal head sink lower and may engage in primigravidae. Hence the fundus descends creating more space for lungs and breathing becomes easier, heart and stomach function easily
- Symphysis pubis widens, pelvic floor becomes more relaxed and softened and the uterus descends into pelvisthe head engages
- Walking may be difficult because of mobile symphsis pubis
- Relaxed sacroiliac joints give rise to backache
- Lightening increase pressure in the pelvis causing pelvic venous congestion and lower limb congestion

\section*{Cont"}
- Increased vaginal secretions
- Frequency of micturation (limited capacity of the bladder), urgency (Irritation)and some degree of stress incontinence. The laxity of the pelvic floor muscles gives rise to poor sphincter control causing stress incontinence
- Non progressive Braxton Hicks Contractions (false pains) gradually changes into progressive ones--the uterus contracts intermittently but the contractions are not strong enough to overcome the resistance of a normal cervix and do not lead to its dilation
A multipara may have such 'false pains' for some days before the onset of true labour
- The cervix becomes soft and able to dilate (in pregnancy it is firm and closed)
- Mixed feelings of excited anticipation to fearfull expectancy

\section*{NORMAL LABOUR}

Labour -the process whereby the foetus, placenta and membranes are expelled through the birth canal after 28 weeks of gestation.
Characteristics of Normal labour
- Duration - completed within 18 hours
- Occurs at term between 37 and 42 weeks
- Is spontaneous in onset
- The foetus presents by the vertex
- Low risk throughout the process
- The newborn and the mother are in good condition after birth/ no complications (child requires minimal or no resuscitation)

\section*{Onset of labour}

The presence of the following signs and symptoms will give evidence that the mother is in labour:
- Contractions of the uterus, which are increasingly strong, painful and regular. Contractions are painful due to:
a. Hypoxia because of the duration of the contraction.
b. Compression of the nerve endings in the myometrium.
c. Cervical stretch and dilatation.
d. Perineal stretch
- The cervix is taken up into the lower uterine segment causing dilatation of the cervix (effacement)
- Show -mucoid blood stained discharge
- Sometimes there is rupture of membranes with drainage of liquor amnii (amniotic fluid)

\section*{TRUE VS FALSE CONTRACTIONS}

There can be true and false labour. The contractions of true labour are regular and intense. In false labour, the contractions are sporadic (Braxton-Hicks contractions). False contractions occur during the last weeks of
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline pregnancy & TRUE & FALSE \\
\hline contractions & regular & irregular \\
\hline Interval btn contractions & Gradually shortens & Remains long \\
\hline Intensity of contractions & Gradually increases & Stays same \\
\hline Location of pain & Back and abdomen & Mostly lower abdomen \\
\hline Effect of analgesia & Do not relieve pain & Relieves pain \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{What initiate labour?}

\section*{Hormonal Factors}
- Close to term progesterone levels in the body fall, while at the same time levels of oestrogen rises. Effects of oestrogen
a. Overcome inhibiting effects of progesterone
b. Cause uterine muscles fibres to display oxytocic receptors (sensitises the uterine muscles) and form gap junctions with each other
c. Stimulate placenta to release prostaglandins that induce production of enzymes that will digest collagen in the cervix thus softening it.
- The decidua releases prostaglandins (PGs), mainly PGE2 and PGF2a. Which cause minor uterine contractions
- An increase in the cytosol-free calcium which causes a joining together of actin and myosin

\section*{What initiate labour?}
- Mechanical Factors This may be due to over stretching of uterus and cervix, as in the case of multiple pregnancy and polyhydromnios, or pressure from the presenting part, when it is well applied to the cervix.
- The release of oxytocin is initiated when the presenting part presses on the pelvic floor. There is a sixfold increase in receptors at 13 to 17 weeks' gestation and an 80-fold increase at term
- It appears that there is a combination of hormonal and mechanical factors that set labour in motion.

\section*{stages of labour}

Labour is divided into four stages
- First stage of labour
- Second stage of labour
- Third stage of labouy
- Fourth stage of labour

\section*{FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR}

This stage has two phases, the latent and the active phase.
1. Latent phase of first stage:
- The cervix dilates from 0 to $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ can take $6-8$ hours in primis, but slower progress may be normal.
- The cervical canal shortens from 3 cm to $<0.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ long
- It is is prolonged if it exceeds 20 hours in a nulliparous mother and 14 hours in a multiparous mother

\section*{stages cont'}
2. Active phase of labour . The cervix undergoes more rapid dilatation. Should be completed within 6-12 hours
- Starts from $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ to full dilatation $(10 \mathrm{~cm})$
- Initiate a partograph when its equal or more than 4 cm dilated
- The rate of cervical dilatation is $1.2 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{hr}$ for nulliparous and 1.5 cm/hr for multiparous
- Mean length is7.7hrs in primis (but up to 17.5 hours) and 5.6 hours in multiparous mothers (up to 13.8 hrs )
- .Towards the end of this phase, contractions are often very distressing, constituting the most painful part of labour. Vomiting and reflex shivering may occur.
- This phase is subdivided into three phases:
- Acceleration Phase. A gradual increase in rate of dilation initiates the active phase.
- The phase of maximum slope is defined as the period of active labor when the rate of cervical dilation is greatest.
- Deceleration Phase. Rate of dilation sometimes slows, with termination at full cervical dilation.

\section*{Stages of labour cont'}
- If the membranes remain intact when the cervix is fully dilated, the onset of the expulsive stage may be delayed because the cervix does not receive the pressure of the head, which helps to stimulate the uterus to increase its activity.
- Transitional phase- starts from 8 cm dilatation to 10 cm dilatation SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR
- Begins when the cervix is fully dilated, the mother feels the urge to expel the fetus, and completed when the baby is born

\section*{THIRD STAGE OF LABOUR-}
- it lasts from birth of the baby until the palcenta and membranes have been expelled, including control of bleeding

\section*{FOURTH STAGE OF LABOUR/ RECOVERY STAGE-}

The period from delivery of the placenta and membranes until the uterus remains firm on its own. 1 hour after delivery of placenta and membranes

\section*{The physiological changes that take place during the first stage are:}
uterine activity resulting in:
- contraction and retraction of the uterine muscle
- effacement of the cervix and dilatation of the os uteri
- fundal dominance
- polarity of the uterus
- an active upper uterine segment and a passive lower uterine segment
- formation of the retraction ring. mechanical factors:
- formation of the forewaters
- general fluid pressure
- rupture of the membranes
- fetal axis pressure.

\section*{Physiology of first stage/stage of cervical dilatation}

\section*{A. Duration -}

On average, it lasts 8-12 hours in a primigravida and 6-8 in a multipara.
Active phase should last between $6-12 \mathrm{hrs}$ with a mean length of 7.7 hrs in primis (but up to 17.5 hours) and 5.6 hours in multiparous mothers (up to 13.8 hrs )

\section*{Length of labour is influenced by:}
- Parity- longer in primis
- Birth interval
- Psychological state
- Presentation and position of the fetus
- Maternal pelvic shape and size
- Character of contractions

\section*{B. Uterine action}
1. Formation of upper and lower segments
- By the end of pregnancy, the uterus is divided into two segments i.e the upper and the lower segments.
- The upper uterine segment is formed from the body of the fundus - thick muscular, contractile area from where the contractions begin. The longitudinal fibres retract, pulling on the lower segment and causing it to stretch, pushing the head down. Its concerned with contraction and retraction

\section*{Cont'}
- The lower uterine segment formed from isthmus and cervix - thinner and $8-10 \mathrm{~cm}$ long. Concerned with distention and/or dilatation. It stretches when being pulled by the longitudinal fibres or force of presenting part
2. The retraction ring (an imaginary ridge), forms between the upper and the lower uterine segment. It is normal as long as it is not marked enough to be visible above the symphysis pubis. When its marked it is called Bandl's ring which indicates obstructed labour. It rises above with contraction and retraction until the cervix is fully dilated

\section*{Uterine action}
3. Fundal Dominance-The contraction starts at the upper part of fundus (the region of the cornua, located where the fallopian tubes join the uterine body), spreading across to the fundus and downwards,
- The contraction last longest and are very intense in the fundus.
- The peak of the contraction is reached simultaneously over the whole uterus and fades from all parts together.
- This pattern allows the cervix to dilate and the contracting fundus to expel the foetus.
4. Polarity - refers to the neuromuscular harmony between the two poles /segments of the uterus throughout labour.
The upper pole contracts strongly and retracts to expel the foetus. The lower pole contracts slightly and dilates to allow expulsion of the foetus to take place.

\section*{Physiology cont'}

\section*{5. Contraction and Retraction}
- Contraction does not pass off entirely but muscle fibres retain some of the shortening instead of becoming completely relaxed (retraction)
- The contracted muscle does not return to its original length when the contraction passes off.
- With progressive shortening of the muscle, the upper segment becomes gradually shorter and thicker and the cavity reduces leading to progressive cervical dilatation and expulsion of the fetus.

\section*{Cont"}

In summary:
As the uterus contracts and retracts more and more,
a. The upper muscular part becomes progressively thicker.
b. The less muscular lower segment is pulled upwards over the presenting part and becomes thinner.
c. The cervix becomes effaced.
d. The effacement is followed or accompanied by progressive dilation of the cervix until full dilatation ( 10 cm ) aided by presenting part
During this stage the woman should not use her voluntary efforts to bear down as this will exhaust her unnecessarily and may cause oedema of the cervix and/or foetal distress

\section*{Physiology cont'}
- Before labour is established, contractions are fairly weak, occuring every $15-20 \mathrm{~min}$ and may last for 30 sec .
- With time, they occur with rhythmic regularity and intervals between them gradually lessens as the length and strength gradually increase. By the end of first stage, they occur at 2-3 min intervals and are very strong
- Contractions are recorded in terms of strength, duration and frequency
- strength - recorded as weak, moderate and strong depending on how long they last. i.e weak take less than 20 seconds, moderate last between 20-40 seconds and strong lasts between 40-60 seconds
- Frequency is recorded as how many contractions occur in 10 minutes

\section*{Cont'}
- As the contraction occurs, the circulation through the uterine wall is reduced and the foetal heart rate is slowed
If the uterus contracts continuously the foetus dies from lack of oxygen (anoxia) and the mother also gets very exhausted because the uterus uses up a lot of energy

\section*{After contraction/Relaxation phase}
- The muscle recovers but shorter and gets ready for the next contraction
- The mother is also able to relax
- The foetal heart rate regains its normal rate

If there is increasing foetal tachycardia between contractions or if the bradycardia is prolonged after each contraction, then foetal distress sets in

\section*{Physiology continued}
6. Effacement. It is the inclusion of the cervical canal into lower uterine segment
- Before labour, the cervix of a primagravida is a thick hard cone which protrudes into the vagina, at least one inch long.
- When labour begins the strongly contracting upper segment of the uterus starts retracting and getting shorter, while the thinner lower segment of the uterus gets pulled away from the presenting part stretching the lower segment.
Two mechanism are proposed
conventional belief- it takes place from above down wards i.e the retracted lower segment pulls the muscle fibres around internal Os and the cervix merges into lower segment, external Os remain unchanged
outward unrolling mechanism- external Os is taken up first. The cervix thin from external Os upwards, internal Os thins last

\section*{Cont'}
- In a primigravida the cervix usually becomes almost fully effaced before any dilation takes place, while in multiparous women the two processes take place together. (might be already effaced and be dilated enough to admit a finger up to the internal Os even before labour is established.) The canal is called 'MULTIPS Os'
7. Dilatation of the cervix- is the enlargement of uterine os to permit passage of fetal head It occurs due to uterine action and counter pressure applied by bag of intact membranes and /or presenting part on the cervix. Well applied part enhances contraction and retraction

\section*{Cont'}
8. Show - cervical dilatation leads to the loss of cervical plug/ operculum through vaginal canal within a few hours after labour starts.
- It is blood stained mucoid discharge. Blood comes from ruptured capillaries in the parietal decidua where chorion detached from dilating cervix. It should not be frank fresh red blood

\section*{Mechanical factors}

\section*{1. Formation of Forewaters}
- The contractions of the uterus dilate the internal Os of the cervix which then separate the chorion from the decidua of the lower uterine segment closest to it.
- A small bag of membranes is formed and is forced into the internal Os by the increased intrauterine pressure. At the beginning of each contraction, a little more amniotic fluid is forced into the bag of membranes (bulging membranes)
- The head of the foetus then comes down like a ball valve (well flexed and fitting) and separates the amniotic fluid above it (hind waters) from that in the bag forming fore waters
- Therefore pressure applied to hindwaters is not applied to forewaters hence keeps membranes intact
- However, if hind waters break, it may be difficult to diagnose rupture of membranes

\section*{Mechanical cont"}

\section*{2. general fluid pressure}
- With intact membranes, pressure exerted is equalized throughout the uterus and over the fetal body. Fluid is incompressible.
- This prevents compression of fetal head, placenta and the cord between the uterine wall and fetus during contraction thus preventing fetal hypoxia
- The physiologic time to rupture membranes is at the end of first stage when the cervix is fully dilated and the mother has expulsive forces

\section*{Mechanical cont'}
- In ill fitting presenting part, the forewaters are not cut off effectively hence membranes may rupture early.
Caul- is a situation where membranes do not rupture and are seen as bulging sac covering the head when it is being born
- Routine Artificial Rupture of Membranes (ARM) reduces the length of labour by 60-120 minutes, and should be reserved for women with slow progress of labour only

\section*{cont}
3. Fetal axis pressure
- Occurs when the membranes have ruptured
- Contractions are transmitted to the upper pole of the foetus, normally the breech, down the long fetal axis and applied by the presenting part to the cervix.
- This facilitate descend and dilatation

\section*{Management of the mother in the first stage}
1. Admission room

Communicate calmly to the mother, reassuring the mother-explain procedures, seek permission and discuss findings
- Assess and decide whether she is in labour or not.
- If you are sure she is NOT in labour send her home to wait.
- If she is in labour, keep her in the ward and continue monitoring her progress
Assessment involves history taking, physical examination and vaginal examination, carryout tests/investigations

\section*{Admission}

Check the woman's antenatal card for any identified risk factors and abnormalities in pregnancy. This involves medical and obstetric risks
If she has not been attending an antenatal clinic, this is the time to take detailed history as covered in the introductory Block

\section*{Find history of present labour-}
- When the labour started /Onset of contractions and their characteristics
- Whether membranes have ruptured /Leakage of fluid
- Last oral intake. In early labour advice to eat light food and drink
- Character of fetal movement
- Presence or absence of vaginal bleeding
- Any presence of show
- Presence or absence of contractions
- Any treatment given

\section*{Admission}

\section*{Review past history}
- Make sure the names are correctly spelled because this can eventually result in problems when registering the baby.
- Review the last day of menstruation to calculate the expected date of delivery.
- Check her age, parity and contraceptive history
- Birth plan
- Gestational age and outcomes of previous babies
- Special clinics attended
- Blood results including rhesus isoimmunization, haemoglobin, HIV status (ANC profile)
- Any known problems

\section*{Admission}

Do physical examination
NB- explain the significance of each examination and consent before proceeding, and ensure privacy, wash hands
a) Assess the general condition (tiredness/exhausted, dehydration and oedema of the face, hands and feet, anaemia, great pain)and progress of labour in the mother, as well as vital signs (TPR BP).
Test urine for protein, glucose and ketones and measure the height : report any abnormalities.
NB-
- presence of ketone- starvations, maternal distress
- glucose- due to IV glucose administration, large quantity of carbohydrates eaten
- Protein- UTI, pre-eclampsia
a) Carry out head to toe examination- emphasize on abdominal and vaginal examination

\section*{Admission}

Conduct an abdominal examination checking for:
Inspection-
- Over-distension of the abdomen, scars or other abnormality
- Over-distension of bladder

Palpation-
- Height of fundus
- Possible presence of twins or multiple pregnancy
- Contractions - frequency, length, type and strength
- Lie of foetus - this is the relation of the long axis of the foetus to the long axis of the uterus (it can be longitudinal, oblique or transverse)
- presentation-Is it a head (cephalic) or the buttocks (breech
- position of the foetal occiput relative to the mother

Auscultation-
- Rate and rhythm of the foetal heart

\section*{Admission}

Vaginal examination
it should not be a routine procedure because it is uncomfortable to the mother and you may introduce infections into uterine cavity especially when the membranes are ruptured
To avoid infections, scrub and put on sterile gloves Then thoroughly swab the perineum of the woman with an antiseptic solution such as Hibitane
While performing a vaginal examination, you should observe the mother's nonverbal communication

\section*{Vaginal examination}

A vaginal examination is necessary to:
- Check if the patient is in labour and what stage of labour,cevical position, presentation, - done on admission
- Assess the progress of labour- done every four hours during the first stage to assess the degree of effacement, consistency, and dilatation of the cervix, and the station of the head relative to the ischial spines, status of membranes
- Rule out prolapsed cord when the membranes rupture
- Confirm full dilatation of cervix/second stage
- Confirm axis of the fetus and presentation of second twin

Do not do a vaginal examination if the mother has an ante-partum haemorrhage, because if there is placenta praevia, severe haemorrhage will occur

\section*{Management cont''}

\section*{KEEP YOUR RECORDS IN A PARTOGRAPH}
- Admit the patient to the waiting room, reassure her and introduce her to other patients,
- Communication- ensure appealing environment, and right attitude to the mother. Explain what is being done at every stage. Ensure privacy and confidentiality
- Emotional support- express caring, advocacy and nonjudgemental attitude towards the mother. Allow birth companion to be with the mother and assist her with massage, encouragement, movement and wiping her brow with a wet towel. Assist the to anticipate labour positively
- Encourage her to empty the bowel in early stage of labour, may give an microenema/suppository (this will reduce the risk of faecal soiling and infection at delivery). However most women have loose stools in early labour

\section*{Mng cont''}
- Cleanliness/Prevent infection- clean the labour ward, encourage personal hygiene(warm birth, hosp gown), wash hands before any procedure, put on gloves, keep membranes intact unless there is positive indication
- Mobility and bladder care- Encourage her to walk about and empty her bladder frequently/ two hourly. If the bladder is full and she cannot empty it on her own, catheterize her using aseptic technique. Sound and feel of water help trigger micturition reflex. Full bladder slows descent and reduces capacity of the uterus to contract (risk of PPH).

\section*{Mnx cont'}
- Feeding in labour

Give her plenty of fluids as she has to work hard and needs the energy
Give easily digestible food especially in latent phase including low fat foods and carbohydrates such as toast, cereal, fruit juice, tea plain biscuits,. High residue solid and/or fatty take a long time to be emptied from stomach in labour .Should she need an operation and anaesthesia, the emptying of the stomach will be difficult and she might vomit and aspirate the vomitus. Aspiration of Undigested food may block airway.

\section*{Management of first stage}

Long fasting woman has strong gastric acid in the stomach which when aspirated can cause chemical pneumonitis (Mendelson's syndrome)
Long hours of starvation also results in gluconeogenesis i.e conversion of protein and fat into glucose to provide energy for contraction. This may results into ketoacidosis
High concentration of intravenous glucose increase fetal blood glucose thereby causing fetal hyperinsulism and later neonatal hypoglycemia

\section*{First stage cont'}

Vital signs
- Foetal heart rate half hourly or more often if you suspect distress. Count for complete one minute between contractions
- Uterine contractions- half hourly (strength, type, frequency and duration) - a few seconds at the beginning and at the end they are painless but felt by the midwife. DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE MOTHER FEELS PAIN FOR YOU TO FEEL FOR CONTRACTIONS. Contracting uterus feels harder and it is soft in between contractions
- Maternal pulse (half hourly) if >100bpm, suspect anxiety, pain, infection, ketosis or haemorrhage
- BP (4hrly) and temperature (2hrly). High temperature may indicate infection or ketosis, or associated with epidural analgesia

\section*{Mng cont'}
- Respiratory rate 4hrly
- Check the urine output and check for albumin/protein and acetone if indicated every two hours
- VE-Every four hours check the level of the presenting part and the degree of dilatation of the cervix
- Constantly check the woman's reaction to labour and be aware/sensitive of her needs. If anxious, fearful or in pain, give her praise, reassurance and encouragement and, inform her about the progress of labour. Do not give pethidine if delivery is imminent as it depresses the baby's respiration

\section*{Management of first stage}
- Towards the end ofthe first stage, she can rest on her side, or in any position she finds comfortable, for example, squatting
- Discourage pushing or bearing down before the cervix is fully dilated. Early pushing only exhausts the woman and will cause oedema of the cervix and interfere with normal dilatation. BUT spontaneous pushing when cervix is fully dilated
- Teach the mother on breathing techniques during labour and delivery- breath out slowly as she relaxes with each expiration

\section*{Management of first stage}
- When the membranes rupture, usually at the end of the first stage, check the colour of the liquor for meconium staining, the foetal heart rate and do a vaginal examination to exclude prolapse of the cord
- Meconium is passed when the fetus is hypoxic i.e hypoxia relaxes anal sphincter. The colour of liquor becomes green. Muddy yellow or slightly green may indicate fetus is recovering from hypoxia

\section*{Mng cont'}
- Golden yellow liquor may indicate rhesus isoimmunization- excess bilirubin
- Sudden onset of Bleeding after membrane rupture indicates ruptured vasa praevia (acute emergency)
- Abdominal pressure in breech presentation can make the fetus to pass frank thick meconium
- Pre-labour rupture of membranes- with no signs of labour and no liquor drainage avoid digital examination(risk of infection). May consider inducing labour(active management of the mother)
Pain management

\section*{Foetal compromise}

\section*{Signs of compromise}
- Fetal bradycardia
- Fetal tachycardia

Passage of meconium stained amniotic fluid
Action to take
- Call obstetrician
- Stop oxytocin, place the mother in left lateral position
- Give oxygen to the mother via face mask if indicated eg anaemic, preeclampsia
- Expedite deliveryfirst stage- C/S
*Second stage- forceps/ ventouse extraction.
* Prepare for neonatal resuscitation

\section*{Management of first stage}

\section*{To prepare for clean delivery you should:}
- Encourage the mother to empty bowel in early first. If loaded on VE(not routine) may consider enema or suppositories
- Avoid shaving the pubic hair, given current HIV/AIDS prevalence rates
- Allow the mother to have bath whenever she wishes especially if she didn't shower at home as it is soothing during labour
- Practice aseptic techniques through labour
- Ensure a clean environment within and around the ward

\section*{To ensure comfortability of the mother}
- Allow her to change position and move around,
- Use back massage,
- Have a chosen companion with her during labour,
- Allow her to take fluids as required and return the placenta to parents if so desired and directed by the culture.
- Do not forget to check on the foetus especially if you suspect foetal distress

\section*{Pain Management in labour}
- Pain is felt when nociceptors are stimulated. Substance P and glutamate facilitate information about pain
- However endorphins and enkephalins modulates and reduces transmission of pain by inhibiting release of substance $P$
- Labour pain is that of referred pain i.e pain from the uterus is felt as if it is coming from skin area supplied by the same section of spinal cord i.e labia and the back
- Pain from stretching muscles, viscera and ligaments is transmitted by afferent or visceral sensory neurons which run adjacent to pain fibres from the skin in the spinothalamic tract. Pain is interpreted in the cerebral cortex

\section*{Pain cont'}

Physiological responses to pain in labour
- Increase respiration rate, reduced PaCO2 level with increased PH
- Increased cardiac out put in first and second stages by 20\% and 50\% respectively. Each contraction returns $250-300 \mathrm{mls}$ into maternal circulation
- Release of catecholamine especially adrenaline which reduces uterine blood flow

\section*{Pain cont'}

Pain perception in labour is influenced by:
- Culture
- Anxiety
- Fear
- Fatigue
- Full bladder
- Individual pain tolerance
- Previous experience with pain
- Level of support during labour
- Malpositions, CPD

\section*{Pain mng}

\section*{Non pharmacological methods}

Gate control theory- its based on the concept that the sensory nerve pathways that pain sensation use to travel to the brain will only allow a limited number of sensations to travel any given time. By sending alternate signals through these pathways, the pain signals can be blocked from ascending the neurological pathway and inhibits the brain's perception and sensation of pain. This is the basis of non-pharmacological methods.
- Hydrotherapy/whirlpool/shower- warm water- heat relieves muscle spasms reducing strain in the pelvis
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)stimulates production of natural endorphins and enkephalins, impedes incoming pain stimuli
- Breathing techniques- deep rhythmic breathing
- Imagery and visualization- visualize cervical dilatation, baby moving down, pleasant scene

\section*{Pain cont'}
- Distraction - Music therapy, television
- Back rubs and massage
- Light gentle circular stroking of the client's abdomen with the fingertips in rhythm with breathing during contraction
- Sacral counter pressure using fist or heel of hand at sacral area especially persistent OPP
- Frequent maternal positional changes e.g semi sitting, squatting, kneeling and rocking back and forth, walking. Upright positions are less painful and has minimum tears
- Of great importance is emotional support and encouragement as well as praise for the woman for how well she is coping with the considerable pain of labour

\section*{Pain cont'}

\section*{Pharmacological methods}

Opiates drugs- pethidine, diamoprphine, meptazinol
S/E- nausea, vomiting, drowsiness(mother and baby sleepy hence difficulty to breast feed), depression of baby's respiratory centre at birth, muscle relaxation (inhibit action of calcium ions and release of oxytocin from posterior pituitary gland- slow down the birthing process)
1. Inhalational analgesia- equal mixing of nitrous oxide N 2 O and oxygen via entonox apparatus- Nitrous Oxide inhibits neuronal and synaptic transmission of pain in CNS
2. Epidural analgesia-e.g bupivacaine and fentanyl
- Explain procedure and obtain consent, put up IV fluids to prevent hypotension
- Place the mother in left lateral position and introduce anaesthesia at lumber region-(L1-L2 OR L2-L3 ORL3-L4) and monitor maternal BP and FHR throughout procedure

\section*{Pain mnx cont'}

\section*{After epidural anesthesia}
- Monitor vital signs BP/pulse/ FHR closely every 5 minutes for the first half an hour then halfhourly
- Change position regularly to prevent injury
- Encourage the mother to empty bladder she may not feel it full
- The mother may not feel contractions or desire to bear down so monitor closely, if possible electronically

\section*{Complications}
- Dural puncture headache and backache- hinder her ability to (and interest in) care for her baby
- Respiratory arrest
- Cardiac arrest
- Loss of bladder sensation- catheterize
- Fetal compromise
- Reduced mobility and sensitivity to bear down-Increased need for assisted delivery(vacuum and forceps delivery)

- Receptacle for used swabs

\section*{Procedure of VE}
- Wash hands, clean trolley and place VE pack on top shelf.
- Ask the mother to empty bladder and test for proteins and sugar
- Place mother in semi-lithotomy position(lowered head of the bed) it should be maintained during the examination to the mother
- Scrub your hands for at least five minutes, dry them and put on sterile gloves.
- Ask the assistant to open the top flap of the sterile pack and Set it with cheatle
- Instruct the assistant to pour solution and lubricant in the bowl and gallipot respectively not contaminating it
- Inspect the perineum and the external parts- for discharge, bleeding, scars, lesions, inflammation, cracks and smell, warts, colour and odour of amniotic fluid(offensive- infection, greencompromise/postmaturity)

\section*{Procedure of Vaginal examination}
- Pick one swab at a time with the dominant hand, deep in antiseptic solution, squeeze and carefully drop it into the other hand until all the five swabs are dropped
- Using DOMINANT hand Swab the labia majora using downward stroke starting with the further then the nearer majora
- Swab the labia minora using the same technique
- Using NON DOMINANT hand swab the vestibule
- Drape the abdomen and buttocks using sterile towels

\section*{Procedure of vaginal examination}
- Lubricate the index and middle finger of the dominant hand
- Ask the mother to breathe in and out slowly while you perform digital examination.
- Insert the fingers obliquely inside the vagina with the thumb tucked in or above the symphysis pubis. Your left hand should be on the mother's abdomen.
- The fingers to be introduced are held on a higher level than the vaginal orifice during insertion to avoid contact with the anus. Fingers should not be withdrawn until the required information has been obtained.

\section*{Vaginal examination cont"}
- The fingers are initially directed along the anterior wall of the vagina with palmar surface downwards then rotated upwards.
- The fingers are then directed upwards to the position of the cervical Os.
- At times the Os is not felt readily, the fingers should then be directed backwards and upwards

\section*{Assess the following:}

\section*{Vagina}
- Is it firm or lax?
- Is it moist and cool or dry and hot?
In prolonged labour, when the woman is in maternal distress and is dehydrated, the vagina feels hot and dry.
- Is it bruised?

The cervix
- Positionanterior,post, central
- Dilatation-How much is the Os dilated?
- Effacement-Is it taking up, that is effaced? \%- measure the length of the cervix, a long tightly closed cervix means no labour
In primis, cervix may be fully effaced without dilatation- is often confused with full dilatation. You must locate a depression in the centre
- Is it bruised or oedematous?
- Consistency-Is it firm or soft? Applied or not?
The Membranes
- Are they ruptured or intact?
- If intact are they bulging?

\section*{Assess cont.}

\section*{The Cord}
- Is it presenting or prolapsed?
- If prolapsed is it pulsating

\section*{The Presenting Part}
- Is it fitting the pelvis and cervix well?
- If it is the head, can you feel a suture or fontanel? It will help to determine the position of the presenting part
- Is it well flexed?
- Presentation- cephalic, breech, shoulder, compound
- Station

\section*{Assessment cont"}

Position- relationship of presenting part to the pelvic brim. Occiput is used in vertex presentation

Feel the hard head sutures and fontanel. Determine whether it is the anterior or posterior fontanel by its shape(ant-diamond, post- triangular). If it is the posterior fontanel, then the position is occipito-anterior. If it is the anterior fontanel then the position is occipital-posterior.
Position is recorded as anterior or posterior or transverse. It can be right or left

\section*{Assessment cont"}

Station -The level of the presenting part is expressed in relation to the easily palpable ischial spines/ descended into pelvis
- state if it is above the brim, at the brim, in the cavity or at the outlet.
if it is at the brim (floating) then it is at station -5 .
If it is at the ischial spines, it is said to be at 'zero station
By the time it is seen at the perineum(crowning) it is at station $+5 / 5$.

\section*{Assessment cont}

Check for moulding and caput succedaneum
- Moulding is when the diameters of the foetal skull are reduced in size due to overlapping of the skull bones along the sutures
- Run the finger on the head feeling for the sutures
- Judge the degree of moulding by feeling the amount of overlapping of skull bones

\section*{Assessment cont}

Assess the pelvis for adequacy
- Is it roomy?
- Are the sidewalls well spaced?
- Can you touch the promontory of the sacrum easily?
- Is the pubic arch wide enough?

After checking for moulding, direct the fingers behind the head and make an effort to reach the sacropromontory. The palm of the hand should be facing upwards. Promontory of the sacrum should not be reached.
With the palm facing downwards run the two fingers down along the hollow of the sacrum and determine the shape. The hollow of the sacrum should be curved.

\section*{Assessment cont"}

The two fingers are then moved to where the ischial spines are located on either side of the pelvis. Run the finger along this area to determine whether or not the ischial spines are unduly prominent. Or else you can stretc h your fingers to see if the spines are prominent. The ischial spines should not be prominent.
As you move the fingers with the palm facing upward, on reaching the pubic arch check if it can accommodate two fingers. The apex usually should accommodate two fingers.
Make a fist facing downwards then place the fist between the ischial tuberosities. The Intertuberosity should accommodate four knuckles. Check if it does

\section*{Assessment cont"}

The Discharge
Withdraw the fingers and check if there is:
- Any vaginal discharge
- Any smell
- Any liquor or meconium staining
- Any bleeding

Clear off the area and give the pad

\section*{Vaginal assessment cont''}

Carryout the investigation:
- Take a urine sample for albumin and sugar
- Check for acetone, especially if the patient is in prolonged labour
- Take blood for haemoglobin and cross matching if the patient is anaemic or might need an operation

Any additional drugs and IV fluids given as appropriately (as per that time)
- Hours -record the time elapsed since the onset of active phase of labour
- Time - record time of admission as zero time, the actual hour of the day is recorded below the hour time
- Encourage the mother to pass urine every two hours and test for protein and acetone, note the volume

\section*{Transitional phase: physiology}

Cervix dilates From 8 cm to 10 cm ,
- Maternal restlessness/ Feeling anxious
- Desire for pain relief
- A sense that the process is never ending and demand to the midwife to end the process immediately/hardest time/makes straining noises
- Contractions become stronger and longer, more frequent
- Membranes may rupture spontaneously, fetal axis pressure increases flexion reducing presenting diameters hence rapid progress/Fetus descends rapidly into the birth canal
- Frequent feeling of hot and cold, involuntary shaking
- Feeling nauseated and/or vomiting
- Confused because of the feeling that you want to empty bowels/rectal pressure

\section*{Second Stage (expulsive phase)}
- This starts with the full dilatation of the cervix, the expulsion of the presenting part and ends with the complete delivery of the baby.
- Resistance offered by the lower uterine segment, the cervix and the pelvic floor has been overcome by uterine contractions, aided by the action of the voluntary muscles of the abdominal wall and the diaphragm. The presenting part can be pushed down onto the pelvic floor.
- Full dilatation of the cervix is accompanied by a bearing down sensation during contractions and women are usually encouraged to push.
As the contraction comes on, the woman takes a deep breath, then holds it and subsequently bears down with all the force of her abdominal muscles.

\section*{Physiology of second stage}

\section*{Duration-}
- primis, it should completed within 1 hr , refer if not completed within 2 hrs
- Multiparas- completed within 30 minutes, however refer if not completed within 1 hr

\section*{Divided into two phases}
- Passive/latent second stage- full dilatation of the cervix prior to or in absence of involuntary expulsive contractions. Fetus descent in the pelvis, internal rotation and flexion occurs
- Active /pelvic floor phase- when the baby is visible, with expulsive contraction and full cervical dilatation. Allow the woman to push as and when she wishes as long as maternal and fetal condition are good

\section*{Uterine action-}
- Contractions becomes longer and stronger but may be less frequent (allows recovery)
- Due to rupture of membranes, fetal axis pressure comes into play and increases flexion of the head

\section*{Physiology cont'}
- Contractions becomes expulsive as the fetus descends further into the vagina
- Pressure from presenting part stimulates nerves in the pelvic floor resulting in the need to push (Ferguson' reflex).
- As Contractions become overwhelming the mother employs secondary powers by contracting abdominal muscles and diaphragm. This is due vagal stimulation
Soft tissue displacement-
- Anteriorly- bladder is pushed up in the abdomen resulting in stretching and thinning of urethra
- Posteriorly-Rectum becomes flattened curve and pressure from presenting part expels residual fecal matter
- Levator ani muscles dilate thin out and displaced laterally
- Perineal body flatten, stretch and becomes thin

\section*{Physiology cont'}

\section*{The head advance with each contraction until crowning occurs}
- For some time it keeps popping out during a contraction and receding back during the relaxation phase. After some time it can no longer slip back.
- The state at which the baby's head remains visible without slipping back is called crowning
- During crowning, the perineum becomes stretched and paper-thin. The mother feels burning/stinging sensation shortly followed by numbness (nerves blocked by thin perineum.) At this stage an episiotomy should be performed if necessary. The next contraction normally expels the presenting part.

\section*{Pelvic floor}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_03_bb4fdf2b0ee834185993g-04.jpg?height=1372&width=2199&top_left_y=366&top_left_x=125)

\section*{The uterus in the second stage}
1. A diminution in the transverse diameters because of:
- Pulling up of the lower segment.
- Flexion of the fetus.
2. The fetal head is forced into the upper vagina which now forms a continuous tube with the uterus and a fully effaced cervix.
3. As well as uterine contractions, expulsive efforts are made by the mother using:
- The abdominal wall muscles.
- The fixed diaphragm, thus raising intra-abdominal pressure.

\section*{Recognition of commencement of second stage}

\section*{Presumptive evidence}
- Expulsive uterine contractions
- Rupture of fore waters
- Dilatation and gaping of anus
- Anal cleft line- purple line in the cleft of buttocks
- Appearance of rhomboid michaelis- dome shaped curve at the lower back due to posterior displacement of sacrum and coccyx by occiput. The mother archs her back, push her buttocks forward and throw her arms back to grasp any object she can find.

\section*{Signs}
- If on epidural analgesia, she may feel discomfort under ribs
- Appearance of presenting part ensure you rule out caput which may appear before full dilatation
- Bulging perineum

Confirmatory evidence
Vaginal examination to ascertain full dilatation
NB- allow the mother to choose her most comfortable position
Positions include-supine, supported sitting, left lateral, upright(squatting, kneeling, all fours, birth ball)

\section*{Mechanisms of labour/natural movements made by the baby}

\section*{Factors which influence the mechanism of labour outcome (the three 'Ps') power, passage, and passenger}

Power-The stronger the contraction in a well prepared mother, the better the outcome of labour

\section*{Passage-}

The size, shape and resistance of the birth canal including the bony pelvis, cervix, vagina and pelvic floor may speed up or slow down the process of delivery. A gynaecoid pelvis and a fully dilated cervix speed up the process.
Passenger This refers to the size, lie and presentation of the foetus, as well as the placenta and membranes.
vertex presentation makes labour shorter- the presenting part fits well on the cervical Os and stimulates the cervix to dilate faster.

\section*{Mechanisms of labour}

Definition -These are movements the baby makes through the birth canal as it descent during labour

\section*{Importance -}
- They help the midwife anticipate the next step in the process of labour
- Help the fetus to turn and occupy the widest space of the pelvis

\section*{Principles common to all mechanisms}
- Descent takes place
- The part that meet the resistance from the pelvic floor first rotates forwards until it comes under symphysis pubis
- Whatever emerges from the pelvis will pivot around the pubic bone

\section*{Mechanisms of normal labour}

\section*{Normal labour-}
- presentation is cephalic (95\%)
- presenting part is posterior part of anterior parietal bone,
- presenting diameter is the smallest - 9.5 cm i.e suboccipital bregmatic and biparietal diameters
- Diameter that distends vaginal orifice is suboccipital frontal $(11.5 \mathrm{~cm})$
- The head is well on the neck with the chin touching the chest. (Attitude is of complete flexion)
- Denominator -occiput
- Position is the right/left occipitoanterior
- Lie longitudinal

\section*{Do Frogs In Cuba/England Ride In Red Limo?}

As the leading part meets resistance of the pelvic floor it rotates 1/8th forwards until it comes under the symphysis pubis.
The mechanism of labour in a cephalic vertex presentation includes the following steps:
- Engagement and descent
- Flexion
- Internal rotation of the head
- Extension of the head
- Restitution
- Internal rotation of the shoulders
- External rotation of the head
- Lateral flexion

\section*{1. Descent}

\section*{Mechanisms cont}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_03_bb4fdf2b0ee834185993g-12.jpg?height=384&width=687&top_left_y=44&top_left_x=1812)
- Begins before onset of labour but contractions speeds up the process
- In the primigravida - occurs in late pregnancy because of firm abdominal muscles
- in multipara- descent and engagement may not occur till labour starts due to lax abdominal
The head enters the pelvic brim in oblique diameter with sub occipital frontal diameter ( 10 cm ).

\section*{2. Flexion}
- With good uterine contraction, fetal axis pressure is directed more to the occiput than sinciput which increases flexion. The head engages with sub occipital bregmatic diameter ( 9.5 cms )
- Occiput becomes the leading part

\section*{Mechanisms cont'}

\section*{3. Internal Rotation of the head}
- Due to the action of uterine muscle, the occiput is pushed downwards to meet the pelvic floor first(resistance) rotating forwards 1/8th of a circle slightly twisting the neck.
- Anteroposterior diameter of the head now lies in the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet.
- The occiput slips below the sub pubic arch and crowning occurs when the head no longer recedes between contractions
NB- epidural analgesia relaxes pelvic floor muscles hence reducing resistance- prolonged rotation

\section*{Mechanisms}

\section*{4. Birth By Extension of the Head}

Once the occiput has escaped from under the symphysis pubis, the head extends forward. The nape of the neck is pressed firmly against the pubic arch, sinciput, face and chin to escape the perineum and the head is born by extension.
- Extension is the result of action from two forces.
a. The abdominal and thoracic muscles exert downward pressure.
b. The pelvic floor and perineum resist this pressure and push the head forward and upward through the weak area, which is the vagina.

\section*{5. Restitution}

The head turns $1 / 8$ of the circle to the left (undo the twist of the neck that resulted from internal rotation), back to where it was before.

\section*{Extension of the head}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_03_bb4fdf2b0ee834185993g-15.jpg?height=1171&width=1266&top_left_y=435&top_left_x=617)

Fig. 221.-Movement of Extension and Disengagement.

\section*{Mechanisms cont'}

\section*{6. Internal Rotation of the shoulder}
- As the head pass through the level of the ischial spines and the outlet in anterior posterior position, the shoulders enter in the oblique diameter of the pelvis and the first shoulder to reach levator ani muscle rotate forward 1/8 of a circle. They are now in the anterior posterior diameter of the outlet.
- The anterior shoulder escapes the symphysis pubis while the posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum.
7. External Rotation of the Head As the internal rotation of the shoulders takes place, the head, which has already been born, rotates $1 / 8$ of a circle as in restitution. The head/occiput now lies in the lateral position

\section*{Mechanisms cont'}
8. Lateral Flexion Following these movements the body bends sideways to follow the curve of the birth canal. The anterior shoulder escapes under the symphysis pubis and the posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum. The body of the baby is born by lateral flexion.

\section*{Mechanism video}
- Rotate forward
- pivoting

\section*{Management of the Second Stage of Normal Labour}
- Continuously provide information, support and encouragement to the woman and her companion her to gain control and confidence. Give the mother praise of what she is doing
$\succ$ Ensure privacy and dignity of the mother, prevent the public from delivery room
$>$ Incase of leg cramp, massage the calf muscle, extend the limb and dorsiflex the foot
-monitor maternal observations
- Contractions- regularly
- Do vaginal examination- to assess station, flexion, internal rotation of the head and formation of caput succedaneum
- Observe progressive descent and rotation of the presenting part including observing progressive distention of the perineum and visibility of presenting part

\section*{Management cont'}
$\succ$ Teach the what is expected in the active phase of second stagehow to push(encourage spontaneous/involuntary pushing), if there is prolonged second stage and/or non reassuring fetal status then direct /coach the mother on how to push
- Breathing- it should be rhythmic breathing
- Avoid 'purple pushing' i.e holding breath and pushing for as long as possible (damage to pelvic floor and fetal hypoxia )
- Breathing the baby out- breath in deeply, then on exhale, gently push downward with abdominal muscles while visualising the baby moving down and out. Continue through contraction
- Pushing the baby out- hold breath for 5-7 seconds while pushing, then breathe deeply in and out again until the urge to push becomes strong.
- Postural changes- supine position leads to venacava compression hence postural hypotension, mother to on left lateral position when no contraction in passive second stage

\section*{Management cont}
- Assess maternal response to labour-
-tiredness, ability to push
-Pulse-half hourly, T- 2hrly
-BP- frequently if epidural analgesia is insitu (1hrly)
- Assess fetal condition-
-Assess colour of liquor if membranes rupture- report if there is thick fresh meconium
-Take fetal heart rate (every 5 minutes) after every contraction

\section*{Management cont'}
$\succ$ Ensure maternal comfort-
- sponge the face and the neck with cool flannel
-sips of water if lips are dry
-Empty bladder at the beginning of second stage, if unable and there is full bladder, then catherize to empty bladder
Be ready to augument contractions with an intravenous oxytocin infusion if contractions are inadequate and fetal heart rate is normal
Conduct delivery with support of the perineum to avoid tears

\section*{Preparation for delivery}

Should start when active pushing commences

\section*{Environment}

Warm delivery room with spotlight
Clean area for receiving the baby
Water proof to protect the bed and floor
Warm cot and clothes

\section*{Equipment}

Sterile cord clamps
Clean apron
Prepared oxytocin- in an easily accessible fridge
Neonatal resuscitation equipments- suction machine and tubes, oxygen, radiant heat warmer, resuscitation tray

\section*{Set your trolley as in procedure manual}

Top shelf- delivery pack
- 1 gallipot
- 5 draping towels
- A of episiotomy scissors
- 2 pairs of scissors for cutting the cord
- 2 artery forceps
- 2 perineal pads- one for supporting perineum
- 2 cord clamps
- 2 kidney dishes- one for receiving placenta, another for instruments
- 1 bowl for lotion
- Atleast 10 cotton wool swabs
- Atleast 10 gauze swabs
- Bottom shelf
- Syringes, needles
- Cotton swabs
- Sutures
- Fetoscope
- Lignocaine
- Sterile gloves
- K-Y jelly
- Identification band
- Eye ointment
- Antiseptic lotion
- Prepared syntocinon

\section*{Procedure}
- Recognize second stage and move her to the delivery room
- Explain the procedure to the mother clearly explaining her role in second stage and reassure her
- Together with your assistant, wash hands as for sterile procedure
- Ask your assistant to open the delivery
- Gown and double glove yourself methodically
- Instruct your assistant to put the patient in the dorsal position
- Swab the mother starting from furthest majora, nearest majora, similarly with minora and complete with vestibule
- Lubricate your two fingers and perform vaginal examination to confirm second stage
- Instruct your assistant to check the FHR after every contraction, the mother's pulse after every 10 mins , wipe sweat from mothers face and to administer syntocinon after ruling out the second
- When the mother is in expulsive phase, encourage her to push with contractions relax between contractions. Encourage her all the time and explain the progress being made towards the birth of her baby.
- Drape the mother starting with the nearest thigh, abdomen, furthest thigh and buttocks

\section*{Cont'}
- Prepare the baby towel, with the scissors and two forceps for clamping the cord. Prepare two pieces of cotton wool for wiping the newborn's eyes, some gauze for cleaning the airway and for a covering when cutting the cord.
- At this stage the head might start distending the perineum. The anus starts dilating and the head is seen at the vulva. It keeps receding between contractions.

\section*{crowning}
- Place the left hand on the advancing head with fingers spread equally over the vertex towards the bregma to stop any sudden explosive effort during and after crowning of the head and to maintain flexion. Don't push or hold the head back.
- With the right hand guard the perineum, holding it with the pad. Check if the perineum is stretching.
- Flexion and perineal support is maintained until the biparietal diameter is born
- If the perineum is tight, infiltrate lignocaine and give an episiotomy at the height of a contraction when the perineum is thinned out and the head is $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ visible during contraction.
- Support the perineum till the head is born. After crowning the mother should sigh out or gently blow out breath to reduce active pushing

\section*{Cont'}

\section*{Extension of the head}
- Assist the extension by grasping the parietal eminences with your left hand. Let the head come out slowly and naturally.
- Feel for the cord around the baby's neck. If it is there, slip it from the baby's neck over the head OR slacken it to form a long loop through which the shoulders may pass.

If it is too tight, place two artery forceps on the cord 3 cm apart and cut it between them holding a swab over the cord and unwind it.
- When the nose and mouth come out, ask the mother not to push, wipe away the mucus with a sterile swab. By this point the whole head should be out.
- Allow the head will to restitute and rotate spontaneously to face the mother's left or right thigh. And bring the shoulders in the anterior posterior diameter

\section*{Delivering the Shoulders by Lateral Flexion of the Body}

\section*{Anterior shoulder}
- Place one hand above and one below the foetal head over the ears
- Apply gentle traction downwards toward the anus/neck, making sure it is neither twisted nor bent sideways till the anterior shoulder is free/or slip below symphysis pubis

- Place the baby on maternal abdomen, dry the baby thoroughly, wipe the eyes and assess the babies breathing. If the baby cries or breathes spontaneously within 30 s , leave it with the mother. If it does not shout for help and begin resuscitation
- Ask your assistant to give oxytocin 10 iu IM on lateral thigh within one minute of delivery after you have palpated the abdomen to rule out second twin
- Ask your assistant for the time and note the time of birth
- Clamp and cut the cord at 3 and 5 cm from umbilicus
- Give the APGAR score to the baby at one minute

\section*{Body}
- Show the baby to the mother to identify the sex of the baby
- Ask your assistant to continue with the immediate care of the baby
- Continue with active management of third stage- the delivery of the placenta by using control cord traction, uterine massage
- Check the placenta for completeness and/or malformation.
- Measure blood loss
- Do the first examination of the baby
- Weigh the baby
- Do a post natal examination and record all the findings
- Let the mother shower
- Give the mother a hot drink and transfer her to the postnatal ward

\section*{Immediate Care of the Baby}
- Clear the airways by gently wipe/suction mucus from the mouth and nostrils respectively. Do not touch nares as it may stimulate inhalation reflex and give oxygen if necessary.
- Ligate the cord and make sure the ligature is very tight before you cut the cord to prevent blood loss 2-3 minutes after birth.
- Keep the baby warm-Wipe/dry the baby's head and the body and wrap in dry towel, remove wet linen, switch off fans, close curtains, skin to skin contact
- Stimulate the baby- finger flick to the sole of foot, gentle back rubbing
- APGAR Score- the baby at 1,5 and 10 minutes

\section*{Episiotomy}

\section*{Definition}

This is an incision through perineal tissues designed to enlarge vulval outlet during birth. It involves incision of fourchette, superficial muscles and skin of the perineum and posterior vaginal wall

\section*{Rationale -}
- minimize the risk of severe trauma to the vagina and perineum
- Expedite delivery when there is fetal compromise

\section*{Indication}
- Complicated vaginal delivery-breech, shoulder dystocia, forceps and vacuum extraction
- Scarring from FGM and poorly healed third/fourth degrees tear
- Fetal compromise

\section*{Episiotomy cont'}

Timing- during crowning at the peak of contractions Early episiotomy-
- Bleeding from cut vessels may be severe
- Levator ani muscle may be cut because it will not have been displaced laterally
If given late- you may have no time to infiltrate lignocaine, you may not prevent lacerations
Types of incisions-
1. Mediolateral incision- from midpoint of fourchette and directed at 45 degrees celcius from midline towards a point midway between ischial tuberosity and anus. It avoids damage to anal sphincter and Batholin's glands but difficult to repair

\section*{Episiotomy cont'}
2. Median incision
- It is the midline incision which follows natural insertion of perineal muscles
- It has reduced blood loss,less pain and dyspaerunia, easy to repair
- However, leads to damage of anal sphincter

NB- infiltrate with lignocaine;
If $0.5 \%-10 \mathrm{mls}$
If $1 \%-5 \mathrm{mls}$
It takes three to four minutes before it takes effect

\section*{Method}

\section*{Infiltration-}
- Insert two fingers into vagina along the proposed incision line to protect the head
- Insert the needle just below the skin up to $4-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ following the same line
- Check if in blood vessel by aspirating, inject about a third slowly as you withdraw the needle.
- Re-directing the needle just before the tip is fully withdrawn, inject the remaining on either side of the line

\section*{Incision- Mayo scissor is used}
- Insert the two fingers as before and position the blades- one in another out
- Make a single deliberate cut $4-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ along the infiltrated line during contraction
- Birth of the head which follows immediately should be controlled to avoid extension of the episiotomy. Incase delivery delays, apply pressure at the incised part
- infiltration

\section*{Perineal tears/trauma}
- Should be assessed immediately after delivery before oedema and bleeding is profuse
- Assessment should be carried out to determine the extent of trauma Classification
a) location
- Trauma can be of labia anteriorly or of perineum posteriorly
b) Classification of posterior trauma/ degrees as per anatomical structures destroyed
1. First degree tear- involves fourchette (vaginal mucosa and connective tissue) only
2. Second degree tear- fourechette and superficial perineal muscles (bulbocavernosus, transverse perineal muscles, pubococcygeus)
3. Third degree tear- partial or complete disruption of anal sphincter muscles. May involve either or both internal and external sphincter muscles
4. Fourth degree tear- anal sphincter muscles with breach of rectal mucosa

\section*{Tears cont'}
- Nb - third and fourth degree tears repaired by obstetrician

Ensure the mother is warm and comfortable in a lithotomy position with her legs on stirrups
Ensure a good directional light
Ensure you are in a comfortable position
Scrub your hands and put on sterile gloves

Use absorbable synthetic polyglycolic acid (stronger, less allergy and less probability of infections) size 2-0 or polyglactin 910 sutures
Start the repair at the fourchette for proper alignement of vaginal opening
- Clean perineum and place sterile towel under the buttocks
- Infiltrate the tear/episiotomy (mucosa, muscles and skin) with 10 mls $0.5 \%$ lignocaine and allow time to take effect (into the muscle- IV injection causes convulsions and death)
- Insert vaginal pack high up the vagina
- Identify the apex/top of the tear/episiototmy and repair the posterior vaginal wall from apex downwards. Use a continuous suture, starting 1 cm above the top

\section*{Tears Cont'}
- At the opening of the vagina, bring together the cut edges, bring the needle under vaginal opening and out through the perineal tear and tie
- Do not pull the thread too tightly as oedema will develop within the first $24-48 \mathrm{hrs}$
- Repair deeper perineal muscles using interrupted sutures. Ensure proper estimation of tissues. Proper estimation does not need skin repair
- If perineal skin repair is done, start at the fourchette downwards use continous subcuticular suture or interrupted sutures
- Remove vaginal pack,
- Sutures should not penetrate rectal mucosa to prevent rectal vaginal fistula
Inspect the sutured areas to confirm haemostasis before removing vaginal pack
Do vaginal examination to rule out narrowed introitus Perform digital rectal examination to rule out rectal involvement Clean perineum and give the mother sanitary pad

\section*{Care of the}
pain managempisiotomy/Trauma
- Ice pack/cold water at the site- reduce pain and swelling
- Mild pain killers-ibuprofen, paracetamol
- Eat high fiber food and increased fluids- to prevent constipation
- Incase of $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $4^{\text {th }}$ degrees - consider stool softeners

\section*{Cleanliness-}
- Frequent sitz baths in warm salty water- for about 20 minutes- 3-4 times
- After bowel movement, clean perineum from front back
- Avoid use of tampons or douches

Avoid sexual intercourse for four to six weeks- till the wound heals
Tell the mother to report if she has foul discharge, dysuria, vaginal bleeding, severe pelvic pain, high fever, passing suture/gas/stool through vaginal canal
Complications- haemotoma, rectal vaginal fistula, faecal incontinence, infections, episiotomy extension into $3^{\text {rd }}$ or $4^{\text {th }}$ degree tears

\section*{Third Stage (placental}

Starts immediately after the bittas hebolaby. It includes the delivery of the placenta and membranes as well as the control of bleeding.

\section*{Physiology of third stage}
- Lasts for between 5-15 minutes, but within 1 hr is normal
- Characterized by separation, descent and expulsion of placenta and membranes and control of bleeding from placental site
- The uterus reduces in size 2.5 cm below the umbilicus, or 15 cm above the symphysis pubis after the expulsion of the foetus
1. Separation and descent

Brought about by mechanical and haemostatic factors
A) Mechanical factors

Based on the ability of the uterine muscle to retract. By the end of second stage placental site area has diminished by 75\% due to retraction

\section*{Mechanism of the Third Stage of Labour}

\section*{The Mechanical Factors}
a) Retraction of uterine muscles
- Retraction compresses the uterus and inter-villous blood is forced into spongy layer of decidua basalis
- Retraction of oblique muscles exerts pressure on blood vessels preventing blood from draining back into maternal system
With this vessels become congested and tensed, they burst with subsequent contraction, releasing some blood between thin septa of spongy layer and placental surface stripping it from its attachment. Surface area of placental attachment reduces. Since the placenta is inelastic, it does not contract, so it detaches from the shrinking uterine wall

\section*{Cont'}

\section*{b) Formation of retroplacental clot}

Separation begins centrally so that retro placental clot is formed. This clot enhance separation by exerting pressure at the midpoint of placental attachment stripping the lateral borders and peeling the membranes off the uterine wall.

\section*{The clot becomes enclosed in a membranous bag as the placenta descents fetal surface first (Schultze method)}
- It takes shorter duration,
- Less blood loss and
- Complete expulsion of membranes and placenta

\section*{Cont'}

In some cases, placenta begin to detach unevenly at tone of the lateral borders, blood escapes and separation not helped by the weight of the retroplacental clot. Placenta descents slipping side ways, maternal surface first (Mathews Duncan Method) associated with:
- Ragged,incomplete expulsion of membranes
- A higher blood loss.
- It takes longer

With the next contraction the placenta is pushed into the vagina and expelled

\section*{B)Haemostasis- control of bleeding}
- Normal blood flow through placental site is $500-800 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$

\section*{Factors responsible for haemostasis}
1. Retraction of oblique uterine muscles fibres in upper uterine segment.
- Exerts pressure on torn vessels acting as clamps that ligate the vessels. Criss-cross fibres control bleeding by compressing the blood vessels. These fibres are also known as 'living ligatures'
Ruptured placenta praevia bleeds profusely because of lack oblique fibres in lower segments
2. Vigorous uterine contraction after separation that brings walls into opposition
3. Activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems after placental seperation especially at placental site to intensify clot formation

\section*{Signs of uterine separation}
- The signs of descent of the placenta in the uterus are:
* The uterus becomes hard/ fundus becomes round/globular(like a cricket ball), smaller and more mobile.
* The umbilical cord lengthens and does not recede on pressing at the symphysis pubis.
* There is fresh gush of blood/loss

Methods of placental delivery
- Mathews-Duncan method- placenta is expelled with maternal side exposed
- Schultz Method- placenta is expelled with foetal side exposed

\section*{Management of third stage}

\section*{Use of uterotonics}
they stimulate uterine smooth muscle to contract
They may be administered:
- With crowning of the head-ergometrin
- At the birth of anterior shoulder- syntometrine
- After birth of the baby before placental delivery - IM oxytocin
- After delivery of placenta - oxytocin infusion

They include:
-Syntometrine (ergometrine + oxytocin)
-Syntocinon (oxytocin)
- Ergometrine
- prostaglandins

\section*{Uterotonics}

\section*{IV ergometrine- $\mathbf{0 . 2 5 ~ m g}$}

Acts within 45s, used for treatment PPH that is due to hypotonic uterus. Not recommended for PPH prophylaxis because of likely retained placenta
Associated with increased blood pressure nausea and vomiting

\section*{I.M Syntometrine - 5IU oxytocin and 0.5mg ergometrine}

Oxytocin acts within 2.5 min while ergometrine $6-7 \mathrm{~min}$
There is a strong sustained contractions. Given at birth of anterior shoulder
Associated with increased blood pressure,nausea and vomiting
NB- no more than 2 doses of ergometrine 0.5 mg should be given because of S/E
C/I- HTN, Cardiac disease

\section*{IM/IV Oxytocin /syntocinon}

If IV-slowly but not more than 5IU. Causes fatal hypotension and water intoxication
Drug of choice for prophylaxis, safe to use than ergometrine/ when combined Prostaglandins/ misoprostol -uterine irrigation/intramural(uterine muscle) Are expensive and associated with diarhoe and cardiovascular complications Best used to treat PPH not as prophylaxis

\section*{Active management of third stage}

NB- place the mother in dorsal position
-Ensure strict aseptic technique is used
-Start active management of third stage
-Manage the mother after placenta delivery

Active management Involves:
- Routine administration of uterotonics- IV/IM after birth of the baby
- Cord clamping 2-3 minutes after delivery of the baby
- Delivery of the placenta by controlled cord traction (cord traction with counter pressure- push and pull)
- Uterine massage after placenta delivery and after 15 minutes for two hours
Aim-
- To prevent PPH
- To fasten third stage

\section*{1. Uterotonics}
- Within one minute of delivery, palpate abdomen to rule out second twin, then give oxytocin 10 iu IM lateral thigh or ergometrine $\mathbf{0 . 2 ~ m g ~ I M}$ if oxytocin is absent. Do not give ergometrine to mothers with preeclampsia, eclampsia and hypertension because it increases pressure, and risks of convulsions and cerebral vascular accidents

\section*{2. Controlled Cord Traction}

\section*{Before CCT, ensure that}
- Uterotonic drug has been administered and has been given time to act-
- The uterus is well contracted- more round and firm fundus or cord lengthens. Don't wait for the gush of blood
- Counter traction is applied

\section*{AMTSL CONT'}

NB- avoid manipulation of the fundus as it may lead to partial separation The uterus must be firmly contracted before this method can be used. It is not necessary to wait for signs of placenta separation.
- Confirm the uterus is well contracted
- Clamp the cord close to the perineum using sponge forceps and hold it with one right hand
- Place the left hand above the symphyis pubis palm facing umbilicus, exert pressure to the uterus upwards and backwards. (counter pressure/traction)
- With the right hand pull the cord downwards and backwards. Apply traction steadily without jerking, following birth canal for about 30-40 seconds.
- Stop traction if the cord tears or the uterus relaxes

\section*{AMTSL CONT"}
- When the placenta is visible at the vulva, direct the cord upwards. The placenta will follow the curve of the birth canal.
- Receive it with both hands. Move it gently up and down OR rotate/twist the placenta till the membranes are delivered.
- If membranes tear, examine the upper vagina and cervix for remnants
- Carefully look at the placenta to ensure non is missing
3. Uterine massage
- Massage the uterus and remove retroplacental clots
- Inspect lower vagina and perineum and repair them if need be
- Instruct the mother to massage the uterus after every 15 minutes for the first two hours
placenta.webm

\section*{The Passive or Natural Method of Managing the Third Stage of Labour}
- Occurs naturally, that is without any interference
- Signs of separation and descent must be present before maternal effort is used to hasten delivery
- The mother pushes as if in second stage
- It takes $20-60 \mathrm{mins}$
- Uterotonic agent is NOT administered
- Early attachment to the breast aid the process

\section*{Other methods of delivery}

Fundal Pressure -used in case of a macerated or pre-term baby as the strength of the cord is reduced.

\section*{Procedure}
- Wait for the signs of placental separation:
- Empty bladder.
- Instruct the mother to breathe through an open mouth slowly and quietly. When there is a contraction, grasp the uterus with your left hand fingers behind the uterus. Thumb in the anterior surface.
- Apply pressure to the pelvic inlet in downward and backward direction.
- Receive the placenta with both hands.
- If the membranes do not slip out, turn the placenta around and deliver the membranes slowly with an upward movement.
- Rub the uterus and expel the clots.

\section*{Placenta at term}
- Blue red colour, discoid shape
- 20 cm diameter, $2-2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ thick at the centre,
- Weighs approx. 1/6 of the baby's weight $400-600 \mathrm{~g}$

Has two surfaces
- Maternal surface- dark red, has appr. 20 cotelydons/lobes separated by sulci/furrows
- Fetal surface- shiny appearance, covered by amnion, with visible vessels as they spread to the cord
Membranes
- Amnion- shiny, translucent, peels off from the chorion up to the cord. The cord has two arteries and one vein
- Chorion- opaque, ends at placental edge,

\section*{Placenta examination-}

\section*{PLACENTAL ABNORMALITIES}
- placental and fetal size and weight roughly correlate in a linear fashion.
- There is also evidence that fetal growth depends on placental weight, which is less with small-for-gestational age infants
- ABNORMAL SHAPE OR IMPLANTATION..
1. Multiple Placentas with a Single Fetus. The placenta occasionally is separated into lobes.
- placenta bipartita or bipartite- two complete and separate are present each with a cord. The cords join a short distance from the parts
- Tripartite placenta - has three parts
2. Succenturiate Lobes- one or more small accessory lobes that develop in the membranes at a distance from the periphery of the main placenta, to which they usually have vascular connections of fetal origin. The accessory lobe may sometimes be retained in the uterus after delivery and may cause serious hemorrhage.

\section*{Placenta''}

Circumvallate placenta- opaque ring seen on the fetal surface of placenta.
The ring has a depression
- The ring is composed of a double fold of amnion and chorion, with degenerated decidua and fibrin in between
- May result in membranes leaving the placenta nearer the centre instead of the edge- associated with prematurity, prenatal bleeding, abruption, multiparity
circummarginate placenta -When the ring does not have the central depression with the fold of membranes,

\section*{Cord insertion and length}
-Battledore- cord inserted to the very edge of the placenta. Its not significant -Velamentous insertion- inserted to the membranes some distance from the edge, vessels running through the membranes to the placenta. May cause vasa praevia
Length- normal length $\mathbf{4 0 - 5 0 c m}$. It can be short or long
-Short< $\mathbf{4 0 c m}$-intrauterine growth restriction, congenital abnormalities
-Long cord- cord prolapse, cord around the neck, knotting, coilings around the body
-Cord knots- true knots- fetal distress
-One artery -heart defects, CNS defects, urinary tract defects (renal),

\section*{Placenta cont'}

DEGENERATIVE PLACENTAL LESIONS. Due to aging or impaired circulation
- Calcification-Deposition of calcium salts ,is heaviest on the maternal surface. It is more extensive in smokers. It is evident as gray plaques on the maternal surface of the placenta
- Placental ischemic Infarctions- yellowish white
CHORIOAMNIONITIS- clouding of membranes with bad odour

\section*{Placenta examinationprocedure}

It should be done as soon after birth as practicable
- Lay the placenta on a flat surface
- Determine the colour and shape

Examine the cord- vessels(wipe blood using gauze), length, cord insertion, knots
Hold the placenta by the cord and let the membranes hang. Identify the hole through which the baby passed, insert the hand and spread the membranes
-Carefully inspect membranes, try to piece them together to give an outlook of completeness
Spread the placenta on a flat surface with good light
- Examine the diameter and thickness

Examine both surfaces
-Fetal surface-
- colour, distribution of blood vessels
-Try to peel amnion from the chorion up to the cord and view the chorion. Rule out chorioamnionitis

\section*{Placenta examination}

\section*{-Maternal surface}
- Remove the clots and keep for blood loss estimation
-Replace broken fragments of cotelydons- lobes of complete placenta fit neatly together with no gaps with edges forming uniform circle. Count the lobes
-Inspect for calcification and infarction
-Blood vessels should not radiate beyond edges, if they do rule out succenturiate lobe
- Weigh the placenta
- Measure blood loss and add to estimated loss
- If you suspect the lobe/membranes are retained. Keep the placenta for further examination

\section*{Once the placenta is out, examine the birth canal.}
- Explain to the mother that you need to check if she has any tears, inform her it will be a bit painful but you will be very gentle and quick and that she needs to cooperate
- Change the gloves, roll gauze over index and middle fingers of the right hand
- Insert middle fingers of left hand facing upwards pushing the upper vaginal wall
- With the right hand press down the lower vaginal wall exposing the cervix
- Check the cervix for bleeding, oedema or tears
- Check for any tears with the two fingers of your right hand, mop both sides of the vaginal wall, finish with the fourchette
- Reassure the mother in case there is any tear for suturing

\section*{After placenta cont"}
- Cover the perineum with the folded pad into a half
- Wipe the buttocks from the fourchette towards the rectum cover the perineum completely
- Collect any blood loss from the bed
- Change the bed linen with the help of an assistant
- In case of episiotomy or a tear, scrub your hands while your assistant is setting a sterile suturing pack and repair the tear
- After suturing, let the mother take a warm bath
- Ask the mother to lie in lateral position with her legs crossed on each other
- Hand over the baby to the mother

\section*{Quiz}
1. During third stage, control of bleeding is brought about by the following except:
a) Retraction of oblique muscles
b) Opposing uterine walls
c) Retroplacental clot
d) Hypercoagulability of blood
2. Syntometrine is made up of:
e) 5 IU oxytocin, 0.5 mg ergometrine
f) 0.5 IU oxytocin, 5 mg ergometrine
g) 10 IU oxytocin, 5 mg ergometrine
h) 5 IU oxytocin, 10 mg ergometrine
3. Explain the factors that leads to separation and descent of placenta

\section*{Fourth Stage}
- This is the period from the delivery of placenta and membranes to the end of the first hour postpartum.
- The uterus is firm at level of two fingers breadth above the umbilicus.
- During this period myometrial contractions and retraction, accompanied by vessel thrombosis, operate effectively to control bleeding from the placenta site. Failure of this mechanism could result in excessive blood loss (postpartum haemorrhage (PPH

\section*{The Fourth Stage of Labour}
- Clearing and completing the records-drugs, observations, physical and placental examination, volume of blood loss
- Observe the mother,-
- for haemorrhage, urine retention or hypotension
-Monitor vital signs,
- check for uterine contraction
- Check the genitals for lacerations and tears and repair if necessary. Encourage uterine massage after every 15 minutes
- Encourage the mother to pass urine even when she has no urge
- Encourage the mother to eat and take fluids, as she rest
- The mother and child relationship should be initiated and encouraged, as it has an effect to the subsequent quality of their relationship and bonding.
- Initiate breastfeeding which aid in releasing oxytocin that help in uterine contraction. Some blood may be lost due to this
- Fill in the baby notification form and after the hour is over escort the mother to the postnatal unit.

\section*{Complications of labour}
- First stage- delayed first stage, obstructed labour, cord prolapse
- Second stage-, prolonged second stage, ruptured vasa praevia, birth asphyxia, tears, cord around the neck
- Third stage- PPH, uterine inversion
