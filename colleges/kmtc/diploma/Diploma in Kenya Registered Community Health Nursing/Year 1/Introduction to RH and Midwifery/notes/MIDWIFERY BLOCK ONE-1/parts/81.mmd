\section*{Physiology of second stage}

\section*{Duration-}
- primis, it should completed within 1 hr , refer if not completed within 2 hrs
- Multiparas- completed within 30 minutes, however refer if not completed within 1 hr

\section*{Divided into two phases}
- Passive/latent second stage- full dilatation of the cervix prior to or in absence of involuntary expulsive contractions. Fetus descent in the pelvis, internal rotation and flexion occurs
- Active /pelvic floor phase- when the baby is visible, with expulsive contraction and full cervical dilatation. Allow the woman to push as and when she wishes as long as maternal and fetal condition are good

\section*{Uterine action-}
- Contractions becomes longer and stronger but may be less frequent (allows recovery)
- Due to rupture of membranes, fetal axis pressure comes into play and increases flexion of the head

\section*{Physiology cont'}
- Contractions becomes expulsive as the fetus descends further into the vagina
- Pressure from presenting part stimulates nerves in the pelvic floor resulting in the need to push (Ferguson' reflex).
- As Contractions become overwhelming the mother employs secondary powers by contracting abdominal muscles and diaphragm. This is due vagal stimulation
Soft tissue displacement-
- Anteriorly- bladder is pushed up in the abdomen resulting in stretching and thinning of urethra
- Posteriorly-Rectum becomes flattened curve and pressure from presenting part expels residual fecal matter
- Levator ani muscles dilate thin out and displaced laterally
- Perineal body flatten, stretch and becomes thin

\section*{Physiology cont'}

\section*{The head advance with each contraction until crowning occurs}
- For some time it keeps popping out during a contraction and receding back during the relaxation phase. After some time it can no longer slip back.
- The state at which the baby's head remains visible without slipping back is called crowning
- During crowning, the perineum becomes stretched and paper-thin. The mother feels burning/stinging sensation shortly followed by numbness (nerves blocked by thin perineum.) At this stage an episiotomy should be performed if necessary. The next contraction normally expels the presenting part.

\section*{The uterus in the second stage}
1. A diminution in the transverse diameters because of:
- Pulling up of the lower segment.
- Flexion of the fetus.
2. The fetal head is forced into the upper vagina which now forms a continuous tube with the uterus and a fully effaced cervix.
3. As well as uterine contractions, expulsive efforts are made by the mother using:
- The abdominal wall muscles.
- The fixed diaphragm, thus raising intra-abdominal pressure.

\section*{Recognition of commencement of second stage}

\section*{Presumptive evidence}
- Expulsive uterine contractions
- Rupture of fore waters
- Dilatation and gaping of anus
- Anal cleft line- purple line in the cleft of buttocks
- Appearance of rhomboid michaelis- dome shaped curve at the lower back due to posterior displacement of sacrum and coccyx by occiput. The mother archs her back, push her buttocks forward and throw her arms back to grasp any object she can find.

\section*{Signs}
- If on epidural analgesia, she may feel discomfort under ribs
- Appearance of presenting part ensure you rule out caput which may appear before full dilatation
- Bulging perineum

Confirmatory evidence
Vaginal examination to ascertain full dilatation
NB- allow the mother to choose her most comfortable position
Positions include-supine, supported sitting, left lateral, upright(squatting, kneeling, all fours, birth ball)

\section*{Mechanisms of labour/natural movements made by the baby}

\section*{Factors which influence the mechanism of labour outcome (the three 'Ps') power, passage, and passenger}

Power-The stronger the contraction in a well prepared mother, the better the outcome of labour

\section*{Passage-}

The size, shape and resistance of the birth canal including the bony pelvis, cervix, vagina and pelvic floor may speed up or slow down the process of delivery. A gynaecoid pelvis and a fully dilated cervix speed up the process.
Passenger This refers to the size, lie and presentation of the foetus, as well as the placenta and membranes.
vertex presentation makes labour shorter- the presenting part fits well on the cervical Os and stimulates the cervix to dilate faster.

\section*{Mechanisms of labour}

Definition -These are movements the baby makes through the birth canal as it descent during labour

\section*{Importance -}
- They help the midwife anticipate the next step in the process of labour
- Help the fetus to turn and occupy the widest space of the pelvis

\section*{Principles common to all mechanisms}
- Descent takes place
- The part that meet the resistance from the pelvic floor first rotates forwards until it comes under symphysis pubis
- Whatever emerges from the pelvis will pivot around the pubic bone

\section*{Mechanisms of normal labour}

\section*{Normal labour-}
- presentation is cephalic (95\%)
- presenting part is posterior part of anterior parietal bone,
- presenting diameter is the smallest - 9.5 cm i.e suboccipital bregmatic and biparietal diameters
- Diameter that distends vaginal orifice is suboccipital frontal $(11.5 \mathrm{~cm})$
- The head is well on the neck with the chin touching the chest. (Attitude is of complete flexion)
- Denominator -occiput
- Position is the right/left occipitoanterior
- Lie longitudinal

\section*{Do Frogs In Cuba/England Ride In Red Limo?}

As the leading part meets resistance of the pelvic floor it rotates 1/8th forwards until it comes under the symphysis pubis.
The mechanism of labour in a cephalic vertex presentation includes the following steps:
- Engagement and descent
- Flexion
- Internal rotation of the head
- Extension of the head
- Restitution
- Internal rotation of the shoulders
- External rotation of the head
- Lateral flexion

\section*{1. Descent}

\section*{Mechanisms cont}

- Begins before onset of labour but contractions speeds up the process
- In the primigravida - occurs in late pregnancy because of firm abdominal muscles
- in multipara- descent and engagement may not occur till labour starts due to lax abdominal
The head enters the pelvic brim in oblique diameter with sub occipital frontal diameter ( 10 cm ).

\section*{2. Flexion}
- With good uterine contraction, fetal axis pressure is directed more to the occiput than sinciput which increases flexion. The head engages with sub occipital bregmatic diameter ( 9.5 cms )
- Occiput becomes the leading part

\section*{Mechanisms cont'}

\section*{3. Internal Rotation of the head}
- Due to the action of uterine muscle, the occiput is pushed downwards to meet the pelvic floor first(resistance) rotating forwards 1/8th of a circle slightly twisting the neck.
- Anteroposterior diameter of the head now lies in the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet.
- The occiput slips below the sub pubic arch and crowning occurs when the head no longer recedes between contractions
NB- epidural analgesia relaxes pelvic floor muscles hence reducing resistance- prolonged rotation

\section*{Mechanisms}

\section*{4. Birth By Extension of the Head}

Once the occiput has escaped from under the symphysis pubis, the head extends forward. The nape of the neck is pressed firmly against the pubic arch, sinciput, face and chin to escape the perineum and the head is born by extension.
- Extension is the result of action from two forces.
a. The abdominal and thoracic muscles exert downward pressure.
b. The pelvic floor and perineum resist this pressure and push the head forward and upward through the weak area, which is the vagina.

\section*{5. Restitution}

The head turns $1 / 8$ of the circle to the left (undo the twist of the neck that resulted from internal rotation), back to where it was before.

\section*{Extension of the head}

\section*{6. Internal Rotation of the shoulder}
- As the head pass through the level of the ischial spines and the outlet in anterior posterior position, the shoulders enter in the oblique diameter of the pelvis and the first shoulder to reach levator ani muscle rotate forward 1/8 of a circle. They are now in the anterior posterior diameter of the outlet.
- The anterior shoulder escapes the symphysis pubis while the posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum.
7. External Rotation of the Head As the internal rotation of the shoulders takes place, the head, which has already been born, rotates $1 / 8$ of a circle as in restitution. The head/occiput now lies in the lateral position

\section*{Mechanisms cont'}
8. Lateral Flexion Following these movements the body bends sideways to follow the curve of the birth canal. The anterior shoulder escapes under the symphysis pubis and the posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum. The body of the baby is born by lateral flexion.

\section*{Mechanism video}
- Rotate forward
- pivoting

\section*{Management of the Second Stage of Normal Labour}
- Continuously provide information, support and encouragement to the woman and her companion her to gain control and confidence. Give the mother praise of what she is doing
$\succ$ Ensure privacy and dignity of the mother, prevent the public from delivery room
$>$ Incase of leg cramp, massage the calf muscle, extend the limb and dorsiflex the foot
-monitor maternal observations
- Contractions- regularly
- Do vaginal examination- to assess station, flexion, internal rotation of the head and formation of caput succedaneum
- Observe progressive descent and rotation of the presenting part including observing progressive distention of the perineum and visibility of presenting part
