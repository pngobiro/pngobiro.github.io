\section*{AMTSL CONT'}

NB- avoid manipulation of the fundus as it may lead to partial separation The uterus must be firmly contracted before this method can be used. It is not necessary to wait for signs of placenta separation.
- Confirm the uterus is well contracted
- Clamp the cord close to the perineum using sponge forceps and hold it with one right hand
- Place the left hand above the symphyis pubis palm facing umbilicus, exert pressure to the uterus upwards and backwards. (counter pressure/traction)
- With the right hand pull the cord downwards and backwards. Apply traction steadily without jerking, following birth canal for about 30-40 seconds.
- Stop traction if the cord tears or the uterus relaxes

\section*{AMTSL CONT"}
- When the placenta is visible at the vulva, direct the cord upwards. The placenta will follow the curve of the birth canal.
- Receive it with both hands. Move it gently up and down OR rotate/twist the placenta till the membranes are delivered.
- If membranes tear, examine the upper vagina and cervix for remnants
- Carefully look at the placenta to ensure non is missing
3. Uterine massage
- Massage the uterus and remove retroplacental clots
- Inspect lower vagina and perineum and repair them if need be
- Instruct the mother to massage the uterus after every 15 minutes for the first two hours

\section*{The Passive or Natural Method of Managing the Third Stage of Labour}
- Occurs naturally, that is without any interference
- Signs of separation and descent must be present before maternal effort is used to hasten delivery
- The mother pushes as if in second stage
- It takes $20-60 \mathrm{mins}$
- Uterotonic agent is NOT administered
- Early attachment to the breast aid the process

\section*{Other methods of delivery}

Fundal Pressure -used in case of a macerated or pre-term baby as the strength of the cord is reduced.

\section*{Procedure}
- Wait for the signs of placental separation:
- Empty bladder.
- Instruct the mother to breathe through an open mouth slowly and quietly. When there is a contraction, grasp the uterus with your left hand fingers behind the uterus. Thumb in the anterior surface.
- Apply pressure to the pelvic inlet in downward and backward direction.
- Receive the placenta with both hands.
- If the membranes do not slip out, turn the placenta around and deliver the membranes slowly with an upward movement.
- Rub the uterus and expel the clots.

\section*{Placenta at term}
- Blue red colour, discoid shape
- 20 cm diameter, $2-2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ thick at the centre,
- Weighs approx. 1/6 of the baby's weight $400-600 \mathrm{~g}$

Has two surfaces
- Maternal surface- dark red, has appr. 20 cotelydons/lobes separated by sulci/furrows
- Fetal surface- shiny appearance, covered by amnion, with visible vessels as they spread to the cord
Membranes
- Amnion- shiny, translucent, peels off from the chorion up to the cord. The cord has two arteries and one vein
- Chorion- opaque, ends at placental edge,

\section*{Placenta examination-}

\section*{PLACENTAL ABNORMALITIES}
- placental and fetal size and weight roughly correlate in a linear fashion.
- There is also evidence that fetal growth depends on placental weight, which is less with small-for-gestational age infants
- ABNORMAL SHAPE OR IMPLANTATION..
1. Multiple Placentas with a Single Fetus. The placenta occasionally is separated into lobes.
- placenta bipartita or bipartite- two complete and separate are present each with a cord. The cords join a short distance from the parts
- Tripartite placenta - has three parts
2. Succenturiate Lobes- one or more small accessory lobes that develop in the membranes at a distance from the periphery of the main placenta, to which they usually have vascular connections of fetal origin. The accessory lobe may sometimes be retained in the uterus after delivery and may cause serious hemorrhage.

\section*{Placenta''}

Circumvallate placenta- opaque ring seen on the fetal surface of placenta.
The ring has a depression
- The ring is composed of a double fold of amnion and chorion, with degenerated decidua and fibrin in between
- May result in membranes leaving the placenta nearer the centre instead of the edge- associated with prematurity, prenatal bleeding, abruption, multiparity
circummarginate placenta -When the ring does not have the central depression with the fold of membranes,

\section*{Cord insertion and length}
-Battledore- cord inserted to the very edge of the placenta. Its not significant -Velamentous insertion- inserted to the membranes some distance from the edge, vessels running through the membranes to the placenta. May cause vasa praevia
Length- normal length $\mathbf{4 0 - 5 0 c m}$. It can be short or long
-Short< $\mathbf{4 0 c m}$-intrauterine growth restriction, congenital abnormalities
-Long cord- cord prolapse, cord around the neck, knotting, coilings around the body
-Cord knots- true knots- fetal distress
-One artery -heart defects, CNS defects, urinary tract defects (renal),

\section*{Placenta cont'}

DEGENERATIVE PLACENTAL LESIONS. Due to aging or impaired circulation
- Calcification-Deposition of calcium salts ,is heaviest on the maternal surface. It is more extensive in smokers. It is evident as gray plaques on the maternal surface of the placenta
- Placental ischemic Infarctions- yellowish white
CHORIOAMNIONITIS- clouding of membranes with bad odour

\section*{Placenta examinationprocedure}

It should be done as soon after birth as practicable
- Lay the placenta on a flat surface
- Determine the colour and shape

Examine the cord- vessels(wipe blood using gauze), length, cord insertion, knots
Hold the placenta by the cord and let the membranes hang. Identify the hole through which the baby passed, insert the hand and spread the membranes
-Carefully inspect membranes, try to piece them together to give an outlook of completeness
Spread the placenta on a flat surface with good light
- Examine the diameter and thickness

Examine both surfaces
-Fetal surface-
- colour, distribution of blood vessels
-Try to peel amnion from the chorion up to the cord and view the chorion. Rule out chorioamnionitis

\section*{Placenta examination}

\section*{-Maternal surface}
- Remove the clots and keep for blood loss estimation
-Replace broken fragments of cotelydons- lobes of complete placenta fit neatly together with no gaps with edges forming uniform circle. Count the lobes
-Inspect for calcification and infarction
-Blood vessels should not radiate beyond edges, if they do rule out succenturiate lobe
- Weigh the placenta
- Measure blood loss and add to estimated loss
- If you suspect the lobe/membranes are retained. Keep the placenta for further examination

\section*{Once the placenta is out, examine the birth canal.}
- Explain to the mother that you need to check if she has any tears, inform her it will be a bit painful but you will be very gentle and quick and that she needs to cooperate
- Change the gloves, roll gauze over index and middle fingers of the right hand
- Insert middle fingers of left hand facing upwards pushing the upper vaginal wall
- With the right hand press down the lower vaginal wall exposing the cervix
- Check the cervix for bleeding, oedema or tears
- Check for any tears with the two fingers of your right hand, mop both sides of the vaginal wall, finish with the fourchette
- Reassure the mother in case there is any tear for suturing

\section*{After placenta cont"}
- Cover the perineum with the folded pad into a half
- Wipe the buttocks from the fourchette towards the rectum cover the perineum completely
- Collect any blood loss from the bed
- Change the bed linen with the help of an assistant
- In case of episiotomy or a tear, scrub your hands while your assistant is setting a sterile suturing pack and repair the tear
- After suturing, let the mother take a warm bath
- Ask the mother to lie in lateral position with her legs crossed on each other
- Hand over the baby to the mother

\section*{Quiz}
1. During third stage, control of bleeding is brought about by the following except:
a) Retraction of oblique muscles
b) Opposing uterine walls
c) Retroplacental clot
d) Hypercoagulability of blood
2. Syntometrine is made up of:
e) 5 IU oxytocin, 0.5 mg ergometrine
f) 0.5 IU oxytocin, 5 mg ergometrine
g) 10 IU oxytocin, 5 mg ergometrine
h) 5 IU oxytocin, 10 mg ergometrine
3. Explain the factors that leads to separation and descent of placenta

\section*{Fourth Stage}
- This is the period from the delivery of placenta and membranes to the end of the first hour postpartum.
- The uterus is firm at level of two fingers breadth above the umbilicus.
- During this period myometrial contractions and retraction, accompanied by vessel thrombosis, operate effectively to control bleeding from the placenta site. Failure of this mechanism could result in excessive blood loss (postpartum haemorrhage (PPH

\section*{The Fourth Stage of Labour}
- Clearing and completing the records-drugs, observations, physical and placental examination, volume of blood loss
- Observe the mother,-
- for haemorrhage, urine retention or hypotension
-Monitor vital signs,
- check for uterine contraction
- Check the genitals for lacerations and tears and repair if necessary. Encourage uterine massage after every 15 minutes
- Encourage the mother to pass urine even when she has no urge
- Encourage the mother to eat and take fluids, as she rest
- The mother and child relationship should be initiated and encouraged, as it has an effect to the subsequent quality of their relationship and bonding.
- Initiate breastfeeding which aid in releasing oxytocin that help in uterine contraction. Some blood may be lost due to this
- Fill in the baby notification form and after the hour is over escort the mother to the postnatal unit.

\section*{Complications of labour}
- First stage- delayed first stage, obstructed labour, cord prolapse
- Second stage-, prolonged second stage, ruptured vasa praevia, birth asphyxia, tears, cord around the neck
- Third stage- PPH, uterine inversion
