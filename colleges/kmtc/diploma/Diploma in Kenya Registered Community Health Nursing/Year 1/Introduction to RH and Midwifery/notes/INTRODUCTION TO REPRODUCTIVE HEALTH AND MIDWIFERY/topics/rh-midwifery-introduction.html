                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>- During a Kenyan population census conducted in the late 1950's, the fertility and growth rates of Kenyans were found to be high.</p>
                        <p>- In response, the government adopted Family Planning (FP) as an important component of socioeconomic development in the 1960's.</p>
                        <p>- As early as 1965, when fertility control was a primary focus, the Government of Kenya (G.o.K) recognised population planning and family planning as part of the National Planning Strategies of Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965.</p>
                        <p>- In 1967, the Family Planning Programme was established (G.o.K/M.o.H, 1998).</p>
                        <p>- Since then, the fertility rate, which was $7.9\%$ in 1979, has decreased to $5.45\%$ in 1993, and the population growth rate has reduced from $3.8\%$ in 1979 to $3.4\%$ in 1993 (CBS, 1995).</p>
                        <p>- The population of Kenya was 15.3 million in 1979.</p>
                        <p>- By 1998, it has doubled to approximately 30 million (NCPD, 1998).</p>
                        <p>- Meanwhile, the growth of the economy has not kept pace with the growth of the population.</p>
                        <p>- If the population growth rate is higher than the economic growth rate, it creates a burden on available land, health facilities, educational resources and the job market.</p>
                        <p>- These factors often impact more on mothers and children, whose mortality and morbidity rates are high, mainly due to complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth and HIV/AIDS prevalence.</p>
                        <p>- In 1974, further evaluation established that the child health services were running parallel to those of family planning and antenatal care.</p>
                        <p>- This arrangement was viewed as inefficient.</p>
                        <p>- As a result, these services were integrated to offer a more consolidated package.</p>
                        <p>- Maternal/Child Health Care and Family Planning (MCH/FP) Programme was established.</p>

                        <p>- In 1987, the Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) was launched at the Conference on Better Health for Women and Children, held in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
                        <p>- The Government of Kenya endorsed the Plan of Action to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rate, which was developed at that conference.</p>
                        <p>- At the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 1994, 179 countries endorsed a Reproductive Health Agenda.</p>
                        <p>- Programme endorsed a shift in development strategies, urging member countries to review and revise health policies to focus on meeting the needs of an individual, and on the provision of basic as well as comprehensive and quality RH services.</p>
                        <p>- The comprehensive concept of RH is based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of RH, which recognised the fact that RH is closely interrelated with policies to empower women, strengthen families, stabilise population growth, and eradicate poverty.</p>
                        <p>- In response to ICPD recommendations, the concept of integrated RH services was developed and launched to meet the revised policy on RH care.</p>
                        <p>- Integrated RH creates demand for, and ensures provision of RH services, defined for each level of the health care system, everyday, during the same visit, under one roof, and where possible by the same provider 'the supermarket approach'.</p>
                        <p>- Kenya is signatory to the Cairo Declaration of 1994, which marked a turning point in the field of population and health development, not only for Kenya but the whole world.</p>
                        <p>- As a response to the 1994 ICPD in Cairo, the Kenya government developed and launched the Health Policy Framework Paper of 1994.</p>
                        <p>- This policy document provides the blueprint for strategies for the development and management of health services in this country.</p>
                        <p>- A notable policy document is the National Reproductive Health Strategic Plan of 1996, covering the period 1997 2010.</p>
                        <p>- This document guides the implementation of a comprehensive and integrated RH programme in Kenya for the next decade.</p>
                        <p>- In order to operationalise the 1997-2010 Strategic Plan, the Ministry of Health (M.o.H), In collaboration with various stakeholders, designed and launched a series of policy documents to spearhead the long term reform process.</p>

                        <p>- Safe motherhood is the concept or initiatives to ensure that women receive high quality care in order to achieve the optimum level of health of mother and infant.</p>
                        <p>- Safe motherhood aims at improving maternal and child health and eliminating the probable risk that can occur.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Why safe motherhood?</h3>
                        <p>- In 2007 there were at least 3.2 million stillborn babies, 4 million neonatal deaths and more than half a million maternal deaths globally. - Every day in 2015, about 830 women died due to complications of pregnancy and child birth. Most of these could have been prevented.</p>
                        <p>- Maternal and neonatal deaths are still high and unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>- Over half of maternal deaths are due to preventable or treatable conditions.</p>
                        <p>- The maternal morbidity and mortality can be reduced through preventive and promotive activities and by addressing avoidable factors that cause death, which are included in safe motherhood initiatives.</p>
                        <p>- For newborns, most deaths are due to premature birth, infections and complications of asphyxia, again all preventable or treatable conditions.</p>

                        <p>- The prevalence of home births plays a large role in the country's high maternal death rate-which has been rising in recent years</p>
                        <p>- These high rates of maternal deaths are attributed to well-known and preventable causes.</p>
                        <p>- They include obstructed labour, complications of unsafe abortion, infections, haemorrhage, and high blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>- Most of these deaths could be avoided if the mother is managed at a health facility by a qualified health professional.</p>
                        <p>- During antenatal care visits to health facilities, pregnant women are screened for complications and given advice on a range of issues, including place of delivery and referral.</p>
                        <p>- However, the majority of women (56 percent) give birth at home.</p>
                        <p>- Why then do so many women choose to deliver at home or in the community?</p>
                        <p>- "Their reasons include lack of transport,</p>
                        <p>- fears about negative attitudes of health workers,</p>
                        <p>- long distances to health facilities,</p>
                        <p>- cultural preferences, and charges for services which are beyond what most women can afford,</p>
                        <p>- On June 1, 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that the Jubilee Government had abolished maternity charges in public health facilities.</p>
                        <p>- Scrapping of the fees would help all expectant mothers access maternal care and would also help reduce maternal deaths.</p>

                        <p>- The framework aims to galvanise high-level leadership in ending new HIV infections among children and reducing HIV related deaths among women and children in Kenya.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Strengthening health systems for service equity</h3>
                        <p>- Recognizing the devolved structure of health services and systems,</p>
                        <p>- Beyond Zero has donated forty seven fully kitted mobile clinics to forty seven county governments to strengthen the existing outreach programs and referral systems.</p>
                        <p>- The mobile clinic design and specifications were developed in conjunction with the Ministry of Health through wide consultations whilst understanding the specifities of county profiles.</p>
                        <p>- The mobile clinic partly addresses access to health care services for hard to reach areas;</p>
                        <p>- informal settlements - focusing on urban and peri-urban areas;</p>
                        <p>- and at risk populations.</p>
                        <p>- The sustainability of the mobile clinics is ensured through a formal handing over to the County Government and the signing of MOU between the County Government, Ministry of Health and Beyond</p>
                        <p>- This process demonstrates transfer of ownership from Beyond Zero to County Governments.</p>
                        <p>- In addition, each mobile clinic receives a master facility number to enable the County Government allocate health workers, purchase drugs and supplies, allocate budget and report on the national District Health Information System.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Contribution to increasing service provision through the mobile clinics</h3>
                        <p>- The forty-seven fully kitted mobile clinics have provided almost half a million integrated services.</p>
                        <p>- The services include antenatal and postnatal services;</p>
                        <p>- HIV testing, treatment and care;</p>
                        <p>- Immunization, basic treatment for common ailments, reproductive health cancers screening and treatment (where applicable).</p>

                        <p>- This path demonstrates the potential of a leadership model for promoting community empowerment for preventative and curative healthcare.</p>
                        <p>- This model has attracted interest beyond Kenya‚Äôs borders and increased donations of health care equipment for facilities in Kenya.</p>

                        <p>- Kenya is known world-wide for her sterling performance in athletics and the Founder of the Initiative determined that "running" would raise the profile of maternal and child health challenges.</p>
                        <p>- Increasing in Kenya, marathons bring together people from all walks of life who identify with a course whilst exercising for fun..</p>
                        <p>- The active citizen participation has grown over the three editions of the First Lady's Half Marathon and has raised nearly KSH 600 million (US\$ Six Million) including in-kind donations.</p>
                        <p>- In 2016, the First Lady's Half Marathon saw the inclusion of a new category for people and/or children with special abilities</p>
