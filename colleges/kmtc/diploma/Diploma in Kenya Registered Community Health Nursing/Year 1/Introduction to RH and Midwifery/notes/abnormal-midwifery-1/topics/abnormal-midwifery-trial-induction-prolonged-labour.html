                    </ul>
                    <p>You should always observe for signs of foetal and maternal distress. Accurately observe and record for onset, strength, frequency and duration of the contractions. Closely observe the descent of the head every one to two hours per abdominal palpation by the same midwife if possible. Encourage the mother to pass urine every two hours and test exclude acidosis.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-management-trial-labour-2">Management of Trial of Labour</h4> 
                    <p>A vaginal examination should be done every four hours to assess the level of the presenting part, the degree moulding and flexion, the dilation of the cervix (whether progressive or not), the consistency of the cervix and the presence or absence of caput. You should also check whether the membranes are intact or ruptured. Encourage adequate hydration by giving intravenous 5% dextrose. Sedate the mother with pethidine or morphia in early labour to promote rest, and reduce anxiety.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Trial of labour may result in spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery by either forceps or vacuum, or caesarean section due to complications.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s3-trial-of-scar">Trial of Scar: Vaginal Birth After Caesarean Section</h3>
                    <p>Trial of scar is a test of labour for a woman with a previous caesarean section scar, where no recurrent indication is present. Studies have shown that some 60-65% of previous caesarean section mothers (Reedes/Martin, 1987) deliver per vagina, involving same or fewer risks than a repeated section. The trial should be in a facility where, if there is a need for a caesarean section, this can be performed immediately. The midwife should be vigilant in making the necessary observations.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s3-educating-patient-avoiding-cs">Educating the Patient on Avoiding Unnecessary Caesarean Birth</h3>
                    <p>A small percentage of women with conditions that are a threat to the foetal or maternal life need a caesarean section. Many other women have a caesarean section due to a series of events, which leads to an inevitable section seen as necessary at that particular time. For some, if other options had been discussed earlier, a caesarean section may have been avoided. Some mothers insist on the operation if the month coincides with the previous month of birth of other children, so as to have the same birthdays for their babies. Others prefer not to push and go through the whole process of enlarging the birth canal. If these women were well informed, they might see the sense of preventing a caesarean section. Additional contributing factors to the decision to have a caesarean section include mismanagement of the syntocinon drip, choice of obstetrician and/or hospital policy.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s3-maternal-distress">Maternal Distress</h3>
                    <p>This is a serious and life threatening condition, which should not occur in this era. It happens when the metabolism and the electrolyte balance of the woman in labour is disturbed and this can result into ketoacidosis hypotonic uterine inertia. Maternal and foetal distresses usually occur together after prolonged labour. In maternal distress, the accumulation of ketoacids and the electrolyte imbalance also affect the metabolism and function of all the other muscles in the body. The intestines stop contracting, which is known as intestinal ileus. The large intestine (colon) distends. Emptying of the stomach is delayed. With large volumes of fluid stagnating uselessly in the stomach, and the small and large bowel, the woman becomes dehydrated. These disturbances in the mother result in a similar disturbance in the foetal metabolism. Often maternal and foetal distress present together in women who have been in labour for a long time at home and are brought to a health centre or hospital in poor condition. The main symptoms of maternal distress are that the mother is exhausted by severe pain and lack of sleep and she might have severe abdominal pain because of the prolonged and obstructed labour.</p>

                    <p>The main investigation is testing for the presence of acetone in the urine. The management of Maternal Distress involves giving an infusion of 10% glucose to correct dehydration. A caesarean section is performed when in the first stage of labour. In the second stage, an episiotomy is given and delivery is assisted with vacuum extraction.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s3-foetal-distress">Foetal Distress (Fetal compromise)</h3>
                    <p>Foetal distress occurs when the foetus is deprived of oxygen and, as a result, develops hypoxia. The baby may be born as a still birth or develop asphyxia and suffer brain damage.</p>

                    <p>Foetal tachycardia of more than 160 per minute is an early sign while foetal bradycardia or pulse less than 120 beats per minute is a late sign of foetal distress. Foetal heart acceleration related with uterine contraction is another sign of foetal distress.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-management-foetal-distress">Management of Foetal Distress</h4>
                    <p>When foetal distress is anticipated, a blood sample is taken, the normal pH being 7.35. If this falls to 7.2, labour has to be terminated. Below pH 7 the brain cells perish. When there are signs of foetal distress, call the doctor. If the mother is on an oxytocin drip, stop it immediately. Change the mother's position and give oxygen by facemask. If the mother is in the first stage of labour, a caesarean section should be performed. If she is in the second stage, an episiotomy should be given. Forceps or vacuum hastens the birth. A paediatrician should always be present, if possible.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s3-post-term-pregnancy">Post Term Pregnancy</h3>
                    <p>Prolonged pregnancy, or post term pregnancy, refers to a pregnancy that has exceeded 294 days from the first day of the last menstrual period. The difference between this term and post maturity or post mature is that the latter relates to the baby and refers to features or conditions of the neonate. It has been proven that the duration of pregnancy differs depending on parity and race. Primagravidae have a longer duration of 288 days, compared to multigravidae, who normally have a duration of about 283 days. To determine prolonged pregnancy is not easy as the mother may give wrong dates. Assessing the gestation period by clinical estimation can be inaccurate because of the biological variation in the size of the mother and the foetus. Quickening cannot be relied on as there is a range of weeks. A primigravida may start feeling quickening between 15-22 weeks while a multigravida may feel quickening at 14-22 weeks. An ultrasound may be relied on in the assessment of maturity. Early scanning can also help to reduce the mistake of diagnosing prolonged pregnancy.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-risks-post-term-pregnancy">Risks of Post Term Pregnancy</h4>
                    <p>There is low prenatal mortality at 40 weeks, which increases at 42 weeks. The post term period contributes to foetal maturation, with big babies weighing 4,000 gm in 10% of cases and 4,500 gm in 1% of cases. This can result in cephalopelvic disproportion or shoulder dystocia. There is a reduction of amniotic fluid, which may result in cord compression and reduction of the placental function. There is also a high risk of foetal distress. The management of post term pregnancy usually involves induction of labour (Myles 1999).</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s3-induction-of-labour">Induction of Labour</h3>
                    <p>Induction of labour involves the initiation of uterine muscle contraction by artificial means.</p>
                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Make sure that when labour is induced it will result in a viable baby.</p>

                    <p>Intravaginal prostaglandin E2 are used in the form of pessaries ( 2.5 mg ), vaginal tablets (3-6 mg) or gel (2.5-5 mg). A nelatone urinary catheter is attached to a syringe containing the gel while membranes are intact in case of intrauterine infection. Introduce the gel to the posterior vaginal phornix. The dose varies from 2.5 mg-5 mg. If there is no change overnight, prostaglandin may be added/repeated, but if the cervix ripens overnight, then pessaries of prostaglandin E2 may be introduced to the vagina. The following steps should be taken to ensure adequate care of the mother during the procedure:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Oral prostaglandin is usually used to induce labour where the membranes have ruptured. One tablet is swallowed at an hourly interval. A maximum of ten tablets should be administered. Each tablet contains 0.5 mg of prostaglandin E2. Should it cause diarrhoea, the administration should be stopped immediately.</p>
                    <p>You should note, however, that there are several complications associated with prostaglandin. The mother may suffer discomfort due to painful contractions. The induction may be ineffective. Over-stimulation of the uterus can cause foetal and maternal distress.</p>
                    <p>Another variety of medical induction is oxytocin administration. The amount and rate of oxytocin must be carefully calculated and administered. Usually 5% dextrose in water of 500 mls with five units of syntocinon is commenced after a vaginal examination. The drip is started at 15 drops per minute and increased by ten drops after every half-hour to a maximum of 60 drops. Using two bottles of the same solution is preferred so that in the event of discontinuation of oxytocin, the intravenous line will still be open.</p>
                    <p><em>It is crucial to label the amount of syntocinon put in both the bottle and the 2.5 ml IV for multiparous and 5 ml IV for primigravida chart.</em></p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-surgical-induction">Surgical Induction (Amniotomy)</h4>
                    <p>In the case of an uncomplicated pregnancy, a sweep of the membranes is an effective method of inducing labour. After a vaginal examination, the index finger is swept through the cervical os to detach foetal membranes from the deciduas. The action produces prostaglandin. Amniotomy is an Artificial Rupture of the Membranes (ARM), which is carried out to induce labour when the cervix is favourable. A well fitting presenting part is essential to avoid prolapse of the cord or rupture of the membranes. Allow the descent of the presenting part to the cervical os. This raises the level of prostaglandin which stimulates strong contractions to hasten labour. This method of induction may be combined with oxytocin drip and this is referred to as combined method. This method has likelihood of delivery within 12 hours, requires less analgesia and reduces the risk of Post Partum Haemorrhage (PPH).</p>

                    <p>The term 'prolonged labour' is used when delivery does not take place after 12 hours of established labour (Baird 1952, Myles 1999). Different terms are used for prolonged labour at different times or for different reasons.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-prolonged-latent-stage">Prolonged Latent Stage</h4>
                    <p>The latent phase lasts from the onset of labour to three centimetre dilatation of the cervical os. If this phase takes more than 20 hours in a primigravida and more than 14 hours in a multigravida, it is considered prolonged. In practice diagnosis should be suspected and treatment instituted many hours before this time interval has elapsed.</p>

                    <p>Labour is obstructed when there is no advance of the presenting part in spite of strong uterine contractions further progress is impossible without assistance. Usually the power (contractions) involves the passage (the birth canal) and the passenger (the foetus). Obstruction usually occurs at the pelvic brim, but may occur at the outlet, for example, in an android pelvis. Compare the causes of obstructed labour with those of prolonged labour. In obstructed labour, the problem is the passenger and passage (never the power). Usually this is when the passenger has gross abnormalities. This is the opposite of prolonged labour where the 'power' may be the main issue and the passenger or passage have mild or moderate problem.</p>

The surgeon will check carefully for any indication that the uterus has ruptured before taking the patient to theatre for repair of the uterus. If the labour is obstructed and the foetus has died, the mode of delivery will still be caesarean section, as vaginal birth cannot be achieved. The following advice should be given to mothers on the prevention of obstructed labour:</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s3-malposition-malpresentation">Malposition of Occiput and Malpresentation</h3>
                    <p>The foetus is not always in the desired position or lie in the uterus. As a result of malposition there is malpresentation of the foetus. The midwife needs to be aware of the various possible malpresentations their complications and how to manage the situation. Several malpositions of the occiput and malpresentations in general are discussed in the following pages.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-occipito-posterior-position">Occipito Posterior Position</h4>
                    <p>Occipito posterior position is a malposition of the occiput. In this position, the vertex is present but it occupies the posterior position instead of the anterior. The occipito posterior position can be either left or right. The cause is not clear but it is associated with abnormalities of the pelvis.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-031-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating Right (A) and Left (B) Occipito Posterior positions of the foetus." class="content-image">
                    <p>Right (A) and left (B) occipito posterior position.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-diagnosis-occipito-posterior">Diagnosis of Occipito Posterior Position</h4>
                    <p>On inspection of the abdomen you will notice a saucer shaped depression at or below the umbilicus. The unengaged head will outline the bladder as if it is a full bladder. On palpation the head is high, as the engaged diameter of 11.5 cm cannot enter the brim until flexion takes place. The head feels large and the occiput and sinciput are on the same level. The back is difficult to palpate. Limbs are felt on both sides of the abdomen. On auscultation the foetal heart is heard on the right flank. It could also be heard at the umbilicus, either at the middle line or slightly to the left. During labour the mother may complain of severe backache. You may note a slow descent of the presenting part in spite of good contractions. Early rupture of membrane may occur.</p>
                    <p>On vaginal examination the diagnosis can be confirmed on feeling the anterior fontanelle to the left anterior in ROP. The Sagittal sutures will be in the right oblique of the pelvis, but the findings will depend on the degree of flexion of the head.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-management-labour-occipito-posterior">Management of Labour in the Occipito Posterior Position</h4>
                    <p>In the occipito posterior position you should expect prolonged, painful labour due to poor fitting of the presenting part, which does not stimulate good contractions.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-first-stage-opp" class="subsubsection-heading">First Stage of Labour</h5>
                    <p>The mother may experience severe backache. You should give a back massage and encourage the mother to remain mobile as long as she can and to adopt what ever position that is most comfortable to her. Most women find the all-fours position most comfortable, pain relieving and is also believed to aid in the rotation of the foetal head. Labour is prolonged with incoordinate uterine action. Give intravenous fluid to ensure that the mother is not dehydrated. Uterine action should be regulated by the use of syntocinon. Keep accurate records by plotting half-hourly observations of the foetal heart, contractions every four hours, and blood pressure in the partograph. Maintain a strict intake and output chart. The mother may have the urge of early pushing due to the occiput pressing on the rectum. You should discourage her from pushing at this stage as this will cause the cervix to be oedematous and delay the onset of the second stage. Encourage her to change her position and use breathing techniques, as these will control the urge of early pushing.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-second-stage-opp" class="subsubsection-heading">Second Stage of Labour</h5>
                    <p>The second stage should be confirmed by vaginal examination as the caput may be seen at the vulva with the anterior lip of the cervix. During labour, one of the following may occur:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">

                    </ul>
                    <p>The second stage of labour can present any of three conditions which you will now explore in detail.</p>

                    <p>This is where the head turns 3/8 of a circle in 90% of cases and the baby is born as in occiput anterior.</p>

                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The above movements do not differ much from the normal mechanism as you may have noticed.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-short-rotation" class="subsubsection-heading">Short Rotation</h5>
                    <p>In cases of short rotation or persistent occiput posterior position, the occiput fails to rotate forward. It persists with the same position. The sinciput reaches the pelvic floor and rotates forwards, while the occiput sinks in the hollow of the sacrum. The baby is born face to pubis.</p>
                    <h6>Management of Face to Pubis Delivery</h6>
                    <p>Give an episiotomy when necessary: You should watch for signs of buttonhole tear due to the large presenting diameter. A buttonhole tear is a rupture at the centre of the perineum. If you failed to diagnose this earlier you may be extending the head thinking it is a vertex delivery, until you see the hairless forehead escaping under the pubis arch. You should then flex the head towards the symphysis pubis.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-034-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the delivery of a baby in the face-to-pubis position." class="content-image">

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-deep-transverse-arrest" class="subsubsection-heading">Deep Transverse Arrest</h5>
                    <p>This is where the occiput fails to rotate forward. This forces the sinciput to reach the pelvic floor first and rotate forwards. The occiput then goes into the hollow of the sacrum, which results in the face to pubis delivery. At first there is good flexion. The occipit reaches the pelvic floor and begins to rotate but flexion is not maintained. The occipito frontal diameter is caught by the bispinious diameter of the outlet. This arrest may be due to poor contractions, a straight sacrum or prominent ischial spines. On vaginal examination the sagittal suture is on the transverse diameter of the pelvis and both anterior and posterior fontanels are palpable. The head is caught at the ischial spines.</p>
                    <h6>Management of Deep Transverse Arrest</h6>
                    <p>Reassure the mother while explaining the position of her labour. Take her consent for the operative procedures which will be necessary. Inform the doctor of her situation. Encourage her to breathe slowly and change her position to discourage pushing. When the doctor arrives, administer analgesics. A vacuum extraction may be performed or the head may be rotated with forceps and the baby delivered. Aftercare is the same as in operative manipulation.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-conversion-face-brow" class="subsubsection-heading">Conversion to Face or Brow</h5>
                    <p>At the onset of labour with a deflexed head, an extension may occur instead of flexion. When there is complete extension, the baby will be born as face presentation but when there is incomplete extension (this is refered to as 'military attitude'), the presenting part turns to brow. A delivery by caesarean section is recommended. You have seen that labour is not smooth with this type of malposition.</p>
                    <h6>Complications of Conversion to Face or Brow</h6>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">

                    <p>You will now look at face presentation as it is one of the potential OPP outcomes. Note the delivery of face in comparison with face to pubis.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-face-presentation">Face Presentation</h4>
                    <p>Face presentation occurs when the head has complete extension, and the occiput is in contact with its spine. It happens in about one in every five hundred labours. Primary face presentation is when the face presents before labour. The term secondary face presentation is used when the face presents during labour. There are six positions in a face presentation, namely:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Right mento-posterior</span></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The denominator is the mento, the presenting diameters are the submento bregmatic ( 9.5 cm ) and the bi-temporal ( 8.2 cm ).</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-036-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating face presentation of the foetus during labor." class="content-image">

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-causes-face-presentation" class="subsubsection-heading">Causes of Face Presentation</h5>
                    <p>You will now look at some of the causes of face presentation in detail.</p>
                    <h6>Anterior Obliquity of the Uterus</h6>
                    <p>The pendulous abdomen of a multiparous woman leans forward resulting in the alteration of the direction of the uterine axis. This causes the foetal buttocks to also lean forward and the force of the contractions to be directed in a line towards the chin, rather than occiput, which usually results in extension of the head.</p>
                    <h6>Contracted Pelvis</h6>
                    <p>Face presentation develops as the head enters in the transverse diameter of the brim. The obstetric conjugate is bound to be withheld which will result in the extended head in an android pelvis. Face presentation results when vertex presentation is in the posterior position and remains deflexed. The parietal eminences are caught in the reduced sacro-cotyloid dimension, the occiput does not descend and the head becomes extended.</p>
                    <h6>Polyhydramnios</h6>
                    <p>In polyhydramnios, when the spontaneous rupture of membranes occurs, the resulting rush of fluids may cause the head to extend as it sinks into the lower uterine segment.</p>
                    <h6>Congenital Abnormality</h6>
                    <p>The absence of vertex in the encephally thrusts the face forwards. A tumour on the foetal neck can also cause extension of the head although this is rare.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-abdominal-vaginal-diagnosis-face" class="subsubsection-heading">Abdominal and Per Vaginal Diagnosis of a Face Presentation</h5>
                    <p>The diagnosis is usually made in labour. During an abdominal examination check for the following features:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">The shape of the foetal spine is an s-shape.</span></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The diagnosis is not always easy and clear. During a vaginal examination you may notice that you can diagnose face presentation with confidence if you have mastered vaginal examination skills. You will differentiate face from brow presentation when you feel the orbital ridges, the brow itself and the anterior sutures. You should look for the following characteristics:</p>

                    <p>In face presentation, you will be substituting occiput with the chin. Instead of flexion you will maintain deflexion and instead of extension you will maintain flexion. Now look at the secret formula:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h6>Extension</h6>
                    <p>Descent takes place throughout and with increasing extension and thus the mentum becomes the leading part</p>
                    <h6>Internal Rotation of the Head</h6>
                    <p>This occurs when the chin reaches the pelvis floor and rotates forwards 1/8 of a circle. The chin escapes under the symphysis pubis. When this takes place and the sinciput, vertex and occiput sweep the perineum, the head is born.</p>
                    <h6>Restitution</h6>
                    <p>This occurs when the chin turns 1/8 of a circle to the mother's left.</p>
                    <h6>Internal Rotation of Shoulders</h6>
                    <p>The shoulders enter the pelvis in the left oblique diameter and the anterior shoulder reaches the pelvis floor first and rotates forward 1/8 of a circle along the right side of the pelvis.</p>
                    <h6>External Rotation of the Head</h6>
                    <p>This occurs simultaneously and the chin moves a further 1/8 of a circle to the left.</p>
                    <h6>Lateral Flexion</h6>
                    <p>The anterior shoulder escapes under the symphysis pubis, the posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum and the body is born by a movement of lateral flexion.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-prolonged-labour-face-pres" class="subsubsection-heading">Prolonged Labour</h5>
                    <p>Labour is often prolonged due to ineffective uterine contraction caused by an ill-fitting presenting part. The facial bones do not mould and in order to enable the mentum reach the pelvic floor and rotate forwards, the shoulders must enter the pelvic cavity at the same time as the head. With good uterine contractions, descent and rotation of the head occurs and labour progresses through to a spontaneous delivery.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-mento-posterior-position" class="subsubsection-heading">Mento-Posterior Position</h5>
                    <p>When the head is completely extended with an effective contraction, the mentum reaches the pelvic floor first and will rotate forwards an the position becomes anterior.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-persistent-mento-posterior" class="subsubsection-heading">Persistent Mento-Posterior Position</h5>
                    <p>The head is incompletely extended, the sinciput reaches the pelvic floor first and rotates forwards 1/8 of a circle, which brings the chin into the hollow of the sacrum. Further mechanism is prohibited, which results in impacted face. In order for further descent, both head and chest have to be accommodated in the pelvis.</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-management-labour-face-pres" class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Labour in Face Presentation</h5>
                    <p>Upon diagnosing the condition the first action you must take is to inform the doctor about the face presentation. Routine maternal and foetal condition observations are done as in normal labour (maternal pulse, foetal heart rate and contraction) half hourly. Blood pressure and temperature is done two hourly. Empty the urinary bladder every two hours. Vaginal examination to determine cervical dilation and descent of the head, is done every four hours to monitor progress of labour. Take care not to injure the foetal eyes. In mento-posterior positions, the midwife should note whether the mentum is lower than the sinciput since rotation and descent depends on this. If the head remains high despite good uterine contractions, the mother is prepared for caesarean section.</p>
                    <h6>Management of Labour in Face Presentation Face extends to the Perineum</h6>
                    <p>When the face extends to the perineum, give episiotomy to prevent extensive perineum tear.</p>
                    <h6>Face appears at the Vulva</h6>
                    <p>When the face appears at the vulva, maintain extension by holding back the sinciput until the chin is delivered.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-039-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing management when the baby's face appears at the vulva during face presentation." class="content-image">
                    <h6>Chin has been delivered</h6>
                    <p>Once the chin has been delivered allow the occiput to sweep the perineum. In this way the submento-vertical diameter ( 11.5 cm ) distends the vaginal orifice, instead of the mento vertical diameter ( 13.5 cm ).</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-039-2.jpg" alt="Diagram showing management after the baby's chin has been delivered during face presentation." class="content-image">

                    <h6>Head is flexed completely</h6>
                    <p>The head is flexed completely and it is delivered. Inform the doctor if the head does not descend in the second stage. In a mentoanterior position, it may be possible to deliver the baby using forceps. If the head becomes impacted, or there is any suspicion of disproportion, a caesarean section will be necessary.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-041-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the head completely flexed and delivered in face presentation." class="content-image">
                    <p>There are several possible complications during labour with a face presentation.</p>
                    <h6>Obstructed Labour</h6>
                    <p>A minor degree of contracted pelvis may result in obstructed labour as facial bones do not mould. Caesarean section is necessary in persistent mento posterior position.</p>
                    <h6>Cord Prolapse</h6>
                    <p>A prolapsed cord is more common when the membranes rupture because the face is an ill-fitting presenting part. Always perform a vaginal examination following rupture of membranes to rule out cord prolapse.</p>
                    <h6>Facial Bruising</h6>
                    <p>The baby's head is elongated with a swollen bruised face, oedematous eyelids and lips at birth. You should take great care while performing vaginal examination to avoid injury.</p>
                    <h6>Cerebral Haemorrhage</h6>
                    <p>The lack of moulding of facial bones can lead to intra-cranial haemorrhage caused by excessive compression of the foetal skull or by upward compression in the typical moulding of the foetal skull found in this type of presentation.</p>
                    <h6>Maternal Trauma</h6>
                    <p>Extensive perineal laceration may occur at delivery due to the large submento vertical and bi-parental diameters distending the vagina and perineum. This increases the incidence of caesarean section, which can increase chances of maternal morbidity and mortality.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s3-breech-presentation">Breech Presentation</h4>
                    <p>Breech presentation occurs in about three percent of labour (Campbell & Lees, 2000). Due to the high risks to both the mother and the baby, the present practice is to book all mothers with breech presentation for caesarean section. In breech presentation, the foetus lies with the buttocks in the lower pole of the uterus, after 34 weeks of pregnancy. There is no obvious reason as to why the foetus presents as breech at term but the following points are contributing factors:</p>

                    <p>The midwife refers the mother to a doctor at thirty two weeks if the breech presentation persists. An x-ray may be done should there be any doubts in diagnosis. It may reveal the following:</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-risks-skull-breech" class="subsubsection-heading">Risks to the skull</h5>
                    <p>The soft skull bones are damaged easily. A large skull may be trapped by the partially dilated cervix, which had allowed the other part of the baby to pass through. It is important to make sure the patient does not push prematurely. Use of sedatives can help to keep the mother calm.</p>
                    <h6>Intracranial haemorrhage</h6>
                    <p>This may occur due to rapid compression of the unmoulded skull. Venous congestion, which is caused by hypoxia, might occur. It may also result from the upward force of foetal blood into the intracranial venous sinuses,the sudden release of the head from the cervix and/or the quick extraction process. This is why it is important to inform the mother as soon as the condition is diagnosed that there may come a time when she will feel that the head is pushing out and she has the urge of pushing but she should plan to release the head slowly to prevent damage to the baby's head.</p>
                    <h6>Hypoxia</h6>
                    <p>This is caused by interference with the utero-placental circulation. You should not use fundal pressure if there is placental separation while the head is still in the vagina.</p>
                    <h6>Cord compression</h6>
                    <p>This is inevitable with a big baby, but you can assist by pulling a loop of cord after the baby is born up to the umbilicus and try to position it so that it is not nipped. When the cord is compressed, the foetus will be stimulated to prematurely breathe and inhale mucous or liquor which will cause asphyxia at birth and subsequent pneumonia.</p>
                    <h6>Injuries</h6>
                    <p>It is very easy for the baby to sustain fractures of the lower and upper limbs but you can prevent this by being competent in the delivery of extended legs. You can flex the knee and gradually pull it out. You may also use Lovset's manoeuvre and should know how to splint the upper arm and flex the elbow. Prevent rupture of the liver and spleen by holding the baby at the iliac crest with the thumbs at the sacrum. Avoid holding the baby at the kidney level to prevent damage to adrenals. Paralysis can occur due to crushing of the spinal cord. To prevent crushing the spinal cord you, should always check that the sub occipital area appears before you carry an upward traction.</p>

                    <h6>Descent</h6>
                    <p>This takes place with increasing compaction due to increased flexion of limbs.</p>
                    <h6>Internal Rotation of the Buttocks</h6>
                    <p>The anterior buttock reaches the pelvic floor first and rotates one eighth of a circle forwards along the right side of pelvis. The bitrochanteric diameter is now in the antero-posterior diameter of the outlet.</p>
                    <h6>Lateral Flexion of the Body</h6>
                    <p>The anterior buttock escapes under the symphysis pubis. The posterior buttock sweeps the perineum and the buttocks are born by a movement of lateral flexion.</p>
                    <h6>Restitution of the Buttock</h6>
                    <p>The anterior buttock turns slightly to the patient's right side.</p>
                    <h6>Internal Rotation of the Shoulders</h6>
                    <p>The shoulders enter in the same oblique diameter of the brim as the buttocks. The anterior shoulder rotates forwards one eighth of a circle along the right side of the pelvis and escapes under the symphysis pubis. The posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum and the shoulders are born.</p>
                    <h6>Internal Rotation of the Head</h6>
                    <p>The head enters in the transverse diameter of the pelvic brim. The occiput rotates along the left or right side of the pelvis. The sub-occipital region (nape of the neck) impinges under surface of the symphysis pubis.</p>
                    <h6>External Rotation of the Body</h6>
                    <p>The body turns so that the back is uppermost, a movement which accompanies internal rotation of the head.</p>
                    <h6>Birth of the Head</h6>
                    <p>The chin, face and sinciput sweep the perineum and the head is born in flexed attitude.</p>

                    <h6>Delivery of the head (The Burns Marshall method)</h6>
                    <p>The previous pages describe a routine complete breech delivery where the apgar score is usually about seven to eight. The breech delivery, however, may not always be this simple. This is supposed to be a doctor's procedure but many times you may have to perform it and perform it efficiently. Should you be called upon to assist in the management of extended legs, you should follow this procedure:</p>

                    <p>In a situation where you are called upon to aid with the delivery of the extended hands, you should apply the Lovset manoeuvre. This is a combination of rotation and downward traction to deliver the arms whatever position they are in. The direction of rotation must always bring the back uppermost. When the baby's umbilicus is born and shoulders are in antero-posterior diameter, grasp the baby by the iliac crest applying downward traction until the axilla is visible. Rotate the baby through half a circle 180° anticlockwise. One arm which is now anterior is delivered. Rotate the baby back 180° clockwise and the second shoulder is delivered in a similar manner. Please refer to Myles, Margaret Text book of Midwives for a complete demonstration of this process.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Take hold of the baby</h6>
                    <p>The position of the baby is Left Sacro-Anterior. During a contraction when the umbilicus is born and the shoulders are in the anteroposterior diameter, grasp the baby at the illiac crest with the thumbs over the sacrum. A small towel should be wrapped around the baby's waist to prevent it from being slippery.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-049-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how to take hold of the baby during Lovset manoeuvre for breech delivery." class="content-image">
                    
                    <h6>Rotate the baby</h6>
                    <p>Rotate the baby through half a circle, 180° anti-clockwise, (starting by turning the back upper most) while applying downwards traction until the axillar is visible. The hand that was posterior now becomes anterior, this movement sweeps the arm infront of the face and also allows the shoulders to enter the pelvis in the transverse diameter.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-049-2.jpg" alt="Diagram showing rotation of the baby during Lovset manoeuvre for breech delivery." class="content-image">
                    
                    <h6>Deliver the anterior arm</h6>
                    <p>The arm that was previously posterior is now anterior. With the two first fingers of your left hand (which is at the baby's back) splint the baby's humerous to avoid breaking it.</p>
                    <p>The elbow is drawn downwards and delivered under the pubic arch. Wait for the next contraction.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-050-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing delivery of the anterior arm during Lovset manoeuvre." class="content-image">
                    
                    <h6>Rotate the baby again</h6>
                    <p>Rotating the body half circle clockwise, make anterior arm posterior. Using the right hand, splint the humerous, draw it downwards and deliver it under the pubic arch. Repeat the next side and deliver the other hand.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_05_9cf3c7522d5c8047fd70g-051-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing further rotation of the baby to deliver the second arm in Lovset manoeuvre." class="content-image">
                    <p>It sounds easy, but you will agree that at times applying tractions can be a very arduous task. Now look at the diagram of how you will position your hands and fingers when performing the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit Manoeuvre (jaw flexion and shoulder traction). The following procedure should be followed when delivering the extended head:</p>

                    <h5 id="heading-s3-causes-delayed-breech" class="subsubsection-heading">Causes of Delayed Breech</h5>
                    <p>The following are some of the causes of delayed breech:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Delay in the first stage is rare, though it may be caused by impaction due to a large baby, a small pelvis or weak contractions in which case a caesarean section is done</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Delay during the second stage is usually caused by extended legs</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In terms of management, nothing should be done until the buttocks extend the perineum. At this point you should perform a medio-lateral episiotomy.</p>
                    <h6>Delay in the Birth of the Head</h6>
                    <p>If an insufficiently dilated cervix holds up the head, the baby will make gasping movements. You should mop the vaginal wall in contact with the baby's face and inserting two fingers make a channel through which you can meet the baby. If the head is arrested high in the cavity, disproportion may exist. Suprapubic pressure may help, but application of forceps is necessary. The doctor will use forceps for the delivery of the coming head.</p>
