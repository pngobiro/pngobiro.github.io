                    <p>Multiple pregnancy is a term applied when there is more than one foetus in the uterus. The incidence of multiple pregnancies is rare. It is estimated that twin conception occurs spontaneously once in 90 pregnancies, triplets once in 310,000 while quadruplets occur once in 700,000.</p>

                    <p>Twins may be binovular or uniovular. Binovular twins are developed from two separate ova, which may or may not come from the same ovary. Uniovular twins are developed from a single fertilised ovum, which undergoes division to form two embryos. Below is a comparison of the two types of twins.</p>

                    <p>A case of conjoined twins usually requires a cesarean section. At times separation of the conjoined twins is possible.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s1-version">Version</h3>
                    <p>This is turning the foetus from an undesirable position to a desirable position. The two types of version are external version and pondalic (or internal) version.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s1-external-version">External Version</h4>
                    <p>This is the external manipulation of the foetus through the abdomen and the uterine walls, used to correct malpresentation. The procedure is successful when done a month before term. Unfortunately, it is often felt that the foetus returns to its original position after a few hours. This procedure is outdated as caesarean section is recommended in malpresentations. It is now used by a midwife only in the delivery of the second twin in the case of transverse lie. External version is contraindicated in the case of antepartum haemorrhage, high blood pressure, rhesus negative mother, previous scars and twin pregnancy.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heading-s1-pondalic-version">Pondalic Version</h4>
                    <p>This is a manoeuvre designed to change any existing presentation to breech presentation. It is also known as internal version. This manoeuvre is useful in delivery of delayed or transverse second twin. It is now never used in any other circumstances. While the cervical os is fully dilated, the whole hand is introduced high in the uterus. The baby's feet are grasped and pulled in the direction of the birth canal. The other hand helps to turn the foetus by pushing the head up at the fundus. The version is followed by breech extraction.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="heading-s1-care-puerperium">Care During Puerperium</h3>
                    <p>For the mother with multiple births, involution is usually slow. The after pain is also often more troublesome. Care of the babies can be a major problem, so the mother should be initially helped with the feeding of the babies. Teach the mother how to feed so that she feels competent when discharged.
