                        <p>The emergency situations covered in this chapter are rare, but the communication and actions of the midwife are fundamental to the wellbeing of the woman, her baby and also her partner and family. Early detection of severe illness in childbearing women remains a challenge to all health professionals involved in their care. Awareness of local emergency procedures and knowledge of correct use of any supportive equipment are essential, and midwives in all practice settings must maintain skills that enable them to act appropriately in an emergency. The use of multiprofessional workshops to rehearse simulated situations can ensure that all members of the care team know exactly what is required when needed. Midwives need also to engage in reviews of practice to ensure that policies and protocols are regularly reviewed to incorporate best practice and current evidence.</p>

                        <p>The immediate management of the emergencies discussed in this chapter is dependent on the prompt action of the midwife. Recognition of the problem and the instigation of emergency measures may determine the outcome for the mother or the fetus. The midwife should remain calm and attempt to keep the woman and her partner fully informed to obtain her consent and cooperation for procedures that may be needed.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that pregnancy and labour are normal physiological events, however regular routine observations of vital signs must be an integral part of midwifery care. There is potential for pregnant women and those who have recently given birth to be at risk of physiological deterioration that is not always predicted or recognized (Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries [CMACE] 2011). To improve recognition of women who are unwell before they become critically ill the modified early obstetric warning score (MEOWS) chart should now be used (CMACE 2011).</p>
                        <p>All midwifery and medical staff must be updated on the signs and symptoms of critical illness from both obstetric and non-obstetric causes. Regular drills should be held to maintain and improve these skills. All staff should be trained in basic life support to a nationally recognized level and emergency drills for maternal resuscitation should be regularly practised in all maternity units (CMACE 2011; National Health Service Litigation Authority [NHSLA] 2011). Furthermore, effective communication between members of the multiprofessional team is essential to ensure the optimum outcome for the childbearing woman who becomes unwell and her baby (National Health Service [NHS] Institute for Innovation and Improvement 2008).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Health services are often criticized for poor communication among their staff, especially when the outcome does not go according to expectations. However, there are very few instruments that specifically focus on how to improve verbal communication. The SBAR: Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendations tool developed by the NHS Institute for Innovations and Improvements (2008) is a framework that midwives can use to develop critical clinical conversations that require immediate attention and action.</p>
                        <h3>Use of the SBAR tool</h3>
                        <p>The tool consists of standardized prompt questions about the condition of an individual in four stages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Situation</li>
                            <li>Background</li>
                            <li>Assessment</li>
                            <li>Recommendation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These prompts can assist the midwife to assertively and effectively share concise and focused information about a woman's condition, reducing repetition. The SBAR tool can be used in all clinical conversations: face-to face, by telephone or through collaborative multiprofessional team meetings.</p>
                        <p>In each of the following midwifery and obstetric emergencies, the use of the SBAR tool should be paramount in facilitating appropriate action that is always in the best interest of the woman and her baby.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-3" class="section-heading">VASA PRAEVIA</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The term vasa praevia is used when a fetal blood vessel lies over the cervical os, in front of the presenting part. This occurs when fetal vessels from a velamentous insertion of the cord or to a succenturiate lobe (Chapter 6) cross the area of the internal os to the placenta. The fetal life is at risk owing to the possibility of rupture of the vessels leading to exsanguination unless birth occurs within minutes. Good outcome depends on antenatal diagnosis and birth by caesarean section before the membranes rupture (Oyelese and Smulian 2006).</p>
                        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Vasa praevia may be diagnosed antenatally using ultrasound scan. Sometimes vasa praevia will be palpated on vaginal examination when the membranes are still intact. If it is suspected, a speculum examination should be made. Fresh vaginal bleeding, particularly if it commences at the same time as rupture of the membranes, may be due to ruptured vasa praevia. Fetal distress disproportionate to blood loss may be suggestive of vasa praevia.</p>
                        <h3>Management</h3>
                        <p>The midwife should call for urgent medical assistance. The fetal heart rate should be monitored via cardiotocograph (CTG). If the woman is in the first stage of labour and the fetus is still alive, an emergency caesarean section is carried out. If she is in the second stage of labour, the birth should be expedited such that the baby may be born vaginally. Caesarean section may be carried out but the mode of birth will be dependent on parity and fetal condition.</p>
                        <p>There is a high fetal mortality associated with this emergency and a paediatrician should therefore be present for the birth. If the baby is born in poor condition, resuscitation, urgent haemoglobin estimation and a blood transfusion with O-negative blood may be necessary.</p>

                            <h5>Cord presentation</h5>
                            <p>This occurs when the umbilical cord lies in front of the presenting part, with the fetal membranes still intact.</p>
                            <h5>Cord prolapse</h5>
                            <p>The cord lies in front of the presenting part and the fetal membranes are ruptured (see Fig. 22.1).</p>
                            <h5>Occult cord prolapse</h5>
                            <p>This is said to occur when the cord lies alongside, but not in front of, the presenting part.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3>Predisposing factors</h3>
                        <p>These are the same for both presentation and prolapse of the cord (for definitions see Box 22.1). Any situation where the presenting part is neither well applied to the cervix nor well down in the pelvis may make it possible for a loop of cord to slip down in front of the presenting part. Such situations include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>high or ill-fitting presenting part</li>
                            <li>high parity</li>
                            <li>prematurity</li>
                            <li>malpresentation</li>
                            <li>multiple pregnancy</li>
                            <li>hydramnios.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>(Lin 2006; Holbrook and Phelan 2013)</p>

                        <h4>High head</h4>
                        <p>If the membranes rupture spontaneously when the fetal head is high, a loop of cord is able to pass between the uterine wall and the fetus resulting in its lying in front of the presenting part. As the presenting part descends, the cord becomes trapped and occluded.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Multiparity</h4>
                        <p>The presenting part may not be engaged when the membranes rupture and malpresentation is more common.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Prematurity</h4>
                        <p>The smaller size of the fetus in relation to the pelvis and the uterus allows the cord to prolapse. Babies of very low birth weight (<1500 g) are particularly vulnerable (Lin 2006; Holbrook and Phelan 2013).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Malpresentation</h4>
                        <p>Cord prolapse is associated with breech presentation, especially complete or footling breech. This relates to the ill-fitting nature of the presenting parts and also the proximity of the umbilicus to the buttocks. In this situation, the degree of compression may be less than with a cephalic presentation, but there is still a danger of asphyxia.</p>
                        <p>Shoulder and compound presentation and transverse lie (Chapter 20) carry a high risk of prolapse of the cord, occurring with spontaneous rupture of the membranes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Multiple pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>Malpresentation, particularly of the second twin, is more common in multiple pregnancy with the consequences of possible cord prolapse.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hydramnios</h4>
                        <p>The cord is liable to be swept down in a gush of liquor if the membranes rupture spontaneously. Controlled release of liquor during artificial rupture of the membranes is sometimes performed to try to prevent this.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cord presentation</h3>
                        <p>This is diagnosed on vaginal examination when the cord is felt behind intact membranes. It may be associated with aberrations found during fetal heart monitoring such as decelerations, which occur if the cord becomes compressed.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <p>Under no circumstances should the membranes be ruptured. The midwife should discontinue the vaginal examination, in order to reduce the risk of rupturing the membranes. Medical aid should be summoned. To assess fetal wellbeing, continuous electronic fetal monitoring should be commenced or the fetal heart should be auscultated as frequently as possible. The woman should be assisted into a position that will reduce the likelihood of cord compression. Unless birth is imminent, caesarean section is the most likely outcome.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cord prolapse</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>Whenever there are factors present that predispose to cord prolapse (Fig. 22.1), a vaginal examination should be performed immediately on spontaneous rupture of the membranes.</p>

                        <p>Bradycardia and variable or prolonged decelerations of the fetal heart are associated with cord compression, which may be caused by cord prolapse. The diagnosis of cord prolapse is made when the cord is felt below or beside the presenting part on vaginal examination. The cord may be felt in the vagina or in the cervical os or a loop of cord may be visible at the vulva (Lin 2006).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Immediate action</h4>
                        <p>Where the diagnosis of cord prolapse is made, the time should be noted and the midwife must call for urgent assistance. The midwife should explain to the woman and her birth partner her findings and any emergency measures that may be needed. If an oxytocin infusion is in progress this should be discontinued. If the cord lies outside the vagina, then it should be gently replaced to prevent spasm, to maintain temperature and prevent drying. Administering oxygen to the woman by face mask at 4 l/min may improve fetal oxygenation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Relieving pressure on the cord</h4>
                        <p>The risks to the fetus are hypoxia and death as a result of cord compression. The risks are greatest with prematurity and low birth weight (Holbrook and Phelan 2013). The midwife may need to keep her fingers in the vagina and hold the presenting part off the umbilical cord, especially during a contraction. The woman can be supported to change position and further reduce pressure on the cord. If the woman raises her pelvis and buttocks or adopts the knee-chest position, the fetus will be encouraged to gravitate towards the diaphragm (Fig. 22.2). The foot of the bed may also be raised (Trendelenburg position) to relieve compression on the cord. Alternatively, the woman can be helped to lie on her left side, with a wedge or pillow elevating her hips (exaggerated Sims' position) (Fig. 22.3). There is some evidence to suggest that bladder filling may also be an effective technique for managing cord prolapse (Houghton 2006; Bord et al 2011). A self-retaining 16G Foley catheter is used to instill approximately 500-700 ml of sterile saline into the bladder. The full bladder can relieve compression of the cord by elevating the presenting part about 2 cm above the ischial spines until birth by caesarean section. The bladder would be drained in theatre immediately before the caesarean section commences.</p>
                        <p>Birth must be expedited with the greatest possible speed to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with this emergency. Caesarean section is the treatment of choice in those instances where the fetus is still alive and vaginal birth is not imminent.</p>
                        <p>If a cord prolapse is diagnosed in the second stage of labour, with a multigravida, the midwife may perform an episiotomy to expedite the birth. Where the presentation is cephalic, assisted birth may be achieved through ventouse or forceps (Chapter 21).</p>
                        <p>If a cord prolapse occurs in the community setting, emergency transfer to a consultant-led maternity unit is essential. The midwife should carry out the same procedures to relieve the compression on the cord. Senior obstetric and anaesthetic staff should be informed and be prepared to perform an emergency caesarean section. An experienced paediatrician should be available to resuscitate the baby, should it be born alive.</p>
