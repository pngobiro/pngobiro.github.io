                        <p>This chapter discusses the development of the placenta - a complex organ, deriving from two separate individuals, the mother and the fetus (Tortora and Derrickson 2011). It is formed from the merging of the chorion and the allantois (see Chapter 5) in early pregnancy (Rampersad et al 2011). The process of forming a placenta (known as placentation) involves prevention of immune rejection, transfer of nutrients and waste products and the secretion of hormones to maintain the pregnancy. In addition, the chapter includes details of anatomical variations of the placenta and umbilical cord, highlighting their significance to midwifery practice.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Within a few days of fertilization, the trophoblasts (see Chapter 5) begin to produce human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), ensuring that the endometrium will be receptive to the implanting embryo. The endometrium increases in vascularity and undergoes a series of structural changes in a process known as decidualization in preparation for implantation; hence the endometrium is referred to as the decidua in pregnancy. Interconnecting arteriovenous shunts form between the maternal spiral arteries and veins which persist into the immediate postpartum period. A reduction of the number of shunts leading to narrower uterine arteries is involved with complications of pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia (Burton et al 2009).</p>
                        <p>The decidua has regions named according to its relationship to the implantation site:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>decidua basalis</strong> lies between the developing embryo and the stratum basalis of the uterus at the implantation site.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>decidua capsularis</strong> covers the developing embryo separating it from the uterine cavity.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>decidua vera</strong> (otherwise known as the decidua parietalis) lines the remainder of the uterine cavity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Uterine glands secrete nutrients such as glycogen, to maintain the developing conceptus until the intraplacental blood flow is fully developed, some 10-12 weeks later (Burton et al 2002).</p>
                        <p>In pregnancy a sophisticated immune adaptation occurs to prevent rejection of the fetus. The decidua is invaded by macrophages, which become immunosuppressive. Adapted T-regulator cells, known as Tregs, become less effective as part of the specific hormonal response to antigens and the effect of natural killer (NK) cells is reduced such that their cytotoxicity becomes impaired and they are less likely to destroy any foreign cells.</p>
                        <p>Microchimerism is the term for the presence of a small number of cells in one individual that originated in a different individual. Some fetal cells actively move into the mother’s circulation, tissues and organs in the first trimester of pregnancy without triggering an immune response. The role of these cells in maternal systems is unclear. They could have an immunosuppressant effect to protect the fetus and they also can facilitate growth and repair in maternal systems.</p>
                        <h3>Implantation</h3>
                        <p>Implantation involves two stages: prelacunar and lacunar.</p>
                        <h4>Prelacunar stage</h4>
                        <p>Seven days post conception the blastocyst makes contact with the decidua (apposition) and the process of placentation begins (Fig. 6.1). The process of implantation is extremely aggressive: chemical mediators, prostaglandins and proteolytic enzymes are released by both the decidua and the trophoblasts and maternal connective tissue is invaded. Nearby maternal blood vessels ensure there is optimum blood flow to the placenta. At this stage the cytotrophoblasts form a double layer and further differentiate into various types of syncytiotrophoblasts. The supply of syncytiotrophoblasts is as a result of continued mitotic proliferation of the cytotrophoblastic layer below.</p>
                        <h4>Lacunar stage</h4>
                        <p>Increasing numbers of syncytiotrophoblasts surround the blastocyst and small lakes form within these cells known as lacunae, which will become the intervillous spaces between the villi (Fig. 6.2) and will be bathed in blood as maternal spiral arteries are eroded some 10-12 weeks following conception. Prior to this the embryo is nourished from uterine glands (see Chapter 5).</p>
                        <p>The trophoblasts have a potent invasive capacity, which if left unchecked would spread throughout the uterus. This potential is moderated by the decidua, which secretes cytokines and protease inhibitors that modulate trophoblastic invasion. The layer of Nitabusch is a collaginous layer between the endometrium and myometrium which assists in preventing invasion further than the decidua. Trophoblastic invasion into the myometrium can give rise to a morbidly adhered placenta, known as placenta accreta (see Chapter 18).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h3>The chorionic villous tree</h3>
                        <p>Chorionic villi are finger-like projections of chorion surrounded by cytotrophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic layers. Initially new blood vessels develop from progenitor cells within the chorionic villi of the placenta (known as vasculogenesis). A relatively low level of oxygen promotes this. Further growth of these vessels (angiogenesis) produces a vascular network that ultimately connects with those blood vessels developed independently in the embryo via the umbilical arteries and vein through the connecting stalk.</p>
                        <p>The villi proliferate and branch out approximately three weeks after fertilization. Over time the villi can differentiate and specialize, resulting in different functions. Villi become most profuse in the area where the blood supply is richest, the decidua basalis. This part of the trophoblastic layer, which is known as the chorion frondosum, eventually develops into the placenta. The villi under the decidua capsularis gradually degenerate due to lack of nutrition, forming the chorion laeve, which is the origin of the chorionic membrane (Fig. 6.3). As the fetus enlarges and grows, the decidua capsularis is pushed towards the decidua vera on the opposite wall of the uterus until, at about 27 weeks of gestation, the decidua capsularis subsequently disappears.</p>
                        <p>The syncytiotrophoblasts surrounding the villi erode the walls of maternal vessels as they penetrate the lower myometrium, opening them up into a funnel shape, forming a lake of maternal blood in which the villi float. This opening up reduces the velocity at which maternal blood enters the central cavity of the cotyledon (lobule) and villous tree (Burton et al 2009). The maternal blood circulates, enabling the villi to absorb nutrients and oxygen and to excrete waste. These are known as the nutritive villi. A few villi are more deeply attached to the decidua and are called anchoring villi.</p>
                        <p>Each chorionic villus is a branching structure like a tree arising from one stem. Its centre consists of mesoderm and fetal blood vessels, as well as branches of the umbilical artery and vein. These are covered by a single layer of cytotrophoblast cells and the external layer of the villus is the syncytiotrophoblast (see Fig. 6.2). This means that four layers of tissue separate the maternal blood from the fetal blood making it impossible for the two circulations to mix unless any villi are damaged.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">THE PLACENTA AT TERM</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>At term the placenta is discoid in shape, about 20 cm in diameter and 2.5 cm thick at its centre and weighing approximately 470 g , which is directly proportional to the weight of the fetus. Rampersad et al (2011) state that, by term, the ratio of fetal size to that of the placenta is about 7 to 1. Placental pathology and maternal disease can affect this ratio: such sequelae being diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (see Chapter 13). The weight of the placenta may be affected by physiological or active management of the third stage of labour owing to the varying amounts of fetal blood retained in the vessels. The placenta is no longer routinely weighed in clinical practice; however some maternity units may do so as part of clinical trials and research activities.</p>
                        <p>The maternal surface of the placenta (i.e. the basal plate) is dark red in colour due to maternal blood and partial separation of the basal decidua (Fig. 6.4A). The surface is arranged in up to 40 cotyledons (lobes), which are separated by sulci (furrows), into which the decidua dips down to form septa (walls). The cotyledons are made up of lobules, each of which contains a single villus with its branches. Sometimes deposits of lime salts may be present on the surface, making it slightly gritty. This has no clinical significance.</p>
                        <p>The fetal surface of the placenta (i.e. the chorionic plate) has a shiny appearance due to the amnion covering it (Fig. 6.4 B ). Branches of the umbilical vein and arteries are visible, spreading out from the insertion of the umbilical cord, which is normally in the centre. The amnion can be peeled off the surface of the chorion as far back as the umbilical cord, whereas the chorion, being derived from the same trophoblastic layer as the placenta, cannot be separated from it.</p>

                        <h3>Functions</h3>
                        <p>The placenta performs a variety of functions for the developing fetus which can be determined by the pneumonic SERPENT (Fig. 6.5).</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>Storage</h4>
                        <p>The placenta metabolizes glucose, stores it in the form of glycogen and reconverts it to glucose as required. It can also store iron and the fat-soluble vitamins.</p>
                        <h4>Endocrine</h4>
                        <p>The many and varied endocrine functions of the placenta are complex, requiring maternal and fetal input. Both types of trophoblasts produce steroidal hormones (oestrogens and progesterone) in addition to many placental protein hormones necessary for pregnancy (Kay et al 2011).</p>
                        <h5>Steroid hormones</h5>
                        <p>There are three important oestrogens: oestrone, oestradiol and oestriol. Both maternal and fetal adrenal production provide precursors for oestrogen production by the placenta. Pregnalone sulphate is converted to oestriol by the feto-placental unit from 6 to 12 weeks onwards, rising steadily until term. Oestrogens influence uterine blood flow, enhance ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein synthesis and aid growth of uterine muscle. They also increase the size and mobility of the maternal nipple and cause alveolar and duct development of the breast tissue. Serial serum (mmol/l) oestriol measurements can indicate the level of feto-placental wellbeing.</p>
                        <p>Progesterone production is maintained by the corpus luteum for approximately 8 weeks until the placenta takes over this function and is dependent on maternal cholesterol stores. Progesterone is thought to play an important part in immunosuppression to maintain the pregnancy (Kay et al 2011). Progesterone is produced in the syncytial layer of the placenta in increasing quantities until immediately before the onset of labour when its level falls. It maintains the myometrium in a quiescent state, during pregnancy. It is involved in preparing breast tissue during pregnancy and when levels reduce after birth of the placenta, prolactin stimulates lactation.</p>
                        <h5>Protein hormones</h5>
                        <p><strong>Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)</strong> is produced under the influence of placental gonadotrophic releasing hormone (GnRH) by the trophoblasts. Initially it is present in very large quantities, with peak levels being achieved between the 7th and 10th week, but these gradually reduce as the pregnancy advances. The function of hCG is to stimulate the corpus luteum to produce mainly progesterone. It also increases fetal leydig cells to affect male sexual development prior to fetal luteinizing hormone (LH) production (Kay et al 2011). Human chorionic gonadotrophin forms the basis of the many pregnancy tests available, as it is excreted in the mother’s urine.</p>
                        <p><strong>Human placental lactogen (hPL)</strong> is sometimes known as human chorionic somatomammotropin hormone (hCS) as it not only stimulates somatic growth but also stimulates proliferation of breast tissue in preparation for lactation. In early pregnancy, HPL stimulates food intake and weight gain, mobilizing free fatty acids, and functions with prolactin to increase circulating insulin levels (Barbour et al 2007; Kay et al 2011). Human placental lactogen is no longer considered the primary agent of insulin resistance as other growth hormones, such as human placental growth hormone (hPGH), appear to be the main determinants for this. Levels of hPL have been used as a screening tool in pregnancy to assess placental function.</p>
                        <p><strong>Human placental growth hormone (hPGH)</strong> levels rise throughout pregnancy. This hormone is involved with hPL as a determinant of insulin resistance in late pregnancy. It mobilizes maternal glucose for transfer to the fetus and contributes to lipolysis, lactogenesis and fetal growth.</p>
                        <p>There are also many other factors, such as insulin growth factor (IGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), playing a variety of roles in metabolism, growth, vasculogenesis and regulation of utero-placental blood flow.</p>
                        <h4>Respiration</h4>
                        <p>Gaseous exchange to and from the fetus occurs as a result of diffusion. Transfer of gases is assisted by a slight maternal respiratory alkalosis in pregnancy. The fetal haemoglobin level is high in utero to facilitate transport of gases. The fetal haemoglobin also has a high affinity for oxygen.</p>
                        <h4>Protection</h4>
                        <p>The placenta provides a limited barrier to infection. Few bacteria can penetrate with the exception of the treponema of syphilis and the tubercle bacillus. However, many types of virus can penetrate the placental barrier, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis strains, Parvo virus B19, human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and rubella. In addition to this, some parasitic and protozoal diseases, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis, will cross the placenta.</p>
                        <p>The placenta filters substances of a high molecular weight therefore some drugs and medicines may transfer to the fetus. Although such drugs will cross the placental barrier to the fetus, many will be harmless, and others, such as antibiotics administered to a pregnant woman with syphilis, are positively beneficial (see Chapter 13). Substances including alcohol and some chemicals associated with smoking cigarettes and recreational drug use are not filtered out. These substances can cross the placental barrier freely and may cause congenital malformations and subsequent problems for the baby.</p>
                        <p>Immunoglobulins will be passed from mother to fetus transplacentally in late pregnancy, providing about $6-12$ weeks’ naturally acquired passive immunity to the baby.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Rhesus disease, if sensitization occurs and fetal blood cells enter the maternal circulation, responding antibodies produced by the mother may cross the placenta and destroy fetal surface antigens and consequently fetal cells, causing haemolysis, hydrops fetalis and potential fetal demise.</p>
                        <h4>Excretion</h4>
                        <p>The main substance excreted from the fetus is carbon dioxide. Bilirubin will also be excreted as red blood cells are replaced relatively frequently. There is very little tissue breakdown apart from this and the amounts of urea and uric acid excreted are very small.</p>
                        <h4>Nutrition</h4>
                        <p>The fetus requires nutrients for its ongoing development, such as amino acids and glucose which are required for growth and energy, calcium and phosphorus for bones and teeth, and iron and other minerals for blood formation. These nutrients are actively transferred from the maternal to the fetal blood through the walls of the villi. The placenta is able to select those substances required by the fetus, even depleting the mother’s own supply in some instances. Water, vitamins and minerals also pass to the fetus. Fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D and E) cross the placenta only with difficulty and mainly in the later stages of pregnancy. Some substances, including amino acids, are found at higher levels in the fetal blood than in the maternal blood.</p>

                        <h4>Transfer of substances</h4>
                        <p>Substances transfer to and from the fetus by a variety of transport mechanisms, as stated below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Simple diffusion</strong> of gases and lipid soluble substances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water pores</strong> transfer water-soluble substances as a result of osmotic and potentially hydrostatic forces.</li>
                            <li><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong> of glucose using carrier proteins.</li>
                            <li><strong>Active transport</strong> against concentration gradients of ions, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P).</li>
                            <li><strong>Endocytosis (pinocytosis)</strong> of macromolecules.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Placental circulation</h3>
                        <p>Invading trophoblasts modify maternal spiral arterioles to accommodate a 10-fold increase in blood flow where there is open circulation around the chorionic villi. Maternal blood is discharged in a pulsatile fashion into the intervillous space by 80-100 spiral arteries in the decidua basalis after 10-12 weeks of gestation. The blood flows slowly around the villi, eventually returning to the endometrial veins and the maternal circulation. There are about 150 ml of maternal blood in the intervillous spaces, which is exchanged three or four times per minute.</p>
                        <p>Fetal blood, which is low in oxygen, is pumped by the fetal heart towards the placenta along the umbilical arteries and transported along their branches to the capillaries of the chorionic villi where exchange of nutrients takes place between the mother and fetus. Having yielded carbon dioxide and waste products and absorbed oxygen and nutrients, the blood is returned to the fetus via the umbilical vein (Fig. 6.6).</p>

                         <span class="heading-icon"> </span>
                        <span class="heading-text">The membranes</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The basal and chorionic plates come together and meet at the edges to form the chorioamnion membrane where the amniotic fluid is contained. The chorioamnion membrane is composed of two membranes: the amnion and the chorion.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>amnion</strong> is the inner membrane derived from the inner cell mass and consists of a single layer of epithelium with a connective tissue base. It is a tough, smooth and translucent membrane, continuous with the outer surface of the umbilical cord which moves over the chorion aided by mucous. The amnion contains amniotic fluid, which it produces in small quantities as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which plays a role in the initiation of labour. In rare instances, the amnion can rupture, causing amniotic bands that can affect the growth of fetal limbs.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>chorion</strong>, which is the outer membrane that is continuous with the edge of the placenta, is composed of mesenchyme, cytotrophoblasts and vessels from the extended spiral arteries of the decidua basalis. It is a rough, thick, fibrous, opaque membrane which lines the decidua vera during pregnancy, although loosely attached. It produces enzymes that can reduce progesterone levels and also produces prostaglandins, oxytocin and plateletactivating factor which stimulate uterine activity. This membrane is friable and can rupture easily, so it can be retained in the uterus following birth.</p>
                        <h3>Amniotic fluid</h3>
                        <p>Amniotic fluid is a clear alkaline and slightly yellowish liquid contained within the amniotic sac. It is derived essentially from the maternal circulation across the placental membranes and exuded from the fetal surface. The fetus contributes to the amniotic fluid through metabolism in small quantities of urine and fluid from its lungs. This fluid is returned to the fetus by intramembranous flow across the amnion into the fetal vessels and through the mechanism of the fetus swallowing.</p>
                        <h4>Functions of the amniotic fluid</h4>
                        <p>Amniotic fluid distends the amniotic sac allowing for the growth and free movement of the fetus and permitting symmetrical musculoskeletal development. It equalizes pressure and protects the fetus from jarring and injury. The fluid maintains a constant intrauterine temperature, protecting the fetus from heat loss and providing it with small quantities of nutrients. In labour, as long as the membranes remain intact the amniotic fluid protects the placenta and umbilical cord from the pressure of uterine contractions. It also aids effacement of the cervix and dilatation of the uterine os, particularly where the presenting part is poorly applied.</p>
                        <h4>Constituents of the amniotic fluid</h4>
                        <p>Amniotic fluid consists of $99\%$ water with the remaining $1\%$ being dissolved solid matter including food substances and waste products. In addition, the fetus sheds skin cells, vernix caseosa and lanugo into the fluid. Abnormal constituents of the liquor, such as meconium in the case of fetal compromise, may give valuable diagnostic information about the condition of the fetus. Aspiration of amniotic fluid for diagnostic examination is termed amniocentesis.</p>
                        <p>Research has found that amniotic fluid is a plentiful source of non-embryonic stem cells (De Coppi et al 2007). These cells have demonstrated the ability to differentiate into a number of different cell-types, including brain, liver and bone.</p>
                        <h4>Volume of amniotic fluid</h4>
                        <p>During pregnancy, amniotic fluid increases in volume as the fetus grows: from 20 ml at 10 weeks to approximately 500 ml at term.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The umbilical cord, which extends from the fetal surface of the placenta to the umbilical area of the fetus, is formed by the 5th week of pregnancy. It originates from the duct that forms between the amniotic sac and the yolk sac, which transmits the umbilical blood vessels (see Chapter 5).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_28_c51b551507f57ce861a5g-126-1.jpg" alt="A cross-section through the umbilical cord showing two arteries and one vein surrounded by Wharton's jelly." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <h3>Functions</h3>
                        <p>The umbilical cord transports oxygen and nutrients to the developing fetus, and removes waste products.</p>
                        <h3>Structure</h3>
                        <p>The umbilical cord contains two arteries and one vein (Fig. 6.7), which are continuous with the blood vessels in the chorionic villi of the placenta. The blood vessels are enclosed and protected by Wharton’s jelly, a gelatinous substance formed from primary mesoderm. The whole cord is covered in a layer of amnion that is continuous with that covering the placenta. There are no nerves in the umbilical cord, so cutting it following the birth of the baby is not painful.</p>
                        <p>The presence of only two vessels in the cord may indicate renal malformations in the fetus; however, in some instances this has little significance to the subsequent health of the baby.</p>
                        <h3>Measurements</h3>
                        <p>The cord is approximately $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ in diameter and 50 cm in length. This length is sufficient to allow for the birth of the baby without applying any traction to the placenta.</p>
                        <p>A cord is considered short when it measures <40 cm. There is no specific agreed length for describing a cord as too long, but the disadvantages of a very long cord are that it may become wrapped round the neck or body of the fetus or become knotted. Either event could result in occlusion of the blood vessels, especially during labour.</p>
                        <p>Compromise of the fetal blood flow through the umbilical cord vessels can have serious detrimental effects on the health of the fetus and baby. True knots should always be noted on examination of the cord, but they must be distinguished from false knots, which are lumps of Wharton’s jelly on the side of the cord and do not have any physiological significance.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A <strong>succenturiate lobe of placenta</strong> is the most significant of the variations in conformation of the placenta. A small extra lobe is present that is separate from the main placenta, and joined to it by blood vessels that run through the membranes to connect it (Fig. 6.8). The danger is that this small lobe may be retained in utero after the placenta is expelled, and if it is not removed, it may lead to haemorrhage and infection. Every placenta must be examined for evidence of a retained succenturiate lobe, which can be identified by a hole in the membranes with vessels running to it.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <p>In a <strong>circumvallate placenta</strong>, an opaque ring is seen on the fetal surface of the placenta. It is formed by a doubling back of the fetal membrane onto the fetal surface of the placenta and may result in the membranes leaving the placenta nearer the centre instead of at the edge as usual (Fig. 6.9). This placental variation is associated with placental abruptio and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).</p>

                        <p>In a <strong>bipartite placenta</strong>, there are two complete and separate lobes where the main cord bifurcates to supply both parts (Fig. 6.10). A tripartite placenta is similar to a bipartite placenta but it has three distinct parts.</p>

                        <p>In a <strong>battledore insertion of the cord</strong>, the cord is attached at the very edge of the placenta, and where the attachment is fragile it may cause significant problems with active management of the third stage of labour (Fig. 6.11).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_28_c51b551507f57ce861a5g-127-4.jpg" alt="A diagram showing a battledore insertion of the umbilical cord, where it is attached to the very edge of the placenta." class="content-image">

                        <p>A <strong>velamentous insertion of the cord</strong>, occurs when the cord is inserted into the membranes some distance from the edge of the placenta. The umbilical vessels run through the membranes from the cord to the placenta (Fig. 6.12). If the placenta is normally situated, no harm will result to the fetus, but the cord is likely to become detached upon applying traction during active management of the third stage of labour. However, if the placenta is low-lying, the vessels may pass across the uterine os (vasa praevia). In this case, there is great danger to the fetus when the membranes rupture and even more so during artificial rupture of the membranes, as the vessels may be torn, leading to rapid exsanguination of the fetus. If the onset of haemorrhage coincides with rupture of the membranes, fetal haemorrhage should be assumed and the birth expedited. It is possible to distinguish fetal blood from maternal blood by Singer’s alkali-denaturation test, although, in practice, time is so short that it may not be possible to save the life of the baby. If the baby survives, haemoglobin levels should be estimated after birth and blood transfusion considered.</p>
