                        <p>In the United Kingdom (UK) midwives are encouraged to broaden their toolkit of skills and knowledge in an effort to strengthen their public health remit and leadership potential in order to work collaboratively with women as equal partners in their care. Midwifery 2020 (Department of Health [DH] 2010a) outlines the future vision for midwifery. This initiative is a unique UK-wide collaborative programme where the four countries of Great Britain share a common purpose and ideology that can benchmark their midwifery planning and provision. It is envisaged that each country will be able to identify their own priorities to deliver care that is woman-centred, safe and fulfilling within existing resources. There are parallels here to be drawn with wider global initiatives such as the United Nations [UN] (2010, 2013) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM 2011) international definition of the midwife.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Globalization and internationalization against the background of midwifery practice are difficult terms to define, compounded by the fact that the terms are often used interchangeably and synonymously, even though they are construed as distinctly separate entities. Globalization is not a new phenomenon (Baumann and Blythe 2008) with a number of varying definitions evident in the literature. The definition with the greatest resonance for midwives is that provided by the World Health Organization (2013), who states that globalization is:</p>
                        <blockquote>the increased interconnectedness and interdependence of people and countries, is generally understood to include two interrelated elements: the opening of borders to increasingly fast flows of goods, services, finance, people and ideas across international borders; and the changes in institutional and policy regimes at the international and national levels that facilitates or promote such flows.</blockquote>
                        <p>Globalization is not without its critics but it is acknowledged that the consequences of globalization are not predetermined and can have both positive and negative outcomes (Baumann and Blythe 2008). It is essential therefore to have an awareness of both the good and harm globalization may impose on a society.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, internationalization has no agreed definition but from a midwifery perspective it can be defined as the international process of planning and implementing midwifery education and services in order that there is a shared vision that can easily be translated or adapted to meet the local and national needs of individual nations in both resource-rich and resource-poor countries.</p>
                        <p>Internationalization is important for the midwifery profession because in a global society midwives are required to have a broad understanding of cross-cultural issues. They need to be flexible and adaptable in order to provide care that is sensitive and responsive to women’s dynamic healthcare needs. This requires the midwife to be an effective change agent, and the onus is very much on the midwife to keep pace with change. This means having a good comprehension of internationalization, learning to deal with uncertainty, embracing the ethos of life-long learning as well as the gains and challenges of interprofessional or multidisciplinary collaboration, contributing to quality assurance issues such as audit, research, risk assessment and the wider clinical governance agenda. Even though skills of problem-solving, clinical judgement, decision-making and clinical competence in the practical assessment, planning, implementation, evaluation and documentation of care are all crucial for midwifery practice, human factors also matter. In England, the Francis Report (Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry 2013) was the outcome of a public inquiry into failings at Mid Staffordshire and relevant regulatory bodies. It represents a watershed moment in the history of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The scale of the problems highlighted by the report relates to the unusually high death rates amongst the sick and vulnerable at Mid Staffordshire in the late 2000s. The key lessons learnt convey the importance of transparent, compassionate, committed, competent and confident caring premised on strong leadership. It can be argued therefore that common standards and a shared vision established through global initiatives such as the MDGs and the ICM definition of a midwife are essential for midwives working within a global community. Not least because there is a strong correlation between outcomes for mothers and babies and the specific professional competencies the midwife possesses.</p>
                        <h3>Definition and scope of the midwife</h3>
                        <p>Midwives should be informed about the legal framework in which their role and scope of practice are enshrined. A definition of the midwife was developed by the ICM in 1972, which was later adopted by the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) followed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 1990, at the Kobe Council meeting, the ICM amended the definition, later ratified in 1991 and 1992 by FIGO and WHO respectively. In 2005 and 2011 it was amended slightly by the ICM Council (Box 1.1).</p>
                        <p>At the European level, member states of the EU (known at the time as the European Community [EC]) prepared a list of activities (Box 1.2) that midwives should be entitled to take up within its territory (EC Midwives Directive 1980; WHO 2009). Although midwives must learn about all of these activities, in the UK, where there is skilled medical care available to all pregnant women, it is recognized that it is highly unlikely that midwives would be expected to be proficient in all the activities identified by the EU. The manual removal of the placenta, for example, would routinely be carried out by a doctor unless no doctor is available and the mother’s life is at risk.</p>
                        <h3>The ICM Global Midwifery Education Standards</h3>
                        <p>The ICM acknowledges that all midwifery programmes should be accountable to the public, mothers and their families, the profession, employers, students as well as one another. It is therefore the responsibility of the provider education institution to ensure that the undergraduate or preregistration curricula they provide have a stated philosophy, transparent, realistic, achievable goals and outcomes that prepare students to be fully qualified competent and autonomous midwives. The Global Standards for Midwifery Education 2010 as developed, outlined and amended by the ICM (2013) are deemed as the mainstays to strengthen midwifery education and practice. These standards, outlined in Box 1.3, were developed alongside two further documents: Companion Guidelines and Glossary, which are all available on the ICM website. In order to meet the needs of childbearing women and their families, the ICM (2013) highlights that these publications are ‘living’ documents subjected to continual scrutiny, evaluation and amendment as new evidence regarding midwifery education and practice unfolds. Therefore it is recommended by the ICM (2013) that all three documents should be reviewed together in the following order: the Glossary followed by the Global Standards for Education and concluding with the Companion Guidelines.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 1.1 An International definition of the midwife</h4>
                            <p>A midwife is a person who has successfully completed a midwifery education programme that is duly recognized in the country where it is located and that is based on the ICM Essential Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practice and the framework of the ICM Global Standards for Midwifery Education; who has acquired the requisite qualifications to be registered and/or legally licensed to practice midwifery and use the title 'midwife'; and who demonstrates competency in the practice of midwifery.</p>
                            <h4>Scope of practice</h4>
                            <p>The midwife is recognized as a responsible and accountable professional who works in partnership with women to give the necessary support, care and advice during pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period, to conduct births on the midwife’s own responsibility and to provide care for the newborn and the infant. This care includes preventative measures, the promotion of normal birth, the detection of complications in mother and child, the accessing of medical care or other appropriate assistance and the carrying out of emergency measures. The midwife has an important task in health counselling and education, not only for the woman, but also within the family and the community. This work should involve antenatal education and preparation for parenthood and may extend to women’s health, sexual or reproductive health and child care. A midwife may practice in any setting including the home, community, hospitals, clinics or health units.</p>

                        </aside>
                        
                        <p>The purpose of the ICM (2013) global education standards is to establish benchmarks so that internationally all countries, with or without such standards, can educate and train midwives to be competent and autonomous practitioners who are equipped to work within global norms. Additionally, it is envisaged that not only can the standards be expanded to meet the needs of individual countries but they can be achieved within the context of these individual countries’ norms and cultural mores, thus embracing the whole ethos of globalization previously outlined. The core aims of the ICM (2013) Global Standards for Midwifery Education are three-fold:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Essentially, to assist countries that do not have robust training programme(s) but are striving to meet the country’s needs for outputs of qualified midwives to establish basic midwifery.</li>
                            <li>To support countries striving to improve and/or standardize the quality of their midwifery programme(s), ensuring that midwives are fit for both practice and purpose.</li>
                            <li>Offer a framework to countries with established programme(s) for midwifery education who may wish to compare the quality of their existing standards of midwifery education against the ICM minimum standards. This can be achieved during the design, implementation and evaluation of the ongoing quality of the midwifery programme.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The ICM expects that the global standards for midwifery education outlined in Box 1.3 will be adopted by all those with a vested interest in the health and wellbeing of mothers, babies and their families. This requires engagement from policy-makers, governments/health ministers, midwives and wider healthcare systems. The standards not only promote an education process that prepares midwives with all the essential ICM competencies, it also supports the philosophy of life-long learning through continuing education. This approach it is hoped will foster and promote safe midwifery practice alongside quality and evidence-based care. A further goal is to strengthen and reinforce the autonomy of the midwifery profession as well as uphold the virtue of midwives as well-informed, reflective and autonomous practitioners.</p>
                        <p>To ensure students are educated and prepared to be responsible global citizens, Tuckett and Crompton (2013) stress that undergraduate programmes for student nurses and midwives should expose learners to global health systems within a culturally diverse society. Maclean (2013) concurs with this view, highlighting that global health issues are much more mainstream in contemporary midwifery practice as a direct consequence of elective placements abroad. Elective placements enable students from high-income countries to gain an invaluable insight into the health challenges faced by resource-poor countries. Furthermore, the importance of global strides to reduce disadvantages and health inequalities, such as Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 (see below), and the principles on which the safe motherhood initiative is based, have greater significance when students have first-hand experience of the struggles encountered on a daily basis by those who are socially and economically disadvantaged.</p>
                        <h3>The ERASMUS programme</h3>
                        <p>ERASMUS is an acronym for EuRopean Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students. Salient aspects of globalization have led to this initiative in Europe, incepted in 1987 to allow international mobility for university student exchange between European countries (Papatsiba 2006). Milne and Cowie (2013) extol the virtues of the ERASMUS scheme in preparing the future generation of healthcare professionals to provide culturally diverse and competent care. However, for a multiplicity of reasons, only a minority of students undertake the ERASMUS exchange.</p>
                        <h3>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</h3>
                        <p>Despite its detractors, globalization has resulted in a rich tapestry of skills, knowledge and research to inform midwifery practice and help deliver culturally sensitive and responsive care to mothers, babies and their families. Having undertaken global travel as a consultant with the WHO to promote safer childbirth through the safe motherhood initiative, Maclean (2013) acknowledges the importance of both globalization and internationalization for midwives. She states that this is pivotal in developing a shared philosophy and building a strong alliance, especially from a cross-cultural perspective in the quest to achieve the MDGs by 2015.</p>
                        <p>Although the MDGs have placed poverty reduction, gender and wider social inequalities on the international agenda, some would argue that the blueprint or framework has its flaws (Waage et al 2010; Subramanian et al 2011) given that the goals must be achieved by 2015 and much work is still needed as the deadline looms. However, the targets outlined in Fig. 1.1 have assisted in the cooperation and collaboration of international agencies and government in addressing many of the major moral challenges of modern day society and healthcare provision for mothers and babies in the quest to realize a healthier nation.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In a dynamic health service, midwives need to have an emotional awareness in order to deliver care sensitively, as well as to ensure that these feelings are acknowledged and responded to. To do this effectively, midwives should be aware not only of their own feelings but of how the delivery of the care meted out to women may impact on women’s affective state (see Chapter 25). Much of midwifery work is emotionally demanding, thus an understanding by midwives of why this is so, and exploration of ways to manage feelings, can only benefit women and midwives. How midwives ‘feel’ about their work and the women they care for is important. It has significant implications for communication and interpersonal relationships with not only women and families but also colleagues. It also has much wider implications for the quality of maternity services in general.</p>
                        <p>By its very nature, midwifery work involves a range of emotions. Activities that midwives perform in their day-to-day role are rarely dull, spanning a vast spectrum. What may appear routine and mundane acts to midwives are often far from ordinary experiences for women - the recipients of maternity care. While birth is often construed as a highly charged emotional event, it may be less obvious to appreciate why a routine antenatal ‘booking’ history or postnatal visit can generate emotions. However, women’s experience of maternity care conveys a different picture (Goleman 2005; Redshaw and Heikkila 2010). There is clear evidence from research studies that women do not always receive the emotional support from midwives that they would wish (Beech and Phipps 2008; Redshaw and Heikkila 2010).</p>
                        <h3>What is ‘emotion work’?</h3>
                        <p>Over the past three decades there has been increased interest in how emotions affect the work professionals do (Fineman 2003). This interest was stimulated by an American study undertaken by Hochschild (1983), which drew attention to the importance of emotion in the workplace, and to the work that needs be done when managing emotions. This study focused on American flight attendants, who identified that a significant aspect of their work was to create a safe and secure environment for passengers, and in order to do so they needed to manage the emotions of their customers and themselves.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, emotional labour can be defined as the work that is undertaken to manage feelings so that they are appropriate for a particular situation (Hochschild 1983; Hunter and Deery 2009). This is done in accordance with ‘feeling rules’, social norms regarding which emotions it is considered appropriate to feel and to display. This is best depicted by Hunter and Deery (2005), who note how midwives describe suppressing their feelings in order to maintain a reassuring atmosphere for women and their partners.</p>
                        <p>Hochschild (1983) used the term ‘emotional labour’ to mean management of emotion within the public domain, as part of the employment contract between employer and employee; ‘emotion work’ referred to management of emotion in the private domain, i.e. the home. The research focused particularly on commercial organizations, where workers are required to provide a veneer of hospitality in order to present a corporate image, with the ultimate aim of profit-making (e.g. the ‘switch-on smile’ of the flight attendants or the superficial enjoinders to ‘have a nice day’ from shop assistants). This requires the use of ‘acting’ techniques, which Hochschild (1983) argues may be incongruent with what workers are really feeling. Hunter (2004a) suggests that the emotion management of midwives is different to this. Midwives are more able to exercise autonomy in how they control emotions, and emotion management is driven by a desire to ‘make a difference’, based on ideals of caring and service.</p>
                        <h3>Sources of emotion work in midwifery practice</h3>
                        <p>Research studies suggest that there are various sources of emotion work in midwifery (Hunter 2004a, 2004b; Hunter and Deery 2005, 2009). These can be grouped into three key themes, which are discussed in turn:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Midwife-woman relationships</li>
                            <li>Collegial relationships</li>
                            <li>The organization of maternity care.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>It is important to note that these themes are often interlinked. For example, the organization of maternity care impacts on both midwife-woman relationships and on collegial relationships.</p>
                        <h4>Midwife-woman relationships</h4>
                        <p>The nature of pregnancy and childbirth means that midwives work with women and their families during some of the most emotionally charged times of human life. The excited anticipation that generally surrounds the announcement of a pregnancy and the birth of a baby may be tempered with anxieties about changes in role identity, altered sexual relationships and fears about pain and altered body image (Raphael-Leff 2005). Thus it is important to remember that even the most delighted of new mothers may experience a wide range of feelings about their experiences (see Chapter 25).</p>
                        <p>Pregnancy and birth are not always joyful experiences: for example, midwives work with women who have unplanned or unwanted pregnancies, who are in unhappy or abusive relationships, and where fetal abnormalities or antenatal problems are detected. In these cases, midwives need to support women and their partners with great sensitivity and emotional awareness. This requires excellent interpersonal skills, particularly the ability to listen. It is easy in such distressing situations to try to help by giving advice and adopting a problemsolving approach. However, the evidence suggests that this is often inappropriate, and that what is much more beneficial is a non-judgemental listening ear (Turner et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>Childbirth itself is a time of heightened emotion, and brings with it exposure to pain, bodily fluids and issues of sexuality, all of which may prove challenging to the woman, her partner and also to those caring for her. Attending a woman in childbirth is highly intimate work, and the feelings that this engenders may come as a surprise to new students. For example, undertaking vaginal examinations is an intimate activity, and needs to be acknowledged as such (Stewart 2005). In the past, the emotional aspects of these issues have tended to be ignored within the education of midwives.</p>
                        <p>Relationships between midwives and women may vary considerably in their quality, level of intimacy and sense of personal connection. Some relationships may be intense and short-lived (e.g. when a midwife and woman meet on the labour suite or birth centre for the first time); intense and long-lived (e.g. when a midwife provides continuity of care throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period via models of care such as caseholding). They may also be relatively superficial, whether the contact is short-lived or longer-standing. There is evidence that a key issue in midwife-woman relationships is the level of ‘reciprocity’ that is experienced (Hunter 2006; McCourt and Stevens 2009; Pairman et al 2010; Raynor and England 2010). Reciprocity is defined as ‘exchanging things with others for mutual benefit’ (Oxford English Dictionary 2013). When relationships are experienced as ‘reciprocal’ or ‘balanced’, the midwife and woman are in a harmonious situation. Both are able to give to the other and to receive what is given, such as when the midwife can give support and advice, and the woman is happy to accept this, and in return affirm the value of the midwife’s care. Achieving partnership with women requires reciprocity. Pairman et al (2010: viii) defines partnership as a relationship of trust and equity ‘through which both partners are strengthened’. This implies that the power in the mother-midwife relationship is diffused. There is no imposition of ideas, values and beliefs, but rather the midwife uses skills of negotiation and effective communication to ensure the woman remains firmly in the driving seat of all decision-making relating to her care.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, relationships may become unbalanced, and in these situations emotion work is needed by the midwife. For example, a woman may be hostile to the information provided by the midwife, or alternatively, she may expect more in terms of personal friendship than the midwife feels it is appropriate or feasible to offer. Some midwives working in continuity of care schemes have expressed concerns about ‘getting the balance right’ in their relationships with women, so that they can offer authentic support without overstepping personal boundaries and becoming burnt out (Hunter 2006; McCourt and Stevens 2009; Pairman et al 2010). However, establishing and maintaining reciprocal relationships can prove challenging at times.</p>
                        <h4>Intelligent kindness</h4>
                        <p>In their thought-provoking book, Ballatt and Campling (2011) assert that in the modern NHS that has undergone relentless structural and regulatory reforms, healthcare professionals need to find a way to return to a way of working and being based on ‘intelligent kindness’, kinship and compassion. ‘Intelligent kindness’, they claim, is being kind while acting intelligently. This approach not only results in individual acts of kindness but it promotes a sense of wellbeing, helps to reduce stress and leads to increased satisfaction with care. It is also liberating to the individual, team and organization as it promotes a harmonious way of working and being. Thus the interest of the individual woman, the midwife and the maternity care organization are inextricably bound together. Measures should be in place to mitigate against inhibiting factors such as a culture of negativity and blame. However, kindness alone is not sufficient. Women want care from a midwife that is not only kind but is also attentive, intelligent and competent in her clinical skills to make the woman feels safe. Equally, Ballatt and Campling (2011) state that kindness should be genuine and not contrived, which results in congruence.</p>
                        <h4>Collegial relationships</h4>
                        <p>Relationships between midwives and their colleagues, both within midwifery and the wider multidisciplinary and multiagency teams are also key sources of emotion work. Much of the existing evidence attests to relationships between midwifery colleagues, which may be positive or negative experiences.</p>
                        <p>Positive collegial relationships provide both practical and emotional support (Sandall 1997). Walsh (2007) provides an excellent example of these in his ethnography of a free-standing birth centre. He observed a strong ‘communitarian ideal’ (Walsh 2007: 77), whereby midwives provided each other with mutual support built on trust, compassion and solidarity. He attributes this to the birth centre model, with its emphasis on relationships, facilitation and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Sadly, however, such experiences are not always universal. There is also evidence that intimidation and bullying exists within contemporary UK midwifery (Leap 1997; Kirkham 1999; Hadikin and O’Driscoll 2000; Hunter and Deery 2005). The concept of ‘horizontal violence’ (Leap 1997) is often used to explain this problem. Kirkham (1999) explains how groups who have been oppressed internalize the values of powerful groups, thereby rejecting their own values. As a result, criticism is directed within the group (hence the term ‘horizontal violence’), particularly towards those who are considered to have different views from the norm. This type of workplace conflict inevitably affects the emotional wellbeing of the midwifery workforce (Hunter and Deery 2005).</p>
                        <h4>The organization of maternity care</h4>
                        <p>In the UK the way in which maternity care is organized may also be a source of emotion work for midwives. The fragmented, task-orientated nature of much hospitalbased maternity care creates emotionally difficult situations for midwives (Ball et al 2002; Deery 2005; Dykes 2005; Hunter 2004a, 2005; Kirkham 1999), as it reduces opportunities for establishing meaningful relationships with women and colleagues, and for doing ‘real midwifery’. The study by Ball et al (2002) identified frustration with the organization of maternity care as one of the key reasons why midwives leave the profession. A study by Lavender and Chapple (2004) explored the views of midwives working in different settings. They found that all participants shared a common model of ideal practice, which included autonomy, equity of care for women and job satisfaction. However, midwives varied in how successful they were in achieving this. Strong midwifery leadership and a workplace culture that promoted normality are deemed to be facilitative rather than inhibiting factors. Free-standing birth centres were usually described as being more satisfying and supportive environments, which facilitated the establishing of rewarding relationships with women and their families. Conversely, consultant-led units were often experienced negatively; this was partly the result of a dominant medicalized model of childbirth, a task-orientated approach to care and a culture of ‘lots of criticism and no praise’ (Lavender and Chapple 2004: 9).</p>
                        <p>In general, it would appear that midwives working in community-based practice, continuity of care schemes or in birth centre settings are more emotionally satisfied with their work (Sandall 1997; Hunter 2004a; Walsh 2007; Sandall et al 2013). Although there is the potential for continuity of care schemes to increase emotion work as a result of altered boundaries in the midwife-woman relationship, there is also evidence to suggest that when these schemes are organized and managed effectively, they provide emotional rewards for women and midwives.</p>
                        <p>A key reason underpinning these differing emotion work experiences appears to be the co-existence of conflicting models of midwifery practice (Hunter 2004a). Although midwifery as a profession has a strong commitment to providing woman-centred care, this is frequently not achievable in practice, particularly within large institutions. An approach to care that focuses on the needs of individual women may be at odds with an approach that is driven by institutional demands to provide efficient and equitable care to large numbers of women and babies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. When midwives are able to work in a ‘with woman’ way, there is congruence between ideals and reality, and work is experienced as being emotionally rewarding. When it is impossible for midwives to work in this way, as is often the case, midwives experience a sense of disharmony. This may lead to anger, distress and frustration, all of which require emotion work (Hunter 2004a).</p>
                        <h3>Managing emotions in midwifery</h3>
                        <p>Hunter (2004a) and Hunter and Deery (2005) found that midwives described two different approaches to emotion management: affective neutrality and affective awareness. These different approaches were often in conflict and presented mixed messages to student midwives.</p>
                        <h4>Affective neutrality</h4>
                        <p>Affective neutrality, described as ‘professional detachment’, suggests that emotion must be suppressed in order to get the work done efficiently. By minimizing the emotional content of work, its emotional ‘messiness’ is reduced and work becomes an emotion-free zone. This approach fits well within a culture that values efficiency, hierarchical relationships, standardization of care and completion of tasks. Personal emotions are managed by the individual, in order to hide them as much as possible from women and colleagues. Coping strategies, such as distancing, ‘toughening up’ and impression management are used in order to present an appropriate ‘professional performance’, i.e. a professional who is neutral and objective. When dealing with women, there is avoidance of discussing emotional issues and a focus on practical tasks. This is clearly not in the best interests of women.</p>
                        <p>Although this may appear to be an outdated approach to dealing with emotion in contemporary maternity care, there is ample evidence that this approach continues, particularly within hospital settings. This can be problematic for midwives who wish to work in more emotionally aware ways, and can detract from the quality of care.</p>
                        <h4>Affective awareness</h4>
                        <p>In contrast, affective awareness fits well with a ‘new midwifery’ approach to practice (Page and McCandlish 2006). In this approach it is considered important to be aware of feelings and express them when possible. This may be in relation to women’s emotional experiences, or when dealing with personal emotions. Sharing feelings enables them to be explored and named. It also provides opportunities for developing supportive and nurturing relationships between midwives and women, and between midwives and colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Affective awareness fits within a wider contemporary Western culture, which emphasizes the benefits of the ‘talking cure’, that is the therapeutic value of talking things through (e.g. via counselling or psychotherapy). However, it is important that midwives recognize the limits of their own expertise, so they do not find themselves out of their depth. Working in partnership with women, particularly in continuity of care schemes, means that midwives are more likely to develop close connections with women and their families. If emotionally difficult events occur, midwives ‘feel’ more.</p>
                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
                        <p>It is also important not to be overly critical of midwives who adopt an ‘affectively neutral’ approach, but to try to understand why this may be occurring. In Hunter and Deery’s (2005) study, most participants did not consider this to be the best way of dealing with emotion, believing that ‘affective awareness’ was the ideal way to practise. But when they felt ‘stressed out’, they described ‘retreating’ emotionally and ‘putting on an act’ to get through the day. Stress may be the result of unsustainable workloads, staff shortages, conflicts with colleagues or difficulties in personal lives. In order to understand emotion work in midwifery, midwives need to be aware of the broader social and political context in which maternity care is provided. Understanding emotion work requires careful thought and reflection, not just about individual midwives, but also about the complexities of the maternity services. In order to move away from a blame culture in midwifery, we need to work at developing empathy, in order to better understand each others’ behaviour.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to ensure cultural sensitivity in relation to emotion. The ways that emotions are displayed, and the types of emotion that are considered appropriate for display will vary from culture to culture, as well as within cultures (Fineman 2003). Midwives need to develop skills in reading the emotional language of a situation and avoid ethnocentricity.</p>
                        <h3>Developing emotional awareness</h3>
                        <p>It is possible to develop emotional skills in the same way as it is possible to develop any skills. In other words, individuals can develop ‘emotional awareness’ (Hunter 2004b) or ‘emotional intelligence’, according to (Goleman 2005). He claims that emotionally intelligent people: know their emotions, manage their emotions, motivate themselves, recognize the emotions of others and handle relationships effectively. Goleman (2005) suggests ways that emotional intelligence can be developed, so that an individual can have a high ‘EQ’ (emotional intelligence quotient) in the way that they may have a high IQ (intelligence quotient).</p>
                        <p>The idea of emotional intelligence has caught the public imagination, although some would argue that Goleman’s ideas are rather simplistic and lack a substantive research base (e.g. Fineman 2003: 52). Instead, Fineman (2003: 54) prefers the notion of ‘emotional sensitivity’, which he claims can be developed through ‘processes of feminization, emotionally responsive leadership styles, valuing intuition, and tolerance for a wide range of emotional expression and candour’. Whatever the preferred terminology, it would seem that these ideas have particular relevance to midwifery, given the emotionally demanding nature of this work. Midwives need to develop emotional awareness so that they know what it is they are feeling, why they are feeling it, and how others may be feeling. They also need to develop a language to articulate these feelings, in a manner that is authentic.</p>
                        <p>So how can midwives develop their emotional awareness? There are a number of options that may be helpful. Attendance on counselling and assertiveness courses can help to develop insights into personal feelings, which by extension provide insights into the possible feelings of others. Supervision may also provide opportunities for exploration of the emotions of both self and others, with the aim of recognizing and responding appropriately to these.</p>
                        <p>It is particularly important that emotional issues are given careful and sensitive attention during pre-registration education. This could take the form of role-play, or by making use of participative theatre. Drama workshops have been used effectively with student midwives (Baker 2000) to explore various aspects of their clinical experience, including a range of emotional issues, in a safe and supportive environment. One advantage of such an approach is that participants realize that they are not alone in their experiences. With a skilled workshop facilitator, difficult situations can be considered in a broader context, so that they are understood as shared rather than personal problems. These methods could also be beneficial for qualified midwives, especially clinical mentors, as part of their continuing professional development.</p>
                        <p>Emotional issues also need attention within clinical practice, if they are not to be seen as something that is explored only ‘in the classroom’. As previously discussed, there may be ‘mixed messages’ about what emotions should be felt and displayed. These mixed messages are not helpful in creating an emotionally attuned environment. Supervision could have a role to play here, having the potential to provide a supportive environment for understanding emotion, particularly if a ‘clinical supervision’ approach is taken. This is a method of peer support and review aimed at creating a safe and non-judgemental space in which the emotional support needs of midwives can be considered (Kirkham and Stapleton 2000; Deery 2005). The importance of ‘caring for the carers’ is crucial, but often underestimated.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as Fineman (2003) recommends, those in leadership positions within midwifery need to set the scene by adopting leadership styles that are emotionally responsive. In this way, a ripple effect through the whole workforce could be created.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A number of influential social policies have resulted in radical reforms of the maternity services in the UK over many years. Consequently, the twenty-first century has heralded the transformation of the NHS at systems and at organizational level to provide better care, enhanced experience for mothers and their families and improved value for money. The reforms are to deliver excellence and equity in the NHS (DH 2010b). Since 2009, the policy reforms have ensured that women and their families are provided with a greater choice in the services they want and need, and guaranteed a wider choice in the type and place of maternity care, including birth (DH 2007a, 2007b).</p>
                        <p>As key public health agents midwives are at the forefront of social change and act as the cornerstone to the delivery of maternity service reforms. Their roles and responsibilities will increasingly focus to deliver greater productivity and best value for money, offering real choice and improvement in women’s maternity experiences. These reforms are creating opportunities for midwives to work in new ways and undertake new and different roles. Midwives are required to be much more oriented towards public health and the reforms provide increased opportunities to work in more diverse teams to provide integrated services. The working environment is changing where midwives are increasingly accountable for the care they provide, creating a new form of ownership.</p>
                        <h3>Disadvantaged groups</h3>
                        <p>Many of the reasons given by women for dissatisfaction with maternity services include fragmented care, long waiting times, insensitive care, lack of emotional support, inadequate explanations, lack of information, medical control, inflexibility of hospital routines and poor communication (Redshaw and Heikkila 2010).</p>
                        <p>Universally, there is no agreed definition of vulnerability, however, the term ‘vulnerable groups’ is often used to refer to groups of people who are at risk of being socially excluded and marginalized in accessing maternity services. These groups of people or communities are more likely to experience social marginalization as a result of a number of interrelated factors such as unemployment, poor or limited skills, low income, poor housing, poverty, high crime environment, poor or ill health and family breakdown. Women from these vulnerable groups may experience disadvantage either due to mental or physical impairment, or particular characteristics no longer attributed to mental or physical impairment but that have historically led to individuals experiencing prejudice and discrimination, for example ethnicity or disability. Box 1.4 provides examples of some of the groups of women who may be disadvantaged in the maternity service.</p>
                        <p>Providing woman-centred care is a complex issue, particularly in a diverse society where individual’s and families’ health needs are varied and not homogeneous. Listening and responding to women’s views and respecting their ethnic, cultural, social and family backgrounds is critical to developing responsive maternity services. Persistent concerns have been expressed about the poor neonatal and maternal health outcomes among disadvantaged and socially excluded groups (Lewis and Drife 2001, 2004; Lewis 2007; CMACE [Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries] 2011), suggesting not all groups in society enjoy equal access to maternity services (Redshaw and Heikkila 2010).</p>

                        <p>There is strong evidence that disadvantaged groups have poorer health and poorer access to healthcare, with clear links between inequality in social life and inequality in health, demonstrating that inequality exists in both mortality and morbidity (Marmot 2010). The WHO (2008) refers to the social determinants of health as conditions in which people are born, live, develop, work and age. This includes the healthcare system, which paradoxically is formulated and influenced by the distribution of wealth, power and resources at all levels. Moreover, the social determinants of health are largely responsible for health inequalities, i.e. the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries (WHO 2008).</p>
                        <p>To facilitate care that is responsive to the needs of women, health professionals need to understand women’s social, cultural and historical backgrounds so that care is tailored to meet their individual needs. A number of models of care have been introduced to deliver culturally congruent care, including some examples of midwifery-led caseloading teams developed around the needs of vulnerable groups, e.g. Blackburn Midwifery Group Practice (Byrom 2006) and the Wirrall one-to-one care scheme (McGarrity Dodd 2012).</p>
                        <h3>Women from disadvantaged groups</h3>
                        <h4>Young mothers</h4>
                        <p>Previously the UK had the unenviable reputation for the highest rate of teenage pregnancy and teenage parenthood in Europe. However, recent figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS 2013) reveal that in England and Wales the tide is finally changing: teenage pregnancy rates are actually declining. Recent statistical data from ONS (2013) reveals that pregnancies in young women <18 years old in 2011 was 31051 compared to 45495 in 1969 when records began, a decrease of $32\%$. In contrast, the figure for conceptions to all women in 2011 was 909109 compared to 832700 in 1969, signalling an overall increase of 9.2%</p>
                        <h5>Why teenage pregnancy matters</h5>
                        <p>It is important to acknowledge that some young mothers do achieve a successful outcome to their pregnancy and parenting with appropriate social support (Olds 2002). Nonetheless, it is widely understood that there is a strong association between teenage pregnancy resulting in early motherhood and poor educational achievement and wider health inequalities and social deprivation, e.g. poor physical and mental health, social isolation, and poverty and wider related factors (Arai 2009). It should also be recognized that mortality and morbidity among babies born to these mothers is increased and that the mothers show a higher risk of developing complications, such as hypertensive disorders and intrapartum complications (Lewis and Drife 2004). Many young teenage mothers tend to present late for antenatal care and are disproportionately likely to have some risk factors associated with poor antenatal health (e.g. poverty and smoking). Moreover, there is a growing recognition that socioeconomic disadvantage can be both a cause and effect of teenage parenthood. Consequently, in the UK the former government led by the Labour party established a target to half the teenage pregnancy rate by 2010, when compared with 1998. This signified a radical shift in the position of local authorities, who set a 10-year target that aimed to reduce the local teenage conception rate between $40\%$ and $60\%$. Such an ambitious goal was meant to contribute to the national $50\%$ reduction target. However, although the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy ended in 2010, the actual teenage pregnancy rate has remained an area of policy interest and contentious debate. The current Coalition government (Conservatives and Liberal Democrats) places teenage pregnancy rate to young women <18 as one of its three sexual health indicators in its Public Health Outcomes Framework 2013-2016 (DH 2013). In fact this emboldened approach is one of the national measures of progress on child poverty, which aims to ensure a continued focus on preventing teenage conceptions as well as the social impact upon teenage mothers (ONS 2013).</p>
                        <p>With appropriate support, young mothers and young fathers can make an effective transition to parenthood. They can be assisted to develop good parenting and life skills to prevent a potential downward spiral and break the cycle of social deprivation and health inequalities by early intervention schemes such as the Family Nurse Partnership developed by Olds (2002).</p>
                        <h4>Women with disability</h4>
                        <p>Women with disability are increasingly engaged with the maternity services as they seek to live full and autonomous lives. A UK national survey on disabled women’s experiences of pregnancy, labour and postpartum care compared to non-disabled women was conducted by Redshaw et al (2013). The study found that while in many areas there were no differences in the quality of care disabled women received there was evidence for areas of improvement. This includes infant feeding and better communication if women are to experience truly individualized care. Thus the midwife needs to allow sufficient time to assess how the disability may impact on the woman’s experience of childbirth and parenting and to work with her in identifying helpful ways to make reasonable adjustment, including the assistance of multiagency departments as required.</p>
                        <p>The woman will probably be better informed about her disability than the midwife. However, she may need the midwife to provide information and guidance on the impact that the physiological changes of pregnancy and labour may have on her, for example the increased weight and change in posture. Some women and their partners may raise concerns regarding the inheritance pattern of a genetic condition, and may need referral to specialist services such as a genetic counsellor. Midwives and other healthcare professionals should recognize the need to approach antenatal screening in a sensitive manner (see Chapter 11). Midwives need to be aware of local information pertaining to professional and voluntary organizations and networks and adopt a multidisciplinary approach to planning and provision of services. The Common Assessment Framework may be an appropriate tool for the midwife to use to ensure a coordinated multiagency approach to care (DfES 2006).</p>
                        <p>A birth plan is a useful communication tool providing the woman with scope to identify her specific needs alongside the issues that most pregnant women are concerned with, such as coping strategies for labour and birth and views on any medical intervention that might be deemed necessary. Assisting women with a disability to make informed choices about all aspects of their antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care (Royal College of Midwives [RCM] 2008) is empowering. If the woman is to give birth in hospital it may be helpful for her to visit the unit, meet some of the staff and assess the environment and resources in relation to her special needs, e.g. if she is planning to have a waterbirth a thorough risk assessment of the environment will be needed. A single room should be offered to her to facilitate the woman’s control over her immediate environment and, where appropriate, to adapt it to accommodate any equipment that she may wish to bring with her. A woman who is blind or partially sighted may prefer to give birth at home where she is familiar with the environment. If she has a guide dog then consideration needs to be given to its presence in the hospital environment.</p>
                        <p>Women with learning difficulties may need a friend or carer to help with the birth plan but the midwife should remember that the woman must remain at the centre of care. Midwives need to understand the worldview of women with disabilities in order to shape the maternity services to meet the individual needs of these women, and work within an ethical framework that values key principles of rights, independence, choice and inclusion (Chapter 2).</p>
                        <h4>Women living in poverty</h4>
                        <p>It is well documented that women living in poverty are more likely to suffer health inequalities and have a higher rate of maternal and perinatal mortality (Lewis 2007; Marmot 2010; CMACE 2011; UN 2013). Tackling inequality is high on the public health agenda and the midwife has an important role in targeting women in need.</p>
                        <h4>Women from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities</h4>
                        <p>The UK has continued to see major demographic changes in the profile of its population and is more ethnically diverse now than ever before (ONS 2012). According to the 2011 census, England and Wales are more ethnically diverse, with rising numbers of people identifying with minority ethnic groups. Nevertheless, although the white ethnic group is decreasing in size, it remains the majority ethnic group that people identify with. Furthermore, there are regional variations for ethnic diversity. London has the most concentrated and rich ethnic mix while Wales remains largely white, despite pockets of minority ethnic groups (ONS 2012).</p>
                        <p>When referring to multiethnic societies, a basic understanding of the culture is often assumed to mean the way of life of a society or a group of people and is used to express social life, food, clothing, music and behaviours. The concept of culture has been defined by many, such as Helman (2007), providing a variety of insights into the concept. However, the commonalities are that culture is learned, it is shared and it is passed on from generation to generation. Members of the society learn a set of guidelines through which they attain concepts of role expectancies, values and attitudes of society; it is therefore not genetically inherited but is socially constructed and the behaviour of individuals is shaped by the values and attitudes they hold as well as the physical and geographical surroundings in which they interact. Individuals perceive and respond to stimuli from economic, social and political factors in different ways and they will be affected differently according to age, gender, social class, occupation and many other factors. Culture is very much a dynamic state, it is not a group phenomenon, and to treat it as homogeneous is foolhardy as it can lead to generalizations and negative stereotypes. Some aspects can be true for some and not for others belonging to the same cultural group.</p>
                        <p>An understanding of some of the cultural differences between social groups is essential in ensuring that professional practice is closely matched to meet the needs of individual women, promoting the delivery of culturally congruent care. An understanding of the role culture plays in determining health, health behaviours and illness is essential when planning and delivering services that meet the health needs of the local population. However, caution is needed as the role of culture in explaining patterns of health and health-related behavior is somewhat simplistic. Placing emphasis on culture diverts attention away from the role of broad structural process in discrimination and the role that racism plays in health status (Ahmad 1993, 1996; Stubbs 1993).</p>
                        <p>Ethnic diversity in the UK has created major challenges for maternity services (Lewis 2007; CMACE 2011). Successive reports of the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the UK have demonstrated that the inability to respond appropriately to the individual needs of women from different backgrounds is reflected in persistent poor communication practice and ineffective care culminating in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby (Lewis and Drife 2001, 2004; Lewis 2007; CMACE 2011).</p>
                        <p>Women from the BME population experience disadvantage and are socially excluded for two main reasons. First, some women are more likely to be categorized into lower socioeconomic status; they are predominantly residents of deprived inner city areas, have poor housing, are at risk of high unemployment, and have low-paid occupations, poor working conditions, poor social security rights and low income, all of which lead to poverty. Often factors such as lifestyle, environmental factors and genetic determinants are cited as indicators of poor health outcomes, dismissing key social determinants of poverty, poor housing and poor education (Nazroo 1997; Platt 2007).</p>
                        <p>Second, because their skin colour and ethnic origin make them visible minorities, they are more likely to experience racial harassment, discrimination and social inequalities (Nazroo 2001). Institutionalized racism and general reluctance by organizations and individuals to address the sensitive issue of ethnicity are likely contributors to inequalities of health and access to maternity services (RCM 2003). It is important to understand concepts of discrimination and racism and how this can marginalize women.</p>
                        <p>Ethnicity has largely replaced the term ‘race’, encompassing all of the ways in which people from one group seek to differentiate themselves from other groups. ‘Ethnicity is an indicator of the process by which people create and maintain a sense of group identity and solidarity which they use to distinguish themselves from "others"’ (Smaje 1995: 16). Ethnicity is a self-claimed identity and is socially constructed; people of a particular group have a common sense of belonging, and have shared beliefs, values and cultural traditions as well as biological characteristics. In general, people use these terms to identify the ‘other’ groups but it must be remembered that all people have a culture and ethnicity.</p>
                        <p>When people value their own culture more highly, perceiving their cultural ways to be the best, they devalue and belittle other ethnic groups, perceiving ‘others’ culture as bizarre and strange; this is referred to as ethnocentrism. Ethnocentric behaviour, in particular when other individuals’ cultural requirements may be ignored or dismissed as unimportant, would do very little to meet the tenets of woman-centred care and hinders the delivery of responsive care. Many maternity services are still based on an ethnocentric model, e.g. education for parenthood is not culturally sensitive where women and their partners are positively encouraged to attend jointly (Katbamna 2000).</p>
                        <p>BME groups as users of the maternity service: The majority of women from BME groups express satisfaction with maternity services. While some argue that ethnicity is not a marker for good or poor quality (Hirst and Hewison 2001, 2002), others have reported a plausible relationship between ethnicity and women’s proficiency in speaking and reading English with poor quality of care (Bharj 2007). Many women assert that their ability to access maternity services is impaired because they are offered little or no information regarding options of care during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period (Katbamna 2000; Bharj 2007). Women are therefore not aware of the range of maternity services and choices available to them.</p>
                        <p>Evidence indicates that lack of proficiency to speak and read English adversely impacts on women’s experience and their ability to access and utilize maternity services, also adversely affecting the quality of maternity services and maternity outcomes (Lewis 2007; CMACE 2011). Often lack of interventions to overcome communication and language barriers, such as qualified interpreters, is cited as a major challenge in accessing maternity services (Lewis 2007; CMACE 2011). Furthermore, use of relatives or friends as interpreters during sensitive consultations is not recommended (Lewis 2007) and is viewed by women as inappropriate. In some studies, women reported that their requests to see a female doctor were dismissed and they were distressed when treated by a male doctor, particularly when they observed purdah (Sivagnanam 2004).</p>
                        <h4>Women seeking refuge/asylum</h4>
                        <p>Midwives need to be aware of the complex needs of this group of vulnerable women who, in addition to the problems described above, have often experienced traumatic events in their home country, may be isolated from their family and friends and face uncertainty regarding their future domicile.</p>
                        <h4>Women from travelling families</h4>
                        <p>Travelling families are not a homogeneous group. Travellers may belong to a distinct social group such as the Romanies, their origins may lie in the UK or elsewhere such as Ireland or Eastern Europe, or they may be part of the social grouping loosely termed ‘New Age’ travellers or part of the Showman’s Guild travelling community. As with all social groups, their cultural background will influence their beliefs about and experience of health and childbearing.</p>
                        <p>A common factor, which may apply to all, is the likelihood of prejudice and marginalization. Midwives need to examine their own beliefs and values in order to develop their knowledge to address the needs of travelling families with respect, plus provide a caring and non-judgemental service. An informed approach to lifestyle interpretation may stop the midwife identifying the woman as an antenatal defaulter with the negative connotations that accompany that label. Moving on may be through choice related to lifestyle, but equally it may be the result of eviction from unofficial sites.</p>
                        <p>Some health authorities have designated services for travelling families that contribute to uptake and continuity of care. These carers understand the culture and are aware of specific health needs; they can also access appropriate resources, for example a general practitioner (GP) who is receptive to travellers’ needs. A trusting relationship is important to people who are frequently subjected to discrimination. Handheld records contribute to continuity of care and communication between care providers, but the maternity service also needs to address communication challenges for individuals who do not have a postal address or who have low levels of literacy.</p>
                        <h4>Women who are lesbian</h4>
                        <p>Evidence suggests that an increasing number of women are seeking motherhood within a lesbian relationship. The exact numbers are unclear as it is the woman’s choice as to whether she makes her sexual orientation known. The midwife can, however, create an environment in which she feels safe to do so. Communication and careful framing of questions can reduce the risk of causing offence and assist the midwife in the provision of woman-centred care.</p>
                        <p>Wilton and Kaufmann (2001) identify the booking interview as the first time, as a user of the maternity service, that the woman must consider how she will respond to questions such as ‘when did you last have sex?’ or ‘what is the father’s name?’ Issues such as parenting, sex and contraception may have different meanings for the midwife and the woman and therefore careful use of non-heterosexist language by the midwife will help to promote a climate for open communication (Hastie 2000). She argues that the ‘realities of lesbian experiences are hidden from the mainstream heterosexist society and so stereotypes are rife among health practitioners’; Hastie (2000) also states that oppression and invisibility damage health. The RCM (2000) suggest that midwives should take a lead in challenging discriminatory language and behaviour, both positively and constructively.</p>
                        <h3>Midwives meeting the needs of women from disadvantaged groups</h3>
                        <p>Midwives are in a unique position to exploit the opportunities created by the NHS reforms to deliver equitable services, and to create responsive organizations and practices. They have a moral, ethical, legal and professional responsibility to provide individualized care and to develop equitable service provision and delivery (Nursing and Midwifery Council [NMC] 2008). They play a key role in bringing about change. They also have a responsibility to facilitate an environment that provides all women and their families with appropriate information and encourages more active participation in the decision-making process, including ensuring ‘informed consent’.</p>
                        <h4>Meeting information needs</h4>
                        <p>Women from disadvantaged backgrounds often lack knowledge and understanding of the maternity services. They are not always given adequate information about the full range of maternity services and options of care available to them during pregnancy, labour and the postnatal period. Often information is not available in appropriate formats to reach women who have visual or hearing impairment or who lack proficiency in speaking and reading English. Therefore, they are unaware of the range of maternity services and choices available to them. Midwives can play an important role in facilitating two-way communication to enable women to participate in making decisions about the care they want, need and receive.</p>
                        <p>Midwives recognize that communication and language difficulties may be addressed by making use of professional qualified interpreters or liaison workers or signers. In practice, the use of qualified interpreters is intermittent and fragmented. Financial resources, midwives’ beliefs and attitudes, time constraints and the nature of employment of qualified interpreters determine the availability of qualified interpreters (Bharj 2007).</p>
                        <h4>Advocacy</h4>
                        <p>In circumstances where women cannot effectively communicate with their midwives, they are unable to fully participate in decisions made about their care. These women feel that professionals and hospitals ‘take over’ and make decisions about them without first discussing all the options, or informing them of their rights. Having a strong advocate is therefore important.</p>
                        <h4>Working in partnership</h4>
                        <p>As identified earlier in the chapter, for midwives to work in partnership with women, they need to cultivate a meaningful relationship with them. Partnership working and its impact in promoting woman-centred care should take account of trust and power (Calvert 2002; Kirkham 2010). A relationship based on trust builds confidence and makes women feel safe and respected.</p>
                        <p>Stereotyping and discrimination on the other hand play a major role in hindering the development of meaningful relationships. There is well-documented evidence illustrating the detrimental effect of discrimination and racism on people’s health (Virdee 1997). Several studies confirm that midwives commonly use stereotypes of women in determining their needs and preferences and utilize these to make judgements about the kind of care women deserve, as well as what a particular woman is likely to want during labour and birth (Kirkham and Stapleton 2004). Often these stereotypes and prejudices have detrimental effect on women’s maternity experiences (Redshaw and Heikkla 2010).</p>
                        <p>Discriminatory attitudes and hostility coupled with their adverse impact on women will do little towards the development of a meaningful relationship. Consequently, partnership working will be rhetoric for women from disadvantaged background as will issues of continuity, choice and control. Midwives need to consider such issues and where possible draw upon transcultural models to provide anti-oppressive care promoting the tenets of womancentred care for women from disadvantaged groups.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>When she provides care during childbearing, the midwife does so by virtue of her expert knowledge. This knowledge distinguishes her from all the people who offer opinions to the childbearing woman. The midwife’s unique knowledge which determines her practice derives from many sources. Traditionally, the midwife drew on her personal experience of childbearing. More recently, the midwife’s occupational experience has assumed greater significance. Precedent has been quoted as an important influence (Thomson 2000), which may have been enforced by authority figures. Ritual has also influenced midwifery practice (Rodgers 2000). Relatively recently research and research evidence have been required to determine midwifery practice.</p>
                        <p>The term ‘research’ carries many implications, so a dictionary definition is useful: ‘systematic investigation towards increasing the sum of knowledge’ (Macdonald 1981: 1148).</p>
                        <p>Clearly, research is about asking questions, but not haphazardly. Systematic questioning is crucial, making planning, in the form of the ‘research process’, the basis of research activity. The purpose of this activity is encompassed in the dictionary definition, as research into the improvement or increase in knowledge in midwifery is intended to ensure more effective care.</p>
                        <h3>EVIDENCE</h3>
                        <p>The term ‘evidence’ refers to a particular form of research, which is considered by some to be particularly strong and crucial to effective practice (Chalmers 1993: 3). The need for ‘evidence’ began with observations by Cochrane (1972). He identified the lack of scientific rigour in medical decisions, and singled out obstetricians for withering criticism of their want of rigour. Some obstetricians, with other maternity practitioners, responded by attempting to correct the deficiency. To develop material for practitioners who lacked inclination, ability and opportunities to search and evaluate the literature, this group began reviewing research systematically. This resulted, first, in the publication of two significant volumes (Chalmers et al 1989) and later, the ongoing development of the Cochrane database. Unsurprisingly, evidence is intended to facilitate evidence-based practice, defined as:</p>
                        <blockquote>The conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. (Sackett et al 1996: 71)</blockquote>
                        <p>As well as evidence, other forms of research are used in healthcare, such as audit.</p>
                        <h3>The stated rationale for evidence-based practice (EBP)</h3>
                        <p>Research-based practice has long been said to ensure highquality care. Additionally, professions’ status may be enhanced by such intellectual activity. EBP has been advocated by many UK policy documents which have argued that it may facilitate more appropriate resource allocation, by increasing effectiveness and efficiency. While midwifery has long benefited from strong evidence relating to episiotomy (Sleep 1991), other aspects of care are seriously deficient; these include contentious issues such as the location of uncomplicated childbirth (Olsen and Clausen 2012), continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) in labour (Alfirevic et al 2013) and routine ultrasound examination in pregnancy (Bricker and Neilson 2007; Bricker et al 2008).</p>
                        <h3>The randomized controlled trial (RCT)</h3>
                        <p>The research design usually regarded as most likely to ensure good quality evidence is the RCT. The RCT overcomes bias inherent in using other approaches without comparison groups to decide between alternative forms of care (Donnan 2000). The power of the RCT lies in its objectivity or freedom from bias, possibly arising from the sampling or selection of subjects for the experimental treatment and control (no/usual treatment) group, who receive a placebo or standard care. Implemented conscientiously, the RCT is regarded as ‘the gold standard for comparing alternative forms of care’ (Enkin et al 2000: 10 ). The data collected are analysed statistically to assess whether differences in outcomes are due to chance, rather than the experimental intervention. Despite the RCT’s power, the practitioner should scrutinize research reports to ensure relevance. In maternity care, where systems of care differ and culture matters, scrutiny takes account of the context, the woman, her personal and clinical experience and her intuition.</p>
                        <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
                        <p>As with other forms of quantitative research, RCTs have been criticized as being reductionist. This is because, to make sense of the subjects’ behaviour or responses, the researcher must simplify or reduce events to their basic component parts. Those who undertake or use research should consider carefully the effect of reductionism in a field such as childbearing. It is possible that some important aspect of the phenomenon may be neglected because the researcher is unaware of it, or it is too complicated, or challenging, to address.</p>
                        <p>The midwifery evidence base has been criticized for its lack of completeness; as evidence, obviously, exists only on aspects of care already subjected to research. The result is that the evidence base is inadequate to permit comprehensive evidence-based midwifery care. This incomplete evidence base is being addressed by ongoing research, to produce new evidence which may conflict with or contradict existing knowledge. To utilize current best evidence, the practitioner should assess or critique the research, which means its careful examination or criticism. Critique, though, carries no negative overtones, comprising a fair, balanced judgement, seeking strengths and limitations.</p>
                        <p>The appropriateness of EBP in an activity as uniquely human as childbearing deserves attention. EBP may reduce the humanity of care, not only through reductionism, but also through ‘routinization’ or even ‘cookbook care’ (Kim 2000). This argument about reducing care’s humanity has been extended to include the effects of EBP on midwifery per se. These effects are reflected in concerns that have been expressed regarding the relevance of RCT-based evidence to the care decisions made by midwives (Page 1996; Clarke 1999). The possibility has been raised of EBP constituting a threat to midwifery through its prescriptive medical orientation (Bogdan-Lovis and Sousa 2006).</p>
                        <p>EBP’s relevance to midwifery continues to be questioned. This applies particularly to the widely accepted need for the active input of the childbearing woman in any decisions about her care (Munro and Spiby 2010). The likelihood exists that research evidence that is RCT-based may be less than appropriate to midwifery practice; this likelihood has also cast doubt on the EBP agenda more generally (McCourt 2005).</p>
                        <p>These concerns about the uncertain relevance of EBP to midwifery have resulted in the need for a more womancentred framework to inform decision-making (Wickham 1999). What may be a compromise position, termed ‘evidence-informed practice’ (EIP), is intended to utilize the strengths of EBP at the same time as avoiding dogmatic and prescriptive approaches. While interventions based solely on prejudice or superstition are unacceptable, the knowledge and judgement of the midwife practitioner and the childbearing woman form an equal triangular foundation with research-based evidence (Nevo and SlonimNevo 2011). Thus, the woman and the midwife enjoy a dynamic relationship which is recognized and encouraged in EIP. The dialogue into which they enter through this caring relationship becomes constructively transparent.</p>
                        <p>The pressure on midwives to adhere to the EBP agenda, though, has been both profound and enduring. This has been demonstrated by the early and ongoing efforts by medical practitioners to direct midwives along the path of EBP. Such direction came from authorities such as Chalmers (1993: 3) in his requirement that midwives use only ‘strong research’. Direction of midwives towards EBP, however, has brought with it an element of medical hypocrisy which has taken the form of ‘do as I say and not as I do’. While there may be many examples of such hypocrisy, a familiar one would be the continuing, and possibly increasing, medical reliance on routine ultrasound during pregnancy, the benefits of which have yet to be established (Bricker and Neilson 2007; Bricker et al 2008).</p>
                        <p>The issue that underpins the adherence of the midwife to EBP is the question of knowledge or knowledges. Knowledge of theory must precede practice, in a relationship that ideally develops as a virtuous and escalating cycle; but a cycle which is affected by a range of factors. Such influence means that practice enhances not just knowledge, but knowledges. These differing knowledges arise out of a multiplicity of belief systems within one health culture. The result is that the authority or dominant nature of a certain set of beliefs may serve to limit, threaten or undermine other belief systems which, though equally legitimate, are accepted to the same extent and do not carry equal kudos. The dominant knowledge system in maternity has been identified as the ‘medical model’, as characterized by EBP, and the other knowledges as midwifery, social or woman-centred. The existence of these discrete knowledges may give rise to tension and conflict between different disciplines, practitioners and the childbearing woman.</p>
