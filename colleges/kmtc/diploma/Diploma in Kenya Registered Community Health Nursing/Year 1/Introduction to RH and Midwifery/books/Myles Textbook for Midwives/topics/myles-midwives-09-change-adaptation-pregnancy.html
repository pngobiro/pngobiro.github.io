                        <p>Anatomical and physiological adaptations occurring throughout pregnancy affect virtually every body system. The timing and intensity of the changes vary between systems but all are designed to support fetal growth and development, and prepare the woman for birth and motherhood. The midwife’s appreciation of the physiological adaptations to pregnancy and recognition of abnormal findings is fundamental in the management of all pregnancies, enabling her to provide appropriate midwifery care to each woman, including those affected by pre-existing illness. A common feature of these changes is the dynamic and symbiotic partnership between the uteroplacental unit and the woman influenced by physical, mechanical, genetic and hormonal factors. Many aspects of the physiology of pregnancy remain poorly understood and controversies continue to be researched. (Changes in the woman’s emotional state due to hormonal factors are discussed in Chapter 25 and changes in the breast are detailed in Chapter 34.)</p>

                        <h3>The uterus</h3>
                        <p>The uterus plays a remarkable role in pregnancy by stretching and expanding to accommodate and nurture the growing fetus (Hudson et al 2012). This expansion and activation takes place in the middle muscle layer of the uterine wall, the myometrium, which is partly covered and protected by an outer layer of peritoneum, the perimetrium. An internal layer, the endometrium, lines the uterine wall (Abbas et al 2010).</p>
                        <h4>Perimetrium</h4>
                        <p>The perimetrium is a thin layer of peritoneum composed of connective tissue that comprises collagen and elastin fibres, which is draped over the uterus and uterine tubes and is continuous laterally with the broad ligaments (Impey and Child 2012) (see Chapter 3). During pregnancy, the peritoneal sac is greatly distorted as the uterus enlarges and rises out of the pelvis, drawing up the two folds of broad ligament on either side. Stretching of the peritoneum makes it difficult to localize pain late in pregnancy which may delay diagnosis of disease (Casciani et al 2012).</p>
                        <p>By the third trimester the ligaments and uterine tubes appear lower on the sides of the uterus. The tubes run downwards, with the fimbriae spread out on its surface and bound to the sides of the uterus by the narrowed broad ligaments. The ovaries have become abdominal structures lying laterally to the gravid uterus (Standring et al 2008). As the uterus expands there is increasing stress and tension on the round ligaments which run almost perpendicularly downwards from the fundus. Spasm of the round ligaments may cause painful cramps which are usually more pronounced on the right side due to the dextrorotation of the uterus (see below) and are relieved by more gradual movement (Beckman et al 2010).</p>
                        <h4>Myometrium</h4>
                        <p>The myometrium is the muscular wall of the uterus that undergoes dramatic remodelling during pregnancy to provide support for the growing fetus and ultimately to expel it during labour (Ciarmela et al 2011). It is composed mainly of bundles of smooth myometrial cells (myocytes) embedded in a supporting extracellular matrix (ECM). The myocytes are elongated, spindle-shaped cells which are functionally different between upper and lower uterine segments having a contractile phenotype in the upper segment and a more relaxed phenotype in the lower segment (Mosher et al 2013). Smooth muscle cells increase in length from $50 \mu \mathrm{m}$ in the non-pregnant uterus to about $500 \mu \mathrm{m}$ or longer in the pregnant uterus (Abbas et al 2010). Each bundle of myocytes is approximately $300 \mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter and is further organized into fasciculi each of which measures $1-2 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter (Blanks et al 2007). The ECM is composed of tension-bearing proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and elastin, all of which increase significantly in mass and composition under the influence of progesterone and oestrogen, providing a scaffold for the smooth muscle cells, mast cells, blood and lymphatic vessels (Åkerud 2009). The increase in elastin in particular assists in accommodating the physical strain within the uterine muscle during pregnancy. Both myocytes and the ECM play an important role in contractility and are synchronously regulated to enable the uterus to change from the relative quiescence of pregnancy to maximal contractility during labor.</p>
                        <h5>Phases of myometrial development</h5>
                        <p>Myometrial development in pregnancy begins with an early proliferative phase activated by oestrogen and other hormones (Shynlova et al 2010), resulting in a rapid increase in myocytes (hyperplasia) by at least 10 -fold. This is followed by a synthetic phase when myocytes increase in size (hypertrophy) and further remodelling of the ECM (Shynlova et al 2009). Myometrial hypertrophy and hyperplasia is initiated and finalized early in gestation. Subsequent enlargement in length and volume is mainly through mechanical stretch, which transforms the uterus into a relatively thin-walled muscular organ capable of accommodating fetal growth and movement. In the contractile phase hypertrophy stabilizes and the muscle prepares for the labour phase of intense coordinated contractions (Shynlova et al 2009).</p>
                        <h5>Myometrial layers</h5>
                        <p>The classic description of three layers of myometrium (stratum supravasculare, stratum vasculare and stratum subvasculare) found in most major texts was observed during research in other species such as the mouse. In spite of extensive investigation since the end of the 19th century, the debate continues concerning the organization of human myometrial muscle fibres. Young and Hession (1999) described the bulk of the myometrium (stratum vasculare) to be composed of a thick layer of myocytes organized into cylindrical, sheet-like and fibre bundles or fasciculata with communicating bridges that merge and intertwine to form an interlacing network and a contiguous pathway allowing coordinated contraction. The myocytes within each bundle all contract and relax in a longitudinal direction only (as with a spring). These fasciculi are well ordered, running transversely across the fundus of the uterus, obliquely down the anterior and posterior walls of the uterus and transversely across the lower uterine segment (Fig. 9.1). Other investigators describe a homogenous structure of one continuous layer of smooth muscle cells organized in large interwoven bundles where longitudinal and circumferential muscle fibres are mixed with fasciculi running at right angles within them (Miftahof and Nam 2011).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The inner third of the myometrium (stratum subvasculare) and its underlying endometrium is known as the endo-myometrial junctional zone (Aguilar and Mitchell 2010). In the non-pregnant state it measures less than 5 mm thick but during pregnancy it becomes indistinct. The peristaltic waves of the junctional zone change direction depending on the stage of parturition thus playing an integral part in both sperm transport and implantation (Aguilar and Mitchell 2010). Failure in the remodelling of the junctional zone segment of the spiral arteries during placentation can result in impaired placental perfusion which may lead to pregnancy complications (Brosens et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>There is little change in the myometrial thickness of the uterine body across pregnancy in spite of the increased volume. The mean thickness is 0.6 cm at 15 weeks and 0.7 cm at 36 weeks with only a very slight decline in later weeks. At term the pregnant uterus is described as a thin, soft biological shell or bioshell with readily indentable walls through which the fetus can easily be palpated (Cunningham et al 2010). It is pear-shaped and measures about 40 cm in height although the dimensions vary considerably depending on maternal height, weight, parity and ethnic origin (Gardosi 2012) (Table 9.1). During normal pregnancy the weight of the uterus increases 10- to 20 -fold from about 44 g in the primigravida to 1100 g at term. It increases with successive pregnancies and may weigh more than 110 g in a non-pregnant woman who is para 5 or more (Abduljalil et al 2012).</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>There is a dynamic balance in pregnancy between forces promoting uterine quiescence with a cervix that remains closed or contractility with a cervix that softens and dilates (Petraglia et al 2010). The quiescent phase is controlled by prostacyclin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), relaxin, parathyroid hormone, nitric oxide and a complex interplay of signals between fetus and mother (Mesiano et al 2011). Progesterone’s relaxing effect blocks the myometrial response to oxytocin. The changing oestrogen and progesterone concentration within the uterus causes an increase in the expression of calcium and potassium channels which dampens electrical activity (Soloff et al 2011). Cell-to-cell gap junctions are present in very low density, indicating poor coupling and limited electrical conduction between the cells. The fragmented bursts of irregular, poorly coordinated, low electrical activity that takes place over several minutes are known as Braxton Hicks contractions, initially described by Braxton Hicks in 1872. They are painless, non-rhythmic uterine contractions that are easily palpated from about 12 weeks’ gestation and are unpredictable, sporadic and of variable intensity. During the last few weeks of pregnancy they may become more rhythmic, increase in frequency and may occur every $10-20$ minutes. The woman is usually unaware of Braxton Hicks contractions unless the uterus is particularly sensitive, which may cause some degree of pain. Some women may find them very uncomfortable such that they may confuse them with false labour (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>In contrast to many other species, progesterone levels remain relatively high throughout pregnancy decreasing only after the birth of the placenta. Awakening of the quiescent uterus is due therefore not to withdrawal of progesterone but rather to resistance of the tissues to its action (Mesiano et al 2011). As term approaches, progesterone resistance increases, gap junction density rises and excitation of myocytes causes the forceful, synchronous contractions of labour.</p>
                        <h4>Endometrium (decidua)</h4>
                        <p>Remodelling of the endometrium begins spontaneously in stromal cells adjacent to spiral arterioles during the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle. If implantation occurs the endometrial cells undergo a transformation known as the decidual reaction which extends into the junctional zone and forms the decidua of pregnancy. The primary function of decidualization is to provide nutrition and an immunologically privileged site for the early embryo. Triggered by maternal immune cells the decidual cells swell due to the accumulation of glycogen and lipid (Moore et al 2013). Their secretions dampen the local immune response to the invading trophoblast enhancing its invasiveness (Gellersen et al 2013) (see Chapter 5). Implantation of the trophoblast usually occurs on the anterior or posterior wall of the body of the uterus where the decidua is better developed than in the cervix or isthmus.</p>
                        <p>Profound changes take place in cellular function during decidualization. Spindle-shaped endometrial stromal cells become round and produce hormones, growth factors and cytokines. Uterine glands and arteries become coiled and the recognizable pattern of three distinct layers can be identified: a superficial compact layer, an intermediate spongy layer and a thin basal layer (see Chapter 5). Under the influence of progesterone, the decidua achieves maximum thickness at 6 weeks’ gestation then gradually becomes less distinct until it is not identifiable by 10 weeks (Wong et al 2009). Effective decidualization is essential for the formation of a functional placenta.</p>
                        <p>Blood flow to the body of the uterus and placenta from a convoluted network of uterine and ovarian arteries and veins is fully established by the end of the first trimester. Remodelling of spiral arteries into large low-resistance uteroplacental vessels begins after implantation and by 7 weeks’ gestation the diameter of the vessels almost doubles in size to accommodate the massive increase in uterine perfusion from 45 ml to 750 ml per minute at term. By mid-pregnancy $90\%$ of uterine blood supply is flowing into the intervillous spaces of the placenta (Brosens et al 2012).</p>
                        <p>In early pregnancy the tips of the spiral arteries are plugged by the invading trophoblast cells so there is little blood flow into the placenta. With increasing trophoblast invasion the tips of the spiral arteries are enormously dilated, particularly beneath the implantation site, often reaching a four-fold increase of $2-3 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter. Loss of smooth muscle in their walls and their elastic lamina results in their dilatation and conversion into flaccid conduits (Burton et al 2009). About 120 spiral arteries enter the intervillous space and extend from the decidua to the myometrium (Pijnenborg et al 2011). They also become longer as the uterus enlarges circumferentially due either to longitudinal growth or progressive straightening of the coiled vessel. Transformation of these spiral arteries has a profound effect on the rate and constancy of delivery of maternal blood to the placenta at an optimal pressure and velocity.</p>
                        <p>The passage of blood through the dilated uterine arteries of the pregnant uterus produces a soft blowing sound like the continuous murmur of the sea, known as the uterine souffle. It can be detected from 15 weeks’ gestation, is synchronous with the maternal pulse and heard most distinctly near the lower portion of the uterus and in both inguinal regions. In contrast, the placental souffle can be heard over the placenta and is produced by the blood flowing through it. This should not be confused with the funic souffle, a muffled swooshing sound produced by the pulsation of blood as it is propelled through the arteries in the umbilical cord. Although synchronous with the fetal heart rate and found in the immediate vicinity of the placenta, it is quite different to the very distinct sound of the fetal heart.</p>
                        <h4>Changes in uterine shape and size</h4>
                        <p>Making comparisons between the uterus and fruit is a fairly reliable mental benchmark for uterine sizing in early pregnancy. At 5 weeks’ gestation the uterus feels like a small unripe pear. By 8 weeks it feels like a large navel orange. By 10 weeks it is about the size of a grapefruit and by 12 weeks it is the size of a cantaloupe melon (SageFemme Collective 2008). Traditionally, gestational age was assessed by comparing uterine height with abdominal landmarks (Hargreaves et al 2011). Although the current standard practice of symphysis-fundal height measurement is flawed, its continued use is advised until proven alternatives are found (Neilson 2009).</p>
                        <h5>12th week of pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>For the first few weeks of pregnancy the uterus maintains its original pear shape but as pregnancy advances the corpus and fundus become globular and by 12 weeks it is almost spherical. Thereafter it increases in length more rapidly than in width and becomes ovoid in shape. By the end of the 12th week it can usually be palpated just above the symphysis pubis (Cunningham et al 2010). Changes in uterine position are normal during pregnancy. The fundus of the uterus is able to move relatively freely in all planes and is frequently retroverted in the first trimester (Fig. 9.2).</p>

                        <h5>16th week of pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>Between 12 and 16 weeks’ gestation, the fundus becomes dome-shaped. When the uterus enlarges it comes into contact with the anterior abdominal wall and the bladder is displaced superiorly (Theodorou and Larentzakis 2012). As it rises it rotates to the right (dextrorotation) due to the rectosigmoid on the left side of the pelvis, and tension is exerted on the broad and round ligaments (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <h5>20th week of pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>By the 20th week of pregnancy the uterine fundus is at the level of the umbilicus. The uterus is an ovoid shape and the round ligaments appear to be inserted slightly above the middle of the uterus and the uterine tubes elongate.</p>
                        <h5>30th week of pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>The enlarging uterus displaces the intestines laterally and superiorly. The caecum and appendix, which have been progressively rising upwards from 12 weeks, now reach the iliac crest. The abdominal wall supports the uterus and maintains the relation between the long axis of the uterus and the axis of the pelvic inlet. In the supine position the uterus falls back to rest on the vertebral column, the inferior vena cava and aorta (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <h5>36th week of pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>By the end of the 36th week the enlarged uterus almost fills the abdominal cavity. The fundus is at the tip of the xiphoid cartilage which is pushed forward and continues to rise almost to the liver (Cunningham et al 2010). The diaphragm is raised by about 4 cm and the anteroposterior diameter of the thoracic cavity increases (Theodorou and Larentzakis 2012). With the gradual upward displacement of the abdominal organs there is stretching of the abdominal and peritoneal cavity. The liver is no longer palpable having been forced upwards, backwards and to the right by the expanding uterus. The transverse colon, stomach and spleen are crowded into the vault of the abdominal cavity and the small intestines lie above, behind and to the sides of the uterus.</p>
                        <h5>38th week of pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>Between 38 and 40 weeks the increase in myometrial tone leads to smoothing and shortening of the lower uterine segment. The uterus becomes more rounded with a decrease in fundal height although this is influenced by the lie of the fetus. Tension on the uterine tubes and broad ligaments increase (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <h4>Uterine divisions</h4>
                        <p>The development of the uterine divisions in pregnancy is asymmetric (Hamdi et al 2010). The muscular upper uterine segment of the uterus grows faster in the first seven months of pregnancy while the lower uterine segment grows more rapidly towards the end of pregnancy. During the first trimester the isthmus hypertrophies and triples in length to about 3 cm (Standring et al 2008). In the second trimester the walls of the isthmus are of a similar thickness to the walls of the body. By term the walls of the lower uterine segment may be as little as 0.4 cm thick.</p>
                        <p>In the primigravida, during the last two weeks of pregnancy, the low-intensity Braxton Hicks contractions cause shortening of the passive lower segment in preparation for cervical dilatation. The contractile upper segment of the corpus pulls the isthmus open over the presenting part converting it into a thinned out cone of circular fibres to develop into the lower uterine segment. This is detected clinically when the previously floating presenting part becomes fixed in the pelvic inlet. In the multigravida, the lower uterine segment usually develops in the early part of labour. In all cases, the isthmus changes from a sphincter into a thinned out tendon-like structure that pulls the cervix open. With the development of the lower uterine segment a transverse depression or ridge forms at its junction with the thickened upper uterine segment. This ridge becomes the physiological retraction ring during the second stage of physiological labour. It is a landmark that is used to ensure that the incision at caesarean section is in the less vascular lower uterine segment where there is less risk of dehiscence in subsequent pregnancies compared to the classical caesarean section scar (Standring et al 2008).</p>
                        <p>Descent of the fetal head into the pelvic brim (engagement) at 38 weeks’ gestation in the primigravida has traditionally been considered a reassuring sign that labour will proceed normally without risk of dystocia. The primigravida with an unengaged head at term or onset of labour is more likely to need intervention (Iqbal and Sumaira 2009). In African women, engagement often does not occur until labour is well established, perhaps because of their shape of pelvis or stronger pelvic support structures, but this should not preclude a normal birth. Descent of the fetal head into the pelvic inlet causes a change in shape of the abdomen and is accompanied by the feeling of the baby dropping known as lightening (Cunningham et al 2010). The woman may feel a sense of relief as the rib cage expands more easily, enabling her to breathe more deeply and to tolerate more substantial meals. Although heartburn may reduce, there may be an increase in other symptoms. Sharp pains may occur in the rectum and cervix, and constipation is common. Increased pressure of the fetal head on the bladder may lead to urinary frequency and an increased risk of urinary incontinence (Gabbe et al 2012).</p>
                        <h3>The cervix</h3>
                        <p>The cervix has been described as the gatekeeper of pregnancy as it is transformed from a closed, rigid, collagen-dense structure with a closed os in early pregnancy to one that is soft, distensible and effaced at the time of birth (Larsen and Hwang 2011). It is less contractile than the lower uterine segment as it contains less smooth muscle. The initial softening phase of the cervix, which is dependent on progesterone, begins at conception and continues until approximately 32 weeks. This softening in early pregnancy was first described by Hegar in 1895 and became known as Hegar’s sign. There are changes in the structural organization of cervical tissue leading to a decline in tensile strength and an increase in compliance. Crvical ripening is a more accelerated phase occurring in the final weeks of pregnancy. Collagen is reduced or disorganized leading to degradation of the ECM. The cervix becomes thin, more elastic and pliable (Hassan et al 2011). Increased blood flow to the cervix results in a bluish-purple coloration known as Goodell’s sign (Geraghty and Pomeranz 2011). These changes are intricately timed to coincide with uterine contractions and the initiation of cervical dilatation (Larsen and Hwang 2011). Pro-inflammatory agents, anti-inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, stromal factors and nitric oxide all contribute to the inflammatory process of cervical ripening. The gradual remodelling of the cervix enables progressive softening to take place while at the same time ensuring the cervix remains closed (Timmons et al 2010). The glands of the cervix undergo such marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia that by the end of pregnancy they occupy half of the entire cervical mass. They become everted so that the tissue tends to become red and velvety and bleeds even with minor trauma such as taking Papanicolaou smears (Pap test). The basal cells near the squamocolumnar junction are more prominent in shape and size due to oestrogen which renders the Pap smear less efficient (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>The endocervical mucosal cells produce copious amounts of a tenacious mucus which creates an antibacterial plug in the cervix. The consistency of the mucus changes during pregnancy under the influence of progesterone. When cervical mucus is spread and dried on a glass slide it is characterized by crystallization or beading. If there is leakage of amniotic fluid ferning may be visualized due to arborization (a branching, treelike arrangement) of the crystals (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>Taking up or effacement of the cervix is the shortening of the cervical canal from about 2 cm in length to a circular orifice with paper-thin edges. Muscle fibres at the level of the internal os are pulled upwards to become part of the lower uterine segment. This funneling process takes place from above downwards because there is less resistance in the lower uterine segment and cervix. The centrifugal pull on the cervix can be visualized on transvaginal sonography whereby the relationship of the cervical canal to the lower uterine segment changes from a T shape to the notched Y shape. With further effacement the uterine segment then becomes a V shape and ultimately a U shape (Iams 2010). In the primigravida effacement usually takes place prior to the commencement of labour but in the multigravida effacement may take place simultaneous with cervical dilatation (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>There is still no agreement about what constitutes a normal length of cervix, however a cervical length of less than 2.5 cm is strongly predictive of preterm birth regardless of gestational age. Differences in cervical length may be associated with race, maternal age, parity and past obstetric history (Slager and Lynne 2012).</p>
                        <h3>The vagina</h3>
                        <p>Increased blood flow to the vagina results in a bluishpurple coloration of the vagina known as Chadwick’s sign (Geraghty and Pomeranz 2011). In preparation for the distension that occurs in labour, the vaginal walls undergo striking changes: the mucosa thickens, the connective tissue loosens and the smooth muscle cells hypertrophy. The increased volume of vaginal secretions due to high levels of oestrogen results in a thick, white discharge known as leucorrhoea (Cunningham et al 2010). The dominant vaginal flora is the Lactobacillus acidophilus (Doderlein’s bacillus). During pregnancy the higher levels of oestrogen favour an increase in the activity and proliferation of the lactobacilli, a byproduct of which is lactic acid which leads to the increased vaginal acidity of pregnancy (pH varying from 3.5 to 6). This is particularly important in protecting women from genital tract infection in pregnancy which may lead to perinatal complications (Donati et al 2010).</p>

                        <p>During pregnancy profound but predominantly reversible changes occur in maternal haemodynamics and cardiac function. These complex adaptations are necessary to:</p>

                        <h3>Anatomical changes in the heart and blood vessels</h3>
                        <p>The heart is enlarged by chamber dilatation and a degree of myocardial hypertrophy in early pregnancy leading to a $10-15\%$ increase in ventricular wall muscle (Monga 2009). The progressive blood volume expansion throughout pregnancy results in increased diastolic filling (particularly in the left ventricle) and progressive distension of the heart chambers. Despite cardiac enlargement, efficiency is maintained by lengthening of myocardial fibres and reduction in after load facilitated by peripheral vasodilatation. These structural changes in the heart mimic exerciseinduced cardiac remodelling (Baggish and Wood 2011), which occurs in response to physical training, and, similarly, they are reversible after pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The enlarging uterus raises the diaphragm, and the heart is correspondingly displaced upward and to the left to produce a slight anterior rotation of the heart on its long axis. This partially accounts for pregnancy variations in key parameters used for cardiac assessment, including electrocardiography (ECG) and radiographic assessments and can give an exaggerated impression of cardiac enlargement (Gordon 2012). Atrial or ventricular extrasystoles are relatively common in pregnancy along with increased susceptibility to supraventricular tachycardia, however it is imperative that signs of severe disease such as angina or resting dyspnoea are not overlooked (Adamson et al 2011).</p>

                        <p>Within 5 weeks of conception changes in maternal blood vessels are evident, including an increase in aortic size and venous blood volume. Compliance of the entire vasculature is increased, partially due to the softening of the collagen and smooth muscle hypertrophy (Blackburn 2012). While influenced by progesterone, relaxin and endothelial-derived relaxant factors such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, the exact mechanism underlying these changes is not yet fully understood.</p>
                        <p>Alongside these anatomical changes are complex physiological changes which are summarized in Table 9.3. They are accompanied by widespread peripheral vasodilatation resulting in the high flow, low resistance haemodynamic state with marked haemodilution characteristic of a healthy pregnancy.</p>
                        <h4>Blood volume</h4>
                        <p>The increase in total blood volume (TBV) is essential to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>meet the demands of the enlarged uterus with a significantly hypertrophied vascular system and provide extra blood flow for placental perfusion</li>
                            <li>supply extra metabolic needs of the fetus</li>
                            <li>protect the woman (and fetus) against the harmful effects of impaired venous return</li>
                            <li>provide extra perfusion of maternal organs</li>
                            <li>counterbalance the effects of increased arterial and venous capacity</li>
                            <li>safeguard against adverse effects of excessive maternal blood loss at birth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The first step is extreme vasodilatation for which several possible explanations are suggested; the dramatically vasodilated, uteroplacental vasculature contributes to this change supported by evidence that fetal weight correlates directly with the rise in blood volume (Blackburn 2012). This only partially explains the reduced systemic vascular resistance, since a significant proportion of the decrease occurs outside the uteroplacental circulation. Increased vasodilatation is probably facilitated by a systemic and renal vasodilator unique to pregnancy. Current studies suggest that relaxin is also a key factor (Conrad 2011). Vasodilatation is partly mediated by rising pregnancy hormone levels, particularly progesterone and oestrogen. These hormones are associated with the stimulation of nitric oxide production and enhancement of endothelial function which induce the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and stimulates sodium and water retention (Monga 2009). The RAAS is important in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and maintaining arterial blood pressure (Fig. 9.3). It has also been postulated that hormonal factors and expansion of blood volume associated with pregnancy may affect sympathetic nervous activity, inhibiting both its vasoconstrictor effect and baroreflex control of heart rate (Fu and Levine 2009).</p>

                        <p>Vasodilatation causes an underfilling of the maternal circulation which subsequently initiates fluid and electrolyte retention, expansion of the plasma and extracellular fluid volumes and a concurrent increase in cardiac output. This occurs prior to full placentation and is accompanied by a parallel increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Fluid balance and osmoregulation are regulated through the modification of homeostatic mechanisms to accommodate and maintain these changes. There is a marked increase in all components of the RAAS leading to increased fluid and electrolyte retention. Oestrogen reduces the transcapillary escape rate of albumin, which promotes intravascular protein retention and shifts extracellular fluid volume distribution while lowering the osmotic threshold for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release. Levels of ADH appear to remain relatively stable despite heightened production, owing to a three- to fourfold increase in metabolic clearance as a consequence of the placental enzyme vasopressinase, which inactivates ADH and oxytocin.</p>
                        <p>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) secreted in response to heart dilatation, raised end diastolic pressure and volume, have similar physiologic actions, both acting as antagonists to the RAAS. Gestational modifications of ANP and BNP are controversial and research has been unable to confirm when plasma levels are modified. Reported increases do not reach pathological levels associated with heart failure. Inconsistencies in study findings may be due to postural effects, namely aortocaval compression by the enlarged uterus on maternal haemodynamics (Gordon 2012) (see Box 9.1).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 9.1 Supine hypotensive syndrome</h4>
                            <p>In later pregnancy (from 24 weeks) the gravid uterus occludes the inferior vena cava and laterally displaces the subrenal aorta, this is particularly so when the mother lies supine. This aortocaval compression has a profound effect on venous return to the heart.</p>
                            <p>Turning from a lateral to a supine position can reduce maternal cardiac output by 10-30% (Gordon 2012). The event is often concealed, because only 10% of pregnant women will exhibit supine hypotension syndrome (Bamber and Dresner 2003). The majority of women are able to compensate by raising systemic vascular resistance and heart rate. Blood from the lower limbs may also return through the development of paravertebral collateral circulation, however if these are not well developed or adequately perfused, the pregnant woman may experience supine hypotensive syndrome. This occurs in around 10% of the childbearing population and consists of hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, light-headedness and nausea, if the woman remains in the supine position too long. The fall in blood pressure may be severe enough for the woman to lose consciousness due to reduced cerebral blood flow.</p>
                            <p>Pregnant women usually avoid lying supine, however they are often subjected to such a position during maternity care with technicians reporting unawareness of this condition (McMahon et al 2009).</p>
                            <p>The consequent aortocaval compression can be relieved by placing a wedge under the woman’s hip or by tilting the operating table to displace the uterus. Compression of the aorta may lead to reduced uteroplacental and renal blood flow and fetal compromise.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Cardiac output</h4>
                        <p>The profound increase in cardiac output (30-50%) ensures blood flow to the brain and coronary arteries is maintained, while distribution to other organs is modified as pregnancy advances. Increased cardiac output is due to increases in stroke volume and heart rate. The relative contributions of these factors vary with gestational age. The increase in heart rate mainly occurs during the first trimester, thus contributing to early changes in cardiac output. Increases in stroke volume facilitate second trimester increases in cardiac output, augmented by plasma volume expansion. The stroke volume increases by $10\%$ during the first half of pregnancy, reaching a peak at 20 weeks that is maintained until term (Nelson-Piercy 2009) (Fig. 9.4).</p>
                        <p>Cardiac output in pregnancy is extremely sensitive to changes in body position. This increases with advancing pregnancy, as the gravid uterus impinges on the inferior vena cava, thereby decreasing blood return to the heart (see Box 9.1). Large variations in cardiac output, pulse rate, blood pressure and regional blood flow may follow slight changes of posture, activity or anxiety.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>Blood pressure and vascular resistance</h4>
                        <p>While cardiac output is raised, arterial blood pressure is reduced by $10\%$ in pregnancy. The decrease in systemic vascular resistance accounts for this, particularly in the peripheral vessels. The decrease begins at 5 weeks’ gestation, reaches a nadir in the second trimester (a 21% reduction) and then gradually rises as term approaches (Blackburn 2012). Numerous modifications occur in the mechanisms controlling vascular activity. Agents responsible for peripheral vasodilatation include prostacyclin, nitric oxide and progesterone and vasoactive prostaglandins. The changes are not limited to the uteroplacental circulation but are apparent throughout the body in a healthy pregnancy. Increased heat production further contributes to the reduced resistance, stimulating vasodilatation in heat loss areas particularly.</p>
                        <p>Early pregnancy is associated with a marked decrease in diastolic blood pressure but minimal reduction in systolic pressure. With reduced peripheral vascular resistance the systolic blood pressure decreases an average of $5-10 \mathrm{mmHg}$ below baseline levels and the diastolic pressure reduces $10-15 \mathrm{mmHg}$ by 24 weeks’ gestation. Thereafter blood pressure gradually rises, returning to the pre-pregnant levels at term. Despite increased blood volume systemic venous pressures do not rise significantly. The exception to this is in the legs due to the gravid uterus impeding venous return.</p>
                        <h4>Regional blood flow</h4>
                        <p>As blood volume increases with gestation, a substantial proportion ( $10-20\%$ ) is distributed to the uteroplacental unit. Renal vasodilatation early in pregnancy initiated prior to implantation in the luteal phase (Gordon 2012) results in a dramatic increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate which facilitates efficient excretion.</p>
                        <p>As a percentage of total cardiac output blood flow to the brain, coronary arteries and liver is reduced, the overall increase in cardiac output compensates for this and the blood flow to these regions is not significantly changed. Pulmonary blood flow increases secondary to the increase in cardiac output, further facilitated by reduced pulmonary vascular resistance. Blood flow in the lower limbs decelerates in late pregnancy by compression of the iliac veins and inferior vena cava by the enlarging uterus and the hydrodynamic effects of increased venous return from the uterus. Reduced venous return and increased venous pressure in the legs contributes to the increased distensibility and pressure in the veins of the legs, vulva, rectum and pelvis, leading to dependent oedema, varicose veins of the legs, vulva and anus (see Box 9.2). These changes are more pronounced in the left leg due to compression of the left iliac vein by the overlying right iliac artery and the ovarian artery, accounting for $85\%$ of venous thrombosis in pregnancy occurring in the left leg (NelsonPiercy 2009).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 9.2 Varicosities</h4>
                            <p>Varicosities develop in approximately $40\%$ of women, and are usually seen in the veins of the legs, but may also occur in the vulva and as haemorrhoids in the anal area.</p>
                            <p>The effects of progesterone and relaxin on the smooth muscles of the vein walls and the increased weight of the growing uterus all contribute to the increased risk of valvular incompetence. A family tendency is also a factor (Blackburn 2012).</p>
                            <p>Some suggestions for alleviating them include: spraying the legs with hot and cold water, resting with the legs elevated and wearing supportive stockings.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A rise in temperature by $0.2-0.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ occurs as a result of the effects of progesterone and the increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). To eliminate the excess heat produced there is an increased blood flow to the capillaries of the mucous membranes and skin, particularly in the hands and feet. This peripheral vasodilatation explains why pregnant women are often heat-intolerant: more prone to perspire, to nasal congestion and to nosebleeds.</p>
                        <h3>Haematological changes</h3>
                        <p>In parallel with the $30-45\%$ increase in maternal blood volume, plasma volume increases by $50\% (1250-1600 \mathrm{ml})$ over the course of the pregnancy (Monga 2009), followed by a relatively smaller increase in red blood cell volume (Table 9.4). These changes are responsible for the hypervolaemia of pregnancy leading to numerous modifications to parameters commonly assessed in blood tests (Table 9.5). Changes are detectable at $6-8$ weeks. In pregnancy, plasma volume, placental mass and fetal birth weight positively correlate with these changes (Rasmussen and Yaktine 2009). Excessive increases in plasma volume have been associated with multiple pregnancy, prolonged pregnancy, maternal obesity and large for gestational age babies, while inadequate increases have been associated with pre-eclampsia.</p>
                        <p>Red cell mass (the total volume of red cells in circulation) increases during pregnancy by approximately $18\%$ in response to increased levels of erythropoietin stimulated by maternal hormones (prolactin, progesterone, human placental lactogen and oestrogen) and oxygen requirements of maternal and placental tissue (Cunningham et al 2010). This homeostatic mechanism is discrete from that which controls fluid balance and increased plasma volume. Therefore, in spite of the increased production of red blood cells, the marked increase in plasma volume causes dilution of many circulating factors. As a result the red cell count, haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration all decrease, resulting in apparent anaemia, characteristic of a healthy pregnancy (Fig. 9.5). This trend reverses towards term as red cell mass continues to increase after 30 weeks when the plasma volume expansion has plateaued. The disproportionate increase in plasma volume is advantageous: i.e. by reducing blood viscosity, resistance to blood flow is reduced leading to improved placental perfusion and reduced maternal cardiac effort (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Red blood cells become more spherical with increased diameter due to the fall in plasma colloid pressure encouraging more water to cross the erythrocyte cell membrane. Mean cell volume (MCV) also increases due to the higher proportion of young larger red blood cells (reticulocytes). The exact increase in red cell mass remains inconclusive, partly because assessments have been influenced by routine iron medication.</p>
                        <p>While total haemoglobin increases from 85 to 150 g the mean haemoglobin decreases. In healthy women with adequate iron stores this reduces by about $20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ from an average of $133 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ in the non-pregnant state to $110 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ in early pregnancy. It is at its lowest at around 32 weeks’ gestation when plasma volume expansion is maximal, and after this time rises by approximately $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$, returning to $110 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ around the 36th week of pregnancy. A haemoglobin level below $105 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ at 28 weeks should be investigated (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] 2008) (see Chapter 13).</p>
                        <h4>Iron metabolism</h4>
                        <p>Iron requirements increase significantly in pregnancy, with estimates for the total iron requirements of pregnancy ranging from 500 to 1150 mg (Cao and O’Brien 2013). While there is an initial net saving from amenorrhoea, in late pregnancy iron requirements increase dramatically to $3-8 \mathrm{mg}$ iron/day. About 500 mg are required to increase the maternal red blood cell mass, 300 mg are transported to the fetus, while the remaining 200 mg are utilized in compensating for insensible loss in skin, stool and urine. In spite of the moderate increase in iron absorption from the gut, woman require an iron-rich diet and have approximately 500 mg of stored iron prior to conception to accommodate the requirements of pregnancy. Since this amount is not available from body stores in most women, the red cell volume and haemoglobin level decrease with the rising plasma volume.</p>
                        <p>Many women conceive with insufficient iron reserves, but research to date has not fully established the benefits and drawbacks of iron supplementation or the optimal biomarkers for interpreting circulating iron status. In spite of this apparent imbalance, even with severe maternal iron deficiency anaemia, the placenta is able to provide sufficient iron from maternal serum for fetal production of haemoglobin. Hepcidin has recently been identified as a key hormone in the homeostasis of maternal, placental and fetal iron levels and studies have identified the differential metabolism of haem and non-haem sources in pregnancy (Young et al 2012). Furthermore the impact of neonatal iron status on long-term health is only recently being fully appreciated and warrants further study (Cao and O’Brien 2013).</p>
                        <h4>Plasma protein</h4>
                        <p>Haemodilution leads to a decrease in total serum protein content within the first trimester which remains reduced throughout pregnancy. Despite oestrogen reducing the transcapillary escape rate of albumin, concentration declines abruptly in early pregnancy and then more gradually (see Table 9.5). Albumin is important as a carrier protein for hormones, drugs, free fatty acids and unconjugated bilirubin, and its influence in decreasing colloid osmotic pressure. A $10-15\%$ fall in colloid osmotic pressure allows water to move from the plasma into the cells or out of vessels, and plays a part in the increased fragility of red blood cells and oedema of the lower limbs (NelsonPiercy 2009). It is now accepted that peripheral oedema in the lower limbs in late pregnancy is a feature of physiological, uncomplicated pregnancy.</p>

                        <h4>Clotting factors</h4>
                        <p>In pregnancy, adaptations occur in the coagulation system to protect the woman from peripartum haemorrhage while also maintaining the uteroplacental interface. The cumulative effect of these is commonly described as the characteristic hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. The increased tendency to clot is caused by increases in clotting factors and fibrinogen accompanied by reduced plasma fibrinolytic activity and an increase in circulating fibrin degradation products in the plasma. Due to these changes pregnant women have a five-to six-fold increased risk for thromboembolic disease (Gordon 2012).</p>
                        <p>From 12 weeks’ gestation there is a $50\%$ increase in synthesis of plasma fibrinogen concentration (Factor I) rising to 200% pre-pregnancy levels at term (Thornton and Douglas 2010). This is critical for the prevention of haemorrhage at the time of placental separation. The development of a fibrin mesh to cover the placental site to control the bleeding requires $5-10\%$ of all the circulating fibrinogen. When this process is impaired, for example by inadequate uterine action or incomplete placental separation, compounded by placental blood flow of up to $700 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ at term, there is rapid depletion of fibrinogen reserves, putting the woman at risk of haemorrhage.</p>
                        <p>Coagulation factors VII, VIII and X increase in pregnancy, while factors II (prothrombin) and V remain constant or show a slight fall. Both the prothrombin time (normal $10-14$ secs) and the partial thromboplastin time (normal $35-45$ secs) are slightly shortened as pregnancy advances. The clotting times of whole blood, however, are not significantly different in pregnancy to non-pregnant values. The platelet count declines slightly as pregnancy advances, which is explained by haemodilution and increased consumption in the uteroplacental circulation. The increased production of platelets results in a slight increase in mean platelet volume (MPV), which is due to immature platelets being larger than old ones resulting in an overall increase in average size. Substantial increases in MCV could indicate excessive platelet consumption and is often used as a marker for hypertensive disease.</p>
                        <p>A decrease in some endogenous anticoagulants (antithrombin, protein S and activated protein C resistance) occur in pregnancy along with the physiological vasodilatation of pregnancy, this contributes to a six-fold increase in the risk of thromboembolism in pregnancy (NelsonPiercy 2009).</p>
                        <h4>White blood cells (leucocytes) and immune function</h4>
                        <p>Pregnancy presents a paradox for the woman’s immune system as the mechanisms that are essential to protect her from infection have the potential to destroy the genetically disparate conceptus. It is clear that the immunological relationship between the mother and the fetus involves a two-way communication involving fetal antigen presentation and maternal recognition of and reaction to these antigens by the immune system (Chen et al 2012). There is evidence that progesterone plays a major role in the immunological tolerance seen in pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The total white cell count rises from 8 weeks’ gestation and reaches a peak at 30 weeks. This is mainly because of the increase in numbers of neutrophil polymorphonuclear leucocytes, monocytes and granulocytes, the latter two producing a far more active and efficient phagocytosis function. This enhances the blood’s phagocytic and bactericidal properties. Numbers of eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and circulating T cells and B cells remain relatively constant. Lymphocyte function is depressed, and natural killer cytokine activity is reduced regulated by progesterone, particularly in the latter stages of pregnancy. Chemotaxis is suppressed resulting in a delayed response to some infections. There is decreased resistance to viral infections such as herpes, influenza, rubella, hepatitis, poliomyelitis and malaria. The metabolic activity of granulocytes increases during pregnancy, possibly resulting from the stimulation of rising oestrogen and cortisol levels (Gordon 2012).</p>
                        <p>The maternal immune response is biased toward an enhancement of innate (humoral) immunity and away from cell-mediated response that could be harmful to the fetus. The stimulus for these changes is predominantly hormonal involving progesterone, human placental lactogen (hPL), prostaglandins, corticosteroids, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), prolactin and serum proteins.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>To accommodate increased oxygen requirements and the physical impact of the enlarging uterus intricate changes occur in respiratory physiology. These are mediated by an interaction of hormonal, biochemical and mechanical factors and are summarized in Table 9.6. Progressive increases in maternal and fetal metabolic demands are reflected in a marked increase in resting oxygen consumption reaching a $20-30\%$ peak from non-pregnant values at term.</p>
                        <p>The driving force for change is the respiratory stimulatory effect of progesterone initiating hyperventilation by increasing sensitivity to carbon dioxide through lowering the threshold at which the respiratory centre is stimulated (Jensen et al 2009). Overcompensation to respiratory demand causes arterial oxygen tension to increase and arterial carbon dioxide tension to decrease, accompanied by a compensatory decline in serum bicarbonate; mild respiratory alkalosis is consequently physiologically normal in pregnancy (Bobrowski 2010) (see Box 9.3).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 9.3 Breathlessness</h4>
                            <p>The respiratory changes can be extremely uncomfortable and may lead to dyspnoea, dizziness and altered exercise tolerance. Up to 75% of pregnant women with no underlying pre-existing respiratory disease experience some dyspnoea, possibly due to an increased awareness of the physiological hyperventilation (Nelson-Piercy 2009). This physiological dyspnoea often occurs early in pregnancy and does not interfere with daily activities and usually diminishes as term approaches.</p>
                            <p>Although mechanical impediment by the uterus is often blamed, hyperventilation is due to altered sensitivity to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Although it is not usually associated with pathological processes, care must be taken not to dismiss this lightly and miss a warning sign of cardiac or pulmonary disease (Hegewald and Crapo 2011).</p>
                            <p>Breathlessness can be alleviated by maintaining an upright posture and holding hands above the head while taking deep breaths. Women may need to modify their physical activity levels to accommodate these symptoms, however studies have shown that exercising in pregnancy can help to alleviate them (Lewis et al 2010).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>From early pregnancy, the overall shape of the chest alters as the anteroposterior and transverse diameters increase by about 2 cm resulting in a $5-7 \mathrm{~cm}$ expansion of the chest circumference. The lower ribs flare outwards prior to any mechanical pressure from the growing uterus. This progressively increases the subcostal angle, from $68^{\circ}$ in early pregnancy to $103^{\circ}$ at term (Fig. 9.6). Although the expanding uterus causes the diaphragm to rise by up to 4 cm above its usual resting position, diaphragmatic movement during respiration is not impaired as chest wall mobility increases and lower ribs flare, increasing the thoracic space. Changes are mediated by progesterone and relaxin which increase ribcage elasticity by relaxing ligaments in a similar mechanism to that occurring in the pelvis. Inspiratory and expiratory maximum pressures appear to remain stable throughout pregnancy. Lemos et al (2010) have suggested that the stretching of the muscles involved in ventilating the lungs is accompanied by the significant addition of sarcomeres (the basic unit of a muscle), thereby maintaining muscle strength. Progesterone also facilitates bronchial and tracheal smooth muscle relaxation, thereby reducing airway resistance. This improves air flow and explains why the health of women with existing respiratory problems rarely deteriorates in pregnancy.</p>

                        <p>Expansion of the rib cage causes the tidal volume to increase by $30-40\%$ gradually rising from approximately 8 weeks’ gestation to term (Jensen et al 2009). Studies report that the normal respiratory rate of 14-15 breaths/min may demonstrate minimal increase in pregnancy, though pregnant women do breathe more deeply, even at rest. The minute volume that facilitates gas exchange is increased by $30-40\%$, from $7.5-10.5 \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min}$, and minute oxygen uptake increases appreciably as pregnancy advances (Cunningham et al 2010). The enhanced tidal volume contributes to an increase in inspiratory capacity while vital capacity is unchanged. As a result, the functional residual capacity is decreased by $20\%$. This reduces the amount of used gas mixing with each new inspiration thereby enhancing alveolar gas exchange by $50-70\%$. While making ventilation more efficient this may result in rapid falls in arterial oxygen tension even with short periods of apnoea which is further compounded by the reduced buffering capacity. Whether from obstruction of the airway or inhalation of a hypoxic mixture of gas the consequence of these adaptations is that pregnant women have less reserve if they become hypoxic.</p>
                        <p>Blood volume expansion and vasodilatation of pregnancy result in hyperaemia and oedema of the upper respiratory mucosa, which predispose the pregnant woman to nasal congestion, epistaxis and even changes in voice. The changes to the upper respiratory tract may lead to upper airway obstruction and bleeding making both mask anaesthesia and tracheal intubation more difficult. These can be further exacerbated by fluid overload or oedema associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia.</p>
                        <h4>Blood gases</h4>
                        <p>Changes in respiratory function result in a state of compensated respiratory alkalosis. Arterial oxygen partial pressure ($\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$) is slightly increased from non-pregnant values ($98-100 \mathrm{mmHg}$) to pregnant values of ($101-104 \mathrm{mmHg}$). In addition, the hyperventilation of pregnancy causes a 15-20% decrease in maternal arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure ($\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$) from an average of $35-40 \mathrm{mmHg}$ in the non-pregnant woman to 30 mmHg or lower in late pregnancy. Because fetal $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is 44 mmHg these changes not only safeguard adequate oxygenation but also maintain an exaggerated carbon dioxide gradient from fetus to mother. This facilitates the transfer of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the fetus to the mother and the subsequent expiration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the maternal lungs. It is important that clinicians consider these changes when undertaking assessment of maternal blood gases. A $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ of $35-40 \mathrm{mmHg}$ which might ordinarily be considered borderline low is markedly abnormal in a pregnant woman and can even represent impending respiratory failure (Nelson-Piercy 2009).</p>
                        <p>The body has a considerable capacity for storing carbon dioxide in blood, largely as bicarbonate. To compensate, renal excretion of bicarbonate is significantly increased which may limit the buffering capacity in pregnancy. The fall in $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is matched by an equivalent fall in plasma bicarbonate concentration. Although maternal arterial pH changes very little, the resulting mild alkalaemia (arterial pH 7.40-7.45) further facilitates oxygen release to the fetus.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Adaptations of the central nervous system (CNS) are probably the least well understood compared to other body systems. The adaptive changes encompass diverse scientific disciplines, including neuroendocrinology, neuroscience, physiology and psychology such that failure of adaptation can lead to disorders that have profound and long lasting consequences for the woman. Russell et al (2001) affirm that the hormonal fluctuations occurring throughout pregnancy may remodel the female brain, increasing the size of neurones in some regions and producing structural changes in others. These manifest in various ways, e.g. the substantial increase in size and activity of the pituitary gland by $30-50\%$.</p>
                        <p>Adaptations in neural circuitry in the maternal brain are initiated by pregnancy hormones. Oestrogen and progesterone readily enter the brain to act on nerve cells changing the balance between inhibition and stimulation. Other pregnancy hormones, such as relaxin, prolactin and lactogen, also have an impact. Progression of pregnancy is signalled to the brain by the pattern of secretion of these hormones culminating in a complex interplay of communications between the mother and fetoplacental unit.</p>
                        <p>Up to $80\%$ of pregnant women report symptoms of ‘baby brain’. There is growing evidence that fetal microchimeric cells participate in the maternal response to injury. Although it is known that hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect neurogenesis, there is no substantive evidence that pregnancy itself influences certain areas in the brain into being more receptive for fetal cells. Consequently, Tan et al (2011) suggest that further studies are required to determine whether there is any biological significance to this.</p>
                        <p>A pregnant woman’s sleep pattern can be affected by both mechanical and hormonal influences. These include nocturia, dyspnoea, nasal congestion, stress and anxiety as well as muscular aches and pains, leg cramps and fetal activity (see Box 9.4).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 9.4 Sleep disturbances</h4>
                            <p>Various hormonal and mechanical influences promote insomnia leading to disturbed sleep during pregnancy, i.e. sleep fragmentation with greater amounts of light sleep and fewer periods of deep sleep. These disturbances tend to worsen as pregnancy advances, with up to $90\%$ of women reporting frequent night awakenings (Wilson et al 2011) that for some continue postpartum. As a consequence, sleep disturbance has been associated with increased labour length and caesarean section rates and may also contribute to the tendency for some women becoming depressed postpartum compared to other periods in their life (Goyal et al 2007).</p>
                            <p>Interventions include establishing sleep-wake habits, avoiding caffeine, relaxation techniques, massage, heat and support for lower back pain, modifying sleep environment, limiting fluids in the evening and avoiding passive smoking. Sleep medications should be avoided, although psycho-educational interventions are being explored as a potentially affective alternative (Kempler Sharp et al 2012).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The striking anatomical and physiological changes occurring in the urinary system are critical for an optimal pregnancy outcome. Systemic vasodilatation in the first trimester and an increase in blood volume and cardiac output results in a massive vasodilatation of the renal circulation that increases the renal plasma flow (RPF) (Baidya et al 2012). According to Pipkin (2012), there is an $85\%$ increase in RPF above non-pregnant values after 6 weeks’ gestation; this falls in the second trimester to about $65\%$.</p>
                        <p>In a healthy pregnancy the kidneys lengthen by up to 1.5 cm and kidney volume increases by as much as $30\%$ (Abduljalil et al 2012). Growth is less in the right kidney due to its proximity to the liver and greater in the left kidney due to increased blood supply via the shorter left renal artery (Ugboma et al 2012). Dilatation of the renal pelvis and ureters (hydronephrosis of pregnancy) with reduced peristalsis starts as early as 7 weeks’ gestation, peaks at between 22 and 26 weeks and by the third trimester is marked in approximately $90\%$ of women. It is due to relaxation of the smooth muscle of the urinary collecting system under the influence of progesterone (Pepe and Pepe 2013). Hydronephrosis is usually only present above the pelvic brim due to compression and lateral displacement of the ureters after the uterus rises out of the pelvis. Dilatation is asymmetric, being greater on the right side due to dextrorotation of the uterus and dilatation of the right ovarian vein complex, and less on the left side due to the cushioning effect of the sigmoid colon. The ureters also become longer and are thrown into single or double curves of various sizes (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>Dilated ureters with reduced peristalsis and mechanical obstruction by the enlarged uterus all contribute to urinary stasis leading to the increased risk of urinary tract infection in pregnancy. More than 200 ml of urine can collect in the ureters serving as an excellent reservoir for pathogenic bacteria (Ansari and Rajkumari 2011) (Fig. 9.7) (see Chapter 13). Other factors that increase the potential for colonization and susceptibility for ascending infection are alkaline urine, increased bladder volume, reduced detrusor tone, vesico-ureteric reflux and dysfunctional ureteric valves. Glucose excretion in the urine which increases in pregnancy 100 -fold due to the increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) also provides an excellent medium for bacterial proliferation (see Box 9.5).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 9.5 Asymptomatic bacteriuria</h4>
                            <p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of more than 100000 organisms per ml in two consecutive urine samples in the absence of declared symptoms. It occurs in $2-10\%$ of the pregnant population.</p>
                            <p>If not treated, up to $20\%$ of women will develop a lower urinary tract infection (UTI) and the condition will develop into pyelonephritis in $30\%$ of pregnant women if not properly treated (Asali et al 2012; Law and Fiadjoe 2012).</p>
                            <p>It is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) and has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, miscarriage and pregnancy-induced hypertension.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 9.6 Urinary incontinence</h4>
                            <p>Up to $46\%$ of pregnant women admit to experiencing symptoms of urinary incontinence, which tend to become more prevalent as pregnancy progresses The most common type is stress urinary incontinence (SUI), due mostly to multiparity, age and raised body mass index (BMI).</p>
                            <p>Pelvic floor exercises are the most important means of managing urinary incontinence (Law and Fiadjoe 2012).</p>
                            <p>Urinary hesitancy may occur in up to 27% of women in the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Urodynamic studies have shown that $8\%$ of pregnant women may develop detrusor overactivity, with $31\%$ showing decreased compliance (Fiadjoe et al 2010).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Significant anatomical changes also occur in the bladder. The blood vessels in the mucosa increase in size and become more tortuous. After 12 weeks’ gestation the bladder trigone is elevated causing thickening of the posterior margin due to the increased uterine size, hyperaemia of all pelvic organs and hyperplasia of the bladder muscle and connective tissues. The trigone becomes deeper and wider as pregnancy progresses leading to reduced bladder capacity. To compensate for this the urethra lengthens by about 0.5 cm and the bladder tone increases to help maintain continence (Cunningham et al 2010). In spite of this, urinary incontinence can be troublesome in pregnancy (see Box 9.6).</p>
                        <p>As the uterus enlarges the bladder becomes distorted and is drawn upwards anteriorly, becoming an abdominal organ by the third trimester (Fiadjoe et al 2010). When engagement of the head takes place in the primigravida the base of the bladder is pushed forward and upward converting the normal convex surface into a concavity that complicates diagnostic tests. The pressure of the presenting part impairs drainage of blood and lymph from the bladder base causing oedema and greater susceptibility to trauma and infection (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>As a result of renal vasodilatation and increased RPF, the GFR increases by $25\%$ by the second week after conception and by $45\%$ by the 9th week, only rising thereafter by another $5-10\%$, from which it remains elevated until term. The filtered load of metabolites increases markedly and tubular reabsorption is unable to compensate. This has a profound effect on the concentration of certain plasma metabolites (Pipkin 2012).</p>
                        <p>Creatinine clearance, which measures glomerular filtration, is one of the main physiological parameters of renal function (Abduljalil et al 2012). It increases significantly by 4 weeks, peaks at $9-11$ weeks and then is sustained until the 36th week of gestation after which it reduces by $15-20\%$. As renal clearance of creatinine and urea increases plasma levels decrease from $70 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{l}$ and $5 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{l}$ respectively in the non-pregnant woman to mean values of $50 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{l}$ and $3 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{l}$ before rising again near term. Due to the increased GFR there is also increased uric acid clearance. As tubular reabsorption of uric acid is decreased, serum uric acid concentration falls by about $25\%$ in early pregnancy but during the second half of pregnancy it rises again as the kidney excretes a progressively smaller proportion of filtered uric acid. Thus normal laboratory reference ranges may reflect renal impairment in a pregnancy (Pipkin 2012).</p>
                        <p>Due to the changes in glomerular permeability and altered tubular reabsorption proteinuria is common in pregnancy, with increases of 300 mg per day being considered normal (Baidya et al 2012). Urinary calcium excretion is also two to three times higher in pregnancy even though tubular reabsorption is enhanced. To counter this, intestinal absorption doubles by week 24, after which it stabilizes. Although there is an increased filtration of potassium in pregnancy, Pipkin (2012) purports that it is reabsorbed effectively in the renal tubules.</p>
                        <p>The increased GFR also causes an increased filtration of glucose. Tubular capacity to reabsorb glucose is decreased, resulting in a 10 -fold increase in glucose excretion (Baidya et al 2012). As a consequence, glycosuria can be detected in around 50% of pregnant women. Clinicians should be aware that although glycosuria may be common in pregnancy, it should not be overlooked as some women may have diabetes mellitus (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>By day an increased urinary output leads to frequency and urgency of micturition affecting $81\%$ of women by the third trimester. The accumulation of oedema in the lower extremities by day is reabsorbed more quickly at night, particularly in the lateral recumbent position, resulting in increased diuresis at night with more dilute urine by the third trimester in up to $66\%$ of pregnant women.</p>
